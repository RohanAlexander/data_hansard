1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr David Hawker) took the chair at 2.00 p.m. and read prayers. NA Taxation,7
2,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister stand by his election promise not to increase or introduce any new tax or levy during the life of this parliament?,7
3,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I stand by my promises. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, with due respect: I would ask that the Prime Minister be asked to answer the question.",7
4,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I believe the Prime Minister did give an answer. He was fairly quick off the mark. As I was giving the call believe he did give the answer. Transport: Port Export Capacity,7
5,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the Deputy Prime Minister advise the House of the progress the government is making to improve access to our shipping ports? Are there limitations on improved port efficiency and productivity?,7
6,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. In this place yesterday I was asked a question by a member opposite which in effect said: why won't we show leadership in the areas of failure of leadership by the ments in the area of our ports? So today I thought it might be a good idea to work through the leadership that we are displaying in terms of boosting Australia's export performance and making it possible by providing the necessary land based infrastructure the areas that are our responsibility. Our freight task is anticipated to double between now and 2020. Our export figures are climbing very rapidly. Indeed, at the moment there is such a demand for coal by China that in recent times no less than 2Â½ per cent of the world's shipping fleet has been involved in moving coal from the Hunter Valley to China alone. In fact, Australia delivers some 12 per cent of the world's total shipping task. The market for commodities at the moment being very strong, it is certainly providing us with a clear indication of what is needed in the future. I have spoken many times in here about one area where we have provided leadership, and it is an area where successive Labor governments said that not only could they not lead but that it could not be done in the Australian context: the waterfront. We have got an average I movement of containers now across our five major ports of 28.2 containers per hour, when the Labor Party said we could not get above 15. I would have thought that was a pretty dramatic example of leadership. More than that, can I make this point in terms of our responsibilities. The interfacing between road, rail and ports in this nation is extraordinarily significant, and it has not been done well enough. I want to say that we are moving to fix it very quickly. If you take New South Wales alone, the Australian Rail Track Corporation has commenced a $260 million rail infrastructure program in the Hunter Valley to fix up inadequacies left behind by a state government that would not state govern- properly invest. In Victoria, you have got the improved road and rail links where, under AusLink, $110 million is being provided into the Dynon intermodal precinct and the Port of Melbourne, and $40 million is being proin vided for a railway line between Tottenham and Footscray to reduce congestion. In Sydney you have got $110 million to improve rail access to the Port of Botany, and in Western Australia $14 million is being provided for a new rail loop to Fremantle port, and new road access to the port, and that project is already under way. These are the measures needed, and we are providing the resources, the planning and the leadership to make them happen. But the point that ought to be noted is that the question yesterday was in relation to Queensland. The House might like to know that the one state in Australia that has refused to negotiate with the Australian Rail Track Corporation, owned by us, to allow for proper leasing arrangements, access to their ports and upgrading under AusLink is Queensland-the Beattie government. They cannot do it themselves, and they want to stand in the way of the Australian government facilitating their exports. The member for Perth ought to go back to the Queensland government instead of asking us to provide the leadership that these Labor states will not provide and talk to them about negotiating sensibly with the Australian Rail Track Corporation. Education: Vocational and Technical Education",7
7,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister stand by his election promise that no fees will be charged at the government's new technical colleges?,8
8,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I stand by the promises that were made in relation to that issue in the campaign. Taxation: State Charges,8
9,Mr BAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen suggestions that the states need assistance to abolish their inefficient and harmful state taxes? Are there any other proposals?,8
10,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question. I can inform the House that, when the GST was introduced, it was introduced pursuant to an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states which provided that the states got all GST revenue. The Commonwealth entered into an agreement to say that, if the GST revenue did not get up to the amount that the states would have got under the old system, the Commonwealth would make up the difference. Let me inform the House that, in the current financial year of 2004-05, every state will be in front of the guaranteed amount; no state will require a top-up; and, on the latest estimates, the cumulative windfall over and above the guaranteed amount which the states will receive in 2004-05 is $2,198 million-for one year. A government member-How much?",8
11,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"$2,198 million. The New South Wales government will receive from the GST, in excess of the guaranteed minimum amount, $269 million-and this is for just one year. The Victorian government will receive, over and above the guaranteed minimum amount, $360 million in 2004-05. And-get a load of this-the Queensland government will receive, in excess of the guaranteed minimum amount, $796 million in 2004-05. It was a condition of that agreement that, in return for that growth in the revenue base, the states would abolish their indirect taxes. Bed taxes have already been abolished, stamp duties on marketable securities have already been abolished, financial institutions duty has already been abolished, and we have secured the agreement of the states to abolish the bank account debits tax as from 1 July 2005. But plainly, with this windfall over and above the guaranteed amount, the states could go further in abolishing inefficient indirect taxes. We will be going to the intergovernmental council in March next year with proposals to use those revenue windfalls for the abolition of further taxes, which was always the intention of the new federal financial relations. Matters which will be considered are stamp duties on non-residential conveyances, on marketable securities, on leases, on mortgages, on credit arrangements and on cheques, bills of exchange and promissory notes. There is no need to give the states additional windfalls to keep them to the agreement that has been entered into. The states are, in this year alone, enjoying a windfall over $2.9 billion. Right across the forward estimates they will continue to enjoy those windfalls. We, the Commonwealth, will be arguing strenuously that those revenues be used to reduce indirect state taxes. Education: Vocational and Technical Education",8
12,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. Has the minister seen yesterday's Australian Financial Review where he is reported as saying that students attending the Howard government's new technical colleges are to be charged fees? Doesn't this directly contradict the Prime Minister's election promise that no fees would be charged at these technical colleges? Doesn't the minister for vocational education's fee announcement reveal that the Prime Minister misled Australians during that campaign, and isn't this another broken election promise?",9
13,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am delighted to receive this question from the member for Jagajaga, in whose electorate there has been a 255 per cent increase in the number of new apprentices during the time she has been a member-some 1,749 people. When you factor that into the swing against her at the last election, that is about every one of them not voting for her. The Australian technical colleges are going to be centres of excellence. They will be run autonomously by their principal. They will be governed by a board led by industry. They will operate in a very similar way to existing government and non-government schools. But, to be eligible for Australian government funding, Australian technical colleges must meet the same funding requirements as all other schools. Only schools that are not for profit are eligible for Commonwealth funding. Let me be very clear: no of additional fees will be charged in respect of the Australian technical colleges, and the article that she talks about makes that point. Of course, it may well be that there are in existing schools a range of fees and charges and, depending on the consortia which are brought together, some costs already there for students today. But the surprising part is the indignity from those opposite today. It was on 8 July 2003 that my esteemed colleague the minister for education wrote to Premier Carr in New South Wales and asked the Leader of the Opposition to co-sign a letter-he actually asked the Leader of the Opposition to co-sign a letter-protesting a 300 per cent increase in fees. If the member for Jagajaga's quote from the Australian Financial Review yesterday is correct-she said that, if students have to pay to attend colleges, it would aggravate the skills shortage-where was the press release when the New South Wales government cranked it up 300 per cent? Where was the press release when in Victoria fees rose by 25 per cent at TAFE? Where was the press release when in South Australia the fees went up by 50 per cent? Those opposite are on this curious mission to stop this government dealing with the urgent skills shortage in this country. They are on this curious mission to deny the workers of Australia the opportunity for their sons and their daughters to follow in their footsteps and to be well placed to lead Australia into a very, very successful and strong economic future. Trade: Japan",9
14,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Would the minister inform the House of recent developments in Australia's trading relationship with Japan?,10
15,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his question. The member for Maranoa, representing a significant proportion of Queensland, recognises the importance of the trading relationship that we enjoy with Japan. That trading relationship is probably one of the most significant and enduring in East Asia. Japan has long been our largest export destination. In 2003-04 our total trade in goods and services with Japan was worth $41.2 billion. Of that, Australia's exports to Japan were worth $23.1 billion. That covered a range of goods and services. Japan is the single most important market for the Australian resource commodity export sector, and it is our largest customer for LNG. In 2002-03 our resource exports to Japan were worth $14 billion. Since 1996, we have delivered almost 7.5 million tonnes of LNG per annum into that market out of the North West Shelf in Western Australia. I am delighted to inform the House-and I know the member for Maranoa will be particularly interested in this statistic-that tralia now supplies 91 per cent of Japan's imported beef, valued at over $1 billion. It is going to be about 360,000 tonnes this year. Ninety-one per cent of that market is dominated by Australian product, and that is largely due to the effort of the organisations that promote our exports into that part of the world. Goods exports to Japan rose 25 per cent in the three-quarters of the year until September quarter this year, which is a significant increase in the exports into this most important market. But when we are contemplating these important statistics and what has been achieved, it is incumbent upon us to recognise that that strong trading relationship that we have with Japan started many decades ago. It was actually instigated over 50 years ago by Black Jack MCEwen, who looked at the important rise in industrialisation in Japan. We should recognise that. I am pleased to say that this coalition government, now in its fourth term, has continued delivering Australian exporters extra access into this very important market. Education: Vocational and Technical Education",10
16,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Does the minister recall an article he wrote for the North Shore Times on 20 October about the Howard government's new technical colleges, where he said âthe college is to be run like a private school but without student fees'? Who is correct: the minister for education or the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, who has just confirmed that students attending the technical colleges are to be charged fees?",10
17,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As was stated throughout the election campaign, as has been stated by the Prime Minister, as has been stated by the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and as has been stated by me, there will Ausbe no fees applying in the technical colleges. The fee arrangements will be those that apply in public state schools. Workplace Relations: Building Industry",10
18,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House how government measures are improving workplace relations in the the building industry, particularly in Western Australia?",10
19,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Stirling for his question. I was delighted to be able to spend some time with him at a small business forum I attended in Perth in his electorate. What we have in Western Australia, where the honourable member for Stirling is from, is a massive increase in industrial disputation under the Gallop government. In 2001, the rate of industrial disputes in Western Australia was 32 working days per thousand employees. By the end of 2003-two years later-that rate had trebled to 97 working days lost per thousand employees. This is the highest rate of any state in Australia, and it is almost double the national average of 53. What we see is the Gallop government allowing militant unions in Western Australia to run amok. Justice Cole in his inquiry into the building and construction industry found that this was the case. He said in his report that the Western Australian construction industry is: ... marred by unlawful and inappropriate conduct ... Fear intimidation and coercion are commonplace. Contractors, subcontractors, and workers face this culture continuously. What we see under the Gallop government and its so-called reforms of industrial relations is a clear failure for the workers and employers in that state. As a result of that, workers and employers are voting with their feet and fleeing from the state system to the federal system. In Western Australia we have seen a massive 277 per cent growth in Australian workplace agreements between 2001-02 and 2002-03. Indeed, over 100,000 Australian workplace agreements have been lodged in Western Australia in just the last two years. That is workers in Western Australia fleeing from the state industrial system, and the militancy which is allowed there, into the federal system. This impressive movement to the federal system shows how regressive the current Western Australian scheme is. This lack of control of militant unions is a threat to the Western Australian economy. It is a particular threat where we see the massive growth in AWAs in the resources sector. This sector contributes something like one-quarter of the total gross product of the state of Western Australia. The mineral and petroleum industries contribute to almost one in five jobs in Western Australia and make up 80 per cent of the state's exports. This is the sector which is most in jeopardy from the regressive workplace relations system in Western Australia. I call upon the Western Australian state government to abandon this regressive system and adopt the much more progressive system of the Howard government. Regional Services: Program Funding",11
20,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Can the minister confirm that she wrote a letter to me dated 2 December 2004 stating that she had recently approved funding for the Horse Australia 2005 project through the Regional Partnerships program? Can the minister confirm that she used her letterhead as the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services?,11
21,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"ANNE KELLY-As parliamentary secretary I advised members on their projects, and the project in Capricornia was one that was widely supported by the member for Capricornia and her constituents. I make no apology for this government investing wisely and soundly in rural and regional Australia. Health: Immunisation",11
22,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister explain to the House how the government is building on its strong childhood immunisation record?,11
23,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the new member for Wakefield for his question and I congratulate him on his rather splendid arrival in this House. I can tell the House that since 1990 childhood immunisation rates have increased from about 50 per cent to over 90 per cent. Government spending on vaccination has increased from just $13 million in 1996 to $254 million in the current financial year. From 1 January all newborns will be eligible for pneumococcal vaccination and there will be a catch-up program for children born after 1 January 2003. In 2002 invasive pneumococcal disease affected some 761 Australian children, with nine deaths. That is what the government's program is designed to combat. The Chief Medical Officer has already written to parents reminding them of the catch-up program. This week GPs have been alerted to the start of the pneumococcal vaccination program. The parents of newborns should receive information about pneumococcal vaccination before their babies leave hospital, during home visits from community health care nurses and at their children's first check-up. The government is determined to ensure that there is a wide take-up of this important new vaccination program. This government does not just talk about Medicare; it invests the money that is necessary to make a good health system even better. Regional Services: Program Funding",12
24,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Given the minister wrote to the member for Capricornia on 2 December informing her of funding of $220,000 for the Horse Australia 2005 project, will the minister now inform the House when she approved this grant under the Regional Partnerships program? Minister, under what authority was this approval made, given that you were sworn in as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs five weeks earlier, on 26 October? Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under the ruling that you made earlier, and under the practices and procedures of this House, it is quite clear that a minister cannot be questioned in this House on matters for which he or she was responsible as a parliamentary secretary. This question is clearly out of order. Mr Latham- Mr Speaker, on the point of order and to clarify the chronology: we are talking about a letter written by the Hon. DeAnne Kelly to Kirsten Livermore, the member for Capricornia, dated 2 December-that is, last Thursday-and received on 6 December. That is fully within the remit and time which De-Anne Kelly has been a minister-sworn in on 26 October. It is perfectly legitimate for the opposition to ask the question that most people would be asking: why is the minister making these grants?",12
25,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat and I will rule on the point of order. The question does place the chair in a slightly difficult position. But, thinking about it, I believe that the point of order from the Leader of the House will be upheld. Mr Kelvin Thomson- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order as to your ruling. The purpose of question time is to enable the opposition to bring ministers to account. Our very question here is that the minister has exceeded her authority. You cannot rule that she is not obliged to answer questions on the basis that she has exceeded her authority.",12
26,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The ruling is based, very simply, on what I said in my statement yesterday; that is, that a parliamentary secretary is not to be held responsible to answer questions. The point is that the minister is the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and can be questioned on matters relating to her role as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. NA",12
27,Mr LATHAM,DISSENT FROM RULING,I move: That the ruling be dissented from.,13
28,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Is it in writing?,13
29,Mr LATHAM,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Yes, it is in writing and signed. Mr Speaker, it is plainly absurd to deny the opposition the opportunity to question De-Anne Kelly about matters that she has discharged as a minister of the Crown. It is absolutely absurd to deny us the chance to question her on why she has sent to Kirsten Livermore, the member for Capricornia, a letter dated 2 December which reads as follows: Dear Ms Livermore I have recently approved funding under Regional Partnerships for Horse Australia Rockhampton Association Inc for the Horse Australia 2005 project in your electorate. Regional Partnerships is an Australian Government initiative that makes it simpler for communities to apply for Australian Government support for regional development projects. Regional Partnerships is administered by the Department of Transport and Regional Services. Yours sincerely De-Anne Kelly This is on a letterhead that reads, âDe-Anne Kelly, Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services'. Mr Speaker, respectfully, every single Australian taxpayer would want to know why the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, five weeks after she has been sworn into that position, is dispensing money for another department-the Department of Transport and Regional Services. What is going on with the Howard government? What is going to be the next practice? We will have the minister for education purchasing aircraft carriers. We will have the minister for health purchasing tanks and other military equipment.",13
30,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Order! There is a point of order. The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The honourable member,13
31,Mr LATHAM,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, a glass of water is not a point of order. Your ruling must be dissented from. It is plainly absurd to allow a minister to avoid parliamentary scrutiny when, just moments ago in the House, she admitted to the member for Capricornia that this signature here is hers, that this letter is hers and that five weeks after she was sworn in as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs she is still dispensing the pork. She is still involved in the regional pork rorts, and it is totally unacceptable under the laws of the Commonwealth. Mr Speaker, I draw to your attention the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette from 26 October 2004, where His Excellency the Governor General directs that it be notified for general information that he has made the following appointments: De-Anne Kelly MP, Minister for Veterans' Affairs-not De-Anne Kelly, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and not De-Anne Kelly for any other purpose than to administer the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I believe this raises important legal and constitutional questions. Under what legal authority does a minister for veterans' affairs dispense money from another department? Under what legal authority does a minister for veterans' affairs write to a member of the House of Representatives saying, âHang on a moment. You thought I had something to do with veterans' affairs but-surprise, surprise-I am here to announce a funding project in your electorate for a different department under a totally different program'? They might have sorted it out over there, but the Australian peopleMr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I am reluctant to interrupt the Leader of the Opposition, but I do say to assist him and, I hope, to assist the House that my understanding is that the parliamentary secretary does have an answer and she is prepared to give it.",13
32,Mr LATHAM,DISSENT FROM RULING,I have a motion of dissent before the House. If the Leader of the House is saying the government is now voting for that motion of dissent in your ruling,14
33,Unknown,DISSENT FROM RULING,Government members interjecting,14
34,Mr LATHAM,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Okay, I will continue with my motion of dissent-either you cut him down or you vote for the motion of dissent. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: there is no questioning of cutting anyone down-not even cutting down the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Speaker, your ruling was perfectly correct, but the parliamentary secretary, to assist the Leader of the Opposition and to assist the House, does have an answer and she is happy to give it.",14
35,Mr LATHAM,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, that was the Clayton's point of order, where the Leader of the House knows that you have made a mistake and knows that this motion of dissent should be carried, but he will not admit it. is now trying to slide out from under the motion by saying, âShe is going to come up to the dispatch box under an unknown standing order of the House to try and give the answer.' How about the government supports the dissent motion, and then makes the minister give the answer, because this Speaker has stuffed it up? Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I simply wanted to make the point of order that, understanding order 91 dealing with disorderly conduct, the Leader of the Opposition is guilty of disorderly conduct by reflecting on your earlier ruling and as such should be ruled out of order.",14
36,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,There is no point of order.,14
37,Mr LATHAM,DISSENT FROM RULING,"My word I am reflecting on the ruling-so much so that I am moving a motion of dissent from the ruling! My word I am reflecting it! I am reflecting on the principle of Westminster accountability. What the Speaker is trying to say to this House is this: if the minister for education authorises the purchase of tanks and aircraft carriers, we cannot ask questions about it. He may have no legal authority and no constitutional authority with which to make that purchase under the orders that have been issued by the Governor General and, even though he is a minister of the Crown, we cannot ask the question. Of course we should be able to ask the question, just as we want to ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs under what legal authority, under what remit, under what constitutional provision she is dispensing money from another department? If she had written to the member for Capricornia saying, âListen, I am the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and you have got some worthy RSL projects in your electorate and we are going to fund them with this grant,' that would be standard He practice. No-one would blink an eyelid. But surely it is unprecedented in our time in this House to have a minister, on the letterhead of a parliamentary secretary to another minister for which she has no responsibility, announcing the grant. I think it is highly likely that she has written these letters to other people associated with the Horse Australia 2005 project. I would expect that, if she is notifying the member for Capricornia, she would also be notifying the local ACC, and she would be notifying the proponents, Horse Australia Rockhampton Association, of the fact they have just been awarded $220,000. For the past week and a half in the House, we have been raising legitimate questions about the regional pork rorts; we have been raising legitimate questions about the SONA secret slush fund. Surely it gets to the point of asking a legitimate question, under extraordinary circumstances, as to how Minister Kelly and Veterans' Affairs are still dispensing the pork and as to how Minister Kelly is still rolling out the barrel and dispensing money from someone else's department. I put it to you that the authority issued by the Governor General on 26 October",14
38,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Reluctant though I am to interrupt this tirade, the fact is that a dissent debate has to stick strictly to the terms of the dissent. The Leader of the Opposition is now ranging far and wide and making all sorts of allegations against the former parliamentary secretary, and he should not be allowed to do so.",15
39,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,I ask the Leader of the Opposition to come back to the motion before the chair.,15
40,Mr LATHAM,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, I am coming back to the order issued by the Governor General on 26 October which gave De-Anne Kelly authority to issue funding as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. This order did not make her the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. One must question the legality of what she is doing-and that is a legitimate question to raise in this House. But it also raises the issue of why, just moments ago, you ruled it in order when the member for Capricornia got to her feet and asked: Can the minister confirm that she wrote a letter me dated 2 December 2004 stating that she had recently approved funding for the Horse Australia 2005 project through the Regional Partnerships program? Can the minister confirm that she used her letterhead as the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services? Mr Speaker, you ruled that in order. You allowed the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to answer that question. Why, just moments ago, did you allow the member for Capricornia to ask the question about the letter on 2 December issuing the grant in the electorate of Capricornia but you do not allow me to ask a question on the same subject, concerning the same letter, the same grant, the same minister, the same lack of authority and the same lack of legality for what she is doing? I asked: given that the minister wrote to the member for Capricornia on 2 December-same letter, same issue-informing her of funding of $220,000 for the Horse Australia 2005 project, will the minister inform the House when she approved this grant? Fair enough, she has written in the letter that she recently approved it. If that was any time in the last five weeks, since De-Anne Kelly has been the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the public-the people who work hard to pay their taxes in this country-would want to know under what legal authority she is dispensing, approving and notifying a grant in someone else's department. That is a perfectly legitimate question. You ruled in order the question from the member for Capricornia. You will not allow me to ask a similar question on the same subject, the same grant, the same minister, the same perversion of process. I went on to ask: under what authority was this approval made, given that DeAnne Kelly was sworn in as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs five weeks earlier, on 26 October? It is curious indeed-some would say exto traordinary-that this has happened. But the whole purpose of question time is for the opposition to ask questions to hold the executive government to account. Mr Speaker, your role is to defend the right of members to seek information in areas where the ministers have acted. This minister has acted in a way that is extraordinary and perhaps unprecedented. Surely the Australian people have the right to know about that, just as they have the right to know about the secret slush fund of SONA, and the right to know how the regional pork-rorts have been dispensed. They have the right, in this parliament, to know about the rorting of different projects. We have not received the answers from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, but surely we should now get an answer from Minister Kelly. Surely Minister Kelly should concede that this dissent motion should be carried. We have half a concession by the Leader of the House that the dissent motion should be carried. He wants Minister Kelly to answer the question, but he will not allow a majority vote on the dissent motion. Mr Speaker, he is basically saying that he has no confidence in you, but he is trying to hide embarrassment, just as he did last week when he had to apologise to you in the debate on a separate dissent motion. We had the unprecedented action of the Leader of the House apologising to the Speaker for letting him dangle in the breeze, to the embarrassment of the House. I would have thought that it was time for the Leader of the House to be honest about it and say, âWhoops: a second apology'-a second time where the government should have said up front: âLet the dissent motion go through. The Speaker has got it wrong. Let the minister give her answer to the House.' Mr Speaker, this is our second dissent motion in a fortnight. We are doing this because we believe it is true to the proper standards of accountability in this House. We believe it is consistent with your promise to the House to be firm but fair. We have had the member for Capricornia asking a question which was perfectly legitimate. Imagine her surprise as the local representative, and the surprise of her staff, to get a letter from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs dispensing money from someone else's department. They must have been very surprised about it-Christmas had come early. All of a sudden it was raining money in the seat of Capricornia-out of other departments. How did it happen? The member for Capricornia has raised the question in the House. The minister strode up to the dispatch box, as bold as brass, to say, âYep, it's my letter, that's my signature, and I have notified it out'-and we assume that she has notified it out to the ACC and the proponents of the grant, Horse Australia 2005. Mr Speaker, given that you allowed that question, surely it is in order for me to ask a question on the same issue. We now have the government and Mr Abbott saying that they want the minister to answer the question; they are conceding that the question is in the order. The government backbenchers are rich and red with embarrassment about the way the Speaker is discharging his duties, because they all know the fundamental truth about this Speaker and how he got the job. They all know the fundamental truth that, when the former member for Wakefield, Mr Andrew, announced his impending retirement some 12 months ago, there was intense lobbying. The member for Mackellar, the member for Cook and the member for Wannon were all lobbying the backbenchers and saying, âIf we get back in, I want to be the Speaker'. At the end of every single question timeMr Abbott-On the point of order, Mr Speaker: the Leader of the Opposition is simply indulging himself here and he should be brought back to the strict terms of the dissent.",15
41,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The honourable the Leader of the Opposition will come back to the motion before the chair.,17
42,Mr LATHAM,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Having got the job, Mr Speaker, you said that you would be firm but fair, but we see no fairness. We just see the firmness of trying to cover up for ministers time after time. We saw it last week. We saw the apology from Mr Abbott, the Leader of the House, and today his concession, effectively, that the dissent motion is valid-it should be carried-and the minister should answer the question that was ruled out of order. How can he nod and say that he wants the minister to answer if the Speaker has already ruled it out of order? There is no mechanism available to the opposition other than a dissent motion, given the fact that our valid question has been ruled out of order by the Speaker. It is absolutely fundamental to the principles of Westminster accountability that the opposition is entitled to raise concerns about a minister having exceeded his or her authority. We are not pretending that this is a under the Department of Veterans' Affairswe are not saying that at all. The minister has herself conceded that this is a grant under the Department of Transport and Regional Services. If our questions are to be ruled out of order on the basis of this particular ruling, then how can we ever ask questions of ministers who have exceeded their ministerial authority? Mr Speaker, unfortunately you are writing a blank cheque for ministers to go and do anything-for ministers to get outside their legal and constitutional authority, run amok in the Public Service, grab a hold of money, throw it out in any old electorate, do whatever they like in the administration of government and then say in the House of Representatives that no-one can ever ask them a question about it. We cannot have a blank cheque for ministers to do whatever they like, exceeding their ministerial authority willy-nilly, dispensing money from someone else's department, sending out letters, sending out cheques and rolling out the porkbarrel without accountability in the House of Representatives. I cannot think of a worse precedent for the accountability of ministers in this House than to say, âYeah, sure, they can go and exceed their ministerial authority and spend money in someone else's department, but anyone on the opposition side who dares to ask a question about it is out of order-you're gone.' Mr Speaker, it is just nonsensical. It is absurd. Every single Australian taxpayer would want to know the legitimate answer, if there is one, to our legitimate question. So why not concede the point that the dissent motion is entirely valid. This is the most classic example of a minister exceeding their authoritya Minister for Veterans' Affairs advising of her decision to dispense grants from the Regional Partnerships program, which is adgrant ministered by another department and another minister. We may well get the answer; it looks like we will-she is sitting there ready to go. But, Mr Speaker, I am arguing this dissent motion and seeing it right through on the vital precedent that, if a minister gets outside the law-a minister gets outside the Constitution; a minister gets outside his or her legal authority-then surely the House of Representatives, the people's house, must have the capacity to ask questions about that. If we allow this precedent to pass-if the government knocks off the dissent motion-it will be a black day on this parliament. It will be a black day on the principles of ministerial accountability. I can think of scandals and controversies in the past where former Speakers, former elders in this House, would be shaking their heads that they would not have been allowed to ask questions about a minister exceeding his or her authority. Mr Speaker, you should be better than that. You should recognise, despite your election promises to the backbench to be tough on us, that this question must be asked, it must be ruled in order and this minister must be accountable to the House of Representatives.",17
43,Ms GILLARD,DISSENT FROM RULING," Mr Speaker, I second the motion and I concur with the Leader of the Opposition. This is a shameful day on which you have made a ruling which would protect the worse forms of corruption in government and leave them unaccountable to the House of Representatives. Let us be very clear about what has happened here, Mr Speaker: this minister has sent a letter to the member for Capricornia dated 2 December. She only had two capacities on 2 December: she was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and she was the private person Mrs De-Anne Kelly. Is anybody in this House contending that she sent that letter in her private capacity as a citizen of Australia? No, no-one is because no-one could. The only other capacity she had on that day, apart from her truly private capacity, was as a minister in this place-a Minister for Veterans' Affairs-and we are seeking to ask her questions about that. The effect of the ruling you have made, Mr Speaker, is in direct contradiction to the standing orders. You could not get a clearer contradiction to the standing orders. If I could take you to standing order 98(c): A Minister can only be questioned on the following matters, for which he or she is responsible or officially connected: (i) public affairs; Are you suggesting her sending a letter to the member for Capricornia about the dispersal of government money is not public affairs? Well, was is it? Coming out of her bank account, is it? Is that where the money came from? It must be public affairs and it is public affairs. The question ought to be allowed and the ruling is wrong. But of even more concern, you allowed the first question from the member for Capricornia and you only ruled this way after a point of order by the Leader of the House. Can I remind you, Mr Speaker, I was without joy at this dispatch box last week in a dissent motion where, when the Leader of the House replied, he conceded that he, the government, had put you in a difficult position by the framing of a question to the minister for education and what had flowed from the framing of that question. Mr Speaker, can I remind you that just less than a short week ago we were in this very same place courtesy of the antics and tactics of the Leader of the House. You have only ruled this way on the urging of the Leader of the House, and in his urging he is directly wrong-directly in contradiction of the standing orders; directly wrong in terms of proper accountability to this House; directly wrong in any understanding of the proper dispersal of taxpayer's funds. The Leader of the House ought to have been told when he sought this ruling from you that it was wrong and you were not going to give it. I would ask you to reflect, Mr Speaker, on the fact that within less than a week we are back to the same place, with a dissent motion following a bad ruling, which conduct by the Leader of the House led to. I would ask you to reflect, Mr Speaker, when you do have time to reflect on this debate, on whether that is going to be the course of dealing in this House. Because, if it is going to be the course of dealing in this House, if the Leader of the House is going to rise and seek to have you make these rulings, then you will always be in this position. The problem for you, Mr Speaker, is that just after he has put you in this position he gives you up. He is not even a loyal friend, not even an ally in your time of need, because what he has effectively done in respect of your rulingMr Causley- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for Lalor is now reflecting on the chair. She should be settling the dissent motion and clearly stating where they are dissenting from the ruling of the chair.",18
44,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,I would say to the member for Lalor that this is a motion of dissent and I would ask her to keep to the motion before the chair.,19
45,Ms GILLARD,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, I am just indicating that I am a better friend of yours than the Leader of the House is, because halfway through this dissent motion, having made the point of order that led us to this, the Leader of the House has now given you up and has basically sought to get out from under this dissent motion. He knows that what he should really do, given the view he has formed, is direct government members to vote for this dissent motion, but he knows inevitably where that leads. So now we are going through the farce where you, Mr Speaker, ruled out of order the Leader of the Opposition's question, we are going to presumably have an unsuccessful dissent motion on it and then the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is going to get up and answer the question. That is what is going to happen in this place now. That is exactly what is going to happen in this place. You ruled out of order the Leader of the Opposition's question, on the urging of the Leader of the House; we have moved a motion of dissent on your ruling; the government is going to use its numbers to vote down that dissent; and then she is going to get up and answer the question. Do you think that is how the House of Representatives should run, Mr Speaker, or would it have been better to have ruled against the Leader of the House when he made the point of order? Would it have been better to do that, Mr Speaker? That is where we are-in a grand absurdity which would be a grand absurdity of humorous proportions if it were not about such a serious issue. What we have here on the face of it is a minister of the Howard government, a minister of the Crown, making arrangements in relation to taxpayers' money which are not within her portfolio area. That is what this is about. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs is just that-the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. And, presumably, as Minister for Veterans' Affairs she gets to disburse funds in the veterans' affairs portfolio. What she does not get to do is disburse funds in other portfolios, and that is what she has purported to do and that is what we are asking about and that is why our question is in order. The examples that the Leader of the Opposition gave are absolutely right. Are you suggesting through this ruling, Mr Speaker, that the best way of hiding inappropriate use of taxpayers' funds in government is for people to do it outside their portfolio? Would the minister for immigration or the Attorney General be protected from questioning in this place if they disbursed funds in the health portfolio? Would that protect the minister from questioning? Would it protect the minister for health from questioning if he purported to disburse funds in the education portfolio? Would that actually protect him from questioning? That is the essence of this dissent motion. I know it is hard for you to follow",19
46,Ms GILLARD,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I know it is hard for you to follow, Member for Sturt-many things are hard for you to follow-but try following this",19
47,Mr TUCKEY,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order: could you please request that the member for Lalor direct her remarks through the chair?",20
48,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"The honourable member for Lalor, I am sure, will follow that point of order.",20
49,Ms GILLARD,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Thank you, Mr Speaker; I understand your trials are many, and we have just had another of them on display! The essence of this dissent motion, which apparently is beyond the intellectual wit of some on the other side, is this: you ought to be able to ask a minister about a letter sent out in an official capacity. Just because she is purporting to exercise authority under another portfolio does not make it right and does not make the matter immune from questioning in the way in which your ruling has made it, Mr Speaker. That is the essence of the problem here. We are now in circumstances where, when we seek to ask questions on these issues, you presumably-if this dissent motion is not upheld-will continue to rule them out of order, Mr Speaker. So apparently the only snippets of information we are ever going to get are the ones that the government is prepared to volunteer. Apparently it is prepared to volunteer a snippet of information today, as we found out mid-dissent motion. But, Mr Speaker, under your ruling, if we have further questions about that snippet of information then presumably they could be ruled out of order. What sort of position is that to put the House of Representatives in-where, if a government volunteers a piece of information, that is okay, but, if in the proper exercise of our democratic duty as members of the House of Representatives and most particularly as members of the opposition we seek to question and hold government ministers to account on those snippets of information, that further questioning will be ruled out of order? That is the position that we are in today.",20
50,Mr KERR,DISSENT FROM RULING,The Leader of the House shouldn't take the point next time!,20
51,Ms GILLARD,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I think, as suggested by the member for Denison, we would all be better off if he did not take the point next time. But what I fear is that we will be in an inevitable cycle where, without judgment, as he has already demonstrated twice, he will take the point, you will rule, Mr Speaker, and we will end up in a cycle of dissent motions.",20
52,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Order! The member will come back to the motion.,20
53,Ms GILLARD,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Yes, Mr Speaker. On the motion of dissent on the ruling that you made today, I am making what I think is the very clear point that the effect of your ruling is that there could be acres of government information-filing cabinets full of documents; computers with hard disks in overload, there is so much information stored on them-that we would never be able to ask about in this House of Representatives. That is the effect of your ruling today, because all the government needs to do to protect itself from questioning is to get a non-portfolio minister to deal with the matter. In the face of that ruling, is that not what you would do if you wanted to have a bit of a dodgy grants program, if you wanted to hand out a little bit of pork here or if you wanted to protect something from public scrutiny? With this ruling on the books, next time would you not say to yourself: âIf I do that directly, I will be subject to questioning about it. If I hand it to the minister next to me, then I will not be subject to questioning about it.' That is where we are driving to with the current ruling, and why it must be dissented from. It is wrong, it is bad, it is offensive in the spirit of holding the executive government to account and it is wholly outside the standing orders. These standing orders do not say that you can only come in here and ask a minister about the minutiae of their portfolio. These standing orders use the terminology âpublic affairs'. Why do the standing orders use the terminology âpublic affairs'? Because the standing orders understand that once you are sworn in as a minister of the Crown you have only two personalities: your genuinely private personality at home, where you are doing things as a private citizen, and everything else is your public personality. You are entitled to be questioned about that âeverything else'. Mr Speaker, by this ruling you have clearly prevented us from questioning the Minister for Veterans' Affairs about something she did in an official capacity. She wrote on government letterhead to a member of the House of Representatives about the disbursal of funds. How could you get more official than that-government letterhead to a member of the House of Representatives about the disbursal of funds? The effect of this ruling is to prevent us from asking about the disbursal of that money. It is not the government's money; it is everybody's money. It is taxpayers' money. The purpose of question time is to hold the government to account on these questions. I conclude where I began, by saying that this is a shameful day and this is a completely incorrect ruling. It had to be dissented from because it will lead to the protection of all sorts of corruption in government if it is allowed to stand-particularly if it is allowed to stand unchallenged. It is clearly a wrong ruling, because it is actually contradictory to your first ruling today. Through your conduct in calling the minister and allowing her to answer, you ruled that that question to the minister was in order. We have only ended up in this absurdity because of the intervention of the Leader of the House. I say to you, Mr Speaker: just like last week he has led you into error. This is not bringing any credit to the office of Speaker or, indeed, to the House of Representatives-and is certainly not bringing any credit to the shameful conduct of the Howard government.",20
54,Mr ABBOTT,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I would be the last person to say that I have never led anyone into error over the years but, Mr Speaker, I have not led you into error. Your ruling was absolutely and completely correct and wholly in accordance with the customs, practices and standing orders of this House. Let us be very clear about what happened here. The Leader of the Opposition asked a question of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs relating to her responsibilities as a parliamentary secretary. It is a clear rule of this House that you cannot question parliamentary secretaries in this chamber. You cannot ask a minister-in this case the Minister for Veterans' Affairs-about what she did when she was a parliamentary secretary. That is a clear principle of this House. Mr Speaker, your ruling is entirely in accordance with the standing orders, customs, traditions and practices of this House. We have heard some talk opposite about your earlier ruling. Let me make it clear: you have made but one ruling today. This was the correct ruling you made in response to a point of order taken after the Leader of the Opposition asked a question which was clearly out of order. No point of order was taken in respect of the first question. You made no ruling in respect of the first question. Your ruling is absolutely right and deserves more respect from members opposite, who know that it is a long tradition of this House-confirmed as recently as yesterday in your statement from the chair-that ministers can only be questioned about that for which they have responsibility as ministers. Ministers cannot be questioned about that for which they formerly had responsibility as parliamentary secretaries. It is a very clear point. Your ruling is absolutely, completely correct. Mr Speaker, your ruling was right, but we are not a cruel government. We are not brutal, even towards a demoralised opposition and even towards an opposition led by Mr Twenty-five Per Cent. If they ask for information-even if they are not in accordance with the forms and traditions of the Housethen, where we can help the opposition, we are prepared to provide information. I made it clear just a couple of minutes into the long tirade of the Leader of the Opposition that we could provide the information he sought. But, no, this Leader of the Opposition would rather fume, thunder and fret on his feet for 20 minutes than receive the information he claims to be interested in. He wanted to let off steam in this House rather than receive the information he claimed to want. The fact is that he can thunder, fume and fret in this House all he likes. It will not save his leadership. Ms Gillard-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. It has to work both ways. I would ask that the Leader of the House be brought back to the dissent motion. It is about the standing orders. A reference to House of Representatives Practice might be in order.",21
55,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The Leader of the House will speak to the motion.,22
56,Mr ABBOTT,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Of course, Mr Speaker. Because the message does not seem to have got through to members opposite, let me repeat it: your ruling is absolutely correct. in accordance with the rulings of all previous Speakers. Ministers cannot be questioned in this chamber on matters which are not their responsibility as ministers. You cannot question in this House the Minister for Veterans' Affairs on matters for which she had responsibility as a parliamentary secretary. It is an iron law of opposition that the more depressed they are in the caucus the more disruptive they are in the parliament. What we have seen today is a very frustrated opposition trying to take out its frustrations on the chair. I put it you, Mr Speaker, that your ruling was a perfectly correct ruling. Ms Gillard-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. I have already raised it once. Could you bring the Leader of the House back to the motion? It was a standard applied to the Leader of the Opposition and me when we spoke. We are just asking for it to be equally applied.",22
57,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The minister is speaking to the motion.,22
58,Mr ABBOTT,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, you have made a correct, a fair and a balanced ruling. The ruling that you have given today is perfectly in accordance with the fair and balanced way that you have conducted yourself in the chair since your election and perfectly in accordance with the fair and balanced way that you have always conducted yourself in the chair. Let me say that there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for the question that was asked. The former parliamentary secretary signed the relevant letter on 31 August.",22
59,Unknown,DISSENT FROM RULING,Opposition members interjecting,22

This is a dissent motion about your It is ruling on the Leader of the Opposition asking a question of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It is not in order for the Leader of the House to volunteer her explanation second-hand. If she is going to give it then she can give it after this dissent motion-and stand by it if it is misleading.",22
61,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume her seat. The Leader of the House will come back to the motion.,22
62,Mr ABBOTT,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, the reason your ruling is correct is because the parliamentary secretary signed the letter on 31 August. It was only despatched in December by a DMO in error.",23
63,Mr KERR,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. You ruled that the Leader of the House should come back to the dissent motion. He is abusing that ruling by repeating",23
64,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The member for Denison will resume his seat. The Leader of the House is clearly speaking to the motion.,23
65,Mr ABBOTT,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, your ruling was correct. Mr Latham-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Leader of the House is making a mockery of the House of Representatives.",23
66,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The Leader of the Opposition will come to his point of order. Mr Latham-This is not relevant to the dissent motion and it further makes a mockery,23
67,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"The Leader of the Opposition! Mr Latham-I will finish my point of order, if you do not mind, Mr Speaker.",23
68,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. It is the prerogative of the chair to rule on a point of order. You will resume your seat.,23

Mr Latham-Thank you, Mr Speaker. My point of order is on the question of relevance. The Leader of the House initially took a point of order to say that my question was out of order. You ruled in agreement with him. Subsequently, in the middle of my speech, the Leader of the House all of a sudden said that the question was now valid and the minister was willing to answer it. That indicated that the government would support the dissent motion. It is totally inappropriate and out of order for the Leader of the House, having flip-flopped so many times, to now try and answer the question on behalf of a minister who moments ago he said should be answering the question at the dispatch box. It makes a mockery of the House.",23
72,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat and I will rule on the point of order. I was listening carefully to the Leader of the House and he was speaking directly to the point of dissent.,23
73,Mr ABBOTT,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Contrary to the rather frenzied pseudo point of order made by the Leader of the Opposition, I am clearly speaking to the dissent motion. Mr Speaker, your ruling was absolutely correct because the matter that the minister was questioned about was not something which arose in her capacity as Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It involved a letter which she signed on 31 August when she was a parliamentary secretary and which was sent in error",23
74,Mr KERR,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It cannot be relevant as to whether or not a question is in order to provide an explanation of circumstances which are on their face manifestly suspicious.",23

76,Mr KERR,DISSENT FROM RULING,The Leader of the House is seeking to explain,23
77,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"When the member for Denison is asked to resume his seat he will resume his seat!  Speaker. This is a serious dissent motion and it turns on the question of whether a minister should or should not answer a question, not what the answer should have been.",24
78,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The Leader of the House will come back to the motion of dissent.,24
79,Mr ABBOTT,DISSENT FROM RULING,"That is what I have been doing for the last 10 minutes. The fact is, for the benefit of point of order takers opposite, that there is a clear rule that ministers questioned in this House on matters for which they have ministerial responsibility. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs does not have ministerial responsibility as Minister for Veterans' Affairs for what she did as parliamentary secretary. She especially does not have ministerial responsibility for what she did as a parliamentary secretary on 31 August. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The Leader of the House is now suggesting that your ruling about whether questions are in or out of order should be founded on material, not on the public record at the time when the question is asked. How on earth can that be the case and how on earth can it be relevant to a dissent motion to put into the public domain new information not known at the time the question was asked? Mr Latham-On the point of order, Mr Speaker, the letter is dated 2 December. Noone can believe it took three months to date stamp it.",24
80,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. That was a superfluous point of order.,24
81,Mr ABBOTT,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, your ruling is absolutely, completely and utterly correct because the Minister for Veterans' Affairs cannot be questioned before this House on matters for which she took responsibility as a parliamentary secretary and on a letter which she signed on 31 August. Mr Speaker, what we clearly have here is a desperately demoralised opposition lashing out at you quite unfairly. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I ask you to draw the minister back to the dissent motion.",24
82,The SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"If the member for can be Grayndler would allow the Leader of the House to continue for long enough for the chair to find out what he is saying, we would know whether it is relevant.",24
83,Mr ABBOTT,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, this dissent motion is a desperate opposition lashing out at you in the hope that it will stop them lashing out at each other. They have spent the last eight weeks lashing out at each other and they hope that by doing this to you today they will distract themselves from their real mission: to destroy the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a second point of order on relevance. Why is it that, when members of the opposition rise to move a point of order, you allow members of the government to continue their rants but when Labor moves a point of order, even one that undermines you, you sit us down?

Let me explain to the House the process of events in this matter. This project was approved by me as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services on 31 August. The letters to all interested stakeholders were signed. The project was announced, and I understand it was greeted with great enthusiasm in the member for Capricornia's electorate. Mr Albanese interjecting",26

93,The SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The Minister for Veterans' Affairs will resume her seat. Members on my left have sought the response of the minister. They will extend the courtesy to her to allow her to be heard.,26
94,Mrs DEANNE KELLY,NOES,"ANNE KELLY-Thank you, Mr Speaker. A departmental liaison officer found the letter sometime later, date-stamped it last Thursday and posted it. This was an administrative oversight by the department. Since being sworn in as Minister for Veterans' Affairs I have absolutely met my responsibilities and devoted myself to Minister for Veterans' Affairs matters for our veterans. Motion",26
95,Mr LATHAM,NOES," Mr Speaker, I seek leave to move the following motion: That this House censures the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for: (1) purporting to act as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services while no longer entitled to and signing a letter dated 2 December to the Member for Capricornia dealing with monies under the Regional Partnerships Program; (2) improperly continuing to deal with arrangements in respect of funding under the Regional Partnerships Program; (3) refusing to provide any proper explanation of her role as Parliamentary Secretary in relation to the grant to A2 Milk Marketeers and her employment, in breach of the Ministerial Code of Conduct, of Mr Ken Crooke, a person with a clear conflict of interest; and (4) refusing to provide any proper explanation of her role in continuing to deal with funding under the Regional Partnerships Program after she ceased to be Johnson, M.A. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister Keenan, M. for Transport and Regional Services. Leave not granted.",26
96,Mr LATHAM,NOES," Mr Speaker, I move: That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving the motion that I previously read to the House concerning the censure of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It is plainly absurd for this House to think, after the fiasco we have just witnessed, that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs",27

102,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,The minister may proceed.,29
103,Mr TRUSS,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"Yesterday the member for Corio asked me to confirm that Primary Energy Pty Ltd had sought funding through the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program for its ethanol project in Gwydir in the first half of 2003, and then he asked why the government had failed to support this project under its Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program. I undertook to get some information from the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, and I can inform the House that Primary Energy Pty Ltd did not submit any applications for funding for any round of the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program. They did register an expression of interest in relation to the third round, but they did not submit any applications. Consequently, there was no rejection by the government of their applications and, furthermore, the Leader of the Opposition's subsequent question was based on an entirely false premise; it was utterly empty and without foundation.

106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"On 2 December 2004 the member for Lingiari asked a series of questions related to the visit to Parliament House on that day by Mr Michael Long. I am advised that at about 10.05 a.m. on 2 December 2004 Mr Michael Long and a number of supporters approached the Australian Federal Police Protective Service officers stationed on the forecourt of Parliament House to request permission to have photographs taken. The AFPPS officers involved agreed to the request and photographs of the group were taken as they stood on the mosaic. Mr Long's group then indicated they wished to use an Aboriginal flag as a backdrop for the photographs. At this point, the AFPPS officer advised the group the most appropriate place for a photograph involving a flag or banners would be on Federation Mall. The group acknowledged this advice, indicated they were unaware of the protocols surrounding protests or demonstrations and readily agreed to relocate to the southern of Federation Mall. The AFP officers walked and chatted with Mr Long's group as they walked towards Federation Mall. Photographs with the flag were taken on Federation Mall with Parliament House in the background. As far as the AFPPS officers were aware, no-one in the group was offended by the AFPPS action, and the AFPPS received no indication from members of the group that any apology was necessary. Ms Gillard-On indulgence, Mr Speaker. The member of Lingiari is absent from the House today due to some personal circumstances. With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, he might want to raise that issue with you again when he returns to the House. I just do not want you to have the impression that there may be no further questions about it because of the member for Lingiari's absence.",38
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I was aware a little earlier today that he was not going to be in the chamber, but I felt that in the interests of timeliness I should give the response anyway. House of Representatives Chamber: Sound Reinforcement System",39
108,Mr RIPOLL,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have a number of questions to you. During the course of question time today, I could not help but notice that on this side of the the microphone levels seemed to be at a different intensity to those on the government side. I know this may sound funny to some government members, but I actually had trouble hearing what the Leader of the Opposition was saying. I conferred with some of my colleagues, and during that discourse the Leader of the House stood up and the levels were distinctly louder. I ask if you could investigate that. In addition, when the member for O'Connor apparently rose on a point of orend der, as the member for O'Connor stood, the microphone came on before you had even recognised him and it became evident that the member was getting a glass of water, not raising a point of order. I ask if you could investigate and report back to the House on that situation as well. Also, on a number of occasions when the Leader of the Opposition actually did have the call, rose to his feet and came to the dispatch box the microphone did not come on. You had recognised him, but the microphone did not come on for some time, and it made it very difficult on this side to hear what the Leader of the Opposition was saying. Finally, when the member for Grayndler rose to the dispatch box and you had properly recognised him, again the microphone did not come on until quite some time after you had recognised him, yet the microphone went on for the Leader of the House without him having the call. I am seeking some explanation from you as to how the system works; I am not sure. If you could investigate and report back to the House, I would appreciate it.",39

111,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Grayndler proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.

112,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"When Senator Ian Campbell became the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, he described himself as being for many years a sceptic on global warming and climate change. However, very soon after, on the Insiders program, in his first media performance, he said he âwasn't a sceptic anymore'. He now describes climate change as the biggest environmental challenge facing the international community. Well, hallelujah! Welcome to the real world, Minister: it is the single most important challenge facing the international community. Today marks the beginning of the 10th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is being held in Buenos Aires. According to article 13(2) of the Kyoto protocol, because Australia has not ratified the protocol, our ability to formally participate in the proceedings of the UN conference currently being held in Buenos Aires is severely compromised. According to the protocol, as a country which has not ratified, Australia âmay participate as observers in the proceedings of any session of the conference' but not participate as a serious player. The Russian government's recent decision to ratify the Koyoto protocol means that Australia is now in an even more isolated position because of this Australian government's failure to ratify it. However, this has not stopped the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, others from the department and staff spending taxpayers' money to fly themselves to Argentina for a conference where they will be on the outside looking in. The Kyoto protocol is not good enough to ratify, sign up to and be a part of-but we will not miss out on the international junket! Australia will find itself on the outside looking in, as will the minister. Looking in like a gatecrasher at a 21st birthday, the minister would have us believe that he will be taken seriously-but he will not be. The world is moving quickly. The Kyoto protocol will come into effect on 16 February next year. The Kyoto protocol is a carrot and stick approach. Essentially there is a deal involved here: countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and in return they get the carrot of gaining new economic opportunities through a global carbon trading scheme. The government boasts about meeting the targets, but it is missing out on the economic opportunities that are there. This is a no-brainer. For the government to not ratify the protocol is an extraordinary abrogation of its responsibility to this nation and its greater responsibility to the international community. The emission of greenhouse gases associated with industrialisation in a world population that has increased sixfold in 200 years is causing global warming at a rate that began as significant, has now become alarming and will become an absolute crisis. The increase in global warming as a result of greenhouse gas emissions is simply unsustainable in the long term. We have changed and are continuing to change the balance of gases that form the atmosphere. This is especially true of key greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Greenhouse gases are vital because they act like a blanket around the earth. Without this natural blanket, the earth's surface would be some 30 degrees colder than it is today. The problem is that human activity is making the blanket thicker. For example, when we burn coal and oil, we spew huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the air. When we destroy forests, the carbon stored in the trees escapes to the atmosphere. If emissions continue to grow at current rates, it is almost certain that atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide will double from pre-industrial levels during the 21st century. The rate of global warming is simply unsustainable. Everyone can help in a small way, but political representatives have a special responsibility to act. As Prime Minister Tony Blair stated in a major speech on climate change on 15 September, the challenge of climate change: ... is complicated politically by two factors. its likely effect will not be felt to its full until after the time for the political decisions that need to be taken, has passed. In other words, there is a mismatch in timing between the environmental and electoral impact. Secondly, no one nation alone can resolve it. It has no definable boundaries. Short of international action commonly agreed and commonly followed through, it is hard even for a large country to make a difference on its own. If no steps are taken to slow greenhouse gas emissions, it is quite possible that levels will triple by the year 2100. The most direct result, according to the scientific consensus, is a one-degree warming by 2030 at the latest and a three-degree increase in temperature over the next 100 years. And it is happening right now. The 10 warmest years on record have all been since 1990. Average global temperatures have risen by 0.6 degrees Celsius over the past 100 years. Just to reassure conservative members opposite that this record is not a green conspiracy or simply a media beat-up, the world's biggest insurers are all joining the chorus of concerns over the connection between global warming and severe weather events. According to the federal government's own report released in December 2003, Australia will be gripped by increasing natural disasters, costly droughts and water shortages as temperatures rise. There is no question climate change will drastically affect farmers, as droughts increase in frequency and intensity, according to the recent 240-page Australian Greenhouse Office assessment. Tourism operators will also be hit hard as hotter water temperatures kill coral in the Great Barrier Reef and because the number of days over 35 degrees in most capital cities is set to nearly double. International experts reported just today that 20 per cent of the world's reefs have already been destroyed by human activities-mainly rising temperatures, coastal development and pollution. First, The experts say that another 50 per cent of extent the world's reefs are under serious threat from coral bleaching associated with climate change. While scientists are busily working to understand more clearly the effects of our greenhouse gas emissions, countries around the globe have joined together to confront the problem. Literally thousands of scientists are now engaged in this work. They have scrutinised the data and developed some of the world's most powerful computer models to describe and predict our climate. There is no doubt that the time to act is now. Tony Blair was right when he said, âNo one nation alone can resolve climate change,' because climate change does not have definable boundaries. As of 25 November, 129 nation states and regional bodies, such as the EU, had ratified the Kyoto protocol. It is worth noting that every member country of the OECD, except Australia and the United States, has ratified Kyoto. The Kyoto protocol's creation in 1997 followed compelling evidence from the 2,000 or so scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that urgent action was required. However, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence, the Prime Minister has stated that ratifying the Kyoto protocol would not be in Australia's interests. The government is prepared to take the cost, but it does not want the benefits. The truth is that it is in the nomic interests of Australia to ratify the protocol. On the economic front, the government should think again. Firstly, the targets for the first phase of greenhouse gas reductionsjust over five per cent in 2008-12-are modest to say the least. Secondly, the protocol was designed to be flexible. There are numerous actions that governments and industry can take. Under the Kyoto protocol industrial countries can offset their emissions by clean and green energy systems in other countries. This will not only deliver muchneeded electricity to poorer parts of the world but also increase the market, export and job creation prospects at home and abroad. The Kyoto protocol is a recipe for prosperity and financial savings rather than economic harm. Australia is the worse greenhouse polluter in the world per capita-25 per cent higher than the United States. So we have a responsibility to lead-not to denigrate as the parliamentary secretary does opposite-developing countries. Every other country in the OECD except for the United States is showing that leadership, and it is happening throughout the world. Yesterday the Minister for the Environment and Heritage said: There's no carbon trading taking place at the moment ... and the costs of setting that up are so high they outweigh the benefits. This is simply not true. Canada is currently developing an emissions trading scheme, and since March 2000 the EU has being developing an EU-wide emissions trading scheme. In the United States nine north-eastern states have agreed to develop a regional emissions trading scheme in the absence of action at the national level. In the US, action is already taking place. Senator John MCCain, the Republican senator, in concert with Senator Joe Lieberman, from the Democratic Party, recently put forward a proposition to ecohave a flexible method of market trading to reduce gases implicated in global warming. And the EU was not the only major economic entity developing plans. It is happening here. In September 2000, Australia took its first step towards carbon trading when the Commonwealth Bank of Australia announced it would manage BP Australia's new register of emission reduction units. BP Australia was positioning itself so that, if carbon trading becomes a reality, oil companies such as BP would use these clean units to offset their own emissions. BP's aim was to work with other groups to bring about a pilot emissions trading scheme in Australia that would not be mandatory, and it was already participating in the parent company's internal emissions trading. Tradeable pollution rights and emissions trading are being increasingly used as an environmental policy tool for pollution control. This is a well known fact. Perhaps someone should tell the minister and the parliamentary secretary, because it allows firms to trade the right to emit specific pollutants. They are now being proposed as a method for meeting Kyoto protocol targets for greenhouse gas emissions. Global firms such as BP and Shell established these internal carbon trading systems more than four years ago. Given the minister has so comprehensively misstated what is actually happening when he said no carbon trading was taking place, I might just give some detail of what is happening right now in the EU. After intense negotiations, the European Parliament in 2003 approved the directive establishing the European Union Emission Trading Scheme. Implementation at EU as well as member state level commenced. The major implementation tasks public authorities have worked on include passing the EU directive into national law, identifying the installations that would participate in the scheme, developing and implementing national allocation plans and designing and implementing an electronic allowance registry system. This is all happening, and it is due to start on 1 January 2005. It will establish the world's largest market in greenhouse gas emissions. But Australia wants to go it alone. The environment minister is over there in Buenos Aires. I am not sure what he is doingperhaps he is at the beach-because he says that Australia should not ratify the protocol. If you are not going to participate in an organisation in a treaty, surely it is beyond lief that you turn up at the conference and have any credibility. But the minister also says Australia is meeting its targets. On one level, perhaps that is arguable, but only because, at this stage, of the actions of the Queensland state government in halting land clearing. The federal government had a deal with Queensland which it then reneged on. If you put that aside, Australia has a continuing disastrous performance on greenhouse gas emissions. Australia needs to be part of the international community, sign up to the protocol and do the right thing, because it is in the interests of the international environment and also in Australia's economic interests. It makes sense for the economy, it makes sense for jobs and it makes sense for the environment. Australia should sign up before February 16 next year. (Time expired)",40
113,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (4.07 p.m.)-What we have heard from the member for Grayndler is a litany of the obvious and a lack of solutions for the future. When it comes to this debate, the government has set out four key principles for dealing with the greenhouse question. Contrary to the assertion and implication by the member for Grayndler, firstly, we accept the greenhouse phenomenon, we accept the position set down by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and we recognise the need for action. Secondly, Australia is one of the countries in the world that is actually meeting its targets. I would be interested to know whether the member for Grayndler and our honourable friends on the opposition side of the House would prefer us to be like some countries which have signed a flawed and false agreement but are failing to deliver. We deliver even though we have not signed. We will be meeting our targets, but other countries which have made a commitment will be- fall short of that. I will come back to this second point about targets. Thirdly, there are significant and fundamental flaws in the Kyoto agreement. This is an agreement which is not equitable, which does not address the needs of the environment and which threatens Australian jobs. At the same time, Australia continues to meet its targets and deliver in a way which very few other developed countries in the world are managing to do-and I will go through those countries. Fourthly, Australia is preparing for the ture, both domestically and internationally. Whereas the member for Grayndler implies that perhaps, given Australia's position, we should not be involved, we are involved. We are involved in Buenos Aires, in APEC and internationally in looking to a successor which is effective and efficient, and which has a genuine impact on the global trading regime. That is what we are doing. At the same time, domestically we have invested, either through expenditure to date or through future commitments, $1.8 billion in energy efficiency mechanisms, energy efficient approaches and practical steps which will have an impact on the way individuals consume and the way the country as a whole is able to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and carbon based energy. There were three core flaws in what my honourable friend across the chamber had to say. The first is the implication that Australia is somehow unwanted, uninvited or unwelcome. When it comes to environmental matters, there is a certain irony in the member for Grayndler talking about being unwanted, unwelcome or uninvited with respect to a large trip. We are aware that perhaps he is not so welcome everywhere he travels. Anyway, let me make the point that Australia not only is welcome and invited but also has a fundamental role to play. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, is working to chair specific sessions at Buenos Aires. So Australia will not only be one of the leaders within the framework on climate change and the processes in Buenos Aires that will be going on over the next week; its environment minister will play a critical, personal and national leadership role. In addition to that, we are saying that we are preparing for the next phase because this agreement, which is flawed and which fundamentally fails to address the problem, needs a successor. We are not backwards in fu- saying that we are working to establish, in the long term, a genuine, effective climate change regime which will have an impact on the world. I notice that the member for Grayndler is shaking his head as if something were wrong. The basis of what we are doing comes down to four principles. I will return now to the first of them, which is that we accept the greenhouse phenomenon and recognise the need for action. Mr Albanese-You didn't six months ago.",43
114,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is our watch, it is our time and it is our turn. If you are not interested in the fact that we accept the principle of global climate change, if you do not want to seek a bipartisan approach and would rather have a fight, that is fine. But we stand here in good faith and say that there is a problem internationally. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has set out science which is important, and it has set out a phenomenon which needs to be addressed. So we are doing that. But we recognise, acknowledge and respond to the fact that, as the minister himself has said, by the middle of this century we will need to achieve a 50 to 60 per cent global reduction in carbon emissions. The Australian Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, says internationally that we need to achieve a 50 to 60 per cent reduction by the middle of this century. That is a real, substantive and powerful recognition of the challenge we face today. Against that background, what do we say in terms of our targets? Here the story is very interesting, and it is a story which many of our friends on the other side of the House conveniently neglect to mention. The story is that, whilst some of our good friends and neighbours in the European Union have signed and ratified the Kyoto protocolMr Albanese-All of them.",44
115,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You will see why I say âsome' in a moment, my friend. The story is that, while signing the protocol, many of these countries are on track to utterly breach the targets. Let me give five examples. France has a Kyoto target, by 2008-12, of 100 per cent of its 1990 emissions, on average. What is the current projection? It is that France will be at 110 per cent of its 1990 emissions. What does that mean? It means a 10 per cent shortfall on the promise, the pledge, the agreement. The Netherlands target is 94 per cent. What is its projection? It is 106 per cent. What is the gap? It is a 12 per cent shortfall on its target. Germany had a 79 per cent target and its current Kyoto projection is 80.3 per cent-a 1.3 per cent shortfall, so not a bad performance in that country. Italy had a 93.5 per cent target and its current Kyoto projection is 103.5 per cent-in other words, it is going to fall 10 per cent short of its pledged agreement. Spain had a target of an average of 115 per cent of its 1990 emissions to be achieved between 2008 and 2012. Its current Kyoto projection is that on average it will have a 148 per cent increase over 1990 emissions by 2008 to 2012, or a 33 per cent overrun or blow-out of the projections it has signed and ratified. All of these countries no doubt signed and ratified in good faith. None of those countries, on current projections-and I emphasise âon current projections'-are targeted to meet their obligations, their commitments and their objectives. By comparison, Australia's story, as announced only yesterday by Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, is a simple one. In 1990, taking a base of 100 per cent, we were set a target of 108 per cent of emissions by 2008 to 2012. What is interesting is that in the latest projections, set out yesterday, Australia is bang on target to achieve that 108 per cent. Mr Albanese-That involves many things.",45
116,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It involves many things, and yes it does involve land clearing, and we support that and think it is the right thingthat was a proper, appropriate, fair thing to have achieved. But nevertheless, what you see is a criticism and an implication that our position on ratification somehow equals failure to meet targets. Australia is on track to meet our targets, and in a world where substance matters that is what counts. That forms the basis for our whole position on Kyoto. Our position moves on from the fact that we recognise the phenomenon. We recognise and will achieve our targets to the point that the agreement itself is a flawed mechanism on three bases. First, it is not equitable in any way, shape or fashion. I respect the need for countries of lower socio-economic development to grow. That is a fundamental thing. But, if our friends on the other side are genuinely concerned with output, we see no obligation on China, the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world with 13.6 per cent at current levels and growing, to decrease or even to control its rate of increase. India, the fifth largest emitter, contributes 4.2 per cent of global emissions, and there is no obligation on it to control and decrease them. Mr Albanese interjecting",45
117,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Grayndler was heard in silence. I will ask him to display the same courtesy.,45
118,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We do have a roleabsolutely-in working with developing countries. That is a fundamental responsibility. Not for one moment do we walk away from our responsibility to help these countries, but not for one moment do we walk away from the fact that the well-meaning but net effect of the position of our friends on opposite side would be a system involving a wholesale transfer of economic productivity to a less efficient greenhouse environment. There is no requirement on these countries to be involved. Nor, significantly, under this flawed regime is there any pathway or any prospect in the future for requiring these developing countries, who are the second and the fifth largest emitters already of greenhouse gases, to become involved. The second of the great flaws in the Kyoto agreement is an environmental one. What we do not recognise and what is not acknowledged is that the net total effect of the Kyoto agreement will be a one per cent decrease in total global greenhouse emissions between 1990 and 2010. That is not a great achievement. It is a start but it is not a great achievement and it adds in a certain false regime. The third flaw is about Australia and Australian interests, and that is in relation jobs. Here is one of the greatest flaws in the position of our friends on the opposite side of the chamber: what they support is both environmentally destructive and economically destructive. The net effect of their tion would be to allow a wholesale transfer of jobs from places such as the smelter in Gladstone or the Alcoa operation at Portland in Victoria. These industries, which are by global standards some of the most efficient smelting industries in the world, would be transferred to other environments in other countries-in fact, we would compel them to transfer. First, we would lose Australian jobs; second, we would lose Australian independence; and, third, we would compel them to establish in other countries with less demanding regimes. In so doing, we would actually have a net negative effect on the global greenhouse gas emission regime. That would be the consequence. How do we deal with all of these things? What is the future? The future involves two the things: needs and actions. We recognise that we need an effective international climate change framework and that what was proposed here, for those reasons I set out, is about exporting greenhouse gases to less efficient environments. In that situation, we recognise that by the middle of the century, in the words of the environment minister of Australia, we need to decrease by 50 to 60 per cent global greenhouse emissions. What are the actions that we have taken to achieve that outcome? We are taking action domestically and internationally. Domestically, since the time of this government and in our forward projections, we are spending up to $1.8 billion to combat climate change. That is about emissions management, international engagement, strategic policy support, and science and measurement. In practical terms, that means a $500 million lowemission technology fund. It means a $100 to million renewable energy development initiative. It means a $75 million solar cities trial. It means a $20 million advanced energy storage technologies fund. It means a $14 million wind forecasting program. It means posisteps to do with hydrogen buses-and I know my honourable friend the member for Macarthur is already pushing to make Western Sydney one of the centres for hydrogen bus technology within Australia. We are also taking steps internationally. At present, we are chairing an umbrella group on the future of climate change arrangements, we are working on COP 10 and, interestingly, Australia is leading an Asia Pacific climate change exchange under APEC. So it is pulling together all of the different spheres of our activity. Ultimately we recognise the need for and we are one of the few developed countries in the world to be adhering to-our targets, but that is not enough. We will not allow a system to be enshrined which allows for the net exchange of greenhouse gases between one area and another in a way which is detrimental to the world. That is why we do not accept this proposition. That is why we do not accept the Kyoto agreement. (Time expired)",45
119,Ms KATE ELLIS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak today on this matter of public importance and to outline to the House my disgust with the government's refusal to ratify the Kyoto protocol. There are very few aspects of life which are untouched by the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. Humancreated global warming is a fact, the devastating effects of which can be seen today, and if left unchecked it will create a bleak world for future generations. The key question is: what is this country going to do about it? This government wants to disengage from the world. It refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol and instead chooses to distance us from all those working towards a global solution. The extent to which the Australian government is an environmental pariah can be seen at the United Nations 10th convention on climate change, where Australia is not even allowed to fully formally participate. How are we supposed to play a role in solving a global problem when we are looking in from the outside? We as a nation must display some leadership on this critical issue. We must ratify Kyoto protocol. We must take this action because we recognise the devastating affects of climate change; because Australian industry should not miss out on the benefits of Kyoto, particularly with regard to emissions trading; and because it is clear that this global problem which requires international efforts to address. This is obviously a global problem, but the effects are already becoming evident at a local level. In my own state of South Australia the results of global warming can already be seen. A report which was prepared by the CSIRO for the South Australian government predicts that average temperatures in South Australia's north may increase by up to two per cent by 2030 and by up to six per cent by 2070, with temperatures in the south of the state tipped to rise by up to 4.4 per cent by 2070. The report states that rainfall will tend to decrease over most of the state, with drought frequency increasing later this century, and the intensity of storms around our coastal areas is forecast to increase. Members would be aware that two or six per cent is indeed a dramatic rise, but even the most modest percentage changes in average temperature have profound effects. The renowned scientist and chairman of the South Australian sustainability round-table, Dr Tim Flannery, informs us that a one-degreeCentigrade change could destroy up to 70 per cent of plant species in some plant groups in South Australia. Across Australia and the rest of the world, the picture is just as bleak. Australia is currently experiencing the worse drought ever. A two per cent increase in temperature would destroy Kakadu and the Great Barrier Reef. We have already had a 0.6 per cent increase in temperature over the past 100 years. It is clear that climate change is the single most important environmental issue of our time. It the would therefore stand to reason that our government would be making every effort to adequately address it. We cannot shy away from our responsibility. Australia is one of the worse offenders, being the largest emitter of greenhouse gases is a per capita in the world, but our government is standing outside, almost alone, rather than engaging in global efforts such as the Kyoto protocol. Why wouldn't our government want to eagerly be at the forefront of solutions to this issue? The response of this ernment to that question is to start talking about the economic costs associated with ratifying the Kyoto protocol. Perhaps we should spend just a moment talking about the economic costs of our not ratifying this agreement. Perhaps we should talk about the economic costs of not doing all we can to address this enormous issue. According to the United Nations Environment Program, the worldwide economic loss from natural disasters in the 1990s was $US40 billion per year. In 2003 it had risen by $US20 billion to $US60 billion per year. Does this government seriously assert that our economy is healthier when the nation is subjected to more frequent and more severe droughts? Does this government assert that it is good for our economy for the nation to endure more flooding? How is it a sensible economic argument to subject our nation to ever-increasing national disasters? Let us for a moment have a look at the potential impact on our tourism industry alone. Whilst I do not claim to be an expert in this field, I am quietly confident that the destrucdence tion of the Great Barrier Reef or of Kakadu would not have a positive economic effect on our tourism industry. The arguments that ratifying the Kyoto protocol would damage our economy are short-sighted, fundamentally flawed and short term. But, if this government continues to resist putting Australia's long-term interests first, perhaps we should also look at the short-term economic effects. Let us look at the Australian businesses who are already being hurt and who will increasingly be hurt by exclusion from emissions trading. Emissions trading lies at the heart of the Kyoto protocol. basically furthers environmental objectives by creating opportunities for those businesses which address the greenhouse problem with cleaner products and services. The gov- emissions trading system also encourages structural adjustment of economies away from activities and products that further contribute to the problem. It provides an economic argument for dealing with greenhouse emissions. Australian companies are already reporting missing out on major contracts because of our government's decision not to ratify this agreement. This will only increase after the agreement comes into force next year. It has been reported that emissions trading is likely to be a $600 billion industry within the European Union alone. It is ludicrous for the government to allow the opportunities that this industry presents to bypass Australia. The government talk about potential job losses, but what they have failed to mention, what they have conveniently skipped over, is any mention of the jobs that would be created in the green energy industry. If Australia had a clear and coherent greenhouse policy, if we gave our green industry a framework outlining our goals and expectations, industry would have the confito invest in new ventures. Without a clear framework, private sector investment in future power generation is stifled. The government must act now to provide some national leadership. Their inaction is preventing both further development and further investment in what should be a rapidly growing renewable energy industry. The government also puts forward today the absurd position that we are meeting our emissions targets and therefore we need not ratify Kyoto-when in fact this is all the more reason to do so. I would assert that any targets that we meet are despite the efforts of It this government and certainly not because of them. It is widely acknowledged that the decision of the states-in particular, that of Queensland-to restrict land clearing has impacted on our performance. It is also true that our industrial emissions are continuing to increase. If we are meeting these targets then surely this is all the more reason to get on board the international effort to address these problems. We must face the reality that Australia cannot solve this issue alone and that our nation will not be spared from the effects of greenhouse emissions, no matter how great our individual effort. This is a global problem. Only international agreements can offer viable solutions-and Kyoto is the international agreement. If Australia is meeting and continues to meet our targets, then surely that is a further reason to act as a global leader, to get involved in the international movement and to say on the world stage, âWe have met our targets; how about you meet yours?' This is, sadly, starkly different to this government's approach. The sad reality is that this government has ensured that Australia will attend the conference on climate change as an outsider. We have the tragic situation where Australia has rejected any leadership role and, instead, our minister is ineligible to formally participate in the proceedings.",47

Kyoto is the only such treaty available, and it is vital to our future that Australia ratifies, then vigorously engages with it. The Australian Labor Party and I believe the Australian people agree with this statement. This parliament addresses issues which vary greatly in both subject and significance. I will always assert that we have a role to play in making decisions for the benefit of future generations and the nation that we will become, as well as having a role to play in the day-today issues we are responsible for. Ratifying the Kyoto protocol is required so that Australian industry will be subject to the opportunities the protocol presents and have a framework to work in and also because we must think seriously about our responsibilities for the long-term prosperity of this nation. Climate change is a threat greater than many of us have fully realised. The cost of inaction is extreme. The really sad thing about this government's position is that it is not just us who will pay the price. The price will be paid by our children, grandchildren and generations to come. I urge this parliament, and indeed this government, to take this issue seriously. Ratifying Kyoto is just a starting point for beginning to grapple with the extreme issues of climate change that we face.",49
124,Mr BROADBENT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your elevation to such a high office. I look forward to participating in this House under your care. What a delightful address by the member for Adelaide. Her pure, idealistic approaches and processes have obviously come from the member for Grayndler, who has a particular position. The Labor Party never moved from the position they took at the start on global warming and it cost them enormously in the most recent election campaign. The Labor Party's attack on the coal industry has been quite horrific. This group of people that pretend to represent working people have offended the whole of the Latrobe Valley, the Hunter and up into Queensland, by the approach they have taken to the signing of this protocol. The coal industry has been so damaged that I think I can use the first part of a Willie Nelson song to describe it: It's been rough and rocky travelin' But I'm finally standin' upright on the ground After takin' several readings I'm surprised to find my mind still fairly I hope the experience of the young member for Adelaide is equally supported by the experience of our Prime Minister, who has made a decision on behalf of the workers and on behalf of this nation with regard to the signing of the protocol. Australia has become a world leader because of the whole issue surrounding the environment and management of the environment. Australia has also become a world leader of the environment at the farm, at the foreshore, at the river, at the dams, at the factories and in the management of weeds in our forests. It has remained at the forefront of issues. What the member for Adelaide did not understand is that there is an argument that, if we were to sign that protocol today, each household power bill would increase by 27 per cent. I notice the young, idealistic member for Adelaide began her speech today by criticising the clearing practices of the Labor Beattie government. We have a responsibility within our streams of operation. The member for Grayndler, of course, was more direct. He believed that Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Ian Campbell, had come a long way on this issue. He said, âWell, hallelujah, welcome to the real world, minister.' This has not been a conversion on the road to Damascus. It is important for Australia to participate in world conferences. We can take a lead; we can explain how this government has remained responsible in response to global air quality issues. There has been no mismatch on the environment, policy and political response. I will outline the most recent political response to the opposition's attitude to the signing of the Kyoto agreement in an area that I know: the polling booths within the area of the Latrobe Valley that is now encompassed in part by the seat of Gippsland and in part by my seat of MCMillan. Moe sound had a 3.3 per cent swing towards the coalition; in MCMillan, Moe Central had a 4.5 per cent swing-not large, but interesting; Moe West, 3.2 per cent; Newborough, 2.4 per cent; and Newborough East, 5.5 per cent. Those swings were because of concern about jobs in the Latrobe Valley. Yallourn North had a 3.52 per cent swing. Churchill moved only 25 per cent and Hazelwood North moved only 40.08 per cent! Those swings were due to the threat to jobs in the power industry if a Labor government were elected. Morwell had a 37.8 per cent primary vote swing towards the coalition; Morwell Central, 26 per cent; and Morwell Estate, 28.5 per cent. Do you think these people were frightened at the prospect of the election of a Labor government and the signing of the Kyoto agreement? But let us go to Traralgon, where the swing was 43.3 per cent; Traralgon East, 38 per cent; and Traralgon North, 37 per cent. Traralgon South, where those in the power industry work, had a 42.7 per cent swing, and Traralgon West, 43.23 per cent. There was massive fear. What has the government's response been? The government's response to energy issues and to meeting the needs of the people in the Latrobe Valley, in the Hunter and in Queensland has been to be Australia's greenest ever government. This year's budget pushed total government environment spending past the $2 billion mark for the first time, with an extra $350 million for environmental measures. Australia is on track to meet our greenhouse targets under the Kyoto protocol. We have achieved this without imposing excessive additional costs on Australian industry, households or, particularly, small businesses and factories. Since 1997, the government has committed $1 billion towards curbing and reducing greenhouse emissions, establishing the Greenhouse Office and developing practical programs. We have the second cheapest coal in the world. We have a great opportunity to fuel the world through our energy, through our optimism and through our innovation in the energy industries. The Australian people have a view that we have a great opportunity today to do positive things that both sides of the House can agree to. This opportunity exists because of the great resources we have in this nation. We do not have to sign the Kyoto protocol to join with the rest of the world. We can enter in. Under Kyoto rules, companies from countries that are not parties to the protocol may be involved in projects under the clean development mechanism. The government's decision on ratification does not lock Australian industry out of this mechanism. That is the truth. So we can enter in. We can be a part of all that is happening throughout the world and at the same time we can protect our own community. Yes, we have some ageing power stations. Today, most states are running out of power. What are the premiers most worried about? Running out of water and running out of power. The obvious solution is to build more generating capacity. But what is the Labor Party's attitude to that? They say, âNo new generators and no new dams.' So we have to take the opportunity to be innovative. Perhaps the Victorian state government, with the support of the federal opposition, can cooperate with the coalition on this. We all have a dream that ocean outfalls will not exist forever and that in fact we will be able to take and reuse that water. One of the things we could do tomorrow, in conjunction with the Victorian state government, would be to invest $1 billion to take effluent out of Melbourne and use it in our power stations. We could then recycle it and clean it and put it back into the Latrobe River-and other rivers. It would then go through the Gippsland lakes and be reused again. There is a huge opportunity here for governments to work together. The previous speaker, the member for Adelaide, eloquently said that she was keen on the future. She was talking about her concern for her generation and the next generation. The members on this side of the House are also concerned about future generations. We join with members on the other side of the House in our concern about our environstill ment and about future generations. We want to leave a legacy that is clean and green and good for this nation. That will be the case whatever government is elected in this country. We will join together. We want to leave our community in good shape for the future. We have an opportunity to work together. I hope that there will be no more arguments about whether we attended a committee meeting at Kyoto. Instead, I hope we will all think of new environmental opportunities.",49

128,Dr NELSON,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I move: That the amendments be disagreed to. Amendments (1), (2) and (5) seek to insert a definition of need into the act. They also require education authorities to commit to give priority in the allocation of funding according to need. This government supports the provision of funding to schools on a needs basis, and this principle underpins Australian government funding for schools. However, one of the key principles that underpin the socio-economic status, or SES, model is that private investment in education should not be discouraged, and it therefore does not take into account a school's private income from fees or other sources. This amendment contradicts this principle. Why would you seek to punish parents for making sacrifices to support and financially fund the education of their children? To include a definition of need in the legislation, which covers a range of schools programs, unnecessarily limits how need may be interpreted and could adversely affect the funding of schools and provide them with considerable uncertainty. Any definition of need is best accommodated with specific program guidelines for particular programs, as is currently the case. Under the current arrangements, school education authorities have the flexibility to make decisions on which schools have the greatest need for additional assistance, including the appropriate funding amounts for schools with educationally disadvantaged students. Schools also have the flexibility to use funding to meet the needs of their students. Amendments (3) and (6) relate to principal autonomy and the impact that it may have on the staffing of remote schools. The primary goal of the amendments appears to be to make sure that the teacher shortage issues in remote schools are not exacerbated in the implementation of the principal autonomy provisions in the bill. The provisions in the bill are specifically intended to make that the principal of a school has a power of veto over who teaches in his or her school. One of the fundamental reforms which are essential to providing quality education for students is to see that principals actually have a say in who teaches in their school. Imagine trying to run a business, for example, where some government agency sends you 10 employees and says, âThey're all terrific; take them.' The goal, of course, is supported. However, the government has already responded to the concern that has been raised, by including in the bill a provision that a commitment to give the principal and governing body autonomy over matters including staffing should be âwithin a supportive framework of broad systemic policies'. That provision recognises the need for school systems to implement policies and practices that ensure that good teachers are available in the required numbers for all schools, especially in the case of rural and remote schools. The issue of concern-as put to me by the Queensland minister for education, Anna Bligh-is that, where principals will be given this authority as a condition of Australian government funding for schooling, some principals, for vexatious or rather trivial reasons, might not wish to have a teacher returning from a difficult-to-staff school or, in particular, a remote area to a suburban setting. I give the undertaking again that in administering the act the government will be working with state government and nongovernment employing school authorities to ensure that it works in a way that does not in any way compound the problems of trying to staff difficult-to-staff schools, particularly in remote areas. Amendments (4) and (7) relate to the principles for reporting school information. These amendments propose to insert a number of principles for reporting on students' sure learning and schools' performance. The bill already has a stronger accountability and reporting framework with a focus on improving student outcomes. Most of the provisions in the amendment concern inputs. There is no mention in the amendment of reporting on student outcomes. A key part of what the government is trying to achieve is to give parents more information about their school and their child's performance. The proposed amendment says that information from school reports is to provide assistance to schools and to teachers to inquire into students' learning needs and to develop teacher programs. It does not mention parents. Members of our government, I as the minister-and indeed as a parent-and certainly parents throughout Australia, especially those who are working extremely hard and may have had a limited education, have had an absolute, if you will excuse the expression, gutful of politically correct reports coming home from school which mean absolutely nothing and are written in a kind of political jargon. In some cases they are computer-generated descriptions of the progress of their children. (Extension of time granted) Then they find to their great distress that their child, approaching year 5 or 6, is barely dren. literate, is barely numerate and is struggling at school, and yet-certainly based on looking through the reports parents have sent to me-they could be forgiven as a parent for having thought that their child was actually making progress. The amendment also requires, among other things, that the total level of resources available to a school be revealed. We support the publishing of the total public funds provided to each school, but non-government schools are independent entities and their detailed financial accounts are their business. These requirements in the amendment have not been discussed with the sector. Amendment (8) relates to the disclosure of all financial resources available to a school. The Australian government does not believe it appropriate to require the publishing of detailed financial accounts of nongovernment schools. As I said, they are independent entities. Further, such a requirement has not been discussed with the Catholic and the independent school sectors. Nongovernment schools provide detailed financial information to the Australian government in order to ensure full accountability of the public funds that they receive from the government. Non-government school authorities must, among other things, provide financial accountability each year in the form of a certificate signed by an accountant to effect that funds have been spent or committed for the purpose for which they are provided. Of course, the ultimate accountability is that parents have to write a cheque or use credit card or other means to pay fees, whether it is in a low-fee Catholic systemic school or one of the much demonised highfee schools on Labor's hit list. In the end, parents are seeking accountability essentially because they are in some cases paying considerable sums of hard-earned after-tax money to support the education of their chilI now turn to amendment (9), which concerns publishing the exclusion policies of schools. This amendment requires nongovernment schools to publish any exclusion policy and practices. As private entities, it is the right of individual schools to implement whatever enrolment policies are in line with their educational philosophies. However, to be eligible for Australian government funding, all non-government schools must meet the same obligations, regardless of their particular religious or educational philosophy. It is also a condition of funding that the schools commit themselves to Australia's National Goals for Schooling in the Twenty-First Century. These national goals include provisions that student outcomes from schooling are free from the effects of negative forms of discrimination based on sex, language, culture, ethnicity, religion or disability and of differences arising from students' socio-economic background or geographic location; and that all students understand and acknowledge the value of cultural and linguistic diversity and possess knowledge, skills and understanding to contribute to and benefit from such diversity in the Australian community and internationally. It is often said, by the way, that students who attend non-government schools and who are removed from those schools all go back the to the public system. In fact, research will inform members opposite that, of those students who are excluded from a nongovernment school, about four per cent evena tually end up in the government school system. Generally, what happens is that a student may be removed from a particular nongovernment school and then will be enrolled at another non-government school-and, in some cases, subsequently in a third or even a fourth. I now move to amendments (10) and (11), concerning the allocation of capital funding. It is not necessary to legislate this level of detail in relation to program administration and consultation. The administrative guidelines which form part of the funding agreements already specify detailed requirements for the capital grants in terms of allocating funding, assessment and reporting requirements. Under these guidelines, the block grant authorities, which administer the capital money for the non-government schools, already determine the priorities for funding on the basis of the relative educational disadvantage of the schools. In determining educational disadvantage, they take into account the SES score of the schools, the number of isolated and special-needs kids, and health and safety issues. Amendment (12) concerns the review of school infrastructure resources. This amendment seeks a review of the resources for all schools before 31 December 2005, including a report on the buildings, facilities and equipment available at every school in Australia. The principal responsibility for maintaining the fabric of Australia's school system rests with state and territory governments. In regard to non-government schools, my department published in 2002 an analysis of non-government school infrastructure entitled Taking stock: report of the survey of non-government schools infrastructure in Australia 2000-01. The report presents key findings from the national survey of nongovernment schools infrastructure in 2000 and 2001. The survey collected a broad range of data that demonstrates sufficiency, condition and suitability of infrastructure in the non-government sector. This information has been valuable in informing procedures under the capital grants program. In addition, block grant authorities have a sound knowledge and understanding of the state of school infrastructure in their respective regions. (Extension of time granted) As I said when the bill was last in this place, we are going to examine the structure and function of the block grant authorities with a view to including in the block grant authorities' composition a representative of parents, consistent with the government's $1 billion government and non-government school capital infrastructure project over the next four years, to give parents more direct say in infrastructure issues at their schools. Senate amendment (13) seeks a review of the impact of the reforms enacted under the bill, to be completed before 30 June 2006. The Australian government does not believe that we should be initiating a review without discussing such a review-its scope and terms of reference-with the sector. This legislation will drive major reform in Australia's school sector. The bill includes a number of measures and conditions on school funding for government and nongovernment schools that receive even a dollar of funding from the Australian government, measures and conditions which will drive national consistency in everything from starting ages to teacher participation in professional learning, teacher qualifications and the publication of school performance in literacy and numeracy; career leaver destinations; in median year 9, year 10 and year 12 results; teacher retention and teacher attendance; student attendance rates; and valueadding measures-the extent to which schools add value to the educational life of a child. The legislation also requires the adoption in every school of the National Safe Schools Framework, and it will require the adoption and public display of the national values framework, which was developed following two years of research, piloting and national consultation. It will also require, much to the derision of some apparently, a very simple thing: that an Australian school will fly the Australian flag. It is Australia's national unitwo parents. fying symbol, and we need to be reminded every day of the values and sacrifices of the people who made this country what it is, as our children think about their own future and creating the kind of future that they want. The legislation also will give certainty to the 1.1 million children who are currently in Catholic and independent schools throughout Australia. I hope that it will-and the early indications are that it will not-put to rest the divisive arguments that have been in the public arena in the last couple of years in relation to parents who make sacrifices for their children to attend non-government schools. It is worth reminding the House and Australians that, every time parents sit around their kitchen table and look at their housing loans, their car loans and their family's size and then make a decision to send their child to a Catholic or non-government school, they make a long-term commitment and the last thing they need is a government pulling the rug out from under them. Labor's plan for schooling would seek to punish parents who have chosen to send their children to, initially, 178 particular schools, by cutting or freezing their funding and then, over a six-year period, sequentially bringing every one of the non-government schools into that so-called resourcing index. What that does is punish parents who have made sacrifices for the education of their children. Anyone who is familiar with any nongovernment school will tell you that within those schools, yes, there are parents who, through their own hard work, have done financially well but, my goodness, there are also a lot of families who have made enormous sacrifices for their children to be there-sacrifices such as skimping on superannuation contributions, forgoing holidays, forgoing a new car, living in quite modest circumstances and not only having two but sometimes three and even four jobs between The Labor Party's recommitment to redistributing funding is farcical in the sense that Labor says that it is dropping its hit list of schools whose funding would be cut but that it will still redistribute funding. I implore the people on the other side who understand and care about these issues to acknowledge that the kids at The King's School are getting 25c in each dollar that kids would get in the public system. The kids at Scotch College in Melbourne are getting one-sixth of the public money that they would get in the public system. There should be no place in Australia for a so-called leadership which purports to punish parents and, more importantly, their children for choosing schools which they think best meet the aspirations that they have for those children. The government will not be accepting the amendments, and I commend the original bill to the House.",55
129,Ms MACKLIN,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"Jagajaga) (5.00 p.m.)Firstly, I thank all of my colleagues in the Senate-members of the Labor Party, members of the minor parties and at least some of the Independents-for supporting Labor's amendments and for seeing the need to introduce some changes to this legislation that would have improved it. Unfortunately we have seen the sort of arrogance that we can only come to expect from this government. It is not intending to take any notice of either the Labor Party or any of the minor parties. That will become more and more evident the closer we get to the middle of next year. It is very disappointing, given that both the Labor Party and the minor parties have put forward amendments that would have improved the legislation. We were pleased to support some of the amendments from the Democrats, in particular. I want to go through the purpose of the amendments and outline why Labor is still seeking to have them agreed to. We will not continue to press these amendments in the Senate because I gave a commitment before the election, and in this debate, that we not jeopardise the funding of both government and non-government schools. Labor actually cares about all schools. We will not be jeopardising the funding of schools so will not press these amendments. I do not want anyone to think that these amendments do not go to the heart of our concerns about this legislation, but we are between a rock and a hard place. We will not put schools in an impossible position for next year. They need this money and that, in the end, is the most important thing. The government say that they agree in principle to the notion of need, but they will not count the resources available to a school. to that. A school that gets a massive level of resources from private fees will not have that taken into account in any assessment of need by this government. In other words, the government are not actually committed to any sense of need when it comes to the funding of schools. They are not going to count what, for some schools, is the predominant source of income. What this government have been quite prepared to do is to give some of the biggest increases in funding to some of the wealthiest schools in the country. Most unfortunately, this legislation continues to do that. The minister says that he hopes we will have an end to division when it comes to schools funding. That will not be possible while this government continues to give these massive increases to the wealthiest schools, when we have some of the poorest schools in the country-whether they are government or non-government-really struggling to deliver a decent standard of education to our children. While those schools still struggle to exist, and we have very wealthy schools getting huge increases from this government, there will undoubtedly be division in our community because parents will see that their children, in their will poor Catholic, Christian or government schools, are just not able to get the same standard of education that students in the very wealthy schools are receiving. The reason that the children in the very wealthy schools are able to get this higher standard of education is because those schools have a much higher level of resources available to them. This is because of the fees that are charged, but this government does not want to take the fees into account because its whole philosophy is based on those who have got the most getting ahead the fastest. We will never agree to that and I actually do not think the vast majority of parents agree Labor does want to see a proper definition of need inserted into this legislation, which is the purpose of the first group of amendments-1, 2, 5, 10 and 11. Amendments 10 and 11 relate to capital funding. Labor are all about making sure that we fund schools on the basis of need. We want to see schools lifted up so that all children can get a great standard of education. The purpose of our redistribution of funding is for the vast majority of children, 95 per cent, to be better off, whether they are in government, Catholic, low fee Anglican or other low fee Christian schools. All of those schools would be better off under Labor's policy. (Extension of time granted) The minister also says that the changes to introduce need as a basis for the allocation of capital funding will not be agreed to. The minister has not demonstrated in his response here today, or in any other comments, how the additional $700 million in capital funding for government schools will be distributed on the basis of need. Obviously once that starts to occur, we will be very interested in following it. There is no point in continuing to try to get an explanation-I have asked a number of times and there is obviously not one forthcoming. The minister says that there will be no additional capital funding going to the better off schools in the nongovernment sector, but we cannot find out which schools they are. Once again, we may get a better explanation as we see the funding allocated. On the reporting issues, I certainly do not want anybody in the Labor Party to be verballed by this minister. He knows full well that every member of the Labor Party in this parliament and, just as importantly, all the Labor ministers at the state level strongly support improved reporting to parents. They support having a common starting age for children. It is very important that we see these initiatives which, in many cases, have been started by state governments. I am pleased that it has been agreed to by the federal government, but it would be good if for once some credit were given where it is due. It is a good thing that the federal government has recognised that these are important national issues but, equally, credit needs to be given in those states where initiatives have been taken. What we were seeking to do with our amendments was to really put an overall point to the increased reporting that is required in this legislation. We do want to make sure that the whole basis of this increased reporting is for the educational needs of children. I would have thought that was unarguable but, for some reason-I think just because he is not prepared to agree to anything-the minister is not even agreeing to that. Before I go on to the Democrats' amendments, I must say that it is also really pointing that on this day in particular the minister continues to lambast the achievements of children in our schools. This is on a day when we have had a fantastic report from the OECD about the achievement of children in Australian schools-all Australian schools. The facts are that 70 per cent of children are in government schools, so-by golly!-they must be doing a pretty good job as well, not that this minister ever gives them any credit. I would like to put on the record here in the parliament today Labor's congratulations to all the parents and teachers, in all of our schools, who are doing such a fabulous job that we have achieved such outstanding results in this OECD study. The study tested 15-year-olds in so many countries around the world. For Australia to do so well shows that in fact we are doing a great job in so many of our schools. The area where we have problems, which is identified in this OECD study, is on the whole question of equity. We fall down in that we certainly have a very significant number of high achievers but, unfortunately, we have a big gap between the high achievers and the low achievers. To me, that really goes once again to the desperate need to introduce the whole question of needs based funding in our school system-something that we cannot get the Howard government to agree to. I do want to put on record my congratulations to all the teachers and all the parents who have done such an extraordinary job in getting such great results from our children in this international comparison. Amendments (8) and (9) are amendments from the Democrats which we agree to. One requires-or would require; the government, of course, does not want to agree to this either-proper public accountability of the financial status of different schools, meaning where the schools are getting their money from. (Extension of time granted) The public disap- has every right to know where each and every school is getting its money from and whether or not any school needs the money that this government is giving to it. Of course the government does not want the public to know that, because then it would become incredibly obvious that some of these schools are getting money. A very well known principal, the headmaster of The King's School, has himself said that nobody could say that he needed extra money. The public does have a right to know that taxpayers' money is being spent where it is most needed. But, of course, the government does not really want that to come through. The other amendment from the Democrats requires that schools publish their exclusion policies. The minister said that these are vate schools and that they should be basically allowed to exclude who they like. In fact, these schools-each and every one of them-receive public funding. They all receive money from the taxpayer and the taxpayer has the right to know which children are being excluded from these schools and on what basis. But we have a government that is not prepared to support such an amendment. Labor certainly does support such an approach. The staffing issues are addressed in amendments (3) and (6). These are to do with wanting to make sure that in those states where we really do need incentives to get teachers out into hard-to-staff areas they are still able to work. I know the minister has made a commitment that he will still allow those states to offer those systemic incentives, and we will certainly watch to make sure that that is the case. Amendments (12) and (13) are also Democrats amendments. The Democrats were seeking reviews of school resources and a review of the act. These reviews would have been quite useful, because we know that there are so many questions that so many people within the school sector and among the public at large have about this policy. One thing is for sure: this legislation is not sustainable for two reasons. One reason is that it continues to give the biggest increases to the wealthiest schools in the country. I have no sense at all that the public will stomach that for much longer. The second reason is that, as the minister knows, a very large number of non-government schools have had their funding frozen under this system-sixty per cent of Catholic schools, in fact, as well as some other non-government schools. This problem will not be fixed by this legislation. The government knows it and, more importantly, both the Catholic Education Office and the independent schools know that this legislation is not sustainable. The pri- reviews proposed by the Democrats could in fact be quite useful at coming up with solutions to the very serious unworkability of this legislation. But, as I say, all that has to be put to one side because the government is not prepared to see reason and is going to press ahead, even though we have a piece of legislation in front of us that is both unsustainable and very divisive. The schools need the money now-the money has to flow-and the opposition will certainly continue to put forward our view that funding must be delivered much more fairly so that all children in all schools, government and nongovernment, get the best possible education. That will not be delivered by this legislation.",59
130,Dr NELSON,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"Before I finish, there are a couple of things I want to raise. Firstly, the government does not accept, as asserted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that high fee schools offer a better education. In fact, the Australian newspaper's school of the year was Trinity Catholic College-an outstanding school in Sydney's west. It is interesting to really look at the facts because we hear a lot about percentage increases and so on. There are 2,652 non-government schools in Australia, and if you go to No. 1-that is, the school that receives the highest level of Australian government funding-it is the Southside Education Centre in Brisbane. It is a school which essentially looks after homeless young girls, a lot of them Aboriginal students. It receives the most amount of money. It is No. 1. If you go down to No. 90, it is Trinity Catholic College, which receives $6,500 per student from the Australian government. You have to go all the way down to No. 2,548-at $2,500 a student-before you get to The King's School. There are a number of points to be made. The first is that the system basically works so that the kids who come from the poorest families get the most; the kids who come from the wealthiest families get the least. Every single one of them gets less than they would get in a public school. The second point, most importantly, is that the quality of education a child receives is determined not primarily by resources but by the quality of leadership in the school and a culture of learning that inherently believes that every child can learn irrespective of their circumstances-which is what Trinity Catholic College personifies, I might add. The third point requires the quality of teaching, the training of the teachers and their participation in professional learning. The fourth point requires a culture of performance in the school-a part of what this legislation seeks to address. The fifth also requires a school culture that gives identity and meaning to the life of the child. The final point is that it requires a level of parental participation in the school. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I take you to Noumea Public School in Mount Druitt, one of the finest schools in the country. It has relatively modest resources and is absolutely outstanding on every one of those six criteria. Equally, I could take you to schools I would describe as relatively soulless but relatively well-resourced schools. Educational outcomes for children cannot and should not be debased to this argument about high fees. High fees mean high parental sacrifice. During the course of this debate, I said to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that when Channel 9's A Current Affair ran the story about Labor's enthusiasm to cut the funding to certain schools and so on, the Channel 9 crew went to The King's School when the parents were picking up their kids and they interviewed two mothers at random. The first mother said: âMy husband is in the Navy. I work full-time. No, if we could afford it, you know, obviously, I would be at home with the boys.' The second mother said this: âWe're just hard-working parents that want to have the choice of sending our kids to a school where I think they are going to be cared for not only academically but also morally. And it's a great community.' That aspiration expressed by that working mother who has a son at The King's School is the same aspiration held by every parent throughout Australia. I implore the more sensible people in the Australian Labor Party to seriously re-examine whether creating a future in education that demonises some schools, and therein the parents and their children, is really the best future for education, let alone the political salvation of the ALP.",62
131,Ms MACKLIN,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I do find it extraordinary that the minister says high that resources are not important. If that was the case then you wonder why this government is giving some of the biggest increases to some of the wealthiest schools in this country. There is no question that lots and lots of things matter at schools: the attitudes of parents at home, the teachers, quality and all the rest of it. All those things are fundamentally important, but of course resources matter. The minister contradicts himself. He goes through the argument about how, according to him, the poorest schools are getting the most and the wealthiest the least, then he says that resources do not matter. In this legislation, so he says, he is trying to actually give the highest level the poorest schools. Our view is: do more of that.",63
132,Dr NELSON,THROUGH CHOICE AND,I didn't say that; be honest.,64
133,Ms MACKLIN,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"A minute ago, the minister said that the highest level of resources in this legislation was going to the schools with the lowest SES-the poorest schools.",64
134,Dr NELSON,THROUGH CHOICE AND,That is not what I said.,64
135,Ms MACKLIN,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"That is exactly what you said. Then the minister said that resources do not matter, that they are not the most important things. What we want to do is to give more resources to those poorer schools and fewer resources to the wealthier schools, because we know that resources do matter-as well as the attitudes of parents and the qualifications of teachers. All of those things matter. We will never agree to these massive increases going to wealthy schools. We just cannot sit by and let a minister say that resources are not important while he delivers massive increases to schools that patently do not need them. Question agreed to.",64
136,Dr NELSON,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"I present the reasons for the House disagreeing to the Senate amendments and I move: That the reasons be adopted. Question agreed to. NA Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee Membership",64

Question agreed to. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SMALL BUSINESS MEASURES) BILL 2004 Second Reading Debate resumed from 18 November, on motion by Mr Brough: That this bill be now read a second time.",64
139,Mr FITZGIBBON,COMMITTEES,"At the outset, can I express my disappointment that the government has put pressure on the opposition to shorten or curtail our contributions in this debate. While the member for Watson and I-and I think the member for Rankin-have agreed to do so, we are disappointed that yet again the government is putting pressure on the opposition to assist the government in its mismanagement of the legislative agenda. But I am pleased that the member for Petrie is here, showing an interest once again in my contributions to these very important taxation bills that come before the House from time to time. I think that on her part it is an expression of her support for the views that I have been expressing on these various matters. Last evening I was very willing to give her credit for the very good work she has done on a number of occasions in taking on the Treasurer on these GST issues, including small business issues. She can be very proud of the fact, as I said last night, that she has been somewhat successful in rolling the Treasurer in the party room and getting some justice for those who have been disadvantaged by the GST. The Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004 is yet another GST bill. Unfortunately, the limited resources of opposition did not allow me the opportunity to check on the figure today, but I am wondering how many GST bills we have had since the original package of bills was introduced prior to the 2001 election. Certainly, they have been numerous. The government keeps telling us what a wonderful thing the GST has been and what amazing things it has done for the Australian economy. It continually boasts about the enormous amount of revenue the GST is raising-well above expectations-but never does it show any sympathy for those who are its victims. I am happy to say that I am amongst those who thought that some form of consumption tax in this country was an inevitability. The rise and increasing dominance of the services sector made it so. But my criticism of the government with respect to the GST is targeted mainly at the design of its consumption tax and of course at its administration of its regime. On the design front, the tax is undoubtedly unnecessarily complex. Bracket creep has eroded compensation for the GST for those who can least afford its effects. On the other side of the ledger the price effect the GST just keeps rising. So compensation is long gone, but the impact of the GST on ordinary working families keeps increasing. The design of this tax is unacceptably regressive. On the administrative side, it is a disaster. That takes us to the context of this bill. This bill will allow certain small firms to report on an annual basis. Importantly, it will compel them to reconcile on a quarterly basis, though, at the end of the year. So the decline in complexity as a result of this measure is minimal. It also allows apportionment in determining the reconciliation of input tax credits. Four and a half years after the introduction of the GST, the Howard government, now officially the highest taxing government in Australia's history, has decided that the GST is too onerous an impost on small business. I am very pleased that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer has joined us at the table. This will be my first chance to hear him make a contribution on these issues. The government, having decidedfinally, after 4Â½ years-that the GST is too great an impost on small business, and having decided to act, has decided to give relief not to all small businesses but only to some small firms. Even then, the government will give relief not to small firms with 20 employees or fewer-which is the government's preference with respect to its unfair dismissals bill, for example-but only to firms with an annual turnover of $50,000 or less. The obvious question to ask is: why not $51,000, $100,000 or $300,000? The overwhelming majority of small businesses are getting a very simple message from this government, and that message is: âTough luck. We've identified the problem. We take a view that it needs to be addressed. But if you have a turnover of greater than of $50,000 annually, tough luck.' This is from a Prime Minister who prior to the 1996 election promised to cut red tape for small business by 50 per cent. And I challenge the member for Cowper when he speaks to share with the House his view about all those firms being left out of this initiative-the majority of firms, with a turnover of more than $50,000. Why would a government finally concede the problem but only target those with such a small turnover? I want members on the other side of the House to think about this amount of $50,000 annually. I remind them that this is less than $1,000 each week. Just in case they are a little bit confused about how small businesses work, let me tell them this also: $50,000 annually is not $50,000 profit. This is an important point to understand. Indeed, if a firm has a profit margin of around five per cent-which is not an unusual rate of return for a small firm-it is a profit of $2,500 annually or $48 each week. These are the firms in the member for Cowper's electorate that are going to be somewhat assisted by this particular initiative before the House tonight. I am not understating the value of those very small, mainly home based microbusinesses-just the contrary. But I am making the point that, while they are growing, they still are the minority of small businesses in this country. I simply make the point again: if there has been an identification that relief is required, why not apply it to some other definitions? This brings me to the fatal flaw in the Howard government's small business policy: the very lack of a definition of what constitutes a small firm. This government clearly lacks such a definition. Let me remind the House of some of its policies in other areas, just to highlight its confusion. In the unfair dismissals bill, or âfair dismissals bill' government likes to call it now, the definition of a small firm is one with 20 employees or fewer, although at some point in time. I believe-I might stand corrected-it was 15 or fewer. How it got to 20 from 15, I am not sure. Maybe that was an attempt to claim a greater increase in employment that would flow from the passage of that legislation, which we will have the great pleasure of debating yet again in this place in the not too distant future. In the simplified tax system for small business, which allows small firms to use cash accounting and a different depreciation method and regime with more immediate writing off, the definition of a small firm is one with $1 million turnover or less. So for unfair dismissals-or âfair dismissals'-a small firm is a firm with 20 employees or fewer; to qualify for the STS a small firm is a firm with $1 million turnover or less; and for superannuation reporting, for which we had the debate in this place last night, there is no threshold at all. This is a bill purported to be put forward in order to give relief to small business but there is no threshold at all with respect to superannuation reporting bills. And under the Corporations Law-not that this was an issue to do with this government-you have the three-point test, whereby a business must meet any two of the three points to reach the definition of whether it constitutes a small firm. You cannot develop good small business policy if you do not even understand what a small firm is. That is why this government has a bandaid approach to small business policy, particularly when it comes to the taxation issue. And this is why it was so stupid of the government in its first budget in 1996 to cut the funding for the small business longitudinal study, an academic piece of work that was tracking small firms over a five-year period-it came out of Keating's as the Working Nation program-which was offering this place, for the first time, some real background on what makes small firms exist and grow, what their impediments to growth are and what their ambitions, goals and aspirations are. Bang! For a measly few million dollars saving, the small business longitudinal study went out the window, much to the distress of numerous academics and PhD students around the country who were hoping for the conclusion of that study to form the basis of their work. If the government had allowed that longitudinal study to run its course and if the government better understood small business in this country then we might not be dealing with such an inept, such a silly, bill tonight. And if they understood small business better, we might have had a more immediate and fulsome response to the Dawson review on various trade practices issues. If they understood small business, we would have had a more immediate response to the Senate committee's inquiry into trade practices issues, particularly those which impact on small business. I have no doubt, because it is a common theme of his, that the member for Watson will have something to say about the imbalance of power between large firms and small firms and the impact on the small business sector. If the government understood small business we might have had a more fulsome response to the Reid committee report from right back in 1997. We had unanimous recommendations from an all-party committee and they were not fully adopted by this government. Why? Because of the impact on the big end of town. They were not prepared to stand up to the big end of town and address the impact this was having on the small business community. If they understood small business better they would have fully embraced the recommendations of the Baird committee-the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector-of which I was a member. The member for Cook proudly accepted the chairmanship of that committee but, of course, he was given riding instructions and told to forget about doing anything serious on the small business front. If the government better understood small business it would give up the folly of its âfair dismissals' bill. On this side of the House we have expressed almost ad nauseam our preparedness to acknowledge that there are some problems in unfair dismissal as it relates to small business. We are happy to work with the government on finding solutions for those. I am glad that the member for Rankin is here. He has done a deal of work, and some very good work, on that issue. But the government does not want to fix this problem. It is too good a political wedge for the government. So it keeps throwing this silly bill, which offers no solutions to small firms, back into the parliament. In fact, it probably potentially produces a barrier to growth for small firms by capping them at 20 employees. It will do small business no good. As I have said here on a number of occasions, once society comes to a conclusion about what constitutes fair and unfair dismissal, we should apply that principle broadly across all of our community and society, not just to those businesses with a certain number of workers. This is a disappointing bill from this government. As I said, it shows that it has a total misunderstanding of how a small business works and thinks, what its aspirations are and what it needs most to grow. I cannot help but note that we have choice legislation coming into effect next year, which is going to be an absolute nightmare for the small firm sector. The compliance costs will fall most heavily on those who can least afford to bear the brunt of those costs. Labor has for some time been promoting a simple solution for small firms-I think the member for Rankin may have had some role in this as well-and that is the ratio method, which we have talked about so often and which we took to the last election. The ratio method allows the tax office to provide the small firm with a figure on which to base its GST liability. The figure is based on its historical turnover and GST obligations with no reconciliation at the end of the year. You cannot get much simpler than that. Small firms would not be obligated to take that option, but that choice would be available to them. I find it absolutely extraordinary that the government, 4Â½ years after the introduction of the GST impost and having been warned on so many occasions prior to its introduction of the likely impact on small firms, is finally recognising and acknowledging the problem, is fessing up and admitting there is a problem, yet is unprepared to do anything about it at all other than for those tiny firms-the minority of firms-on a turnover of $50,000 annually or less. I move: That all words after âThatâ view to substituting the following words: âwhilst not declining to give the Bill a secthis bill? ond reading, Labor condemns the Government for: (1) not adequately addressing the significant burden placed on small business by the introduction of the GST; and (2) failing to adopt Labor's Simpler BAS Option that would allow small businesses to use an ATO determined ratio to calculate their quarterly GST payments, with no annual or quarterly reconciliations thus freeing small business owners of the burdensome compliance requirements of the current regimeâ.",64
140,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Burke-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,68
141,Mr HARTSUYKER,COMMITTEES,"Perhaps it is the new member for Watson who has created this new-found interest in small business. For so long the members opposite have been silent. I think that, up until this point in time, Labor's policy on small business has been to buy a big business and wait, under a Labor administration. Basically, Labor has been the party, when in government, that has changed many large businesses into small businesses or sent them broke. I really hope that the member for Watson does not lose his enthusiasm for small business and that he is not infected by that anti small business feeling that exists on the other side of the chamber. I really hope that he keeps trying to jab them in the ribs and get them fired up on the importance of small business. We on this side of the chamber are fully cognisant of the fact that small business is an important area of our economy and an important constituency. We realise the importance of those 1.2 million small businesses that account for around 30 per cent of Australia's GDP and employ over 3.3 million be omitted with a Australians. Mr Burke-How many do you help with",68
142,Mr HARTSUYKER,COMMITTEES,"We are helping small business because we realise that small business needs a strong and growing economy and low interest rates. If you go out into the street and talk to people in small business, you will hear that they do not want a Labor administration. They know that the coalition is the friend of small business and that Labor is the enemy of small business. That is why you are sitting over there, Member for Watson. This very important constituency supports the coalition. They know what is good for them. They know the importance of a strong economy and they know this government delivers a strong economy. The Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004 is all part of our support for small business. We have been supporting small business in the past, and this bill continues our support. This government introduced the new tax system, which abolished 10 taxes, including the wholesale sales tax. We reduced the company tax rate from 36 per cent to 30 per cent. We simplified and extended the existing small business capital gains tax regime with rollover relief and retirement exemptions, and we introduced the simplified tax system. We are also proposing to provide a 25 per cent entrepreneurs discount, which will be very supportive of small businesses and microbusinesses, because most large businesses started life in the initial stages as a small business or a microbusiness. We will be extending the STS to those that account on an accrual basis. But we are very focused on the fact that a healthy economy is the cornerstone of strong small business and a strong small business sector is the cornerstone of employment growth in our community, particularly in regional and rural areas like the electorate of Cowper, that I represent, where we have very few large employersMr Fitzgibbon-Taking care of my grandmother, I hope!",68
143,Mr HARTSUYKER,COMMITTEES,"Yes, I look after the member for Hunter's grandmother-a very fine constituent and a very fine resident. ",69
144,Mr HARTSUYKER,COMMITTEES,"Perhaps she did. Perhaps she has seen our support for small business. But small business knows the importance of the fact that this government paid back $73 billion of Labor's debt, providing an additional $5.5 billion in interest payment savings so that we could help with the programs that the people of Australia need and the sorts of programs that small business needs. Small business knows the importance of lower interest rates. Under Labor, when Labor was last in power, interest rates for small business were well over 20 per cent, and I would have to say that, if you speak to virtually any small business operator, one of their greatest fears about a Labor administration is returning to 20-plus per cent interest rates. With respect to the fact that a strong economy is the cornerstone of small business, the OECD has praised this government's economic performance. The OECD said: Continued strong growth is expected in 2005 2006 â¦ This should be accompanied by further employment gains and inflation staying within Reserve Bank's 2 to 3 per cent target band, derpinned by moderate wage increases and solid productivity growth. So we have strong growth, solid growth; we have low inflation; we have growing employment-it is a great story, and the people of Australia, the small business operators of Australia, know it is the coalition that can be trusted with their business future. It is the coalition that is supported by small business to keep the economy strong and keep small business growing. We have certainly demonstrated leadership in the area of industrial relations reform. We have put in place a more flexible industrial relations system. We have far more work to do, and we are looking to the members opposite to support our industrial relations agenda. A more flexible, more productive work force is a great way to increase the productivity of small business. It is a great way to allow further jobs growth. We will be certainly looking for their support for our unfair dismissal legislation. The member for Watson can really show himself there-he can really teach his fellow members over there a lesson by joining with us and supporting small business by supporting our unfair dismissal regime in this House. The Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004 gives small businesses and non-profit bodies that are voluntarily registered for the GST the option of reporting and paying GST on an annual basis. Businesses that take up this option will be able to prepare and lodge their annual GST returns at the same time as they prepare their annual income tax returns. The second initiative in this bill gives businesses with an annual turnover of $2 million or less the option to make annual apportionments of input tax credits relating and to acquisitions used partly for business and partly for non-business purposes. They will unmake a single adjustment at the end of the financial year, which has to be good for business. The third initiative further reduces compliance costs for small business by simplifying the election rules relating to the option pay GST by instalments and to lodge an annual GST return. An eligible business will no longer be required to make and lodge an annual election with the Commissioner of Taxation. The annual lodgement and annual apportionment initiatives will apply from 1 October 2004 for entities with quarterly tax periods and 1 November 2004 for entities with monthly tax periods. The simplified GST instalment election initiative will apply from 1 July 2005. These are three new measures which are all good news for small business. These are measures which will further assist small business and are further evidence of the government's commitment to small business. You only have to look at our good friend the member for Brand. He said: We have never pretended to be a small business Party, the Labor Party ... That was on 7 July 2000 and they have certainly kept that up so far. But I say to the member for Watson: do not be discouraged. Do not be disheartened by the lack of commitment from the members opposite. I think you should just keep plugging away, because we are going to be supporting small business. We look forward to your support in this House, supporting small business. The small business sector has realised that the coalition is the party of small business. We have been working hard. We have been supporting small business during our time in government, and I commend this bill to the House.",69
145,Dr EMERSON,COMMITTEES,"Rankin) (5.50 p.m.)Government members are claiming that the coalition is the party of small business, and yet this Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004 makes a very small reduction in the massive compliance burden that was imposed by this government on small business in the year 2000. I refer of course to that giant tax, the GST. The govto ernment members have the temerity to come in after applying a $32 billion tax, much of that to small business, making small adjustments to the compliance burden and then saying, âPat us on the back; give us the big tick, because we're the friends of small business. We've put this massive burden on their shoulders; we're going to take a small chip off that and then the small business community is supposed to support us.' These measures are worth supporting, but let us not get carried away. They are pretty small in their nature and their scope compared with this monster GST compliance burden. Schedule 1 gives small businesses and non-profit bodies that voluntarily register for the GST the option to report and pay their GST on an annual basis. That applies to businesses with less than $50,000 of turnover and to non-profit organisations with less than $100,000 of turnover. We welcome it, but let us not get carried away and think that this is now going to lift this massive burden off the shoulders of small business. Schedule 2 relates to the annual apportionment for creditable purposes. The story here is that, at present, businesses must determine each quarter the amount of input tax credits related to purchases used for personal and non-business use. An example would be a home computer. The reform here is that the taxpayer, if they had an annual turnover of less than $2 million, would only be obliged to determine the amount of the input tax credit related to personal use on an annual basis rather than a quarterly basis. Again, this is a very minor lifting of the burden on small business. But, given that it does ease the burden on small business, we will support it. Schedule 3 applies in the case of the payment of goods and services tax by instalments. At present, businesses with an annual turnover of less than $2 million can elect to pay their GST through quarterly instalments with an annual reconciliation, but these businesses are required to make a new election each financial year. The great and marvellous reform here is that you do not have to notify the tax office each and every year that you are staying with this quarterly option. Again, in this case, it is a trivially small lifting of compliance burden of the GST on small business. That is about it in terms of the legislation. But we will support it because it does, in that small way, ease the burden. I refer to a pledge that the Treasurer made back on 24 January 2000, coming up to five years ago. The Treasurer had just come back from his Christmas holidays and he had an interview with Neil Mitchell on 3AW. Small business was rioting around the country because of the complicated and heavy-handed BAS system that had been introduced by the Treasurer. Neil Mitchell said, âDoes that mean no more changes?' The Treasurer said: Well, it does mean that we're not changing the legislation, that we've got it right. As you implement these things there have to be further rulings, they're just rulings as to how the Tax Office applies the concepts, but we're not changing the legislation. Within one year, there were 1,865 amendments to the legislation. Not changing it one bit! Subsequently, there was a total of more than 2,000 amendments. Here we are, at it again, making more amendments, trying to lift ever so slightly the burden on small businesses of GST. In that statement, the Treasurer referred to the issuing of private binding rulings. These were, effectively, clarifications of the operation of the GST. Did you know that in calendar year 2000 alone-that is, the year of the introduction of the GST-there were more than 89,000 private binding rulings? That is 89,000 clarifications to the Treasurer's streamlined new tax system for a new century. More than 84,000 of those private binding rulings were in relation to the GST, part of the streamlined new tax system for a new century. There was a state of utter confusion where the tax office was churning these out. I have not got the mental arithmetic but it would be a horrendous number of private binding rulings every day. They would have the been doing nothing but issuing clarifications of the Treasurer's streamlined new tax system for a new century. The rate of the issuing of these clarifications has abated, but only somewhat. It has been quite difficult to get the figures, but I do know that the tax office annual report for 2002-03 states that there were around 15,000 private rulings issued; I am not sure how many of those related to the GST. And in 2003-04 another 15,000 private binding rulings were issued. The document that lists the public rulings in relation to the GST is an extensive document as well-so much for the streamlined new tax system for the new century. This legislation makes minor changes to the option that was introduced by the government when the small business community was absolutely outraged in early 2001. That option was for businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million, and it gave them the option to pay quarterly GST instalments based on a quarter of the previous year's net GST amount adjusted upwards by a GDP deflator. The government said, âThis is marvellous, you see, because you'll only have to do it quarterly if you are small business with less than $2 million of turnover.' But, of course, then you have to submit one return on an annual basis, whereupon there is a reconciliation and then variation provisions are made available where the previous year's adjustment payments are not suitable. All it does, really, is put off the day of reckoning till the end of the year. The government said: âThis is it. This is the marvellous reform. We've now eased the burden on small business of the GST.' But the government did not go very far at all. Labor has produced a policy that would go an enormous way towards easing the burden of the GST off the shoulders of small business. I refer to what has come to be known as the ratio method. The member for Hunter is right: I did in fact develop this posal. I point out that I developed the proposal from the experience of being a small business person before I came into the parliament. This was before the GST came in, thank goodness. I realised that, for every expense you incur, you keep a receipt, you put it in a shoe box and you put a bulldog clip on them. At the end of the month, I would give it to my partner-I was able to convince my partner to do the paperwork so that he could have the burden and I could go home-and he would have to total them all up and then enter them. And this was even before the GST came in! I thought, âThere must be an easier way.' All around the country, every time small business people go onto a toll road, they have to keep a receipt. Every time they park, they have to keep a receipt. For every minor expense, they keep a receipt. This is a very large burden not only with respect to the GST but with respect to income tax generally. That is why I developed the ratio method. Under the highly simplified BAS arrangements, taxpayers in ordinary circumstances would need to complete only section A of a form. In the case of section A, the tax office provides for each registered business its own unique ratio of GST remitted to taxable suppliers. That ratio would be calculated by reference to the actual GST remittances to the business as a proportion of the value of taxable suppliers over a representative period. Ordinarily, that ratio-based on the historical experience of the small business-is going to lie somewhere between zero and 10 per cent. If you have no input tax credits at all-that is, your business only adds value and does not use any inputs-the ratio would be 10 per cent. That would be a very unusual situation but, conceptually, it is possible. If you had full input tax credits-that is, you did not add any value at all-it would be zero. But, for most businesses, it would lie someprowhere between zero and 10 per cent, indicating that those businesses were making positive value added. Let us suppose for the sake of argument that it is 3.6 per cent for a particular business. The tax office would simply print this on the BAS and send it to the company for subsequent BAS adjustments. The business simply inserts the value of its taxable supplies, let us say $2 million, multiplied by 0.036 and, Bob's your uncle, that is the GST remittance for the period. In circumstances where that business has incurred unusual lumpy expenses, it may want to make an adjustment to the very simple ratio method by completing section B. Examples of lumpy sorts of purchases are replacement motor vehicles, large legal fees or capital equipment such as an oven or a forklift. Then they would complete section B. Item 1 is taxable supplies, just as it was in section A. Item 2 in section B is GST paid on taxable supplies, which is simply one-eleventh of item 1. Item 3 derives the ordinary input tax credits claimable against the taxable supplies-in the case of this particular business, 3.6 per cent. Item 4 is the total of input tax credits claimed on extraordinary purchases in the tax period. They are then itemised, whether it be the forklift, the large legal expenses or whatever. Item 5 is then the total input tax credits claimed in the tax period, which is the ordinary credits plus the extraordinary credits claimed in item 4. The final item is the GST remitted to the tax office, which is the normal GST payable minus the credit for extraordinary credits claimed. The proposal obviously dramatically simplifies the BAS for small business. If a business substantially changed its net GST to taxable supplies ratio in subsequent years as it moved from one form of business to another, maybe from a consultancy service to one that engaged in manufacturing, it could apply for a permanent variation in its ratio. Alternatively, the tax office could reserve right to review the operations of the business and, if it had in fact changed, the tax office could recalculate a new ratio and issue that to the enterprise. The elegance of this proposal is that there is no reconciliation at the end of the year, unlike with the government's proposal. If it is all done in good faith with no fraud, the government accepts that. Because it has issued the ratio, it has basically entered into contract with the taxpayer. They agree that the ratio is reasonable and then the calculation occurs, so there is no need for a reconciliation at the end of the year. Government members such as the Treasurer and the Minister for Small Business and Tourism say, âThis won't work. Either people will pay too much tax or too little tax.' That is not right, because there are gains to be shared between the tax office and the small business and they are the gains from reducing the compliance burden of the GST. In economic terms, we call it deadweight loss but, in reality, there is an enormous amount of compliance burden and that is why we are here in parliament discussing this legislation. If we can get that compliance burden reduced, there are gains to be had for both the tax office and the small business. That is the beauty of the scheme. It simplifies the arrangements and allows businesses to get on with the very reason they have been set upthat is, to make money-and allows businesspeople in the circumstances in which I was to go home, spend a bit of time with the kids and get a life. This is what we want to do for small business in easing the burden. That ratio method, which has been expressed as a private member's bill and as official Labor Party policy, should be adopted by this government. I am curious as to why the government will not. The then Minister for Small Business, the member for Groom, commissioned the a paper from the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. He scurried around the press gallery trying to leak it to various journalists. Lots of the journalists said, âI'm not too interested in this.' Finally, I think he got it to AAP, who rang up the shadow Treasurer's office and said, âWe've obtained this secret document.' The shadow Treasurer said, âThat's the one that the small business minister has been a trying to peddle to all the members of the press gallery.' I had better not be sworn to AAP; it might have been someone else. We obtained a copy of that paper. The official critique of the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, in commenting on the ratio method, said: A ratio by turnover method is a reasonable option for calculating GST as long as the ratio continues to be an accurate reflection of the net GST position of the business. Exactly. That is what the ratio method says and does; that is the rationale for it. It goes on to say: As the actual turnover figure in a quarter is the basis for the calculation, it can be a sound means of reflecting seasonal or abnormal fluctuations provided the basic composition of a business's trading circumstances does not change. Under the ratio method, we have contemplated the possibility of those basic trading conditions changing, whereupon the tax office would issue a new ratio or the business could apply for a new ratio. So, far from being some sort of damning indictment, the official advice is that this is a reasonable method. I will quote it again: A ratio by turnover method is a reasonable option for calculating GST as long as the ratio continues to be an accurate reflection of the net GST tion of the business. Exactly. The then Minister for Small Business could not get this up as a critique because it was not a critique; it was support. As I said, the Treasurer and the various small business ministers said that small business will hate this because they will end up paying more tax. Let me tell you what small business had to say. On 8 August 2001, after I had gone to brief COSBOA on this method, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia chief executive, Rob Bastian, was quoted as saying that he had seen a presentation of Labor's ratio model for GST payments and walked away happy. He is further quoted as saying: I can say with absolute clarity that the members of the association who were in the room were very impressed with the idea because it was ple. Mr Bastian also rejected suggestions by small business minister Ian Macfarlane that the sector was happy with existing arrangements and did not want Labor's plan. He is quoted as saying: I do not believe that. The main concern as reported to me is paperwork itself. There is COSBOA saying, âWe are drowning under the paperwork burden of the GST. Labor has come up with this terrific option, the ratio method. It ought to be adopted.' That was back on 8 August 2001. Here we are in late 2004 and the government steadfastly refuses to adopt it. Why? Because it is mean and it is not interested in doing anything serious to lift the compliance burden of the GST off the back of small business. To give some indication of the dimensions of that burden, I was able to get some calculations done. In the year 2002-03, which is the latest year for which data is available, the gross amount of GST payable was $163.7 billion, of which input tax credits were $133 posibillion. That is an enormous amount of churning amongst businesses as each business then adjusts for the input tax credits on the items that they purchase from another supplier. Because this is a value-added tax and it is a value-added tax to minimise avoidance activity, there is an enormous compliance burden associated with it. The tax is assessed at each stage in the commercialisation of a good or a service, meaning that there is this enormous churning. What it means is that, for every dollar of GST revenue, $5.30 has to be collected by various entities and $4.30 credited to the entities as input tax credits. That gives some indication of the dimension of the compliance burden. Here is the government coming into parliament with legislation that trivially eases the compliance burden of the GST, and we supsim- port it-but if the government were fair dinkum about small business it would select Labor's ratio method, a serious effort to reduce the compliance burden of this monster tax.",70
146,Mr WAKELIN,COMMITTEES,"The Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004, which is now being debated in the House, was announced in the budget. When the Treasurer introduced the bill he mentioned that a big part of our resilient economy is our resilient small business sector. The measures contained in this bill are expected to benefit around 740,000 small businesses and 30,000 non-profit organisations that are voluntarily registered and currently paying GST on a monthly or quarterly basis. The first measure in the bill gives these businesses and organisations the option of reporting and paying GST on an annual basis. It is a genuine effort to try and simplify the GST and to offer some relief in that department to small business. Businesses that take up this option will be able to prepare and lodge annual GST returns at the same time as they prepare their annual income tax returns. The second initiative in the bill gives businesses with an annual turnover of $2 million or less the option to make annual apportionment of input tax credits relating to acquisitions used as part of the business. The third initiative further reduces compliance costs for small businesses by simplifying the election rules. I make the observation that, for all the rhetoric and talk in this place about the GST and the new tax system, the great living proof of the success of this government is the state of the economy. Throughout Western democracies, by any measure the Australian economy stands as a beacon. With respect to employment, debt and the well-being of our general community, the Australian economy over the last eight or nine years has been quite a revelation to me personally and I think it has been a source of great relief to the Australian people. I will not dwell on the issue of interest rates or the $96 billion $80 billion of which was incurred in the last three or four years of the Keating government. I will not go there. I will simply stay within the context of the bill and try and deal with the tax issue, specifically with the GST. The great proof of the success of this government-certainly one of the major tests was on 9 October-is the acceptance by the community of this new tax system. I am somewhat amazed when political opponents take a âsun will not rise tomorrow' type approach when talking about the GST and the related paperwork. By any measure, this system has been a great success. It does not mean that you do not offer some change. It does not mean that you do not adapt it to current situations. It does not mean that you do not bring in a bill like this one. I remind the chamber and anyone in the community who may care to listen that every cent of the GST that is collected goes to the states. As the Treasurer said in question time today, the increase in GST going to the states above that which was expected is quite remarkable. As someone who worries about how much the government taxes the people, I always worry when governments get a windfall, and particularly when the states get a windfall. This is actually happening. But no-one is disputing that a great deal of money that was not expected is going to the states, which is allowing our community to be a lot stronger and will deliver a whole lot of services and benefits, which was not expected. This is a fairly straightforward bit of legislation and it is very welcome. It honours a budget undertaking which was somewhat delayed by the election, but now, as with many of its election promises, the government is honouring it with the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004. I support the bill and I wish it speedy passage.",74
147,Mr BURKE,COMMITTEES,"For debt, the government there is nothing to be particularly proud of in putting forward legislation that goes some way to minimise a mess that they created. That is about the proudest boast that you could put on legislation such as the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004 before the House at the moment. As has already been made clear, Labor is not going to oppose the government's bill, in the way it delays GST reporting and payment requirements until the end of financial years, but through the amendment moved by the member for Hunter we have referred to the alternative method which the opposition has developed as a way of relieving the GST burden on small business. In this bill, the government's answer to the regulatory burden does not remove the problems for small business; it just delays them. Instead of having the headache four times a year, you have the headache once a year. As far as headaches go, I guess if I had the choice between four times a year and once a year I would take the once-a-year option. Even though the rhetoric and the title of this bill say that this is a benefit for small ness, it is important to note that a small ner of small business gets the benefit of this bill: only those with a turnover-and that is turnover, not profit-of less than $50,000. So we are talking about some very small businesses and associations that will get a real benefit. When you are offered a crumb or nothing, I guess you would take the crumb, but it is not going to the real problems in any way. There are two arguments that the government put up and keep putting them up and both cannot be true. They have been putting up both ever since the introduction of the GST. The first is that this is not a burden at all, and the second is that we have this great legislation to reduce the burden. The government put up both those arguments on each occasion, and they have done the same again today. In fact, the Minister for Small Business and Tourism-and we referred to this in the MPI the other day-has gone as far as to say, in the Sunday Age, that the concerns of the small business community about the GST and the business activity statement have evaporated. Subsequently, he stands up in the House and refers to the new web site that is available and to how, for one small business operator, this is going to save four hours a week. No doubt that is a worthy measure, but I do not know how you save four hours a week on a concern that has already evaporated. And then, for something that has already evaporated and that someone is able to save four hours a week on, we get another piece of legislation to further ease the burden of compliance. The government at some point has to acknowledge that the burden is real. You cannot have something that has evaporated and then just keep taking it away again and again. It does not work that way. The reality is that where small business is at with BAS now is no doubt better than it was when it busiwas first introduced. No doubt the complicorance burden on small business is better now than when the GST first kicked off, but that is hardly a really tough benchmark for the government to score itself against. It is hardly a really tough benchmark for the government to boast: âWe created this dreadful situation for small business when this tax first came in, and now it is less dreadful than it was. There you go, we've saved them.' That is about as proud a boast as the government is able to offer on legislation such as this. One of the concerns that has been put forward by some is that this can potentially create an annual cashflow problem. In the Financial Review on 13 May, a tax partner with Deloittes referred to the potential for small businesses to get caught out if they do not carefully plan for GST payments, stating that this could lead to an increase in small business collapses around the time of annual GST payments. Statistically, because we are talking about such a small number of small businesses, we are not going to see huge changes in the figures, but it is important to acknowledge the cashflow problem which intrinsically becomes a likely outcome of only dealing with delaying the problem for small business rather than addressing it headon. The Leader of the Opposition stated in January of this year that Labor's simpler BAS option would have effectively extended to all businesses the simplified accounting method put in place by the government for mixed businesses. Once again, the government keep separating into different pieces of legislation little moments of what they would describe as âjoy', which is probably better described as âreduced pain', for small business in the compliance burden. So, even though the government will again claim, âThere you go, we've fixed it again,' no doubt, in the months and years ahead, we are going to get more pieces of legislation to the problem, while in the interim the government continue to claim that the problem is not there. You do not need to fix problems which are not there, and yet the onset of amendment bill after amendment bill acknowledges up front the compliance burden which does fall on small business. As the government has been gradually making completion of BAS and all the GST compliance requirements less burdensome than they have been, it has clearly decided, âIt must be time to put a new problem in place.' The clock is now ticking to 1 July next year when there will be deregulation of the superannuation retail market-a compliance burden on small business in a whole new way. Just when it was thought that the burden of completing the BAS was getting better-better than it was-we find that what the government refers to as âsuper choice' is going to create a new and deeply significant compliance burden for small business. I had a franchisee tell me that, when he took on the franchise, he thought he would do the right thing for his employees and said to them, âTake whatever super fund you want.' He thought he was doing them a favour, but his own words were, âIt was the worse thing I could have done.' He has spent the last 18 months trying to get them all to the same super account only to find that, having achieved that, on 1 July next year the government is going to demand that he go to each of his employees and tell them that they can choose from all the different super funds and that if they have not chosen-or even if they have-they have the chance every 12 months to swap again. Why is it a compliance burden? It is a burden because for various small businesses it is not just a matter of sending off the different cheques-although for people who do their own admin every extra piece of adminifix stration is a real burden-but also the case that, for the people who want to do this electronically and who set up electronic deductions to these accounts, every super fund has a different interface for their webpage. They all have a different system for making these payments go through from the employer's account to the super fund. We will have a new compliance problem there. The opposition took it to the election that there should be an exemption for small business on this, but once again the government is only interested in exemptions for small business if they are based on unfairness. That is where we will have the debate and where the government speakers in this debate have tried to set out the challenge to the opposition, saying, âIf you really believe in helping small business ...'. They have done it in the context of a bill for small businesses that overwhelmingly do not employ anyone, so I find it extraordinary that the unfair dismissal debate was raised in the speech of the member for Cowper as being relevant to this bill. Some of them do employ people but, overwhelmingly, where your profit margins are down to a few thousand dollars you are not likely to have a particularly big staff. Yet government speakers claim that that is the test of whether or not back you are on board with small business. I do not believe small business is out there desperately wanting to fire people unfairly. They are not raising that with me. They are raising compliance problems. They are raising concerns about the procedures associated with unfair dismissal. What they are raising is not that they want to sack people unfairly but that they do not believe that, when they sack somebody fairly, they should have to go further and put forward some extra go-away money. All those issues can be dealt with procedurally. So I say to the government members who have raised this as some sort of threshold test: the threshold test that will come in the next debate on the small business agenda is whether or not we want to create a situation where the one-off employer who decides to fire someone two weeks before they qualify for long service leave should be told, âWhat you have done, whether it is unfair or not, is completely okay by us,' or where the employer who fires somebody the moment he discovers she is pregnant can be told, âIt might look a bit unfair but, because you have 19 employees, not 21, it's okay by us.' We are happy to do things about the goaway money. We are still waiting for a response from the government to look at the procedures on that bill. But the people who, in the context of this debate about small businesses with an annual turnover of less than $50,000, claim that the big threshold test is not paperwork or compliance costs but whether or not we allow businesses with a turnover of less than $50,000 to unfairly fire their multitudes of employees simply do not get it. They do not understand the concerns that are out there for small business. As the clock continues to tick towards 1 July, as with a piecemeal approach they try to undo, bit by bit, the damage that has been imposed on small business through the carelessnesswhich they have always denied-in the application and the paperwork associated with the completion of BAS, they will then be ready to introduce the new bit of paperwork and the new compliance costs from 1 July next year. We have moved our amendment, but obviously, as I said before, we will not be opposing the legislation. It is difficult to pose something that is a tiny step forward for a community that has been pushed a long way back.",75
148,Mr WINDSOR,COMMITTEES,"I rise to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004 and to speak briefly to it. Obviously, any progress to assist in the compliance costs and the time small businesses have to spend filling out the BAS et cetera has to be welcomed, but I do think the member for Watson makes some pertinent points. A number of the other speakers have also made some points. The fact that we do seem to be dealing with little bits of the jigsaw means that the origins of the GST probably were not thought through as well as they could have been at the time. I think it is positive that we are moving to fix up some of those things, but there are still very real concerns out there in the land of small business in relation to the time taken by, the compliance costs of and the administrative costs of the GST. I am particularly pleased-and I congratulate the minister and the government-about the first part of the new tax system amendment that provides small businesses and non-profit bodies which are voluntarily registered for the GST with the option to report and pay GST on an annual basis. I think that is an important step forward and will be welcomed by many small businesses, as will the other two clauses within the legislation. I will not go through those at the moment. While I am on my feet I would like to comment briefly on the debate that seems to be going to take place in this chamber. When the Senate changes, there is going to be quite a degree of debate on industrial relations. I hope that is looked at in a positive sense rather than in the old battleground sense of the bosses and the workers. I think there is an enormous opportunity for the body politic opto move forward on the politics of this century. I do not believe, and I do not think many of the constituents in my electorate or in many other electorates believe, that the old battleground of the worker versus the boss should be what divides people in this coming century. I think that in industrial relations there is an opportunity, with the government having control of the Senate-I think there are certain warning signs as well-to remove some of the old bogeys that have in a lot of ways created an artificial division between the opposing sides of this House and move on to more important pieces of legislation and issues that could be addressed into the future. In that sense I will be supporting the ernment on this piece of legislation. I will supporting the government in relation to the unfair dismissal legislation. I would urge the Labor Party to look beyond the short-term benefits and disbenefits of the politics at moment and see if they can come up with an arrangement where they do agree with the government on a movement forward. One of the downsides from the Labor Party's point of view, and the government's point of view for that matter, is that the government has had this neat arrangement of being able to bash the opposition to death over unfair dismissals. I think the legislation has been introduced and reintroduced 50 times now. So, on the removal of that issue, the government is going to have to find other issues on which to divide itself from the opposition. But I do hope that this House can find some common ground on industrial relations at the start of this century so that we can move on to what I view as more important issues, rather than the divisive issues 100 years ago. I think there is a real opportuout nity with this parliament. I refer to this coming parliament-when the Senate is controlled by government-as the âno excuses' parliament. There will be no excuses for poor country and regional legislation in the future. There will not be the Greens, the Independents or the Democrats to blame; at the moment everybody tootles back to their electorates and says, âWell, we would have liked to have done that but we couldn't because of someone else.' I saw that practised for about nine months during the ethanol excise freedom period. In that case, The Nationals were constantly going back to the electorate to say they were backing ethanol to the hilt, blaming the Labor Party and others for the lack of progress through the Senate. During that time, the people who were to blame were The Nationals themgov- selves. They would not agree to what the be industry required-although we are talking about a small business today. They would not agree to the eight-year period of excise freedom that the industry had made quite plain it the required. And in the end it was agreed to. So those sorts of excuses, those artificial excuses that were used in the past, will not be there in the âno excuses' parliament. There will be no excuse to country people for selling Telstra. I think this is going to be an exciting parliament. I think a lot of people have assumed that it is going to be a bit ho-hum and things are just going to be drummed through, but from a regional and country perspective it is going to be a very interesting one because, as I said, there will be no excuses anymore for poor legislation for country people. There are a couple of other issues I would like to raise in passing. The member for Watson and others have raised this particular issue, but I too would urge the government to of look very closely at superannuation. People there are confused. There is constant change, there are options; we tend to see changes taking place almost biannually. The very purpose of superannuation, when it was first introduced, was fairly clear to people, and I think they accepted-particularly with the population bubble we are now starting to go through that the Treasurer has been referring to in recent weeks-that they were going to have to make a contribution to their own retirement. But over time it has come to be seen as a form of taxation, a revenue source for government. If we are serious about the ageing population and about trying to come to grips with more older people living longer and their capacity to look after themselves into their futures, we have got to get very serious about sending clear messages about superannuation. A similar thing applies to fuel taxation. GST on fuel is running at about 50 per cent at the moment, and it is an enormous impost on country people. Some people in this House will say, âThe farmers don't pay it,' but country people pay it. They pay it and they do not have the choices that other Australian residents do. They do not have the benefits of large stocks being sold, where there is some real competition in terms of price. So country people are at a real disadvantage. From time to time we talk about free trade agreements et cetera in this chamber and the benefits to our exporters and country people. It amazes me that some people believe the benefits of those trade arrangements may accrue to country people when we still have one of the greatest inhibitors to economic activity being perpetuated by government itself: the impost of up to 50 per cent tax our fuel. That is something that we have got to have a very hard look at, and we have got to do that in the context of what we can do with the global situation the way it is, the uncertainty in terms of world stocks and prices. We have to have a good, hard look at some of the domestic options-a mandate on ethanol, some of the renewable fuels and those sorts of options-that can in fact generate employment, small business and economic activity within our country communities and better utilise some of our resources. As a wheat grower myself, receiving wheat prices that are probably 20 years old while operating under a cost structure that is ever being indexed because of a whole range of economic impacts, it seems an absurdity that we export grain in a corrupt world market, receive some money back, enter another corrupt world market to buy fuel, impose this ridiculous taxation regime and then all of us march into this place and say that is a fair way of doing things. It is not at all. To impose that sort of taxation regime on fuel, particularly renewable fuel, to me is an absurdity. If we are talking about developing small business and economic activity in the future we really need to get serious about those sorts of policy initiatives. The final thing that I want to mention is zonal taxation. The National Farmers Federation have spoken about it at different times. The Institute of Chartered Accountants have spoken about it. A whole range of country groups have spoken about it. Various people have agreed to have a look at it. I remember that about 2Â½ years ago the member for Parkes-who is a former president of the New South Wales Farmers Associationagreed to go to the library and have a look at zonal taxation. I wonder how he is getting on with that. He was an exponent of zonal taxaon tion at that time. It is something that we really do need to seriously look at. If we are serious about sending economic signals to country communities that will expand and grow small businesses we have to have a policy mix that delivers. One thing that annoys me is that in this place from time to time-particularly from the current government but I am sure the other side would be no different if they were in government-we hear that you cannot assist some of the country industries because we are a global player. We went through the debate on the sugar industry last year. We went through the ethanol debate on why you could not remove or reduce the taxation on the sugar industry and encourage ethanol production. A lot of the time the argument that was being put was that you could not interfere with the market, that government was not about interfering with the market and that it would be improper for government to do that. Then we had this corruption of economic language such that the removal of a tax was seen in some way to be a subsidy on that industry, which I find quite amusing. What we did find in terms of the small businesses that are impacted on by the goods and services taxMr Brough-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have been very reluctant to interrupt but the fact far away from the issue of this bill now that I would ask you to please encourage the member to come back to something remotely resembling the bill before us.",78
149,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Thank you. I would encourage the member to do so.,81
150,Mr WINDSOR,COMMITTEES,"I am delighted to see the minister paying attention. This bill is about the goods and services tax and how that tax impacts on policy. That is the positive aspect of this particular piece of legislation. One industry that was particularly impacted on by the goods and services tax was the building industry, an industry which involves many small businesses and contractors. The building industry said it was going to be impacted by the changes, not only through the filling out of BAS statements on a quarterly basis but by the goods and services tax itself. The GST was going to create an increase in the price of homes and was going to have an impact on employment et cetera in small businesses as well as larger ones. The government reacted to that by putting in place the First Home Owners Scheme. The state governments matched that. The point is this: my information as of about six months ago, and the minister might be able to correct me in relation to this, is that there has been a transfer of income-a subsidy to a certain extent-to a sector of our economy of about $4.3 billion. I am not saying that is a good thing or a bad thing but it is a fact; it has happened. So when we talk about assisting industries, particularly in country Australia, we have to remember that this government has interfered with the market when there has been government policy put in place. I do not think that is a bad thing. I think it gets to the heart of what governis that we are so ment is about. So if we are serious about encouraging small businesses to develop in country Australia we have to be sending the right sorts of signals. The signal that that sent to the building industry had a major impact on urban Australia. In fact, the Reserve Bank at one stage said it was going to have to intervene to use interest rates to dampen down the pressure cooker real estate market. Part of that pressure cooker was driven by government policy through the First Home Owners Scheme. The majority of the beneficiaries of that scheme were obviously city people. I only make that point because if we are serious about encouraging growth in nonurban areas we have to get very serious about the policy signals we are sending to them. We should not get too carried away with the blanket policy approach that governments tend to have from time to time. In closing, I support the government on this particular piece of legislation and foreshadow my support for the unfair dismissal legislation as well.",81
151,Mr BROUGH,COMMITTEES,"I want to thank all those honourable members who participated in the debate this afternoon. One of the things that became clear today was that the opposition have been taken kicking and screaming into looking at the plight of small business, whether contracbusiness tors, small franchisees, home based businesses or tradespeople. One of the messages that they have got from the election is that this is a group of people who have basically walked away from the Labor Party and closed their minds, their eyes and their ears to anything the Labor Party is saying because they do not believe the Labor Party has credibility. The reality here is that small businesses need to be looked after, assisted and encouraged. They need to be given the right economic parameters so they can reach their potential and so that in places in rural and regional Australia-such as those the member for New England mentioned-they can thrive. Through their thriving, employment thrives, there are fewer people dependent on the welfare purse, more people feel independent and you have a greater sense of achievement and self-sufficiency in those rural communities. Tonight we have heard from, in particular, the member for Hunter and the member for Watson on the plan that the opposition took to the public in the last election with regard to small business and GST. There are some fundamental issues as to why that would be bad for small business and for the economy. First and foremost, Labor's âsimpler' BAS proposal is very much open to abuse and revenue leakage. It does not require a reconciliation of the estimates made by small business and the actual GST liabilities. Labor's proposal is open to abuse by businesses that know they will pay less tax under that option than they would actually be required to. I will go into the reasons why that is bad, both for that business and for other businesses in the same industry, and into the leakage of revenue. A business that is required only to keep records to justify their turnover is one that has been given the opportunity to set up bad practices right from the start. One of the things that the GST certainly did do was to ensure that businesses understood, and had a better handle on, both what they were spending and what they were taking. Clearly, if you were getting a return from the government month after month in the form of your GST return, the fact is that your business was, more often than not, running at a loss; and, rather than finding that out when you have got your house on the block and the bank is about to call it in, some businesses were able to find out that their pricing regimes or overheads were right out of kilter. But the Labor proposal-where you were only required in an audit to justify your turnover but not your tax credit claims or the details of your sales-encourages bad business practice. In doing that, businesses are not being set up to just pay less tax; they are being set up to fail. They are being told, âDon't worry about the rigours of being in business. You just slip through. We won't pay much attention to you, because quite frankly we don't think you are going to go anywhere.' I think that is a very dangerous message that the opposition took to the last election, and I would ask them to reconsider that as they reconsider so many of their failed policies. There is also the issue of leakage of revenue. As the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, I am very mindful that all of the spending ministers in this place need to have the financial wherewithal to provide assistance to the Australian business community, to provide incentives to those who are less well off for things such as superannuation, to provide for the defence of our nation, and to provide so many other important initiatives. If we start to erode our revenue base from our small business sector, then where does it end? It comes down to responsibility and to the fundamental reason why the Labor Party was unsuccessful at the last election, and that was that the public did not accept that they had the financial capacity to run an $800 billion economy. The government has always supported small business. We have always had small business at the forefront of our policy initiatives and have driven it forward. To that end, today we have a thriving small business sector-one that is growing in confidence and is seeing contractors and tradespeople going out on their own and establishing their own businesses and being responsible for not only themselves but also a growing employment base. And that is a really positive thing. We have seen a range of measures announced during the campaign. For example, we have the 25 per cent entrepreneurial tax incentives-discounts-to small businesses; and this is just another way in which we are acknowledging the major contribution that small businesses make to the Australian economy. In July this year, the Prime Minister had this to say: A thriving small business sector is a tremendous asset to Australia. Small businesses make a major contribution to our economy and to community life in general-especially in regional a dynamic and expanding generator of jobs. That statement sums up the coalition's commitment to the small business sector, and it is reflected by this new instalment through the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business Measures) Bill 2004. We have focused on improving the climate for small business, and we have done that by ensuring that they have a stable environment in which to invest, both in their own businesses and in people. We feel that there is a lot more to be done there, and many members who have spoken on both sides of the House have reflected upon some of the other measures we will be taking forward, including the draconian measures of unfair dismissal, which are a real negative in the eyes of small business people who fear the consequences of putting on staff. Far from it being a positive time in the business's growth, it is a time when they have uncertainty; and indeed it is a time when they feel that they are most vulnerable. That is not what we want our small business sector to feel when they believe they are in a growth cycle. The measures contained in this bill reflect the government's ongoing commitment to small business, which we outlined in the 2004-05 budget. They are part of a package of measures that are aimed at reducing the tax compliance burden on small businesses, assisting them to grow. As I have said, we have a range of measures, some included in the small business simplification package, which expand the fringe benefits tax exemption, increase flexibility in relation to family trusts and interposed entity elections, and allow companies more time to repay loans or to put loans on a commercial footing so they have a bit more certainty around these activities. The government's commitment to reducing paperwork and red tape for small businesses commenced in 1996 and is ongoareas. It is ing to this day. Mr Fitzgibbon-Fifty per cent reduction-that was the promise!",82
152,Mr BROUGH,COMMITTEES,I am pleased that we have the interjection on time and on cue from the member for Hunter. Mr Fitzgibbon-You're pleased with the interjection but you are not going to respond.,83
153,Mr BROUGH,COMMITTEES,"If you can just bear with me for 10 seconds, you will get your answer. Perhaps the member for Hunter can listen and pick something up. The fact is that the statement Committed to Small Business, which was put out in July by the coalition, showed that the Howard government has cut paperwork-and I invite the member for Hunter to listen carefully-required by the Australian Bureau of Statistics by more than 30 per cent, reduced the number of forms required for company registration and reporting, and promoted the Internet as a way of interacting with regulatory bodies and the tax measure. office. These are major instalments to what the government has always committed to and delivered for small business, and tonight's bill is another instalment. Most important, though, is a strong economy. Without a strong and well-managed economy, small businesses will go to the wall, as they their thousands during the reign of the previbusiness ous Labor government. We cannot afford to have a return to those terrible days when the only growing business was an insolvency business. This bill contains three measures which give effect to our budget commitments: giving voluntarily registered small businesses and not-for-profit bodies the option to report and pay a GST on an annual basis; giving entities with an annual turnover of $2 million or less the option to make an annual apportionment for business and private use; and simplifying the annual election rule under the GST instalment option so that taxpayers do not have to lodge a new election every year if they are continuing with the same option. Even some of the smallest businesses in Australia sometimes choose to be registered for GST, for a whole range of reasons. For some microbusinesses, being registered makes it simpler for their clients-so they choose to be registered. Currently, all registhis tered businesses and not-for-profit bodies must generally pay and report GST on a quarterly or monthly basis. Under the new law, microbusinesses and not-for-profits will be able to elect to lodge GST returns and pay any GST liability at the same time as they lodge their annual income tax returns or, if they do not lodge a return, by 28 February in the following year. The reduction in the frequency of reporting and payments should reduce their compliance costs. We all know-and it has been acknowledged by those opposite-that this will be a welcome The apportionment of input tax credits for partially creditable acquisitions and importations on an annual rather than on a monthly or quarterly basis is also expected to reduce compliance costs for small businesses. Businesses will make a single end of year addid in justment to take account of the nonuse of the acquisition or importation at the time of completing their income tax returns. This will allow further cost savings by allowing the GST and income tax information to be determined simultaneously. The last measure in this bill simplifies the annual election rule. At the moment, if you have an annual turnover of $2 million or less and want to pay GST instalments with an annual reconciliation you have to lodge an election every year by 28 October. This measure will mean that that election will remain on foot unless you revoke the election. In other words, you have certainty that you do not have to continue to do it. Mr Fitzgibbon-Big deal!",83
154,Mr BROUGH,COMMITTEES,"The member for Hunter says it is a big deal. It can be if you are head down and working hard in your business and you forget to do this. We acknowledge that particular provision in the bill is a small measure, but it is still important to small businesses that we recognise that not all of their circumstances are the same. Making life a bit more flexible for them allows them to concentrate on productivity, growing their businesses and growing jobs, and that is all the coalition is trying to do-maximise their returns for their efforts and, in doing so, maximise their profits and the success of their businesses. I am sure that all these measures are going to be welcomed by small businesses. Only last night the opposition were saying how they supported the superannuation reporting measures. I am not so sure that they have had that view today in the Senate and I am a little confused about knocking some of these things on the head. I sincerely hope that they will continue to support the measures that we moved here last night and that they will continue to support these measures. Whilst these are positive measures, there is more the government will do to support small business. Most importantly, we recognise that it is essential that we drive the economy forward, that businesses know that they are going to have a stable workplace relations act to work under, that they can have confidence when they put people on and that they are not going to have major imposts due to increases in interest rates and the like. That is what the government has been able to deliver over the last 8Â½ years. is our absolute intention to deliver that into the future. I am pleased that the opposition now recognise the significance of small businesses, franchises, contractors and trades personnel. All they have to do now is back up those words with actions-and actions are a damn sight harder to deliver than words. I congratulate the shadow spokesman, the member for Hunter, for his words tonight congratulating the government-but I wish him well back in the caucus in trying to get some of these measures through it and its union bosses. I commend the bill to the House.",84
155,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Hunter has moved an amendment that all words after âThat' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. Question agreed to. Original question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading,85

That all words after âThatâ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: âwhilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for failing to correct the tax anomaly earlier, leading to significant stress and suffering on elderly Australians.â",85
157,Ms HALL,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"It gives me great pleasure to speak on this piece of legislation that is before us and particularly to support the amendment moved by the shadow minister. The Tax Laws Amendment (Retirement Villages) Bill 2004 clarifies the ambiguities in the existing law. It also ensures that the supply of living and accommodation services for residents in retirement villages remains GST free. The bill clarifies that certain services will be supplied GST free and that services provided by a charitable institution or a trustee of a charitable fund to a resident or a retirement village will receive that GST-free treatment. This legislation is long overdue. The government has procrastinated and created uncertainty in the aged care industry since February 2003, when the Australian Taxation Office conducted a review of retirement villages. That review was conducted in conjunction with providers and people involved in aged care retirement villages. Since that review, the government has been giving mixed messages to the industry. By giving those mixed messages to industry, it has have also been giving mixed messages to the people who live in those retirement villages. On 10 August in this place, in answer to a question from the member for Hotham, the Treasurer said: ... for residents in nursing homes, their nursing services, accommodation and meals are GST free. Retirement village residents in serviced apartments and independent living units are not GST free. They are the words of the Treasurer, and when you hear those words you can understand why so many people living in independent-living units within retirement villages became quite concerned and why the people who run those independent-living units were very concerned and worried about this legislation. The confusion was added to when Minister Brough assured us that the government would legislate to ensure that the services remained GST free. So, on 10 August, we had the Treasurer saying that they will not be GST free and then the minister had to run to the defence of the Treasurer and save him by saying that they would be GST free. I would have to say that that did not reassure many of the providers within Shortland. I was contacted by a number of them. They were most concerned about where the government was going on this and about the ATO's ruling in relation to the GST free nature of the services provided to people living in these units. As I mentioned, I have been contacted by many of these not-for-profit organisations. To be quite honest, I am sure that members on both sides of this House received similar correspondence and that they were very anxious for the residents in these units. They were concerned that this would create uncertainty and could cause financial insecurity for these residents in the future. As well as that, I was very concerned for those quality aged-care providers within the electorate that I represent in this place, because I know that they are dedicated to providing the best service and the best accommodation that they can for all those people within their facilities. I thought I would just refer quickly to one such letter that I received, from Anglican Care, whose motto is âExcellent care, quality lifestyle'. They certainly provide quality care within Shortland and in the Hunter and Central Coast areas. They provide residential care-self-care units-which is impacted upon by this legislation, respite care, community care packages and day therapy. This is an organisation that puts people first. This is an organisation that cares for people. One of Anglican Care's services is their self-care village at Mount Hutton in Shortland. Dennis Byron, who is the general manager and does an excellent job, is a member of the ACSA in the Hunter. He points out that Greenmount Gardens Self Care Units at Mount Hutton are provided at: ... considerably below market value for people of a diverse background, but particularly for those that are financially and socially disadvantaged. If I could flip to the words of the Treasurer and the ruling of the ATO, you can see how Anglican Care would become concerned for these residents and for their ability to continue providing service at the same level if they were to lose their GST free status. This letter goes on to say that Anglican Care has been able to provide, GST free, all the extra services that they provide to people living in their self-care units. That is particularly beneficial to the residents, a large proportion of whom are socially and economically disadvantaged, as I mentioned. These units are provided to them below the market rate. They were concerned that the tax office was seeking to remove the exemption to providers such as Anglican Care and they followed this concern up by saying that, if that happened, they would have no choice other than to pass these increased operational costs on to the residents of the self-care units. This would have had an enormous impact. This concerns me because the government should have acted a lot more quickly. The uncertainty, anxiety and concern that overcame residents who were living in these selfcare units were enormous. The government allowed that uncertainty to continue for far too long. When you are old, frail, economically disadvantaged and with limited finances you do not need that kind of uncertainty. The government needs a slap over the knuckles for taking so long to deal with this matter and for creating uncertainty within the industry for quality aged care providers within the Shortland electorate and throughout the country. The member for Rankin is sitting here nodding in agreement because it has not been limited to Shortland-it has occurred throughout Australia. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, that you have probably come across those sorts of things within your own electorate. As we all know, when the Howard government introduced the GST it promised residents in retirement villages and aged care residential settings that they would receive their accommodation GST free. I can understand why people became anxious. I can understand why they worried so much about whether or not their GST status was going to change. There are so many things that the Howard government has promised people and then not delivered on that they felt this was going to be another one of those things. They felt that their financial security and their economic independence were really going to be impacted upon by the Howard government failing to deliver to them yet again. It is not good enough that this has gone on for so long. This leads us to the ministerial determination by the then Minister for Health and Ageing in 2002 which specified that services could be GST free if a resident required and received a daily living allowance. This is what people were basing it on. This is part of the problem-the government constantly change the rules as they go along. When they conducted the review in February 2003, even though they consulted with the sector people did not believe them. People were not prepared to accept that the government were actually genuine and that they would continue to deliver to people living in this kind of accommodation. There are still a couple of problems in this legislation. The first problem relates to the fact that the bill empowers the Minister for Ageing to specify the level of care needed to qualify for GST-free supplies. Firstly, I am always concerned when it is left to the minister to determine what will and what will not be supplied GST free. How can we trust the minister? Tell me: how can we trust a minister who has created so much uncertainty for such a long period of time and has created anxiety for both providers and residents? That is a real concern for me. There is some concern that the level of care could be specified as being so high that it would be too onerous for an operator to provide. If you think about that, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a real issue and is something that needs to be sorted out by the government. It is something that the government needs to clarify, not only for the residents but particularly for the providers. I know from speaking to providers that they would prefer it if the bill specified that satisfying one of the criteria listed in aged care minister's determination would be a sufficient condition for GST-free treatment. That is what should be included in this legislation. That is not what is included in this legislation, and that concerns me. There is also some concern that the bill empowers the Minister for Ageing to specify the process by which the requisite level of care for the GST-free services is assessed. This is expected to be conducted by aged care assessment teams, who currently assess residents' eligibility for government funded places. Any member in this place who has any connection with aged care in their electorate or any member who has any dealings with ACATs in their electorates would know just how much pressure those ACATs are under. There are waiting lists for residents to be assessed to go into either high care or low care or to be provided with community aged care packages. I feel that this is going to be another burden for the ACATs. I feel that this is not going to work because people will be made to wait. It will affect not only the areas covered by this legislation but also other areas that the ACATs are involved in. It would be much better if this were delegated to a doctor or a registered nurse-somebody who deals with residents on a regular basis and intimately knows their medical condition and their functionality and who can act quickly. People do not need to wait. It is unnecessary and cumbersome and will have a very negative effect. The bill does clarify the situation. It does clarify that certain supplies will receive GSTfree treatment when provided by a charitable institution or a trustee of a charitable fund to a residential retirement village. But, as I have said, it is too little too late and there are still areas that need to be addressed. I condemn the government for taking so long to end the uncertainty. I feel that the only reason the changes have been introduced in this legislation, and the only reason the government has actually dealt with it at all, is because of the pressure the Labor Party, we on this side of the House, have put on the government. I do not think that this government has performed well enough in this area. I do not think that it has looked at the implications of its legislation and its procrastination on the people to whom the legislation applies-the providers of the services and the residents of these independent living units. I think that this legislation probably needs to be looked at a little more thoroughly, but it is very important that we clarify the situation, get some certainty and deal with this piece of legislation now. I end where I started by condemning the government for its procrastination and for the anxiety and stress that it has caused those elderly people and providers of the services.",85
158,Dr WASHER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am very pleased to see legislation being introduced to the parliament to make minor amendments to the A New Tax System with regard to the GST treatment of retirement villages. While the amendments are indeed minor, they will allay the fears of aged care providers and retirement village owners who have felt vulnerable to interpretations of tax laws with regard to GST on services. Back in July, I was contacted by a retirement village owner in my electorate of Moore, who was very concerned that elderly people in his care would face increased charges because of a potential ATO interpretation of tax law. In fact, the professional advice given to this owner was that the retirement village should pay GST on services. The owner was very concerned that if he misinterpreted the rules or failed to collect the GST from his residents, he would be responsible for not only the tax but also the interest and penalties. Of course this was never the intention of the government. The government's intention has always been that, where residents of retirement villages require daily living or nursing assistance, those services would be GST free. The Tax Laws Amendment (Retirement Villages) Bill 2004 simply removes any uncertainty or perceived ambiguity in the legislation that may have the effect of changing the GST treatment for some residents. Put simply, residents of serviced apartments in retirement villages who are assessed as requiring daily living and nursing assistance will receive these services free of GST. This has always been the government's intention, and this legislation will make it crystal clear. This legislation will specify what constitutes residential care, to whom it applies and the level of service required to meet the test of daily living assistance. For instance, without the amendments, it was unclear whether serviced apartments in retirement villages were considered to be a residential setting. This bill removes that uncertainty if the following criteria apply: (1) they are a resident of a serviced apartment in a retirement village; and (2) there is a written agreement under which the operator of the retirement village provides daily meals and heavy laundry services to all the residents of the serviced apartment. They would then be GST free as these residents rely heavily on daily services provided by the village owner. To provide a contrast, let us look at two different scenarios which will now be very clearly defined under the Tax Laws Amendment (Retirement Villages) Bill 2004. Resident A enters into an arrangement for the retirement village operator to supply him or her with breakfast each day but the resident chooses to cook their own lunch and dinner. This would not be considered as a provision of daily meals. It would normally be expected that the operator would supply all the daily meals for resident A to meet these requirements. In contrast, resident B, a resident of a serviced apartment, might be absent from his or her retirement village on a particular day. The resident may be visiting relatives or enjoying an excursion with a local seniors club. As the resident is away from the retirement village for the whole day, the resident does not have his or her meals provided by the operator. In this scenario, it is not intended that this would result in GSTfree treatment being denied. However, residents in serviced apartments and independent-living units who do not receive nursing services or assistance with daily living activities are not eligible for GST-free treatment of their accommodation and services, and never have been. These changes are minor, but they are necessary to protect the government's policy intent. The Tax Laws Amendment (Retirement Villages) Bill 2004 provides for certainty in the aged care sector, both for providers and residents of retirement villages. I commend this bill to the House.",88
159,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,I call my good friend the member for Rankin.,89
160,Dr EMERSON,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Rankin) (7.20 p.m.)Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. You have lots of good friends, and deservedly so. The Tax Laws Amendment (Retirement Villages) Bill 2004 is necessitated by ambiguity in the GST legislation and the tax office rulings. That ambiguity has created a great deal of stress and uncertainty amongst residents of retirement villages. The government has been very sluggish in finally moving to resolve some of that uncertainty. When the government first introduced the GST, it promised that residents of retirement villages in an aged care setting would receive a range of living and accommodation services without attracting GST. This resulted in a ministerial determination in the year 2000 that established as the criterion for GST-free status the receipt by the resident of daily living assistance. I understand why that criterion would be applied because it no doubt is designed to stop people plonking serviced apartments onto an aged care site without any relationship between the serviced apartments and the aged care site and, therefore, having services supplied GST free. That would not have been the intent of the policy makers, so the criterion of a resident receiving daily living assistance was applied. In the year 2003 the tax office conducted a review of the GST treatment of retirement villages. As a consequence of that review, the tax office decided that living in serviced apartments in aged care facilities is the same as living in your own home. That had obvious implications-that is, that the service associated with these apartments would in fact attract GST. As result of that review, the tax office went on to prepare a draft ruling denying GST-free status for serviced apartments in retirement villages. The Treasurer told parliament on 10 August this year: Retirement village residents in serviced apartments and independent living units are not GST free. That is the legislation and that which the government announced. So the Treasurer said that serviced apartments which are located in retirement villages are not GST free. In other words, they attract GST. In the same contribution to the parliament he went on to discuss the tax office ruling and confirmed his view that these services would in fact attract GST. Three days later, Minister Brough, the Minister for Revenue, issued a media release announcing that the government would legislate to ensure that these services were GST free. So we had the Treasurer confirming the government's intention all along that these serviced apartments would attract GST, and yet, three days later, in a most bizarre development, the Treasurer was rolled by the Minister for Revenue. The Minister for Revenue provided some hope to residents of serviced apartments in aged care facilities by saying to them, âLook, really the intention is that these services will be GST free.' And so this bill emerged. The bill amends the GST act to ensure that supplies of certain services and accommodation to residents of serviced apartments in retirement villages are GST free. Two criteria apply. The first is where the resident requires what is called daily living activities assistance. The second is nursing services. These are the two tests. In fact, the explanatory memorandum says: Without these amendments it is unclear whether supplies of certain care services and accommodation to residents of serviced apartments in retirement villages fall within the existing subsection 38-25(3), and are thus GST-free, as originally intended. It goes on to say: This bill ensures that services provided to a resident of a retirement village are taken to be provided in a âresidential setting'is the policy and therefore are GST freeif: - they are a resident of a âserviced apartment' in a âretirement village'; and - there is a written agreement under which the operator of the retirement village provides daily meals and heavy laundry services to all the residents of the serviced apartment. So that is the second test: the provision of meals and heavy laundry services. That is the level of detail to which this legislation goes in determining whether or not residents in those serviced apartments will be subject to the GST on the services they receive. So much for the streamlined new tax system for a new century. We have a tax that has been designed, and now criteria that are applied in legislation in this parliament, to determine that residents must receive heavy laundry services. Are we going to have the Commissioner of Taxation or his delegate, or the Minister for Ageing or his or her delegate, running around and checking the weight of the laundry to make sure that the resident uses heavy laundry services and not light laundry services? Such is the absurdity of the so-called streamlined new tax system for a new century that the Treasurer used to boast about back in the year 2000 when this legislation was being introduced. I have not heard him refer to the streamlined new tax system for a new century for a good four years now, and for good reason. It is not streamlined. It is not a new tax act idea; it is a concept that has been around for a long time. This government has comprehensively blown it in terms of the compliance burden that has been borne not only by small business but in this case by residents retirement villages in seeking to satisfy the government that their services should in fact be GST free. Who does make those decisions? Fortunately, it is not the Treasurer, because, if was, he would probably be saying, âNo, that is light laundry and you're going to be subject to the GST, because I've been weighing your laundry lately.' That is good news, but the situation is not much better because it is in fact the Minister for Ageing who will be brought into make a determination here. Again, quoting from the explanatory memorandum, this is the way the Minister for Ageing gets into the act: To provide greater clarity as to which services will qualify for GST-free treatment, and to ensure that they are provided to people who require those services, services provided to a resident of a serviced apartment in a retirement village will not be taken to be provided in a âresidential setting' if: - the Aged Care Minister has made a determination under new paragraph 38-25(3B)(a); and - the Aged Care Secretary has not made an assessment or has assessed the person as not meeting the requirements set out in that determination. That should be clear to all. So we have not only the Minister for Ageing coming into the act but also the aged care secretary. What then happens? The explanatory memorandum states: ... if the Aged Care Minister has made a determination that applies to the person, then the supply will only be GST-free if the Aged Care Secretary has assessed the person as needing the required level of care services. No doubt the resident will have to need this heavy laundry and need the other services that are provided rather than want them. We are going into a strange twilight zone of economics and sociology, where the secretary of the department decides on the difference beof tween a need and a want. I do not know how they are going to do that, but they say that they will be able to do it. The secretary can delegate to an aged care assessment team such decisions as whether it an aged care resident needs or wants their services, or partly needs or partly wants them. As the member for Shortland suggested, perhaps the delegation should be to a registered nurse or someone on location who has a better idea of these matters rather than to a member of an aged care assessment team, who would be wandering around serviced apartments determining whether the laundry was heavy or light or whether the services people used reflected their needs or wants. All of this is designed to decide whether, for GST purposes, a person is effectively in an independent living unit-the services would not therefore be GST free; they would attract GST-or, alternatively, they are in a serviced apartment where the services would be GST free. If a person living in a serviced apartment is to all intents and purposes living independently of the aged care facility in which he or she is located then that person is really in an independent living unit and, under the legislation and the intent of the lation, the services would not be GST free. The explanatory memorandum reveals the true impact of this measure. In 2004-05 the revenue forgone will be $47 million, in 2005-06 it will be $11 million and then subsequently it will be $12 million and $13 million. Why the $47 million? The answer is: because so many people, faced with the uncertainty as to the tax office making determinations and the ambiguity in the legislation, had chosen to pay the GST on these services so they would not be hit with a great bill if the decision went the other way. So, now that the decision has gone the right way, that will be a cost to the revenue of $47 million. This legislation continues the debacle of the GST's compliance burden and complexity. I am sure the member for Canberra recalls the Treasurer referring to the complicated sales tax of Botswana and Swaziland and saying that wholesale sales tax was going to be replaced with this streamlined new tax system for a new century which would be very, very simple. On 24 January in the year 2000, which is now a very long time ago, the Treasurer was asked the following question by Neil Mitchell on radio 3AW: Does that mean no more changes? And the Treasurer said: Well, it does mean that we're not changing the legislation, that we've got it right. As you implement these things there have to further rulings, they're just rulings as to how the Tax Office applies the concepts, but we're not changing the legislation. On 24 January 2000-2001, 2002, 2003, 2004-coming up to five years ago, the Treasurer said, âWe're not changing it at all.' Within one year there were 1,865 changes to the legislation. There have now been more than 2,000 changes to the legislation, and this bill before the parliament makes further changes to the legislation. In addition to that, legisin one year-the year 2000-there were 84,000 private binding rulings on this streamlined new tax system for a new century. What is a private binding ruling? It is a clarification. There were 84,000 clarifications! If it was so streamlined, if it was so simple, if a complicated wholesale sales tax system had indeed been replaced by an elegant, simple GST, why did it require 84,000 clarifications in one year? It is pretty clear that there have been about 15,000 private binding rulings in the years subsequent, to the best of our knowledge and from the research that I have been able to do. I have with me a list of the GST public rulings that runs to dozens of pages-these are also clarifications on the application of the GST. It has caused so much uncertainty, it has been mishandled, it has been poorly designed and it is anything but a streamlined tax system. The fact is that this legislation is needed because so much ambiguity, so much uncertainty and so much unnecessary anxiety has been created amongst aged care residents in serviced apartments. It is a useful piece of legislation. It does, as the member for Shortland reminded us, lead to yet further uncertainties as to how these criteria will be applied in practice-who will apply them in practice-but we do welcome the government finally providing some clarity in this regard and removing some of the anxiety and uncertainty. It is on that basis that Labor be supporting the bill.",89
161,Mr HARTSUYKER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I have to note the preoccupation of the member for Rankin with light laundry and heavy laundry. Whilst I might say that that distinction is probably an important one, there is certainly a lot of dirty laundry on display by the ALP at the doors each morning. So I regret to advise the members opposite that, as members of this House, laundry services would be subject to GST in their hands. I rise today to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Retirement Villages) Bill 2004. This bill will make some minor amendments to the new tax system and remove uncertainty in relation to the GST treatment of retirement villages. The bill will clarify the operation of the goods and services tax law for operators and residents of retirement villages and will ensure that it is consistent the government's policy intent. The bill before the House cements in legislation what has always been the HowardAnderson government's intention: that GSTfree treatment should apply where residents require daily living or nursing assistance. The bill removes any uncertainty for residents of serviced apartments in retirement villages that are assessed as requiring daily living and nursing assistance as defined under the Aged Care Act 1997. This legislation confirms that these residents will receive these services GST free. The bill also extends to charities that operate retirement lages that supply accommodation or accommodation related services and meals GST free, in accordance with existing practice. The government are committed to the needs of older Australians and have implemented many measures to support those older Australians, such as linking the age pension to no less than 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings or CPI. We will have introduced the senior Australians tax offset, SATO, which allows eligible older Australians to earn up to $20,500 without paying income tax, or, in the case of couples, $16,806 each. Substantially widening the eligibility criteria for the Commonwealth seniors health card is a major achievement by this government. We have increased the private health insurance rebate for older Australians from 30 to 35 per cent for people aged between 65 and 69, and to 40 per cent for people aged over 70. In addition, in this year's budget the government have provided an additional $2.2 billion to support our aged community. We have provided $58.4 million for more aged care places over four years, which will increase the aged care provision ratio from 100 to 108 operational places per 1,000 people aged over 70. We will increase the maximum with rate of the accommodation charge and increase the concessional resident supplement under the building better aged care homes program. We will also provide 1,200 new nursing places to universities under the better skills for better care program, to ensure that we have the skilled work force to provide the care that our older Australians need. We announced during the recent election campaign that the Howard-Anderson government would introduce a number of new measures to help our older Australians. We will provide a $100 utility supplement, which will help some 2.2 million older Ausvil- tralians; a new $200 payment to self-funded retirees to help compensate them for the lack of action by state and territory governments in extending concessions to self-funded retirees; and a new $148 million package over four years to provide more help for carers who are looking after family members and loved ones at home. The Howard-Anderson government will also exempt accommodation bonds paid for hostel care from the social security assets test. We have been supporting Medicare, a much-needed service for older Australians. We will be increasing the Medicare rebate from 85 per cent to 100 per cent of the schedule fee. Also, we recently announced the $7.50 incentive payment in my electorate for GPs to bulk-bill children aged under 16 years and health care card holders. There will be a program, at a cost of some $47.9 million, to provide better access to medical care for residents of aged care facilities. We also introduced the safety net, so widely needed by our older Australians and particularly our frail Australians, to ensure that they are proing tected from high out-of-pocket expenses which are incurred outside the hospital system. The Howard-Anderson government is committed to helping our older Australians with dementia. It will introduce a number of new measures, including a $200 million program over four years to support people with dementia and their carers. This new funding will allow us to enhance dementia research, primary care and early intervention opportunities. The $200 million program will include âDementia-a national health priority', which will direct some $52.2 million to make dementia a national health priority and allow better early intervention for people with dementia and their carers. There will be $127.7 million for dementia-specific Extended Aged Care at Home places and $20.1 million to provide new dementia training for aged care workers and people in the community likely to come into contact with people with dementia. This government also wants to support carers of our aged community. This government cares about carers. In its policy Recognising Senior Australians-their Needs and their Carers, the Howard-Anderson government provides further evidence of its support for older Australians in this funding of $148 million over four years to assist carers. Included in this package is $60 million over four years to increase the number of respite services available to carers in paid employment. There is $21.7 million to increase the availability of overnight respite in aged care homes and $40.8 million over four years to fund additional community respite houses to provide overnight respite. Importantly, this package also provides $6.4 million over four years to provide more respite in rural areas through multipurpose services. This government is committed to providfor older Australians. It will continue to develop good policy and it will plan to ensure it is providing for our older Australians in the face of the rapid demographic change which is approaching and which has in many cases arrived. Our rapidly ageing population requires a strong, definite policy response. This government has taken up that challenge. The Treasurer has been very vocal in relation to the demands that are going to be placed on our economy and society as a result of that demographic change, as illustrated through the Intergenerational Report. If we want to look back at Labor's legacy with regard to our older Australians, we need look no further than the 1998 Auditor General's report, The planning of aged care. This revealed that Labor's failures resulted in a shortfall of some 10,000 aged care places when they left office. Labor also failed to ensure an adequate supply of capital to the aged care sector. There was a severely rundown capital structure. The 1994 Gregory report found that some 13 per cent of nursing homes failed to meet relevant fire authority standards, 11 per cent of nursing homes did not meet relevant health authority standards, 70 per cent of nursing homes did not meet relevant outcome standards and 51 per cent of nursing home residents were living in rooms with three or more beds. This government have addressed the challenges of aged care. This government have substantially increased the amount of investment in aged care. We are meeting the challenges of an ageing population. We are providing the necessary investment to care adequately for our ageing population. This bill is one which I support. It removes the uncertainty with regard to GST treatment of the services which I mentioned earlier. I commend the bill to the House.",93
162,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,The question is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. I call the honourable member for Canberra and wish her and her family a very happy Christmas.,95
163,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay. I wish the same to you and colleagues. The Tax Laws Amendment (Retirement Villages) Bill 2004 should never have been required. It is required and we are supporting it, but if the introduction of the GST had been a bit more carefully thought through and if the warning signs and words that have been emanating from the sector over the last four years had been listened to then maybe we would have seen the bill earlier than this. It is fair to say that any discuspay sion concerning how we care for or about our senior citizens is an important discussion. Anything we do in the way that we care for these people is equally important. The government said when introducing the GST-in fact, it promised-that residents of retirement villages in an aged care residential setting were to receive a range of living and accommodation services GST free. I will go back, if I may, to 1999, when there were a couple of indications that we should have been able to believe that. The first is an extract from a letter of 8 March 1999 to the Retirement Village Association of Australia from the office of the Prime Minister. In part, it says: Services similar to those provided under the Aged Care Act 1997 will also be GST Free where they are determined by the Minister for Aged Care to be of a kind covered by the Quality of Care Principles. This means care provided to residents of retirement Villages will be GST Free where the services are determined by the Minister to be eligible. Then, in April 1999-the next month-a Senate committee report on the GST and A New Tax System said: DHACthe Department of Health and Aged Careadvised the Committee that where a retirement complex is providing nursing or daily living assistance to some of its residents, âthen the accommodation and meals provided, in addition to the nursing and daily living assistance will be GST-free for those residents if the Minister has determined that those services are of a kind covered by Schedule 1 to the Quality of Care Principles'. We had a very similar third quote from the office of the Minister for Aged Care on 21 April of the same year: All residents of retirement villages who receive nursing or personal care (assistance with tasks of daily living such as bathing and dressing) will not GST on fees and charges for their care, meals and accommodation. In addition, residents who are receiving nursing or personal care will not pay GST on maintenance fees (body corporate fees), as these fees are part of their accommodation costs. So from the very beginning we, the sector and the community were led to believe that, in the circumstances which are affected by this bill, the GST would not in fact be applicable. Then, in June 2000, we saw the then Minister for Aged Care, Bronwyn Bishop, present a ministerial determination that specified the services that could be GST free if the resident required and received daily living allowance. I have had a look at that, and that is another piece of historic interest. It seems, however, that there remained some definitional issues. The ATO decided to review the situation and conducted a GST review of retirement villages in about February 2003. It is fair to say that that was in consultation with the sector. It is no surprise that the sector became pretty concerned when they saw the direction emanating from that review, and they began asking questions and outlining their concerns. The ATO concluded that living in serviced apartments in aged care facilities does not differ from living in your own home. That was their view at the time. They went ahead and prepared a draft ruling to deny GST-free status to supported living assistance and accommodation services. Interestingly, the Treasurer withheld that ruling. That draft ruling was not made available at the time, as I understand it. Some in the sector were concerned enough that they started paying the GST in fear of penalties that could possibly occur in the future, should that ruling literally come into place. The people who were making that decision-the people who were going to possibly be affected by such a new rulingwere, it is probably fair to say, part of the consultation process: working with the ATO, giving advice, doing the best they could to try and make sure that it was clearly understood. Some of them erred on the side of caution. We demand that the people who run these sorts of institutions, facilities and organisatax tions actually do show financial responsibility, and so they thought they were doing the right thing. Some of them, I understand, did in fact begin to charge their residents and to pay a GST or at least have the money there for it. Others, however, held out, in the hope I guess that sense would prevail and that the GST status would remain as they understood it. The sector were very concerned at the uncertainty-the lack of clear decision from the government in relation to this issue. Their agitation led us in the opposition to start raising serious questions. On 10 August, the then shadow Treasurer, the member for Hotham, asked a question in this place of the Treasurer, seeking clarification on this very issue. In part, that question said: I refer to the government's promise that the GST would not apply to living and accommodation services provided to elderly residents living in serviced apartments in retirement villages. â¦ â¦ â¦ Is the Treasurer aware that, in December 2003 and June 2004, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer wrote to the member for Petrie confirming that the Australian tax office was preparing a draft ruling on this matter which contravened government policy and implied support for this change? In reply, the Treasurer thanked the member for the question and gave the normal sort of introduction to his answer. Then he went on to say: Retirement village residents in serviced apartments and independent living units are not GST free. That is the legislation and that is the policy which the government announced. The ruling in relation to the applicable act turns on whether or not a person is living in a retirement village or independent living as opposed to living in residential aged care. He concluded by saying: Those taxpayers who wish clarification from the office of course are entitled to seek it, and the tax office is willing to give assistance in relation to those definitions. It seems that the Treasurer may possibly have pre-empted the ATO ruling, because we must remember that that draft ruling, as far as I understand it, had not been released by the Treasurer. It was not public at the time. What did we see then? We then saw Minister Brough trotted out. He was forced to come out with a press release on 13 August, indicating that the government would legislate to ensure that these services remained GST free. And now, here we are in December 2004 with this bill-which of course we will be supporting but which we should never have needed in the first place if clarifishare cation of definition had been incorporated into the original legislation. We are supporting it; however, there are some concerns remaining with regard to two elements of the bill. Firstly, the bill empowers the aged care minister to specify the level of care needed to qualify for GST-free supplies. We share the concerns of the sector that the level of care could be specified as being so high that it would be too onerous for an operator to provide-and possibly too expensive for the self-funding resident to pay-despite its having GST-free status. Secondly, the bill empowers the minister to specify the process by which the requisite level of care for GST-free services is assessed. It is expected-although not known-that the ACATs, the aged care assessment teams, who currently assess residents' eligibility for government funded places, may be given this job. The sector suggests that this be delegated not to the ACAT but to a doctor or a registered nurse. I tend to agree with the sector on this. It seems a far preferable way to go to ask a doctor or a registered nurse involved with the person concerned to do that sort of assessment. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and anybody in this parliament who deals with their community on aged care matters understand very clearly the pressures that ACATs are under. They already have a very onerous load. It is fair to say that, to varying degrees around the country, depending upon their locality and demographics, in most cases they already have a very heavy load and, in some cases, sadly, a bit of a backlog in the normal assessment work that they have to do to determine whether or not a person is eligible for a government funded aged care place anyway. I do not really believe that this is of a high enough order, in the sense of the work ACATs do, to ask them to do it. I tend to the concerns of the sector and agree with my colleagues that maybe a doctor or registered nurse who would be well informed on the person concerned could possibly do that work. Let us not weigh down the ACATs any more than they are; they already have a very important role to facilitate. I understand that we will be considering amendments to hopefully address those concerns, possibly not here but in the Senate. They are worthy amendments and should be seriously considered by government. This bill, as I said at the outset, clarifies the situation. Importantly, it corrects an outcome that we should never have seen. I very much feel for the sector and for the people within it who attempt to offer services and serviced apartment accommodation for our elderly residents, without having what is virtually a bureaucratic nightmare put upon them in addition. I welcome the bill for the fact that it is going to clarify and correct a situation. I repeat my comment that it should never have been needed in the first place. I am hoping that, with common sense and a bit of clarity, the government will support the amendments that we put forward in the other place and ensure that there are no further problems following the passage of this bill in relation to the administration of the issue at hand.",95
164,Mr HATTON,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am delighted to be following my colleagues on this side of the House in this debate. First of all I want to say that I am thankful to the member for Shortland for moving up the speaking order because when I was due to speak I was in fact in the chair. I am only able to speak on this bill because she was able to assist. The Tax Laws Amendment (Retirement Villages) Bill 2004 is not a complex bill. It is not a difficult set of propothe sitions involved within this. But it is a necessary bill largely because the Australian Taxation Office has acted, from 2003 and through 2004, in a way in which it commonly acts in regard to a whole range of activities: if it moves, tax it. If you need certainty in regard to fine definitions, then you can be sure that somewhere in the Australian tax office there is a section working on bringing forward a new draft ruling. Given that the fundamental job of the Australian tax office is to protect the revenue of the Commonwealth, much of what they do is entirely laudable. But you have to wonder about this one in terms of what they were up to. What was the driving force behind this draft ruling? I do not know. As far as I know, none of the speakers who have spoken to this bill, either on the government side or the opposition side, know what the fundamental driving force of this was. Was there evident within the sector a series of examples of people setting out to effectively defraud the Commonwealth of moneys properly owing to it because they had set up their aged care facilities in such a way that they could have argued that certain parts of them-the serviced apartments they provided, whether part of the existing way in which the facility was run or proposed large, new tracts of serviced apartments to be plonked down-would become GST free? Was there in fact an incentive for them to do it? I do not know. It will be interesting to hear in the reply from the minister or the parliamentary secretary what really was the fundamental cause of the government and its relevant subset, the Australian Taxation Office, putting this clarification ruling into place in the first place. Why was it delayed so long? Secondly, in a fundamentally related question, why has it taken so long for the government to fix it? Listening to other speakers dealing with these matters and listening to the answer that Treasurer made in regard to this, a number of things occurred to me. In terms of what happened in August 2004, when the Treasurer effectively turned on its head what had been the government's position in relation to the GST effect on people living in residential care-a position that had been evident since 2000-it has been indicated by the member for Canberra and others that it seems as though that was a mistake. It seems as though the Treasurer had been acting on advance advice from his department concerning what the draft ruling would bring into effect but that at the time had not been announced publicly. When the Treasurer gave his answer to a question from the member for Hotham, I am pretty sure that people in the aged sector were aghast at what they heard. It was confirmation of what a number of people in the sector had been saying from December 2003 through to June 2004: firstly, that the taxation office was preparing to change the way things had operated since 2000; secondly, that that would be detrimental to the running of aged care facilities; and, thirdly, that that detriment could be so grave that they were prospectively making a series of changes to cough up the GST for those services. A thought occurred to me regarding the Treasurer's reply on 10 August 2004 to the question from the member for Hotham. The member for Hotham said: I refer to the government's promise that the GST would not apply to living and accommodation services provided to elderly residents living in serviced apartments in retirement villages. He mentioned reports of a gentleman from the Retirement Villages Association who had stated: â¦ as a result of uncertainty arising from the Australian tax office's deliberations on a draft ruling on this matter, some retirement villages are already being advised to start making provision for this GST impost. The member for Hotham went on to say that, over a period of six months or so: â¦ the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer wrote to the member for Petrie confirming that the Australian tax office was preparing a draft ruling on this matter which contravened government policy and implied support for this change. My memory is that the former member for Parramatta was serving as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer at that time. The former member for Parramatta would be aware of the circumstances at Courtlands Retirement Village, given that (1) it is in his electorate and (2) I know for certain that he visited the village a number of timesindeed, he visited it in the presence of the aged care minister. He would have known at that time that that complex, run by Manchester Unity, had a nursing home facility, that it had an original set of independent-living apartments, that it also had hostel type accommodation-and this is the key in terms of what we are dealing with here-and that a number of additions to this complex had taken place over time and were still in progress. Manchester Unity reinvested in the complex. They created more independentliving areas. In the latest tranche, they also increased what I would term the old-style hostel accommodation and self-serviced apartments. Given his awareness of what the practical situation was, I wonder whether the then member for Parramatta and the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer took counsel from the people running that complex, because in this situation there was an increase in the number of independent-living areas that were serviced apartments. If the ATO thought, either in relation to this or other complexes, that there was some kind of rort being built up, an extension beyond what was previously there, maybe that gave rise to the Treasurer's answer. I know for a fact that the addition of those services at Courtlands had been directly related to meeting demand. It is a very well-run complex, and it is run effectively on a non-profit basis. Part of this legislation deals with charitable institutions or not-for-profit activities, such as those at Courtlands in North Parramatta, in the former parliamentary secretary's electorate, and, in my electorate, at the Bankstown Frail Aged Persons Trust, which runs a series of different activities in one complex and is associated with four other complexes which provide hostel accommodation. Shivers would have gone up the spines of the people in Bankstown and Parramatta after the Treasurer's answer to this question without notice. A number of members have quoted it, but it is chilling, so I will quote again: Retirement village residents in serviced apartments and independent living units are not GST free. That is the legislation and that is the policy which the government announced. Is it the legislation? The legislation in 2000 said that people in independent-living units would not be GST free, but I am pretty sure that the Minister for Aged Care and the Treasurer said at the time that if you were living in a serviced apartment in one of those complexes you would be GST free. The Treasurer went on: The ruling in relation to the applicable act turns on whether or not a person is living in a retirement village or independent living as opposed to living in residential aged care. He went on to attempt to clarify this but I think he made it more mystifying for just about everybody. He said: The tax office and, indeed, the law look at numbers of indicia to decide the difference in relation to those matters. Various rulings have been given and the legislation has been drawn accordingly. Those taxpayers who wish clarification from the tax office of course are entitled to seek it, and the tax office is willing to give assistance in relation to those definitions. The Treasurer was in fact wrong in relation to the legislation that he was responsible for. This bloke is supposed to know the GST act up, down, sideways and inside out but he was wrong in point of fact and he was wrong in point of principle. Given that he had charge of bringing this into being, he should have understood that it is not enough. Given that there had been all that activity from December 2003 to June 2004 with the ATO setting up a draft ruling and with the parliamentary secretary informing the member for Petrie that there was a ruling coming contrary to the government's legislation, what kind of performance is this from the Treasurer? Did he pick up the wrong briefing? Was this the one that was supposed to come out after the federal election rather than before? Was the draft ruling, which had been so long in preparation, expected to have its effect after the election that we had in October 2004? When did they have it set down to be put into place? Three days after the Treasurer said this, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Mr Brough, quickly came out to correct the record. That is enormously speedy as far as the government are concerned. What did he state? He did not say the Treasurer was wrong, but his media release stipulated that, from 2000 when the GST came in, government policy had always been that people in this condition would not have that impost, that it would not be expected to be imposed in the future, that this is what the government always meant and that anyone who does not think that way is misled. In fact, over a period of six months, the Treasurer and his parliamentary secretary caused the people running the Manchester Unity complex at Courtlands in North Parramatta, and the people running the Bankstown Frail Aged Persons Trust in my electorate, and everyone else in the community to say, âWhat do we do here? We know this is coming. We know that it is not right, based on our experience, but prospectively we have to start paying the GST on these services because otherwise we're going to be in a position where we have not provided for that and there may in fact be impost of penalties on top of it.' What is the poor person in a hostel to do? The fundamental reason for this is that we are not just dealing with the application of an extremely complex GST and a series of arrangements associated with it; we are dealing with the effects of the government's aged care policy. I well remember when the member for Mackellar was the minister in charge of this area. The member for Mackellar brought in a policy based on the notion of ageing in place. Ageing in place was a new concept. Whilst Labor had been in government, we had a tripartite approach to looking after people in the community. We recognised that people were inappropriately being put into nursing homes which had been underfunded and which had not been properly rebuilt in the period prior to 1983. There was very poor provision and people who should not have been in nursing homes were thrown in there inappropriately. We said that we were not going to cop any of that. One of the great changes we made was to say that those people who perforce, because of their individual health and circumstances, had to go into a nursing home would do so only on advice received from health professionals and they would get the best care possible for people in their situation. But we said that, wherever possible, we would ensure that people would be able to live in their own homes. In fact, 96 per cent of the population could stay in their own homes and be supported if we actually brought the services to them. We then increased the provision of hostels by 15 per cent each year. The hostels operate like serviced apartments: there is a total living service, with provision for meals and for laundry-either heavy or light, depending upon a person's particular needs during the week. That approach of having three different divisions was abolished by this government. They followed the private sector and said, âWhat we really want is no distinction whatsoever in the type of care available to people.' All they left out was the situation of a person living independently in their own apartment within a retirement village such as Courtlands. A large number of people live in such a situation. What the government would like to achieve in a complex like that is to have a person stay in the one place, occupy the same bed in the same place. The original intention was to say, âOnce you take a place, that is yours and we will provide the services, whether those services are for independent living or for hostel-like accommodation-a fully serviced apartment and someone taking care of your basic necessities, or, if necessary, nursing home provision in situ.' In practice, what has happened? They have not really gone that far in most instances, because not every complex is run in the same way as that run by the Morans.",97
165,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,I gently remind the member for Blaxland that he might like to return to the substance of the bill.,101
166,Mr HATTON,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"With respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, I could not be more accurately dealing",101
167,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,I am listening carefully.,101
168,Mr HATTON,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I know you are. Indeed, you have not spoken on this bill, but I have done the research in relation to it. Having sat in the chair recently and having listened to members of the government and the opposition, these matters are entirely germane. The fundamental problem is that what we did in government compared to the ageing in place approach that this government has adopted has led to this very imposition where the Treasurer has said he would turn the policy upside down. Luckily, the former minister, Minister Brough, announced a set of changes prior to the last election that meant that those people living in hostel-like accommodation, in serviced apartments, would be assured that they would be able to stay there and that they would be able to stay there GST-free. He had to save the Treasurer and the government from the consequences of a draft ruling that had been tossed around for six months. Labor's approach to this is expressed in our amendment, which criticises the government for taking so long, leading to a great deal of uncertainty for people in the sector, who, through time and effort, have not only made provision for the GST but had to pay the GST. This bill retrospectively provides that, going back to the year 2000, the entities that coughed up the GST when they should not have should be repaid. This is a repair job that the government has had to do because of the inappropriate redefinition of people living in this situation. Other members on this side, particularly the member for Rankin, have pointed out the fact that the other complexities involved in this bill go to the very nature of the GST itself. It is like the medieval practice of trying to work out how many angels you could fit on the head of a pin. Is this in fact a serviced apartment? Should these services be GST free? Is there a provision for heavy laundry rather than light laundry? This matter has not been put in the hands of tax inspectors but in the hands of representatives of the minister, either through an aged care assessment team or other mechanisms. The overarching question is whether a determination should be made not on the basis of need, but on the basis of needs. Whether a facility be at Bankstown or north Parramatta, if a person takes up an aged care place in hostel-like accommodation-in fully serviced apartments, as with the Courtlands Retirement Village-should that simply be established or should someone make an assessment of the needs of a person on an individual basis? This is a complexification of the whole issue for a person living in one of these retirement homes. They have not needed the grief that has been associated with the great uncertainty. The people running these entities should not have had to bear the grief that has been associated with this situation. The government should have acted quickly. It should have acted resolutely. At last it has. We support the fundamental approach now evident. (Time expired)",101
169,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak to the Tax Laws Amendment (Retirement Villages) Bill 2004 and in particular to support the amendment moved by my colleague the member for Hunter-whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, Labor condemns the government for failing to correct the tax anomaly earlier, leading to significant stress and suffering on elderly Australians. In terms of setting the background to the bill before us, is unquestionably the case that we live in an age where seismic shifts in human health and longevity have created the need for new concepts and ways of caring for one another into our older age. As a burgeoning sector, retirement villages have stepped into this fray of our ageing demographic, becoming a key facet in the accommodation mix for many senior and retired people living not only within my own electorate of Wills but right around Australia. The theory of retirement villages is that they exist to fill a need that all people have, but especially as we age, for social belonging and security. In the face of changing family and community structures, retirement village living is fast becoming an integral part of the aged housing continuum. The latest data on the retirement living sector presented in the November edition of the journal Healthcare indicates that there are approximately 1,800 operators of retirement villages in Australia, offering 70,000 units or meeting about six per cent of the accommodation needs for people aged between 70 and 80 years. The national data on our ageing population reveals that by 2020 17 per cent of Australia's population will be 65 years and over. It does seem obvious that Australia is facing a crisis in aged care and that meeting the housing needs of our ageing population will become a foremost policy challenge for this century. I hear the Treasurer from time to time talking about the challenge of the ageing demographic and the ageing population. You have to ask just why on earth it was that this government, when it came to office, abandoned plans for the co-contributions and prevented us moving forward from nine per cent to 15 per cent. In my own electorate of Wills we have been experiencing acute accommodation shortages in aged care for some time. In it Wills, 16.5 per cent of the population is aged 65 years plus. Funding cutbacks in this sector and onerous administrative burdens on providers, coupled with a lack of suitable infrastructure to construct new aged care facilities and higher returns available on alternative types of development, have resulted in a very serious deficit in the number of places available for people when they age and can no longer independently meet all of their care needs. In the light of the increasing significance of the retirement village sector in meeting the accommodation demand from our ageing population, it becomes clear just how crucial it is to get the policy responses governing their operation right. Unfortunately, growth in this sector has outpaced legislation. Tonight we are dealing with an example of growth having outpaced legislation when it comes to the application of the GST, leading to the confusion that this bill is seeking to deal with. There has been quite unacceptable uncertainty about the way in which the GST is applied to so many of the services people living in serviced apartments in retirement villages receive. One has to wonder, though, whether we can be all that surprised that operators and residents in retirement villages are confused when the federal Treasurer himself does not even know how to apply the GST in this case. We should just take a moment to look at the performance-the confused and confusing performance-of the federal Treasurer on this issue. We know how much this federal government love to tax the people of Australia, but in their eagerness to tax, tax, tax, federal Treasurer took a unilateral decision to extend the GST to residents in serviced apartments. The federal Treasurer, rather than issuing proper advice to the operators and residents of retirement villages, saw fit to come into this House, back on 10 August, and declare that services provided to those residents in serviced apartments were not GST free. This kind of âshow me the money' approach that was taken would have slugged elderly residents in serviced retirement village apartments yet again, leaving them to figure out how they were to pay for this announcement with their meagre pensions and savings. For someone who is pegging his leadership credentials on the ability to run the economy and his ability to lead the policy debate on managing intergenerational change in Australia, this was a very worrying announcement. Fortunately, the federal government has now seen the light on this issue and heeded calls from Labor and elsewhere to address the inconsistencies present in this sector. This is a positive step and I welcome the federal government once again following Labor's policy lead. I particularly welcome it on behalf of my constituents who were facing massive and unsustainable blow-outs in their GST bills because of the federal Treasurer's inability or difficulty in applying his own taxation laws. As I said before, there are a number of retirement villages in my electorate of Wills, including Federation Village and Pascoe Vale Gardens Retirement Village. In addition to these facilities, many of my constituents have moved into nearby retirement villages in surrounding electorates. The development of these retirement villages has brought with them a number of new challenges-most particularly, concerns over the fee structure that residents pay and serious issues over whether services in these villages meet the prepurchase promises. That is an area that the my office and I have been investigating in response to complaints and, perhaps on another occasion, I may wish to draw to the attention of the House some of the shortcomings that I think exist in this sector from a consumer affairs perspective, in terms of the rights of people living in retirement villages, whether those rights are always being adequately respected and whether residents have an appropriate say in the decision making processes of the retirement villages. One of the other constant themes that constituents have come to me about in relation to retirement village living concerns the complete confusion that residents have been in when determining what they are obliged to pay the federal government in GST. An example of this occurred very recently, coincidentally, when I was informed by a constituent that he was facing an increase in his GST bill from $11,000 to $48,000 per year. A $37,000 GST bill increase is an extraordinary increase for people on a limited income. The constituent who wrote to me asked me a very simple question: whether GST is applicable on serviced apartments in retirement villages? One can only imagine the level of uncertainty residents in retirement villages have been feeling, faced with such massive increases in their GST liability. Despite this, we have had the federal Treasurer offering these people advice which has turned out to be incorrect. I am very keen to tell my constituent who has written to me seeking clarification of how GST is applied that we have in the federal parliament this legislation which we hope will resolve the inconsistencies. Unfortunately, there are people in retirement villages who have been incorrectly paying GST. Indeed, some of them may not even live to see their hard-earned money refunded. It is, frankly, just not good enough that residents may never get the chance to recoup the money that they have paid mistakenly, but this is the reality of the situation; this is the government has created through its inability to legislate to end the ambiguity. If it were not for Labor highlighting the problem, I have no doubt that the federal government still would not have got it right. There are some issues with this legislation which I think ought to be addressed before we can be assured that the best law has been passed. It may well be that this bill ought to be referred to a Senate committee for further consideration. One of the concerns that I understand stakeholders in the retirement living sector have with this legislation is that this bill could create problems for aged care assessment services. The federal government have never really understood the crisis in aged care, so it is not surprising that they might be ignorant of problems that would be created by demanding aged care assessment teams complete the evaluation of residents needing daily living assistance and thus qualifying for GST-free status. I understand, however, that the sector would like other health care professionals such as medical doctors and nurses to be given authority to make such appraisals. I understand that the sector would like amendments to ensure that the level of care needed to qualify for GST-free status would be so high that it would be too onerous for retirement village operators to provide such services and that it could be too costly for residents who are self funded to pay for. Government has, for quite some time, been advocating the concept of residents ageing in place. Informal evidence from providers of aged accommodation in my electorate tells me that it is preferable to minimise the disruption to people as they age that is caused through continually having to shift. That is what they need to be aiming for. This, along with the fact that Australia has an ageing population, means that there needs to be an increasing emphasis on providing a what range of accommodation options for the elderly. For the sake of affected residents now and to ensure the protection of future residents, to assist operators struggling to correctly apply the complex GST legislation and to ensure the retirement living sector has a sustainable basis on which to develop, we need to take action to ensure that the best legislation is enacted. I hope that the government will take Labor's suggestions very seriously indeed. This is an area of great complexity. If one looks at the detail of the bill, one cannot help but be reminded of just what a red-tape nightmare the GST has been. It has been here for over three years. I guess there are many Australians who are not directly involved with it-they experience it of course as consumers, and it has played a great role in rolling in the money for the federal government-but in terms of the sort of work and the obligations that it places on those, such as the small businesses, who have to deal with it directly, it really is quite remarkable how complex it is and, for something that we were promised would simplify our taxation system, just how difficult it is to understand and comply with. If we look at some of the material that has been provided to us concerning the retirement villages legislation, we can see what a remarkably complex piece of legislation it is. Section 38-25 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 sets out the conditions when a supply of residential care services is GST-free. The provisions in this section are as follows: 3) A supply of services is GST-free if: (a) the services are provided to one or more aged or disabled people in a residential setting; and (b) the Aged Care Minister has determined in writing that the services covered by Schedule 1 to the Quality of Care Principles; and (c) the services include, and are only provided to people who require, the services set out in: (i) item 2.1 (daily living activities sistance) of Part 2 of that Schedule; or (ii) item 3.8 (nursing services) of Part of that Schedule. The question then is: how has the tax office interpreted this section of the act? The tax office has come good with an interpretative decision. ATO ID 2001/664 was made on 30 November 2001. The issue before the commissioner was whether a retirement village was eligible for GST-free supply when it supplied meals to residents in independentliving units. The tax commissioner ruled that the supply of residential care must satisfy the following criteria: - the care recipient is aged or disabled and receiving the care services in a residential setting; and - the services provided to the care recipient satisfy the Aged Care Minister's Determination under paragraph 38-25(3)(b) of the GST Act; and - the services include, and are only provided to people who require the services set out in item 2.1 or item 3.8 of Schedule 1 to the Quality of Care Principles. That is great; we have a ruling from the tax office. However, we also note that the expression âresidential setting' is not itself defined in the GST act, so the interpretative decision of the tax office sought to equate the meaning of âresidential setting' with an inferred meaning of âresidential facility' in the Aged Care Act 1997. The tax office said that the justification for that interpretation was: Section 38-25 of the GST Act refers to principles made under the Aged Care Act 1997. Therefore, it is permissible to consult the Aged Care Act 1997 ... to determine the meaning of the term âresidenare of a kind tial setting'. They decided therefore that it had: ...a similar meaning to âresidential facility' in the Aged Care Act 1997. You can imagine just how people who are as- engaged in retirement villages, charitable retirement villages and the like struggle in the application of complex provisions like 3 this and in the application of complex pieces of taxation legislation such as this. The opposition certainly hopes that this legislation will achieve its intended objective, which is to clarify ambiguities in existing laws and ensure that supplies of living and accommodation services to residents in serviced apartments and retirement villages are GST free and to clarify that certain supplies will receive GST-free treatment when made by a charitable institution or a trustee of a charitable fund to a resident of a retirement village. It is a situation which has been quite unsatisfactory. The current law has been encumbered by definitional problems. It has been unclear what a serviced apartment in a retirement village is and what an independent-living unit is. The latter are not GST free and there is no intention to make them so. Those units are essentially private houses but, in a residential aged-care complex, residents have communal facilities like meals areas and it has been unclear whether these were independent-living units or not, so we hope that some of these problems will be sorted out. We want to ensure that this uncertainty is ended. We do take some pride in having forced the government to make what we regard as a socially responsible legislative change and we hope that the government will seek to ensure that people in retirement villages do not have the ongoing uncertainty of an ongoing GST liability. We hope that this government takes more steps to make the GST legislation simpler and easier to work with for those in small business and in areas such as this, who have the very difficult task of working with the legislation and putting it into practice.",102
170,Mr BROUGH,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I thank all the members who contributed to the debate tonight and yesterday. I also want to place on record my thanks to the industry members, who were very constructive in formulating these amendments and ensuring they reflect the needs of the industry-such an important industry to the welfare of so many Australians-and my appreciation of the constructive manner in which they dealt with the departmental officials. The Tax Laws Amendment (Retirement Villages) Bill 2004 does make some minor amendments to the A New Tax System to remove public uncertainty and came about basically because of a potential Australian Taxation Office ruling that may have had the effect of changing the GST treatment for some residents. That uncertainty needed to be clarified. Much has been said tonight by members opposite and I thought that I would read into Hansard an extract of one of the responses that I received from state treasurers and premiers in relation to this issue, because, as I hope most members opposite know-and the public should know-anything that the government tries to do in relation to adjusting the taxation base of the GST must have the unanimous support of all states, and that goes to measures such as these. So when the government made the decision to clarify this issue as a result of the potential ATO ruling, I wrote to all of the states seeking their support for these clarifications. The Hon. John Brumby, Treasurer of Victoria, put it succinctly when he said in his letter of September of this year: Given the proposed amendments will clarify the original policy intent of the legislation and ensure that GST treatment continues to apply to accommodation and services provided to residents of serviced apartments in retirement villages and to residents of charitable retirement villages, Victoria provides approval for these amendments. That basically says it all: these amendments are about clarifying the original policy intent. I think it has escaped some of those opposite that, in fact, when the government makes law and publishes its explanatory memoranda, from time to time the ATO will interpret that in a way which was clearly not part of the original intent put down by the government. This is not something unique to this government. I am sure that members of the opposition, in their time in the previous government, probably had similar circumstances occur from time to time. It is frustrating, and it forces us to come back into this place to clarify the intent so that people can have that stability in and confirmation of the decisions they are making. I would like to make a couple of comments on some of the issues raised by members opposite, because they go to the heart of what we are trying to achieve here. The member for Rankin, for argument's sake, was talking about the âneed' or âwant'-they were the two terms he used-in relation to residents wanting or requiring serviced apartments because they needed to be receiving daily assisted living. This law is not about whether an individual wants to receive that care; it is about those that need that That is the fundamental issue. I guess the member for Blaxland had a similar sentiment when, at the end of his address, he was referring to whether it is a need-in other words, if an individual is to move into a serviced apartment, should they, by definition, then immediately become GST free. Can I assure the members opposite, particularly the member for Blaxland and the member for Rankin, that to do so would be to open up the uncertainty that we are here trying to clarify tonight. It would open up two sets of arrangements for people in similar circumstances-one group being treated differently in having a GST-free component when they had no need for that extra level of care but had simply made a lifestyle choice. This is not about a lifestyle choice; this is about treating like for like-those people in assisted accommodation, those people in traditional forms of aged care facilities commonly referred to as hostels or, in similar circumstances, those people who have been deemed in need of assisted care. It is very important that we remove that uncertainty. I want to ensure that the members for Rankin and Blaxland and those others who sit opposite understand what they are actually advocating when they start to go down the blurred path of allowing personnel to reside in serviced apartments and gain GSTfree access to food, accommodation and other services when there is no need for that. The long-term ramification depends on where you draw the line. This legislation draws the line in treating like for like as best we can. I know it will be welcomed throughout the industry. To do what members opposite were referring to would be to add yet another leak to the revenue base. We are talking about fiscal responsibility and the need for economic responsibility and, obviously, the public will have noted the lack of such care. responsibility that has been applied by the opposition. The ALP need to take these issues very seriously when they are looking to speak to these bills and develop policy of their own. The other main part of this bill concerns the charitable sector. It has not been spoken about much but it is a significant contributor to the retirement village and aged care sector. Retirement villages operated by the charitable sector receive GST concessions in relation to accommodation, related services and meals if they meet certain guidelines, and they always have. This bill protects that treatment and provides certainty. Of course, these measures build on the range of measures the government is committed to which recognise the contributions of senior Australians and the issues faced by retirement home residents. The government has announced a comprehensive package of programs involving more financial support and respite for carers and exempting accommodation bonds, paid by people entering low-level care hostels or homes, from the social security and veterans' affairs assets tests until the bonds are refunded. These measures complement other government initiatives such as making dementia a national health priority and increasing home support for people living with dementia, 100 per cent Medicare, and the increased private health insurance rebate for people aged 65 to 69. Much of tonight's debate has in fact centred around an answer given by the Treasurer in this place on 10 August to a question from the member for Hotham which was trying to make out that the Treasurer somehow did not understand the legislation or had in fact misrepresented the legislation. The words he used were: Retirement village residents in serviced apartments and independent living units are not GST free. That is absolutely correct. The distinguishing factor as to whether or not an individual receives GST-free treatment is not whether or not they are in a retirement village or a serviced apartment: it is whether they are in a retirement village or a serviced apartment and have been assessed as being in need of daily living assistance. Of course, for political purposes I guess that has escaped those opposite, but it is important to place it on the record. There was also much ranting and raving tonight about the complexities of the GST. The fact is that I do not recall the ALP taking to the recent election a policy to abolish the GST or to change it in any substantial way at all, if at all. And yet, tonight, here they are ranting and raving about a policy which is in fact Labor Party policy and coalition policy-this is not something that either party in this place actually differs on in relation to the implementation and going forward of the GST. In closing, I would like to congratulate the member for Bowman. Even when he was still a candidate he was advocating for the sector and, in particular, a gentleman whose case had been brought to the media's attention. The uncertainty raised by a potential ATO ruling was causing some real concern for this individual. This bill will bring the clarity that is required to the sector. It will provide clarity not only to the residents but also to the charitable sector, which plays such a significant and important role in housing so many of our valuable elderly Australian citizens. I commend the bill to the House.",106

JAMES HARDIE (INVESTIGATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS) BILL 2004 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 December, on motion by Mr Costello: That this bill be now read a second time.",109
175,Mr SWAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"If there was ever a bill introduced into this parliament that protects the common good, that is necessary to protect the essence of our wealth creation, that is necessary to ensure the essence of a civilised society, that is necessary to protect fairness and justice, it is the James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Bill 2004. Speaking for many on this side of the House, and I am sure for some on the other side, there could be no bill in Australian public life that goes more to the heart of what we must be about in public life, which is to look after the interests of those people who go out there, day in, day out, and work hard to bring up and protect their families and provide them with a quality of life to which they aspire not only for their children but also for future generations. To find that that can be taken away by such chicanery, by such negligence and by such viciousness in corporate affairs demonstrates that the role of this parliament in protecting the common good is important to each and every one of us, particularly to those in the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement who are in politics because we need to protect the livelihood and health of those people who make this country great. Those are the people BILL 2004 this bill is here to protect. James Hardie has done everything to avoid its responsibilities to asbestos sufferers in one of the most repugnant acts in Australia's corporate history. In no way does it reflect the current move to embrace the principles of international, corporate social responsibility. Everything that James Hardie has done is completely in the opposite direction to what a modern society and modern economy must be about-that is, responsible business conduct. Corporate social responsibility may be a term used in our national discussion, but James Hardie has demonstrated that it has not taken root in our national consciousness. That is why this bill is necessary today. We look to business to create wealth and jobs, to provide goods and services and to help meet our expectations and aspirations for an improved quality of life. Corporate activity is not just about narrow measures of economic progress and financial performance. It also has wider impacts on society and the environment. I believe that government has an absolute responsibility to set market frameworks, to address market failures and to regulate responsible behaviourall crucial components in creating an effective, modern economy and an equitable modern society. Corporate social responsibility cannot be just a marketing tool, a good public relations device or some green washing exercise. Corporate social responsibility must lie at the heart of a modern company's core beliefs. It plays a role in developing improved social and economic governance and improving living and working conditions, as well as enhancing a company's competitiveness. In short, from the chief executive in the boardroom to the worker on the front line, corporate social responsibility must be ingrained in the ethos of every business. However, these principles have not been of any interest to James Hardie. Despite announcing a first quarter profit this year of $US37 million and predicting an annual profit of up to $US169 million-and giving a massive payout of millions of dollars to its former CEO, Peter Macdonald, and granting him ongoing consultancy fees-the company has been negligent in discharging its responsibilities to workers and exceptionally callous and insensitive to asbestos victims' claims. Of course, there is an extensive background to this. James Hardie has engaged in a complex corporate structure, separating subsidiary companies with liabilities and transferring assets offshore to a Dutchregistered legal entity. James Hardie also established the Medical Research and Compensation Foundation to deal with the claims of all victims of asbestos related diseases against the various companies comprising James Hardie. Despite the clear public assurances of James Hardie officers that the foundation was sufficiently funded to meet all its liabilities, it has become clear that a substanDavid tial funding shortfall exists, currently estimated to be in excess of $1.5 billion. Despite the government's continued attack on the relevance and the role of the trade union movement, it has been the trade union movement that has led the response to the community's outrage over the lack of responsibility and accountability of James Hardie and its executives. ACTU secretary, Greg Combet, recently put it like this: Nothing in my working life has upset me as much as James Hardie's attempt to walk away from people who are suffering disease and death because of exposure to the company's asbestos products. It highlights a disconnection between commercial decisions and morality which is sickening. I can assure people who are suffering or who have a family member who is suffering, the union movement will not be letting this issue go. This is the one of the largest exercises to avoid moral and legal obligations in Australian corporate history. The union movement is going to fight very hard for them for justice. The Labor Party strongly endorse these words, and we will continue to campaign with the union movement to achieve a just outcome for these people. The newly elected member for Parramatta has been at the forefront of this campaign. She has been a key player in putting this issue in the public eye. She has worked with local families in her community and has been lobbying, agitating and doing all the things a responsible local champion should be doing. It is a great tribute to her that she has been so effective in bringing these issues to the fore. Also, the New South Wales government has provided support for Hardie's victims from the beginning. Premier Carr and Attorney General Debus have applied constant pressure on Hardie management and used whatever appropriate means at their disposal to force their hand. The New South Wales government established a special commission of inquiry into James Hardie, conducted by Jackson QC. Adverse findings were made against various Hardie executives. Subsequently, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission announced it would fully investigate these matters. The importance of this bill is that it enhances the ability of ASIC or the DPP to undertake investigations and to take proceedings under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act against corporate bodies that are part of the James Hardie group and officers, employees or advisers of the James Hardie group. Without the measures provided for in this bill, we may never be able to establish the knowledge and intention of James Hardie's officers. Not only is there a public interest establishing these things; they are likely to be critical for determining whether any breaches of the law have occurred. There are alarming findings which arise from the Jackson inquiry and which urgently require further investigation by ASIC. This bill is imperative for the provision of the relevant authorities and the appropriate resources to investigate potentially misleading and deceptive conduct by James Hardie and its executives. Without this bill there simply cannot be any justice. That is why it is so critical that the federal government gets behind ASIC and provides resources so that we can get to the core of this problem. Then we can prosecute those people who are responsible for the ill health of so many Australians. We can prosecute for the negligent act of failing to provide for those people-once it has been established what the impact of this company's activities has been on the lives of so many Australian workers. They are the sorts of people who went to work to provide for their families, day in and day out, thinking that they were doing the right thing by the country, but all the time they were slowly killing themselves. This bill enables us to get to the heart of the injustice that has been perpetrated by some executives in this company, not just in recent times but over a prolonged period of time. It goes to the heart of why all of us in public life must seek justice. This bill partially delivers that. But it is only a mechanism on the way. We will cover a lot more territory in this endeavour to deliver justice for those poor employees of James Hardie who suffer so much today. That is why this House must fully support this bill and that is why the Australian Labor Party are very supportive of this bill. We welcome the initiative of the government in bringing it forward, but we say to the Treasurer, Mr Costello: âThere in is a long way to go as yet, and we look forward to your continued support.'",110
176,Mr BAIRD,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"On this occasion, in the debate on the James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Bill 2004, it is interesting to find that I agree with everything that I have heard the member for Lilley say. This is a matter of justice; it is a matter of the way that the James Hardie board treated the employees of the organisation. It is a national disgrace. I personally know the chairman, Meredith Hellicar, who replaced me in a job that I had at Esso. I find her to be a person of integrity, but obviously the challenge for her is the response of the company to this situation. I would like to see the company doing more. I would like to see that in her role she would be much more amenable- (Quorum formed) I am surprised at that call for a quorum to be formed. Both sides of the House agree on this particular bill. Why do we waste our time with these political frolics when we have the health and welfare of the former employees of James Hardie to consider? In reality, if you were serious about the welfare of the workers of James Hardie, why would you put on this political stunt right now? There was no objection to what was said by the member for Lilley. The member for Parramatta came in and the member for Lilley drew attention to the great work that she has done. That is terrific. But why would you put on this political frolic now of saying that a quorum needed to be formed? The situation is no different from what applies for much of the time. If we are going to be constructive in this House, let us stop the political frolics and get on with the real business. Let us start addressing the real issues that affect the workers of James Hardie. That is what we are here for; that is what this bill is about. In fact, I find it totally objectionable that the member for Shortland can come in and display this total political hypocrisy when we agree on this matter. So let us return to what we are about. The reality is that thousands of hard working Australians will be diagnosed with asbestos related illnesses over the next decade. This will add to the list of thousands of tralians who are already cast down, unable to breathe, let alone function in society, as a result of asbestos related diseases. It is now generally accepted that more than half of asbestos related disease sufferers are dead within eight months of diagnosis. That is why we are concerned. The fact is that many people as they operated in the sixties and seventies were not aware of the implication of asbestosis and the result that it would have on their health. There are many people around today whose health is in serious jeopardy and whose mortality is threatened as a result of exposure asbestos. This legislation refers to the compensation which is due to the sufferers of asbestosis. As a result of some international conniving, James Hardie, as we know, separated out the company that was responsible for the compensation of the organisation so that they would not hold the responsibility and could continue to operate. This will go down in the annals of Australian corporate history as one of the prime examples of what appropriate corporate governance is not about. In the 1970s when I was in MBA school we talked about appropriate standards of ethical behaviour for corporations. Nowand going back to the year 2000, and before that-we have seen a prime example of a corporation which does not meet its obligations in terms of ethical behaviour or in terms of its responsibility to employees. With this legislation, which was brought forward by the Treasurer, we have a provision that bypasses the legal protection that the company has and enables it to provide all the details of the legal aspects of its dealings with other companies, with its shareholders and with its employees so that an adequate review can be established of its responsibility before the law. What is involved is quite Aus- straightforward and quite simple, so that James Hardie is both financially and morally accountable for the damage it consciously caused to thousands of Australian families. On this very night there are many people around Australia with asbestos related illnesses as a result of their exposure to asbestos as a result of the actions, whether on a known basis or an unknown basis, of James Hardie. Looking at the corporate history, an awareness of the relationship between asbestosis and exposure to asbestos occurred in the seventies. If we trace through the responto sibility of the organisation, it begins at that point-it begins with the corporate responsibility of the boards over that time. The separation out of the organisation, when they moved to establish the company offshore, is what I find morally reprehensible-that they have done it with the express understanding that they would minimise their corporate exposure at the cost of the very livelihood of Australian families, Australians who are suffering because of their exposure to asbestos. The reality is that in most cases the employees of James Hardie were totally unaware of the implications, but we all know now. There was a clear and clinical understanding of what they were doing in moving the company offshore to separate out the organisation from this corporate responsibility. This bill will help to remove legal limitations that currently exist relating to legal professional privilege. These limitations currently inhibit a comprehensive investigation of the liability of the James Hardie group for the damage to the health of past employees. The changes under the bill will also facilitate the further investigation of matters arising from the James Hardie special commission of inquiry conducted in New South Wales by David Jackson QC, as well as future legal proceedings stemming from the investigation. The Jackson report specifically highlighted claims of improper conduct by several of James Hardie's officers and their former actuaries, Trowbridge Deloitte, in presenting false and misleading information under section 52 of the Trade Practices Act during the James Hardie group restructure in the period 2001-03. Under scrutiny are claims by the James Hardie group and Trowbridge Deloitte regarding the funding arrangements in place for the Medical Research and Compensation Foundation. The fund was created by the group to meet the claims of victims of asbestos related disease caused by the negligent practice of James Hardie. Specifically in question are claims that the funds provided by James Hardie to a value of $293 million were adequate for current and likely future claims by former employees of the organisation and its subsidiaries with asbestos related diseases. It is now estimated that a further funding outlay of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion will be necessary to meet the first round of compensation, with a further substantial outlay necessary in the near future as the predicted second and third rounds of those affected by asbestos related disease come to light. The bill will specifically enable the recovery of funds for the compensation of employees who were consciously subjected to conditions that resulted in incurable damage to their health directly from the very ganisations that most benefited from the conscious sacrifice of their employees' health and now seek to continue to profit from it. Firstly, this bill facilitates future investigation and prosecution of James Hardie. In order to ensure the obligations of James Hardie and related organisations to sufferers of asbestos related diseases are fulfilled, it will be essential that investigations of James Hardie be uninhibited as regards access to documentation and legal privilege. The investigation to be conducted by ASIC, as well as subsequent proceedings brought forward by ASIC or the Director of Public Prosecutions, must be able to access to all the documentation available to the Jackson inquiry and supporting its findings. The most important aspect is access to all documentation. No legal privilege will be enabled by this bill. Secondly, this bill specifically abrogates the obligation of legal professional privilege that exists for the application and acquisition of certain materials, allowing their use in the investigation of James Hardie and any related proceedings. The bill specifically covers the weaknesses and shortcomings of the legislation rushed through the New South Wales parliament related to the Jackson report. Finally, the type of documentation included in the reference in this bill to legal professional privilege specifically includes that documentation which relates to exchanges between the clients-in this case, James Hardie-and their legal representatives. The importance of the removal of these privileges is by no means taken lightly by the government but is seen as being in the overall best interests of the people, the sufferers, in Australia. It is vital to recognise those interests. There is also a need to have confidence in Corporations Law. Despite the fact that we or- want Australian corporations to operate on an effective basis and be subject to the normal legal requirements which allow them to protect themselves as organisations, in this particular case, where we have undoubtedly the worse case of corporate misgovernance to the detriment of thousands of Australians and their health, we need real action. We need the accountability and responsibility that this Treasurer and this government have taken. I am certainly pleased that the member for Lilley on behalf of the opposition has indicated the support of the opposition for this bill. We need to make a combined impact on the corporation so it recognises that the federal government and state governments around Australia are very serious about ensuring that the corporation meets its legal obligations. It is a great tragedy that the people who were exposed to asbestos are in this situation. No-one knew about it at the time. They bear the consequence on behalf of their organisation. In conclusion, we collectively express our great concern at the actions James Hardie have taken. We recognise that they are making attempts to restore confidence in the organisation. The company have had a strong and effective past and they are a great producer of products sold in the Australian marketplace. But this is about corporate morality and integrity. If they were serious they would have acted long ago and we would not have had this split in the organisation. It is priate that they be exposed to the full weight of investigation by ASIC and that all of the documentation be available for the investigators to review so as to determine the appropriate compensation for those people who have so unfairly contracted asbestosis and related diseases. These are very serious diseases that clearly result in death in most cases. On our side of the House we are very pleased with this legislation that the Treasurer has introduced. We are pleased that the opposition is joining us in supporting it.",112
177,Ms OWENS,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Bill 2004. This bill impacts directly on the people of the Parramatta electorate. James Hardie spent 45 years manufacturing asbestos products in Camellia in the heart of the Parramatta electorate. It started operation in 1937 and ceased making asbestos products in 1983. The story of the Hardie company in Parramatta will go down as one of the most disgraceful in Australian corporate history. The number of people who worked there would be in the thousands, not in the hundreds, and they worked without knowledge of the danger of asbestos. James Hardie was thought of as a local company and a good employer. Whole families worked there-fathers, sons and brothers. Fathers proudly introduced their sons to the company and brothers got brothers jobs on the night shift. The Banton boys left school in the seventies to work in the local factory. Ted, the oldest brother, got his younger brother a job at James Hardie. Ted died of mesothelioma and the two younger boys, Albert and Bernie, both have asbestosis. Bernie is just 57 years old. Of the 137 workmates he left at Camellia in 1974, he knows of only six who are still alive. The James Hardie BI workers still hold Christappromas reunions at the Wentworthville Leagues Club on the first Friday of each December. In 2003, only two people were able to attend. Asbestos fibres can give rise to a number of asbestos related illnesses such as lung cancer and asbestosis. The worse, though, is mesothelioma, a deadly lung cancer that has already taken the lives of 7,000 Australians. Two and a half thousand Australians die each year from the broader range of asbestos related diseases. Sadly, that figure is just the tip of the iceberg. Due to the long latency period between the exposure to asbestos fibres and the manifestation of the disease, which can be 30 years or more, the epidemic of asbestos related diseases is yet to peak in this country. That peak is expected to occur around 2023. Deaths from mesothelioma are expected to rise to 18,000 by 2020. The number of other asbestos related cancers may rise to 35,000 to 45,000 by that time. For some that is just a number but, to put it in context for people in this House, that if half of the adult voters in your electorate died of these diseases. Many will die, there is no doubt, but nowhere is this truer than in my electorate of Parramatta. It seems there that everybody knows somebody that worked at James Hardie or died of the effects of asbestos or is suffering from the effects of a lung disease. But asbestos does not just kill workers. It was widely used. In the peak period of the fifties to the seventies, it was used in fencing, pipes, insulation, paints, sealants, brake linings, clutches, fireproofing and textiles such as felts. There would be few public buildings-hospitals, schools, office blocks, factories or homes-that do not contain it. Asbestos related deaths are not restricted to the miners and workers in the manufacturing plants. There has been occupational exposure among workers in government railways, electricity commissions, wharves, the building industry and defence. Worse still, the latest range of new victims are home renovators. Even now, many home renovators are completely unaware of what really lies within their homes. When James Hardie set up in the thirties in Parramatta there were plenty of people willing to work. The 1933 census in Parramatta and surrounding areas showed an average of 16.7 per cent unemployment. There were many people willing to work at James Hardie. There followed in 1937 a major boom. People were moving into the area to start families. Record development applications were received by council and this number continued to grow as housing demand increased through the late thirties. Many of these applications were for small cottages. The War Service Homes Commission began accepting submissions for building or financing homes in the area. Building activity was particularly intense in Wentworthville, Pendle Hill and Toongabis as bie and along Windsor Road. Many of these new homes were constructed from asbestos cement-commonly and still affectionately called âfibro'. The use of the new material grew rapidly and, by the mid-fifties, Australia was fourth in the world in gross consumption of fibro. On a per capita basis, we were the clear winner by miles. In the 15 years after World War II, 52 per cent of all houses built in New South Wales were made of fibro. That is 70,000 fibro houses, many of which still stand. Australia wide, a quarter of all new housing was clad in this new wonder material. Even those of us who did not live in fibro houses were exposed to it. I lived in a weatherboard house, but the outdoor loo was made of fibro. At some point it disappeared in favour of indoor plumbing. I do not remember how that happened, but I suspect that my father tore it down, broke it up and threw it in the back of the ute along with me and my three sisters and took us all to the tip. In my electorate, it is not just the workers; the ex-directors and managers of Hardie also are there, often suffering from asbestosis themselves. They remind me, though, that they were not the only ones-and they were not; CSR and BHP Billiton have potential liabilities-but it is James Hardie that has deliberately walked away from its responsibilities. And there can be no doubt whatsoever that Hardie was well aware of the dangers of its products to workers and consumers very early in the history of its plant in Camellia. It is very hard to believe that any person or company would act with such callous disregard for people's lives, and I certainly found it a very difficult story to believe I first heard it, but there can be no doubt whatsoever that the damaging effects of asbestos were well known by James Hardie. Pliny the Elder knew about it. Asbestos has a very long history, and it was the ancient Greeks who gave it its name: asbestos, meaning inextinguishable. From that time it was known to damage the health. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder noticed that workers who wove asbestos into cloth commonly displayed a sickness in the lungs. The Greeks knew it but, like James Hardie, they were in such awe of asbestos's magical properties that they ignored this. The first modern registered death from asbestos exposure was recorded in 1899, 38 years before Hardie opened its plant in my electorate. In 1900, a physician in London's Charing Cross Hospital concluded that a 33year-old man had died from asbestos related disease. He had worked for 14 years in an asbestos textile factory and was the last survivor from a group of 10 men who had worked with him. The French knew in 1906 and made recommendations that ventilation be increased in asbestos workplaces. In 1917 and 1918, several US studies showed that asbestos workers were dying unnaturally young. From 1916, Prudential Insurance in the US would not give life insurance to anybody who worked in an asbestos related industry. James Hardie set up in the US in 1917. The first diagnosis of the disease asbestosis was made in 1924 in England-again, well before Hardie opened its plant in Camellia-following the death of a 33-year-old woman who had been working with asbestos since she was 13. A subsequent study on asbestos workers in England showed that 25 per cent had asbestos related lung disease. The first workers compensation workers disability claim from asbestos was filed in 1927. The man was a foreman in an asbestos when textile plant in Massachusetts. By the thirties, when Hardie opened their plant, there was a substantial amount of scientific knowledge accumulated concerning asbestos related disease. However, this did not deter James Hardie from manufacturing numerous products containing various types of asbestos for both domestic and industrial uses, and it did not deter them from doing that without warnings on their products and without appropriate safety procedures for their workers. As early as 1941, just four years after Hardie opened their plant in Camellia, even the US made asbestosis a work compensatable disease. The first Australian reported case of mesothelioma-that of a worker and miner from Wittenoom in WAwas in 1962. Later research identified over 658 Australian cases between 1945 and 1979. Then finally, in 1978, James Hardie put a first warning on its product, years after others had done it. I have talked to workers in pubs and shops and on the picket line outside the gates of James Hardie in Camellia about their complete ignorance at the time of the dangers of asbestos and the inadequate process for cleaning asbestos off their clothes and bodies before returning home to their families. I was told of the air hose that was used to blow the asbestos off their clothes-off their clothes and into the air-before they returned home to their families. They all know that they took the deadly dust home with them, that they hugged their children and that their wives shook the remaining dust off their clothes before washing them. Now the company's complete lack of regard for human life is reaping a bitter harvest, with responsibility for tens of thousands of deaths laid directly at its door. And what was the response from James Hardie? It took the money and ran. James Hardie engaged in a complex corporate restructure, separated subsidiaries from liabilities, transferred assets offshore and established a foundation to deal with the claims of victims, making public assurances that the foundation was sufficiently funded to meet all liabilities. It clearly is not. The current shortfall is estimated to be in excess of $1.5 billion. The NSW government established a special commission of inquiry into James Hardie, conducted by David Jackson QC. Adverse findings were made against various Hardie executives. Subsequently, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission announced that it would fully investigate these matters. I have been proud over the last year of the Labor Party's commitment to standing by the victims through this disgraceful display of corporate greed. Many Labor councils, including that of Parramatta, supported a boycott of Hardie's products. The Labor Party was the first party to reject donations from James Hardie and the first to give donations back to the victims. Labor demonstrated its commitment earlier this year to supporting legislation to ensure compensation to victims and to prevent this kind of corporate immorality occurring in the future. It is good to see the government introducing this bill, and I would like to give credit where credit is due. This bill will do a great deal for the victims. The bill significantly enhances the ability of ASIC or the DPP to undertake investigations and take proceedings under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act against corporate bodies, officers, employees or advisors of the James Hardie Group. The bill expressly abrogates legal professional privilege in relation to certain materials, permitting their use in these investigations or proceedings. Materials include records used in the special commission, as well as materials requested by ASIC or the DPP in relation to their investigation. The bill removes any uncertainty as to whether ASIC's powers to require the provision of materials can be obstructed by a claim of legal professional privilege. This is a great step forward in the pursuit of justice for the victims. Recently, NSW government legislation sought to enable victims to take action against the Dutch-registered entity, and the government has indicated support for this legislation. But there are still issues that are unresolved-in particular, whether the judgment would be enforceable in the Netherlands. The Jackson inquiry questioned whether laws that were retrospective and Hardie specific would be enforceable in the Netherlands in the absence of a treaty. In November, the Attorney-General reported that the Australian government had been advised by Dutch and US authorities that, in general, conventional Australian court judgments can form the basis of legal action in their respective jurisdictions. The Attorney General's comments do not address the fact that judgments arising from the legislation he endorsed would not be conventional; they would be Hardie specific and retrospective. To the government I say this: if there is any possibility that a treaty will be required, they must work to develop one without delay. After all their suffering, Hardie's victims and their families deserve certainty and, for them, time is of the essence. For men and women with asbestos related diseases there is one absolute certainty that this parliament can do nothing about: that disease will take their life. For those with mesothelioma, the taking of that life will occur in just a few short months. For the victims and the families we can deliver another certainty: that they will receive compensation in an appropriate and timely manner. That requires that James Hardie is found liable and, if the victims win their day in court, that they will be able to get access to the money even if it is hidden away in the Netherlands. This legislation goes a long way. It has been well received in my electorate and, again, I commend the government. But I ask the government to give urgent attention to the rest of the way. We ask that they either table the legal advice showing that the treaty is unnecessary or pursue the treaty as a matter of urgency. The James Hardie story is a complex one, but for the victims it is really quite simple. is about whether or not they will receive just compensation, whether the company that delivered their death sentences will be brought to justice, whether they will leave their families with a level of financial security and whether they will live to see it. The government have taken this step and I commend them for it, but I urge them to act on the treaty issue with some urgency. The victims with mesothelioma cannot wait six months for us to get this right. Many victims will die before this parliament even sits again. While we cannot give them life, we can give them certainty-the certainty that they will leave their families with a level of financial security and that justice will be done. I commend this bill to the House.",115
178,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I rise having informed my party room of my serious concerns about a piece of legislation, the James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Bill 2004, that is specific to one corporate entity, being enacted in this parliament. I have no objection to removing the corporate veil. I have no objection to people, our regulators, knowing all the facts. But, if it is reasonable for a single company because of the hysteria associated with this particular issue, it is reasonable for all companies, all individuals and anybody else. If those are the new rules in the judicial system, that is fine. have heard the member for Parramatta quoting an inquiry where, of course, the rules of evidence were not involved. There was no cross-examination. I remind this House that in every legal case one QC loses; they are not both right. But suddenly, on the report of a QC, a single inquirer or investigator, if you like, it is decided in this House-the ultimate democracy of Australia-that a company are guilty, they are crooks and, collectively, including their shareholders, they set out to kill Australians. I did not come to this place for that type of It attitude. I live in reasonable proximity, as the Western Australian area goes, to the Wittenoom Gorge where this asbestos product was produced. I know quite a lot about it. I had close friends who in fact transported the product in its raw state and who died from the various asbestos diseases-I will not try to pronounce them all. The reality is that I also know people in that country who got killed driving a truck carting iron ore. Looking at the challenges that confront us as a community and the things that kill us, I went to the Parliamentary Library and I asked them âWhat happens in our society? What are the risks we take every day in our employment, in our social activities and by other means?' I found the annual road fatalities by state and territory from 1981 to 2000. The figures were: in New South Wales, 561; in Queensland, 322; in my state of Western Australia, 179; and for Australia, 1,715. I tried to get some evidence of how many people were thought to have died of tobacco related diseases. The best they were able to provide me with was the estimated deaths caused or prevented by the active smoking of tobacco in Australia in 1992 according to condition. It appears that the net total deaths caused by tobacco for males was 13,357 and, for females, 5,063. The totals for all conditions I were 66,000 and 57,000, and the percentages caused by tobacco were 21 per cent and 8.8 per cent. I have just referred to motoring deaths and tobacco related deaths. This government, as have previous governments, still taxes the activities that led to those deaths. We condone them and we tax them. I also thought, considering I have some understanding of history, about what asbestos cement, as we knew it, delivered in terms of the public good over the 40-odd years that the member for Parramatta chose to speak about. The cost of housing was an issue that arose at the last election. I know well the electorate of Blaxland where, for instance, a recent Labor Prime Minister was raised. I had a sister who lived in that region on one occasion and I visited her. Every house was fibro asbestos sheet. Consequently I found figures on the materials of all household dwellings for 1999. The figure for fibro asbestos cement in New South Wales was 278,500 households or 11.5 per cent of the total housing in that state. I found that in Queensland 151,000 houses-11.3 per cent of the total-were similarly constructed and in WA 68,900 houses, or 9.5 per cent, were similarly constructed. In those years, which I remember well, people chose that housing because it was the economic alternative to bricks and tiles, which were la creme de la creme of shelter and which many people could not afford. It also created huge employment in what was known then as the cottage-building industry. Various figures have been quoted. I thought the member for Parramatta had researched the subject well but the reality is that what she told us was that we should arguably have known 100 years ago not to let anybody in Australia manufacture or build houses associated with asbestos. We are all well aware of the great value of hindsight. The cases were isolated and, in those early years, the world had a somewhat different attitude to workplace-related ties or illnesses. I well remember photographs appearing in the West Australian newspaper of goldmining workers sitting with their mouths on machines which helped them with the problems that they experienced as a result of underground mining activities. We know all this but suddenly this parliament and a substantial component of the Australian community have decided to pick on one company which, in my view, provided more public good-unfortunately, we now know, unwisely-than hurt to the Australian people. I have pointed out just how many Australians have been killed by using other forms of dangerous products. I cannot give you the number of people that get killed walking across a crosswalk. Before we attack and dance on the grave of the corporate entity, I want to know where the regulators stand. If the member for Parramatta is correct, where were the government regulators in New South Wales, Western Australia and Victoria? Who allowed it to happen? Why are they not part of the process of compensation? We do these sorts of things. As I said, we have a fairly relaxed attitude to things like tobacco, alcohol and driving cars. As you may remember, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, I had the attention of the Western Australian community years ago when I drove a Lamborghini into the trees. Fortunately, I did not kill myself or my passengers. What I want to know is why, in the modern culture of Australia, I was so silly not to sue them for selling me the motor car. After all, I was obviously incompetent to drive it. I did not do that. And I will not. When is Australia going to take a view about hindsight? When is Australia going to stop ambulance-chasing and when are we going to stop picking, as we are on this occasion, on a single corporate entity that we want to fataliblackguard in hindsight? I also want to take this opportunity to talk about what I think I have learnt from the debate that has been publicised in the media and what I have learnt from watching certain representatives of the company speaking on television. I understand the great dispute to be about the means by which the people who have suffered this tragic disease might be compensated. The comments by the member for Parramatta were quite interesting in that regard. She is worried about those who might die before they get the money. That is a common response. It does not matter how much pain you suffer, whatever the circumstances of your disability, as long as you get some money, it will be all right. The pain goes away after you have banked the cheque. It does not. I foolishly put a car into the trees. I thought it was my fault. It was a single-car accident, and I still limp and suffer personal pain every day. I do not think that was anybody's fault but my own. I have almost reached the well-advertised age of survival of three score years and 10. I don't know; asbestosis might kill me. I have certainly dealt with the product over many years. I still live under an asbestos super six roof, which is asbestos cement. I have to tell you a couple of things I will not do or expect my children to do. I do not expect them to go running around to find out whether my cancer was caused by passive smoking, which I did for many years as a hotel keeper. I do not want to think that they would go out and say that they need to get money. If I were 25 or 30 or 40 and, like the duty shadow minister at the table, just starting a family and I as a breadwinner",119
179,Dr EMERSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,What's that?,121

188,Dr EMERSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Are you speaking on behalf of the Liberal Party in the James Hardie case?,121
189,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,I have never spoken to anybody in James Hardie,121
190,Dr EMERSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,On behalf of the Liberal Party.,121
191,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,The member for Rankin will have his opportunity to speak shortly.,121
192,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"and I have told my party room my views on this matter. The difference between my position and that of members of the Labor Party is that I do not get punished if I express these views in this, the centre of democracy. I want to say that, if money is the cure of all problems and somebody loses their life because of the gross and deliberate negligence of a party-whatever that might be-and there are children to be supported and things of that nature, I agree with compensation, cash compensation, a payment to support the people disadvantaged. But say I am 70-three score and 10-and I have got, as I have, three grown children, one nearly as old as the interjector, who have good jobs and who have kids that they are putting through school and I do not contribute to their support. If the negligence of somebody causes my death, why should they get money? They don't need it. Who should be paying for it-some self-funded retirees who happen to be shareholders of the corporate entity? There is an issue in the Labor Party that only the directors, only the chief executives, make money out of corporations like James Hardie. Nobody thinks about the self-funded retirees that make their contribution. I think it was Friedman, the well recognised economist, who said, âThere is no such thing as a free lunch.' We think you can pursue people and get money for what is often minimal injury.",121
193,Dr EMERSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,There is no such thing as a free death either.,122
194,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"No, I have talked about death. Death is something we all confront and hazard is something we in our society all confront. Sometimes that is in our youth and when we have clearly defined responsibilities to others, and that is when money counts. Why should someone who will die of something in the next few years get large financial assistance and leave it to their kids, who are all okay, who are in good jobs and who are not going to die? That is the point I want to make; it is a point of logic. There is a difference when we are talking about a young person who has family responsibilities or whatever. Then there is the issue of pain and suffering. I know about that: I have suffered it all my life, I think it is overrated. Dr Emerson interjecting",122
195,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Of course, the interjector has not. I hope his kids are okay. But the reality is that we have got to a point where my party has promoted a piece of legislation to pursue a single company. I support the principle, provided it applies to all companies. I want the members of this parliament to ask themselves: why does money fix everything? It is fine for the ambulance chasers, the plaintiff lawyers. We are saying all these things about how we are going to chase these people overseas. I have been listening to radio broadcasts about the 20th anniversary of Bhopal. It is tragic; the circumstances are horrible. To this day international litigation has not resolved it. I heard a radio interview of an Indian woman who lost her husband and a couple of kids. She said, âYes, we got compensation.' I think she mentioned a figure of $40,000. The lawyers got $20,000, someone else got $10,000 and her family got $10,000. From my reading of the media, I understand that Hardie says, âOkay, we apologise. We lacked hindsight. We want to enter into a statutory response.' Maybe part of that response is to say, âLet us look at your age, let us look at who you are obliged to support and let us work out how much money you need, as you depart this world, to look after your dependants, presuming you have them.' That has been rejected by the ACTU. Why? Let us get down to the detail of that. They want to keep the plaintiff lawyers, otherwise known as the labour lawyers, in the scheme of things, when historically-and Bob Carr has said this-they get up to 70 per cent of the outcome. Money may or may not be the appropriate response. This legislation, which is appropriate in making sure the villains are properly addressed, should apply to all companies or to none. Why we are in here saying, âHardie is guilty' as legislators, not judges, I do not know. (Time expired)",122
196,Mr MELHAM,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Bill 2004. At the outset, I want to address a number of concerns that have been raised by the member for O'Connor and put him right in his misconceptions. The first point I make is that I agree with him in relation to the piercing of the corporate veil. The Treasurer, in his second reading speech, cited the Daniels case, in which: ... the High Court found that legal professional privilege is not merely a rule of substantive law but an important common law right that cannot be abrogated by statute without express words or an unmistakable implication. He then went on to say: Nevertheless, there are situations in which its abrogation is justified in order to serve higher public policy interests. One such situation is the effective enforcement of corporate regulation. I think it should not be restricted to James Hardie, because there is that principle of effective corporate regulation. Why is this so? In another part of the second reading speech of the Treasurer, he said, especially in relation to this case: It is expected that many crucial documents will be subject to claims of privilege by James Hardie. The transactions that will be the subject of tigation are of a complex nature, and were the subject of extensive legal advice and assistance. Materials documenting this advice may offer critical evidence as to the purpose and nature of certain transactions. Such evidence may be unavailable from any other source. So that evidence may well assist James Hardie, but we need to learn from the mistakes of the past and the history of the past in relation to tobacco companies and the subterfuge that they went through in hiding material. I agree with you: it should not just apply to them. I think this is a power that ASIC is seeking. The second point, which I think is a misconception, is that the member seems to think that we are automatically presuming that James Hardie is guilty and that compensation will flow. That is not the case at all. What we are allowing is for investigations to properly be undertaken, and each case will be determined on its merits. In the Dust Diseases Tribunal of New South Wales, Justice Curtis, in the case of the State Rail Authority of New South Wales v. Wallaby Grip Ltd18 NSWCCR 193-found: There is no evidence that between 1938 and 1950 the SRA had actual knowledge of the dangers to health posed by visible clouds of asbestos dust. Hardie did know. It is sufficient to refer to one exhibit only. SRA 26 reveals that on October 1938 Hardie's asbestos factory at Brooklyn in Victoria was the subject of tests carried out by the Victorian Department of Health to determine the concentration of asbestos particles in the air. The results were sent to Hardie. The report stated that: âCertain authorities regard 5,000,000 asbestos particles per cubic foot of air as the maximum concentration to which workers should be exposedâ and advised that where workers were exposed to such concentrations, even intermittently, they should wear suitable dust respirators. Any visible cloud of asbestos dust contains a concentration above 5,000,000 particles per cubic foot. invesThat was stated in paragraph 108 of Judge Curtis's findings. So you had a situation there where the complainant had to prove his case, and that is what we have in relation to these matters. I think it is an important matter of public policy that we do not have a situation where legal professional privilege is invoked to in effect stifle what are legitimate investigations, be they Hardie or any other company. I believe that one of the problems in the past is that those companies that go belly-up are using their lawyers in effect and the corporate veil. So I think the member has a legitimate point, but in this instance you cannot attack it for being used in James Hardie's case. My view is that this is a good precedent, and it is a precedent in public policy that should not be invoked lightly, but if you have a situation where",122
197,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,We think we know better.,123
198,Mr MELHAM,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"No, it is not a question of we think we know better. I understand where the member is coming from-I really do-but I think the problem here is that we have had a company that for years has sat on its hands, and it is now setting up corporate entities and engaging in evasion. The criticism of David Jackson QC that was implied by the honourable member I do not share. I know Mr Jackson-I have met him on a number of occasions. He is a highly regarded QC who is not necessarily a Labor supporter. I have never heard him talk politics. What I know is that he is respected on both sides of the political fence and by all in the legal profession. His report of the Special Commission of Inquiry into the Medical Research and Compensation Foundation, tabled in September 2004, had this to say on page 13, in paragraph 1.25, and this is the point: The negligence of the James Hardie companies occurred in the past, but the liabilities flowing from that negligence only arise day by day, now and in the future, as the diseases are acquired or manifest themselves. The exposure to asbestos may not even yet have occurred. The position in February 2001 was, as it remains, that members of the public will contract asbestos-related diseases over many years because of the negligence of Amaca and Amaba. The notion that the holding company would make the cheapest provision thought âmarketableâ in respect of those liabilities so that it could go off to pursue its other lucrative interests insulated from those liabilities is singularly unattractive. Why should the victims and the public bear the cost not provided for? He goes on to say: The second observation concerns the quite misleading statements made on behalf of JHIL at the time of separation, and the culture of denial adopted as the shortcomings in the Foundation's funding began to emerge. For nearly thirty years in this country we have had standards for business communications. Such communications are not to be misleading or deceptive. Those standards appear in the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and in its State equivalents, in the Corporations Laws and in the Corporations Act 2001. They have been maintained by governments of all political colours. In my opinion they were not here observed. That is a fairly damning indictment. Mr Tuckey interjecting",124
199,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Order! The member for O'Connor has had his say.,124
200,Mr MELHAM,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The member for O'Connor would know that this is a commission of inquiry that has laid the foundation for this particular piece of legislation, which will lead to further inquiries. Events flow from there. The member talked about his visit to Blaxland, which is an adjoining electorate-I have the electorate of Banks. Banks is an old-style Labor seat with housing commission war service homes settled after the Second World War. Many of those homes are riddled with asbestos. As I drove past when going to the shops a couple of weeks ago, there were a number of homes being demolished because they are going to be replaced by duplexes. It turned out that the demolition was not being done in accordance with the appropriate standards when it came to asbestos. That demolition was halted and the builders were told to do it the right way. This situation is going to be more something which our community will have and interact with and which will impact upon it for many years to come. I do not judge James Hardie guilty. That is not my role as a legislator. This is, in effect, the member's complaint. My complaint is: you are doing it to James Hardie; what about everyone else in relation to the corporate veil? My answer to that is that the threshold question has been reached in relation to investigations. Mr Tuckey interjecting",124
201,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Order! The member for O'Connor will cease interjecting.,125
202,Mr MELHAM,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I say: let us pierce the corporate veil, which is what this legislation is about. In future, let us pierce the corporate veil as well if it is shown that, in effect, the corporate regulator requires it to get behind the purpose and nature of certain transactions. Behind us are the days when the community accepted us as legislators sitting on our hands while companies like James Hardie could use the corporate veil to conceal the truth, in effect. That is what this legislation will do-and that is why it should be warmly embraced. Some of us have a view about James Hardie. I do. But my view is irrelevant. My view will not render James Hardie liable for one cent. But my view as a legislator will allow James Hardie to be properly investigated and allow a number of people, some of whom will never get to court because they will not survive long enough, to at least have a level playing field when it comes to investigating the causal connection of their illness or their death. If it is revealed that James Hardie sat on material-on medical evidence, reports and a whole range of other things-that would not have seen the light of day but for this legislation then I think we have done the right thing. I think it is a good thing that sides of the House are supporting it. The point the member makes is: why James Hardie and no-one else? It is because James Hardie is the first one in the queue where this has become a real live issue, courtesy of the report of Mr Jackson QC. I do not rest on the view that we should never pierce the corporate veil. In relation to that, I think the member for O'Connor and I have the same view. Having said that, you cannot turn around and say, âI don't think the corporate veil is sacrosanct, but I don't want to do it to James Hardie, because we are not doing it to anyone else.' I am sorry. What I hope is that, as a result of this case-and quite frankly some of the corporate entities need to be on notice that the old tricks of the lawyers and the accountants",125
203,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Why are you picking on them?,125
204,Mr MELHAM,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I will tell you why I am picking on them: because there is a piece of legislation introduced by a government of a different political persuasion, and I am arguing a principle. That is the thrust of this bill.",125
205,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Order! The member for Banks will not respond to interjections and will refer his remarks through the chair. The member for O'Connor will cease interjecting.,125
206,Mr MELHAM,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I think this is the problem that member for O'Connor has. If you take his objections to their natural conclusion, quite frankly he should be supporting the bill. He is raising objections, but the natural conclusion is to support the bill. By this bill we do not say that you are automatically going to get a bag of money. What we have basically said to those people who want to take James Hardie on is that, as a result of this bill, we are not going to allow James Hardie to use the corporate veil to both hide critical evidence that could go to the purpose and nature of certain transactions. It may well be that James Hardie can produce the material that abrogates their responsibility. Theoretically, they could say: âThis is the advice we have acted on. We have acted in good faith and we have not been negligent or criminal. We have not maintained production of a product, knowing the consequences of that product being in the marketplace.' I do not know what advice James Hardie has received, but I do know that someone like Mr Jackson-who has been around for many years, who at one stage was on the short list for a High Court appointment under this government and who has the enormous respect of all who know him and all in the legal community, irrespective of their political affiliations-cannot be ignored. We as a parliament cannot stand still in the light of this report and say that in this instance we are going to maintain legal professional privilege which could defeat legitimate claims. I think it is a great piece of legislation terms of the principles that I believe in and principles that should, in my view, be expanded because, at the end of the day, if James Hardie are not negligent or criminal and they acted in good faith on appropriate and proper advice and did all things reasonable then they have nothing to fear. I have often had it quoted to me by many on the other side: âIf you are not guilty, what have you got to worry about?' All we are doing here is dealing with the fiction of legal professional privilege in this instance. Why? Because on good public policy grounds we are serving a higher public policy interest. This is where I agree with the honourable member for O'Connor. For me, I would not restrict it to James Hardie. I would lift the corporate veil across the spectrum. In that regard we are at one. I commend the bill to the House. I was particularly impressed by the speech by my colleague the honourable member for Parramatta because it is a particular problem in her electorate. I think she eloquently pointed out to the House why this is a bill we can all be proud of. I think the honourable member for O'Connor should go back to his party room and try and get them to, in effect, open up the corporate veil in all corporate matters. He might find that we will support him on this side.",125
207,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,I've been there.,126
208,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I simply want to say at the outset in response to the member for O'Connor that the James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Bill 2004 is not about ambulance-chasing, nor is it about ordinary workers and their families seeking some short-term windfall monetary gain. I dealt with James Hardie in a professional capacity as a young trade union official at the very factories now represented by the member for Parramatta. I might also say that, in my dealin ings with James Hardie as a professional trade union representative, I found them fair in terms of the negotiations and, more importantly, honourable in adhering to the outcome of those negotiations. In the late 1970s and early 1980s it was my own union, the then Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia, that negotiated some important breakthroughs in minimum financial compensation for those workers and their families who suffered the awful disease of mesothelioma. All I can say is that there seems to have been a change in corporate culture within James Hardie in the 1990s which leads us to the bill before the House this evening, because it is not about ambulance-chasing-it is not about money-and I simply say that I regard some of the comments by the member for O'Connor in terms of importance of this bill as a reflection on the motives of ordinary Australians and their families. This bill is about corporate governance issues in Australia in the 21st century. It is also about ensuring that mechanisms are in place and perhaps it is a warning to the corporate world in general that this parliament will act to force corporate Australia to actually accept responsibility for its actions to ensure that everyday Australians are protected from the damage done by large, faceless organisations. The actions of James Hardie are well known, well recorded and well reported in the media. In an attempt to absolve itself from financial responsibility for the pain and suffering that would result from its products, James Hardie-and let's be frank about itdeliberately engaged in a complex corporate restructure, separating subsidiary companies with liabilities and transferring assets offshore to a Dutch-registered legal entity. In essence, James Hardie brought the parliament to this evening's debate by its own actions. This parliament did not go out of its way looking to act against James Hardie; James Hardie invited the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia to react in response to actions taken by its company and, more importantly, its board of directors. At the same time, James Hardie established and underfunded a medical research foundation, ostensibly to deal with the claims by innocent victims-and they are innocent. These victims are innocent, and we cannot hide from that fact. We have to front up to our responsibilities to protect ordinary innocent people, because that is why we are elected to this parliament. These innocent victims suffered asbestos related diseases, and I simply say it is an awful death. I have dealt with it because my father actually suffered from it and it contributed to his death, so I know all about the impact of asbestosis. It is about time we accepted our corporate responsibility on both sides of the parliament to bring companies such as James Hardie to heel. They stand condemned for their own actions. In that context, let us talk about performance on the financial front. It has become clear that this foundation was underfunded to the tune of $1.5 billion.",126
209,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Order! If the member for O'Connor continues to interject, he will be dealt with.",127
210,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Rather than facing up to its corporate responsibilities, what did James Hardie do? What did it do which prompted the actions of the Commonwealth parliament this evening? It moved offshore, leaving only $293 million to fund estimated compensation costs of some $2.3 billion. Mr Tuckey interjecting",127
211,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Order! The member for O'Connor is warned.,127
212,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Such an abrogation of corporate responsibility, so far as this parliament is concerned-with a few exceptions such as the member for O'Connor-is unacceptable to ordinary Australian citizens in the 21st century. The James Hardie company made good profits out of its activities for over 80 years. The industry was highly profitable, and the wages and conditions paid to the workers were generally amongst the best in the manufacturing industry in Australia. We also cannot escape the fact that it knew that it was producing and selling potentially deadly products. That goes to the heart of corporate responsibility: it knew it was producing and selling potentially deadly products. One has to accept one's responsibilities in life. As we now know, those products cause mesothelioma, an insidious form of cancer which has no cure and often kills victims within 12 months of diagnosis. Mesoits thelioma has already killed some 7,500 Australians since 1945. I can recall my father telling me stories about working in asbestos factories. There was no warning; you were jumping around in bins of asbestos as if you were jumping into a long jump pit on a sporting field. That was the nature of working in (Mr those factories for workers seeking a new start in life after returning home after the Second World War and the fight against fascism. We are now expected by the member for O'Connor to accept that we should not hold James Hardie and other companies accountable for the actions that they knowingly pursued when they now want to escape by going offshore and walking away from their responsibilities to ordinary workers. It is interesting to note that the number of deaths is expected to rise to some 18,000 by 2020. More than 500 people contract the disease each year. The peak of its incidence is not expected to hit Australia until around 2010; it is still ahead of us as a nation. In addition, incidences of other asbestos related cancers are estimated to be at around 30,000 to 40,000 by the same time. Worse still, Australia had the highest use of asbestos per ita in the world from the 1950s until the 1970s. One must also appreciate that, because of the desire of state governments to actually house the less privileged in the Australian community, throughout the fifties, sixties and seventies often the housing commission homes built to assist those people were built out of asbestos because it was a cheap product. If we did anything wrong it was in the 1970s, when we got carried away with removing asbestos when it was unwarranted. Properly treated and maintained, it is safer to leave asbestos in situ rather than risk the health of workers by engaging them in the removal of asbestos when it is unnecessary. That was the lesson we learnt from the 1970s. We have also learnt throughout historyas the member for O'Connor raised in terms of road and pedestrian accidents, the problems with smoking or, in this case, the problem with asbestos related products-that it is our responsibility as a responsible, forward looking nation to take every precautionary action possible to reduce deaths, be they on the road, at work or in any other place. I simply say that one must accept that, for that reason, prior to 1982 approximately one-third of domestic dwellings built in Australia contained asbestos. Until the mid-1980s, James Hardie was the largest Australian manufacturer of products containing asbestos, most notably asbestos sheeting and fibro. It also knew the problems, because during that period it invested considerable amounts of its profits into research and development in order to develop an alternative product. It succeeded-that is why it is still in business today. One of the most difficult tasks it had was to develop an alternative to the high pressure pipe. It came up with a product called Hobas. So it knew the problem and it knew it had to find an alternative building product in Australia to take itself forward. I cap- do not accept any suggestion that James Hardie is being hard done by by the Commonwealth parliament in this debate. I also point out to the House that it is now known that the company knew about the dangers from at least the 1930s yet took no action and placed no warnings on its products until-when?-1978. That is about the time some of the first agreements were negotiated for minimum legal settlements for asbestos related diseases by my own union, the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union, led by the then general secretary, Ray Gietzelt. It is not surprising, therefore, to hear that, as I have already pointed out this evening, Australia has the highest per capita incidence of mesothelioma in the world. While not being the only company involved-there have been others in the game faced with asbestos related claims-James Hardie has been a major player in the industry. In 2002, over 50 per cent of the claims made to the New South Wales Dust Diseases Tribunal were, interestingly, against the James Hardie group. I therefore say, in the context of the debate in which the Howard government is hell bent on destroying the Australian trade union movement, that we must give respect where respect is due. It is simply through the perseverance and determination of the union movement in Australia that the Howard government-the Commonwealth government of Australia-has finally been forced to act to bring James Hardie to account and to bring James Hardie to heel. The union movement, led by Greg Combet, the Secretary of the ACTU, is currently involved in a complex round of negotiations with James Hardie management to ensure that the company accepts its responsibilities. This bill is about assisting the workers, their families, the Australian trade union movement and those decent representatives of corporate Australia in sending a message to rogue companies such as James Hardie that in Australia there are certain levels of accepted practice to do with the responsibilities of the corporate world which we as a civilised community accept. In terms of the ACTU, all it is doing is acting on behalf of its claimants. It is doing its job. It is not seeking to chase ambulances. It is not seeking to manipulate the legal system to get money where money is not warranted. It is seeking to drive negotiations with James Hardie to ensure that the foundation it established provides additional funds for current and future victims. It is as simple as that. I do not regard that as outrageous, as suggested by the member for O'Connor. I regard it as something that we all in the Australian community ought to support and, in doing so, send a message to corporate Australia that that is what we as a nation expect. We represent workers who are well respected internationally for doing a hard day's work for a fair day's pay. But all Australian workers rightfully expect that when they go to work they have a right to go home that evening without being maimed, injured or killed at work. That is what the debate is about. It is about ensuring that workers are protected in all respects and, also, when there is a fatality, it is about ensuring that the lies who suffer that-and they often suffer huge financial difficulties-are protected through the Commonwealth parliament accepting its responsibilities. The Howard government has acted, but we should not lose sight of the fact that it did sit on its hands. It did let thousands of workers suffer while the company was let off from its obligation to offer compensation for their injuries. The company's bottom line was more important than the lives of its victims, in the minds of some representatives of the Howard government initially. But let us give credit where credit is due. The hand of the Howard government has finally been forced. This bill will enhance the ability of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission or the Director of Public Prosecutions to undertake investigations and take proceedings against the corporate bodies that make up the James Hardie group. This action will also extend to officers, employees or advisors of the James Hardie group. This legislation will also remove any uncertainty as to whether ASIC's powers to require the provision of materials can be obstructed by a claim of legal privilege. While the opposition supports the passage of this legislation, as the member for Banks indicated, it is also clear that we have a very strong view that the government should have acted sooner rather than later. Criticism must also be levelled at the government this evening for not taking the legislation potentially far enough. Following its own commission of inquiry into the James Hardie affair, the New South Wales government announced legislation aimed at allowing asbestos victims to take legal action against related corporations, including the Dutch-registered entity. However, there unfortunately remains a lack of clarity about famithe enforcement of any judgments against the Dutch based Hardie entity in the absence of any international treaty with the Netherlands. I remind the government this evening that we believe that it needs to urgently enter into such a treaty to remove this difficulty beyond any doubt and to ensure that we provide the necessary access to justice. The government must also explain to the Australian people why it has not adequately funded ASIC to undertake a full investigation into the actions of James Hardie. While the Treasurer has made vague statements about further funds being made available, I believe that lack of clarity has hampered ASIC's ability to instigate a thorough investigation into what is clearly one of Australia's most serious breaches of corporate responsibility. Corporate responsibility and governance are issues which deserve far more attention by this parliament. James Hardie is one case in point. The James Hardie legislation must send a message to all companies operating in Australia that this parliament will act in the future if companies do not do the right thing by Australia in terms of its national best interests. There are a range of other matters that I could touch on but, given the late hour, I simply want to say that James Hardie forced the hand of the Commonwealth parliament. The Commonwealth parliament did not go looking for this dispute. The actions of James Hardie, in seeking to run away from its responsibilities, eventually forced the Howard government to actually embrace the necessity to bring the James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Bill 2004 before the parliament. The bill is properly based in terms of guaranteeing that workers and their families are looked after. I simply reject the proposition by the member for O'Connor this evening that the bill before the House is about ambulance-chasing and that workers and their families are seeking to make a short-term windfall monetary gain. I also say to those workers and their families that I apologise on the behalf of the parliament for the inflammatory and vulgar comments made by the member for O'Connor in his contribution concerning this bill. They were unnecessary and reflect his own ignorance rather than the desire of this House to do the right thing by the workers and their families. I commend the bill to the House.",127
213,Dr EMERSON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I point out that on the speakers list tonight there are a number of Labor members wishing to contribute to the debate-to the advancement of knowledge about this very unfortunate saga-yet only two members of the coalition, the member for Cook and the member for O'Connor, have even bothered to come into the parliament to make an argument about this legislation. Labor supports the James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Bill 2004. Some of the points raised in the debate are quite illuminating. It is true that in an ideal world we would be debating legislation not specific to James Hardie but that dealt with this kind of unacceptable behaviour across corporate Australia. So I do understand that there is merit in the argument that we should not be legislating specifically for an individual company. As the member for Batman has pointed out, the reality is that James Hardie has forced the hand of the Commonwealth parliament. We are in an extraordinary situation where the will of the people, as expressed through this parliament, is such that James Hardie must be brought to account. I urge corporate Australia to get behind this legislation and understand that, when you have such appalling behaviour by an individual company, corporate Australia at large should condemn it. Otherwise, if the member for O'Connor and others in the debate had their way, corporate Australia would be subject to exactly the same legislationabout which, no doubt, it would be indignant and would express outrage. But you cannot have it both ways. When a company behaves in this way then there is an obligation on other companies to declare that this behaviour is unacceptable. Otherwise we will be confronted by company specific legislation again and again and again. Alternatively, the parliament will be fed up with it and will apply this sort of legislation across the board, and no doubt corporate Australia would be very upset about that. Like the member for Batman, I am outraged at the assertions made by the member for O'Connor that this legislation involves ambulance-chasing. For him to suggest that the death of a 70-year-old is in some way fundamentally different from the death of, say, a 50-year-old, in that a 70-year-old would have no offspring who legitimately should be the beneficiaries of compensation, is appalling. In the world of the member for O'Connor, it is all right for compensation to be paid for a 50-year-old with relatively young dependent children who dies of a disease caused by the negligence of a company, but if you are 70 then there is no case and it constitutes ambulance-chasing. The tragic reality of mesothelioma is that it takes about 37 years in order for that disease to become a reality after the first infection. So the truth of the matter is that it is more likely to be a disease that occurs among people in their 60s and 70s. Does that make it all right? Does that make the disease acceptable and the case for compensation weaker, because it is such an insidious disease with such a long gestation period? I say no. I say that a company that is involved in activities where it knowingly has jeopardised, endangered, the health of its employees and of others should be brought to account. That is why we had the Jackson inquiry. The government is very fond of condemning the union bosses of Australia, of condemning the trade union movement in this country and of condemning people like Greg Combet for some sort of unacceptable behaviour that in some way is unethical and against the national interest. But I say this: Greg Combet, his colleagues in the ACTU and his colleagues in individual unions brought this scandal to light. I assert to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, and to the parliament, that we would not be debating this legislation if it were not for the efforts, the diligence and the persistence of Greg Combet, the ACTU and all the relevant unions. When we have a debate, as we did in the federal election campaign, about the role of trade unions in this country, we should remember, through the James Hardie saga, that trade unions bring to light outrageous behaviour on the part of companies and individuals. We would be much the poorer as a country if we did not have the trade union movement performing that role. So when the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, at the behest of the Prime Minister of Australia, stands up here in parliament, day in, day out, week in, week out, condemning the union bosses, it might just be wise for both the minister for workplace relations and the Prime Minister to pause and ponder the fact that, without the unions, this tragedy and this negligence on the part of James Hardie would not have been brought to light, would not have received the public attention that it has, might not have resulted in a commission of inquiry in New South Wales and certainly would not have resulted in the legislation that we are debating tonight. As always, I will defend the role of the trade union movement in this country in bringing to light these sorts of outrages. It is worth discussing for a moment the consequences of the negligence of James Hardie. Mesothelioma is a cancer caused by the inhalation of asbestos. It causes extreme pain. It causes breathlessness. The lung is effectively collapsed by the weight of the tumour. Within nine to 12 months of diagnosis, a person who is afflicted with mesothelioma dies. It is a shocking disease and there are no cures for it. That is not the only asbestos related disease. Asbestos has also been implicated in other malignancies, particularly lung cancer. It is implicated in respiratory diseases, non-malignant diseases, but the worse of it is that there are no cures. Australians were into asbestos like no other country. We loved our asbestos. I am from the country, from a small country town called Baradine, in north-western New South Wales. The member for Batman referred to the âFibros' in Sydney Rugby League, in the contests of the 1970s-Les Boyd for the âFibros', the western suburbs, playing the âSilvertails' in Manly. The fibros were the cheap houses of the western suburbs, built from asbestos cement. And so it was in the town where I grew up. If you had a brick house, you had a castle. All the houses were built of fibro. Do you know what we used to do? We used to get the fibro, smash it up and put it on fires. We would light a fire out on the back block, build it up, get it hot, put fibro on and watch it pop. Someone with some medical expertise said to me that you need only one fibre of asbestos to lodge in your lung and you can get this shocking disease. As kids, we did not know that. Working people of this country did not know that. Low-income people of this country did not know that. As a consequence of not knowing the impact of fibro and other uses of asbestos, so many people are dying. These are the figures. About every third domestic dwelling built in Australia before 1982 is thought to contain asbestos, mostly in the form of fibro. We have the highest per capita incidence of mesothelioma in the world. Already 7,500 people have been reported as dying from mesothelioma in Australia, and it is being contracted by around 500 more Australians every year. By 2020 it is expected that 18,000 Australians will have died of mesothelioma, and the peak of it is yet to come. The peak of it is expected in six years time, in 2010. If you compare the road toll to the toll from asbestos related diseases, you get a other shocking comparison. Asbestos related diseases, most particularly mesothelioma, are right up there. The scariest thing about thisit is a shocking disease-is that the average gestation period is around 37 years. Who was the biggest manufacturer of asbestos containing products in Australia? James Hardie was. And there is, as the member for Batman has pointed out, some evidence demonstrating that James Hardie knew of the dangers of asbestos from at least the 1930s, and yet it took decades for all of this to come to light and even longer for this legislation to come before the parliament. In early 2001 James Hardie established the Medical Research and Compensation Foundation but put in it a grand total of $293 million of assets. The James Hardie CEO, Peter Macdonald, stated at the time that the the trust fund was fully funded-that there were adequate funds to compensate all the victims of James Hardie's activities. Yet in October 2001 James Hardie gained approval from the Supreme Court of New South Wales for a scheme of arrangement that involved the establishment of a new Netherlands based parent company and the transfer of $1.9 billion from James Hardie to that company. Let us just put this through the common sense test. Why would James Hardie enter into an arrangement where it transferred $1.9 billion of assets to the Netherlands? What is so special about the Netherlands? Do they produce lots of fibro houses? I do not think so. Do they have a love for asbestos? I do not think so. The Netherlands is one of only two countries in the world with whom Australia does not have a treaty for the enforcement of civil action. So, on the evidence, James Hardie knew exactly what it was doing. It was not chasing asbestos related markets in the Netherlands; it was shifting assets to the Netherlands so that they could not be accessed by the victims of asbestos related diseases. So that scheme of arrangement was approved, $1.9 billion was sent off to the Netherlands, and James Hardie's solicitors assured Justice Kim Santow that Australian asbestos creditors would suffer no prejudice from this due to a lifeline of partly paid shares. Come forward to March 2003, and James Hardie separated JHIL from the James Hardie group, creating the ABN 60 Foundation, and cancelled the partly paid shares, thereby cutting the lifeline. James Hardie indemnified the Netherlands parent against any claims arising from or connected with past asbestos liabilities and, by the way, did not alert the Supreme Court, the New South Wales government or the Australian Stock Exchange about the cancellation of those shares. One of the central objectives of the separation and restructure was to place the assets of James Hardie beyond the reach of asbestos victims. I now want to refer to some of the findings of the commission of inquiry. I quote a brief summary of the report: At the time of separation JHIL announced that the Foundation was âfully fundedâ, that its lishment would bring certainty to asbestos claimants and shareholders and that the level of ing required by the Foundation had been determined by the directors of JHIL with the benefit expert advice from firms including PricewaterhouseCoopers and Access Economics ... In my view each of those statements was untrue ... I have also formed the view that in publishing the Media Statements in question JHIL and its Chief Executive Officer, Mr Macdonald, engaged in conduct which was, or was likely to be, misleading and deceptive in terms of s 995 of the then Corporations Law, and that there is evidence on which it could be found that Mr Macdonald had contravened ss 1309 and 999 of the Corporations Law ... It goes on to say that the provision made for the asbestos liabilities was manifestly inadequate: the assets were $293 million but the liabilities for claims in future years would be not less than $1.5 billion in present value terms. Compare the assets of $293 million and the liabilities of not less than $1.5 billion-and others suggest that it could be much, much greater. There was a cash flow model that was used to test and verify the adequacy of this $293 million. The commission found: The cash flow model ... worked on the assumption that the funds available from time to time for investmentby two of the associated companieswould be able to earn income at a constant rate of 11.7 per cent per annum for 50 years ... I formed the view that the 11.7 per cent was selected because it would achieve the result that the model would show significant surpluses over its life ... That is, it was a convenient selection of an expected rate of return to produce the desired result. This legislation is warranted. It is true that, in an ideal world, it should not be applied simply to James Hardie. But James Hardie has gone out and behaved in a completely irresponsible way. If other companies estabbehave in the same way then I fear and believe that this legislation may well spread to fund- those other companies. That is why I urge corporate Australia to understand the impliof cations of one company behaving in such an irresponsible way. Personally, I would not like this legislation necessarily to apply to all companies. But if particular companies are going to behave in this way without sanction then, of course, parliament will speak on behalf of the Australian people. The bill enhances the ability of ASIC and the Director of Public Prosecutions to mount investigations and undertake proceedings against corporate bodies that are part of the James Hardie group and officers, employees or advisers of the James Hardie group. The bill expressly abrogates legal professional privilege in relation to certain materials, permitting their use in these investigations proceedings. So, as a result of the passage of this legislation, those materials will be able to be used in those investigations and proceedings, and I welcome it. Certainly James Hardie has behaved in an appalling fashion. That is why we are debating this legislation. I want to finish where I started: this dal would not have been brought to light if it were not for the work of Greg Combet, the ACTU and the affiliated unions. We must always remember that unions have a great role to play in defending the public interest and in defending victims, whether they are 70 years old or not. I commend the bill to the House.  Secretary to the Treasurer) (10.39 p.m.)The James Hardie (Investigations and Proceedings) Bill 2004, bill will facilitate a thorough and effective investigation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, in relation to the matters ing out of the James Hardie special commission of inquiry in New South Wales. It will also enable proceedings that may arise from these investigations to be brought by either ASIC or the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the DPP. The transactions that will be the subject of ASIC's invesSecretary tigation are complex and were the subject of extensive legal advice and assistance. Materials documenting this advice may offer critical evidence as to the purpose and nature of certain transactions. Such evidence may be unavailable from any other source. It is the government's view that ASIC must conduct a comprehensive investigation into the conduct of the James Hardie group, including its directors, officers and advisers. The investigation of possible contraventions of the Corporations Act may be impaired if ASIC and the DPP cannot obtain and use material obtained by the special commission or that is subject to claims of legal professional privilege. This bill will expressly abrogate legal professional privilege for certain materials, allowing their use in investigations of James Hardie and any related proceedings. This means that authorised persons including ASIC and the DPP will be able to obtain mascanterials that would otherwise be subject to legal professional privilege and use them for the purposes of James Hardie investigations and proceedings. The government place great store in ethical behaviour by corporations. We do not condone or support companies that restructure their affairs to avoid their legal liabilities to the victims of their products. That sort of behaviour is unconscionable and should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. The government remain of the view that James Hardie should honour its obligation to compensate those victims who have a legitimate claim against the company for asbestos rearislated diseases. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading  to the Treasurer) (10.42 p.m.)-by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 2004 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Ordered that the amendments be considered immediately. Senate's amendments(1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 14), omit âthingâ, substitute âprescribed thingâ. (2) Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 20), after 1, insert: 1A Section 35 Insert: prescribed thing means a thing, including any substance that is prescribed by regulation under this Act. (3) Schedule 1, item 3, page 3 (line 30), omit âthingâ, substitute âprescribed thingâ.",130
214,Mr RUDDOCK,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION,"I move: That the amendments be disagreed to. Yesterday the member for Barton moved an amendment to define the term âthing' by reference to regulations. The government did not support the amendment then and disagrees with the amendment now for the reasons that I outlined yesterday. The term âthing' was intentionally used because it is important that there be appropriate flexibility within the act, particularly in a changed security environment. This is consistent with the other parts of the definition of âprescribed administrative action', which refers to access to information or a place. Such broad terms are not defined now, and this has not represented a problem in the past. In fact, while the outcome of the ASIO security assessments has been subject to appeal, nobody has ever suggested that the circumstances in which ASIO furnishes its assessment are inappropriate. As I said in this place yesterday, I am not churlish about these matters. If the government thought that an amendment would improve the legislation-and it does not matter whether the amendment is moved by the opposition or suggested by government members-we would adopt it. However, in this case we do not believe this is one of those areas. The definition of âthing' is already limited by the rest of the definition, which requires a person's ability to perform an activity in relation to or involving the thing to item be controlled or limited on security grounds, with âsecurity' defined in the act. The bill is intended to be proactive and to be sufficiently broad to cover, to the extent possible, issues that may arise in the future as regards other hazardous materials. The current wording, in our view, strikes the appropriate balance. On that basis, I encourage the House to disagree with the amendments made by the Senate. If it is appropriate either now or later, I will table a statement of reasons.",135
215,Mr MCCLELLAND,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION,"I agree to the tabling of the statement of reasons. In terms of the question before us, I can indicate, as I indicated last night to the Attorney-General, that the opposition will not be opposing the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Amendment Bill 2004 because our amendment has been unsuccessful. We obviously moved the amendment because we thought it appropriate in an area of national security to retain ultimately the power of the parliament. However, the fundamentals of the bill are of significance. As I indicated, we put forward the amendment in good faith with a view to improving the legislation. That amendment being unsuccessful, nonetheless the rationale for the legislation still remains. On that basis, the opposition will not oppose the government's rejection of the Senate amendments. It will enable the legislation to be passed expeditiously-one would think tomorrow morning. Question agreed to.",135
216,Mr RUDDOCK,INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION,"I thank the member for Barton for his observations earlier. I present the reasons for the House disagreeing to the Senate amendments, and I move: That the reasons be adopted. Question agreed to. NA INFORMATION (CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS) BILL 2004 Debate resumed from 2 December. Second Reading",136
217,Mr RUDDOCK,NATIONAL SECURITY,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Bill 2004 involves the protection of Australia's national security, which is an obligation that the government takes seriously. An integral part of this obligation is the protection of information which, if disclosed, could damage our national security. As the Director-General of Security, Mr Dennis Richardson, recently told the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry: Sooner or later, the protection of classified security sensitive information will be a critical issue in a terrorism trial in this country. The existing rules of evidence and procedure do not provide adequate protection for such information where it may be disclosed during the course of criminal proceedings. As a consequence, the Commonwealth may be faced with the unpalatable choice of accepting the damage resulting from the disclosure of information or protecting that information by abandoning the prosecution. The National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Bill 2004 will strengthen the laws for protecting information that is likely to prejudice our national security. The bill is designed to enable information to be introduced during a federal criminal proceeding in an edited or summarised form. This will facilitate the prosecution of an offence without prejudicing national security and the rights of the defendant to a fair trial. The bill has been considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, who reported on 19 August 2004 with 13 recommendations. The government has considered the committee's report and has adopted several of the committee's recommendations. The bill makes it clear that defendants and their legal representatives can only be excluded from hearings where the legal representative does not hold a security clearance. The bill makes it clear that the court must, in making an order in relation to the disclosure of information or a witness, consider whether the exclusion of information or a witness would impair the ability of a defendant to make his or her own defence. This requirement is in addition to requiring the court to consider whether the excluand sion would substantially affect the defendant's rights to receive a fair hearing, in which case the proceedings could be stayed. On 17 November 2004 the bill was introduced into the Senate, where it was debated and further amended. While the government opposed the amendments in the Senate, after further consultations we decided in the spirit of working collaboratively to protect Australia's national security that we would reach a compromise solution to facilitate the passage of this bill. I intend to move government amendments to meet the policy objectives agreed to by the Senate without undermining the effectiveness of this bill. The bill makes a significant change to the way information that may affect our national security is used in federal criminal proceedings. However, the new measures will not prevent a defendant from receiving a fair trial. The courts will retain the power to ensure that a trial is fair and the defendant is not disadvantaged. In this way, the government has struck the right balance in protecting national security without sacrificing the independence of the judiciary and the defendant's right to a fair trial. For this reason, I commend the bill. I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr MCClelland) adjourned. NA INFORMATION (CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2004 Debate resumed from 2 December. Second Reading",136
218,Mr RUDDOCK,NATIONAL SECURITY,I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill is consequential to the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Bill 2004. The bill makes consequential amendments to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and the Judiciary Act 1903 in relation to the court's jurisdiction to hear or determine an application regarding a certificate issued by the Attorney General. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr MCClelland) adjourned. NA,137
219,Mr NAIRN,ADJOURNMENT,I move: That the House do now adjourn. Australian Institute of Sport,137
220,Mr GRIFFIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I recently attended the Australian Institute of Sport with the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Rod Kemp, to see the undertaking of the development of the new pool and other facilities that are part of the redevelopment that is occurring at the AIS. The new facilities are going to be at the very cutting edge of sporting facilities. The aquatic centre that is there will provide a new pool and other facilities which will really give our athletes a chance to realise their capacities and ambitions into the future. Construction will occur over the next 15 to 18 months, as I understand. It will involve a pool which, as I said earlier, will be at the very cutting edge of technology. It will have the capacity for camera work so that it can be clearly understood what the swimmers are doing under the water. There will be a range of other facilities-areas to deal with injuries and other aspects-which will really give them a chance to move ahead. It certainly is an example of what can and should be done to try to give our elite sportspeople the chance to improve on the results that they have achieved in recent times. Members would know that at Athens we had an incredibly impressive result right across a range of sports. We certainly can be very proud of what our athletes achieved. Petria Thomas, the Olympic gold medallist, was there and spoke on the occasion. She certainly recounted some interesting tales of her time at the AIS. To all those involved with the new facilities, I wish them all the best with those developments. It was certainly a pleasure to be there representing the federal opposition. I hope to go along there in the future to see the completed facility and the other facilities that are part of the redevelopment. It is part of what has provided our athletes with the opportunity to realise their abilities and their ambitions and I would urge all members, if they get a chance, to go out there and have a bit of a look at what is going on at the AIS. It is very impressive, and it is something that we can all be very proud of. Bass Electorate: Trail of the Tin Dragon",137
221,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House a project of great importance to Northern Tasmania, that being the proposed project known as the Trail of the Tin Dragon. The Trail of the Tin Dragon is a local themed touring trail within the north-east touring route. Its aim is to attract and connect visitors to the region through stories of the Chinese and the tin mining industry in north-east Tasmania. The trail fits within the north-east touring route and this has the potential to increase the number of visitors travelling between Launceston and St Helens by 60,000 per year and to add up to around $9 million each year to the regional economy. In addition to the tourism benefits, the project could potentially drive needed infrastructure development, build the social capital of the community and help establish better cultural and economic links with modernday China. Chinese tin miners were amongst the early pioneers of Tasmania's north-east and were the largest group of non-European immigrants to early Tasmania. Their arrival commenced in the late 1870s and at their peak they numbered around 1,000. The history of these people is closely tied to the tunes of the state's tin mining industry. Their ingenious mining skills and business acumen played an important role in the development of the region and Tasmania. The stories of the people and this time are a point of difference for north-east Tasmania and part of our nation's cultural heritage. The remaining evidence and personal associations with the Chinese of this time are, however, disappearing. The Trail of the Tin Dragon is guided by memories and stories, community passion for the history of the place and an emphasis on Tasmania's core appeals of cultural heritage, natural experiences and the region's food and wine. The work done so far has been preliminary. No-one has been a stronger supporter for this project than me and so I was delighted that the Prime Minister, on 27 August this year, pledged real Australian government support. The government provided $50,000 to the Dorset Council to undertake a business development plan for the tourist project. On the successful completion of this business plan, and subject to the project being viable, the government is prepared to provide up to $1.7 million towards the development of the project. The steering committee has now appointed the Sentience Group to carry out the business plan. This will be led by Bob Campbell, Lynda Jones and Brian Green. This, of course, is a critical stage; the group must demonstrate the viability of the project in the tourism marketplace to qualify for the $1.7 million, and I certainly wish them every success. When complete the Trail of the Tin Dragon will see sites, stories, photographs and artefacts of the people and the time brought together with infrastructure, services and interpretation to create a better sense of place and a memorable visitor experience. It will benefit a part of Tasmania where the fortourism product and associated infrastructure could do with enhancement. From a national perspective, the trail will interpret a significant part of our Chinese cultural heritage and provide modern-day links with China through a potential sister city relationship with the immigrants' province of origin. In fact the establishment of this relationship has been a contribution that I have been able to make, by coming up with the concept earlier in the year and progressing negotiations with the Chinese Embassy here in Australia. Finally, I would like to mention the contribution made over the last weekend by the Hobart based Tantra Buddhism group who travelled up to Scottsdale to help the local community celebrate the Dorset Christmas parade. In their own way this group added their moral support to the project and provided what can only be described as a very colourful and energetic display of a Chinese dragon for all to enjoy. Of course, the traditions are quite different, but the goodwill and support is very welcome. Aviation: Bankstown Airport",138
222,Mr HATTON,ADJOURNMENT,"Blaxland) (10.58 p.m.)In just eight short days, the draft master plan for Bankstown Airport must be handed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon. John Anderson. The longcoming day is 15 December. Very early this year, the first indications were given that this master plan would be put into effect. There were three months of public consultations. There was an indication very early on that not all that much would change but, when the preliminary draft master plan emerged, I as the member for Blaxland, representing half of the 165,000 people of Bankstown, in conjunction with Mr Daryl Melham, the member for Banks, was confronted with something completely contrary to my expectations. Firstly, there was a demand that the main runway, 29C, be extended by over 200 metres. Secondly, there was a provision that regular public transport should be introduced into Bankstown Airport. Thirdly, there was no provision whatsoever that large aircraft such as category 3D and category 4C would be forbidden from landing at Bankstown Airport. Consequently, given that all of these things were contrary to our expectations, the member for Banks and I launched a public campaign against these elements of the preliminary draft master plan. I am happy to be able to tell you tonight what I recently announced in my electorate and what has been confirmed by Mr Kim Ellis, the CEO of the Bankstown Airport Corporation, in this week's edition of the Bankstown Express. Following a meeting between me, Mr Ellis and his boss just three days before the election, the indication given was that they would look closely at what I and 4,000 people had argued in individual submissions and form letters that I and the member for Banks had put out. The very first point that we argued for was that there should be an absolutely concrete prohibition on large jet aircraft at Bankstown Airport. That has finally been acceded to by the owners of the Bankstown Airport Corporation. This means that 737s, 717s and the like will not be allowed to land at Bankstown Airport. This means that, in effect, what this government attempted to achieve on 13 December 2000-namely, to turn Bankstown into Sydney's overflow airport-will not be achieved and the new private owners will act not only in their own private interests but also in the community interests of the people of Bankstown. This outcome would not have been achieved without the support of all of those people who signed up to the public campaign run by me and the member for Banks, because the intention in the preliminary draft master plan was to simply say, âFor planning purposes we do not take these things into account.' When pressed by the community organisation that was put together to look at this, the owners initially said that they wanted to reserve all of their options and, in a future with changing technology, they wanted to be able to say that, with a longer runway and regular passenger transport using it, larger aircraft could use the airport. I congratulate Mr Ellis and the owners of Bankstown Airport Corporation on having the good sense to act not only in their interests but also in the broader interests of the Bankstown community. I ask them to do two other things: firstly, to strike out from the draft master plan the extension of the runway by 200 metres; and, secondly, to cast out from that draft master plan the introduction of the regular passenger transport aircraft from Bankstown Airport. Neither of those things are in the interest of the Bankstown Airport Corporation and, as indicated in the preliminary draft master plan, they are certainly not in the interests of the people in the community of Bankstown. We do not want in any shape or form to change the nature of Bankstown Airport as a general aviation airport. We do not want an extension or a change to its operation, and I call for those things to happen. (Time expired) Child Support Agency",139
223,Mr SCHULTZ,ADJOURNMENT,"I once again rise in this place to talk about what I call the national shame that is the Child Support Agency. In my files, I have in excess of 450 case studies from all over Australia with regard to the dreadful way in which men and women are being treated by the Child Support Agency-and they are still coming in. Let me now read from one case study, from a mother of two sons. She says: I am the mother of two sons, one whom is separated with 3 children aged 10, 8 & 6. Over the past five years, my son has taken his responsibility as a separated DAD very seriously-both in supporting his children emotionally and financially. As his ex-wife received 72% of their assets by the Court, their car, and all the contents of their home getting started again has been a nightmare. He currently pays 47% tax and 34% in child, so you can see that there from every dollar he earns. He works 10 days straight, very long hours, including on-call, and is out in all weathers. I believe he is being destroyed by the current child support system and he feels there is very little incentive for him to continue on working in this manner and getting nowhere. I notice that his personality has changed and that he is becoming increasingly anxious and depressed about his situation. I am very worried about him. However, what makes me really mad is that my grandson tells me about their mother and her new partner's three investment properties, their very large new home, their new car, and plasma t.v all this while my husband is in the kitchen sticking the soles of their shoes back on with superglue! Clothes are cast offs from others and what is sent down in the bag is nothing short of disgusting. It is left to me to buy pyjamas and other clothing items, as well as providing extra money for food and entertainment when they come to stay for the school holidays. I feel this situation is very wrong and that there should be some accountability about how maintenance money is spent. I am sure that I am not alone and that many grandparents are helping their sons the same way I have to. I would be interested to know in this climate of political largesse with public funds what tangible support is to be given to separated DADS-not the Dead beat DADs that people so often use to label them. Elizabeth Andrews I also now very briefly quote from another email I received, this one from a 70-year-old constituent of mine. He said: I am 70 years old in good health and I have worked hard all my life, taught in TAFE (Business) for 30 years, wrote 22 books for the students and started a network of Tax & Accounting offices in the last 15 years which numbered 22 at its high point-third largest in Australia. I am aware of your terrible accident which you have had to overcome, and, for the record when I now work with the pool I go very carefully with the chemicals. I am also a victim of the Child Support Agency. A precis of my CSA Matter. I have supported my twin girls since 1991 (now 17), and never missed a payment in all of that is very little left time, not one! I have been messed about by the staff at CSA for the last few years, they have sent me other peoples files, they have taken on average 80 days to answer correspondence. They have taken my tax refunds, they have taken my interest from the bank, they have made the most obvious mistakes and often not corrected them. When I took over the care and custody of one of the twins, they INCREASED my payments under the support scheme, and, then refused to reduce same! I wont go on you have seen it before-is there a minister or assistant that I can put this matter I have told this particular individual that there is, as I have told many such people. I have answered every email that has come to me, because I have a real concern as a member of parliament about the way in which the Child Support Agency in this country is operating and about the way successive governments and ministers of the Crown have allowed this to happen. They are killing males; they are sending males into institutions because they are having mental breakdowns. If something is not done about it we are going to have what can only be described as a catastrophe in the area of male health because of the pressure that is being put on them by the Child Support Agency. I intend to read as many of these case studies as I can over the next 12 months until such time as I bring the responsible ministers of the Crown to their knees and make them-forcibly, if I have to-do something about changing the culture and about removing the legislation that is obviously not being followed by the Child Support Agency with the best intentions of supporting children, as it was supposed to. This is not a Child Support Agency issue. It is now an issue centred on how much money and how many assets the payee gets from the payer. (Time expired) Economy: Performance",140
224,Mr BOWEN,ADJOURNMENT,"Prospect) (11.09 p.m.)Tonight I want to address some important issues for the people of Prospect and for the people of many other electorates in relation to economic management and to place on record some comparative figures with respect to economic indicators for various governments. During the last election campaign the government made all sorts of claims about its economic management. It ran very hard on interest rates. Everywhere to? you turned, you saw television and newspaper advertisements from the government spruiking that it was a superior economic manager and that interest rates would rise under a Labor government. The government campaigned on economic growth. Its television advertisements talked about 8Â½ years of uninterrupted economic growth. That is accurate. I take no issue with that. But there have been more than 8Â½ years economic growth. There have been 13 years of uninterrupted economic growth. If you looked at the advertisements, you would have thought that economic growth started miraculously in 1996. We have had consistent economic growth since 1991. But of course it goes further than that: economic growth under the Hawke and Keating governments averaged 3.7 per cent per annum whereas average growth under the Howard government has been 3.6 per cent per annum. These rates are similar, but the rate was higher under the Hawke and Keating governments. This would normally simply be a matter of historical interest, but the government made a lot of play on the fact that interest rates were higher under the Whitlam, Hawke and Keating Labor governments compared to what they have been whilst they have been in office. If they are going to start raising historical comparisons going back to 1972, the ledger has to be clear. All economic figures need to be compared and economic growth has been higher under previous Labor governments than it has been under this government. We all know that the matter of interest rates was a key issue in the election campaign. Again, the government advertised extensively, saying that interest rates had reached over 10 per cent under every Labor government since 1972. What those advertisements did not point out is that the official cash rate under the Fraser government was also over 10 per cent. The Treasurer at that time was none other than the honourable member for Bennelong. I think it is important to put these figures on the record, because economic management will be a key area of debate over the next three years and will certainly be a matter of keen interest for the people of Prospect. In the recent election campaign the Labor opposition had savings and reprioritisations to pay for its election commitments. The government did not. The government's economic policies are placing more pressure on interest rates and it will be very interesting see what happens to interest rates over the next three years. I certainly hope, on behalf of all the people who have heavy mortgages, that interest rates do not increase. One thing the government is right about is that a small increase in interest rates will have a big impact on members of the community. In 1996 the average mortgage in New South Wales was $118,000. Today that figure stands at $255,000. I will also deal briefly with the Howard government's management of the current account, a key economic indicator. The current account deficit is now as big as it has ever been. Exports are underperforming dramatically. However, the government cannot blame the terms of trade. The terms of trade indicate the value of goods that we export compared to the value of our imports. The terms of trade are not in the control of the government. Currently, the terms of trade are at 113.4, compared to 86.0 in December 1985. In the last current account crisis that this nation faced we had a terms of trade crisis. Today we face a current account crisis with our terms of trade figures the best they have ever been. The government are running out of excuses when it comes to economic management. They ran in the election campaign as being the better economic managers, but they are really becoming the emperor without clothes. We will be holding them to account over the next three years for their very poor economic management. They have overseen a reduction in investment in research and development and have taken a very ordinary approach in developing our elaborately transformed manufactures, which are the key to improving our export growth. While we have an economy which is continuing to rely on goods other than elaborately transformed manufactures, we are going to see a current to account deficit like the one that this government and this Prime Minister and Treasurer have been overseeing and we are going to continue to see the economy go down the perilous path it has been going down in recent weeks. Indi Electorate: Citizen of the Year Award",141
225,Ms PANOPOULOS,ADJOURNMENT,"A few months after my inaugural election I instigated an award open to all people in my electorate, the Indi Citizen of the Year award. I created the Indi Citizen of the Year award to provide an opportunity for people of north-east Victoria to celebrate the achievement and contribution of a local resident and to recognise a resident who could be a role model for all of us, particularly one who had not received formal recognition for their voluntary contribution to their local community. In my job, not a day goes past where I do not meet someone or hear of someone making an extraordinary contribution to the local community and through creating this annual award I was hoping to provide an avenue for us to identify and formally recognise, on an annual basis, an individual who has made a significant positive impact on my electorate of Indi. Selfreliance, self-help, personal sacrifice, reachhill. ing out to others, looking out for your neighbour and community works are true hallmarks of the people of the north-east. Those are the collective qualities that give enduring strength to the fabric that binds country communities together. It is this very spirit upon which the Indi Citizen of the Year award is based. Last year I was delighted to present the Indi Citizen of the Year award to Wangaratta resident Margot Ballard. Tonight I have great pleasure in declaring Helen Bird, a resident of Whitfield in the beautiful King Valley, the recipient of the 2003-04 Indi Citizen of the Year award. Helen is an absolute champion of the Whitfield community. She is secretary of the local Red Cross; she is heavily involved in the Greta Craft Group-one of the most effective women's support groups in the whole of north-east Victoria-she is secretary of the local golf club, which includes many of the menial jobs that not many others are prepared to undertake; she assists at the Whitfield Public School through helping young students with literacy programs and teaching them how to improve their literacy skills; and she displays a compassionate advocacy for the town's elderly residents and assists at the local community health centre in this regard. One resident of Whitfield told me that Helen is the glue that binds the community together and that she is a person who is always there to lend a hand, but never seeks to be thanked or rewarded. Without even knowing or realising it, Helen has done all she has for the local Whitfield community not for deeds or bouquets that may come her way but by striving, in the words of Ben Chifley in his famous 1949 âLight on the Hill' speech, for âthe betterment of mankind, not only here but anywhere we may give a helping hand'. Within the small Whitfield community, Helen Bird is one such light on the Without people like Helen Bird doing their bit for the people around them, rural communities will wither and die. It is no secret that the rate of volunteerism in rural communities is much higher than that found in the cities. Be it in the army of volunteer groups such as Rotary and Lions clubs, the Red Cross and other welfare organisations, the CFA and the SES, it is here where the true spirit of rural communities is found. Often within these groups are found true examples of community spirit. Helen Bird is such an example. I thank and commend Helen for the commitment and effort she gives to her local community in the beautiful King Valley. Whether it is a family crisis or a small personal problem, residents of Whitfield and the surrounding area know that they have a friend and an ally in Helen Bird, who will help to look after them. Tonight it is my great pleasure to officially award the 2003-04 Indi Citizen of the Year award to Whitfield resident Helen Bird. From the depths of my heart, thank you very much, Helen, for the work you have done for your fellow citizens in the King Valley. Education: Vocational and Technical Education",142
226,Ms BIRD,ADJOURNMENT,"Cunningham) (11.18 p.m.)Yesterday during question time the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education displayed quite extraordinary arrogance and, indeed, ignorance, all in the space of less than two minutes. This minister clearly shoots from the hip. In the Australian Financial Review on 30 November, the minister is quoted as pushing a particular company in the Illawarra as a possible interested party in the establishment of one of the government's proposed technical colleges. The problem is, of course, that the company knows nothing about this. It was a classic case of a new minister simply shooting from the hip on the issue, and yesterday in question time the minister confirmed that he was doing just that. This is what the minister told the Australian Financial Review on 30 November in a report titled âBusiness forced to fund training': I don't want to put any pressure on any people, but you may end up with a BlueScope Steel boilermakers college in the Illawarra ... Not surprisingly, this immediately attracted my attention. The minister claimed yesterday in answer to a question from me that he did not see the Australian Financial Review report. BlueScope Steel certainly saw the report and responded to my inquiries very clearly, saying that BlueScope has: ... not been able to ascertain that we have any formal discussions with the government about setting up a training college. That was the BlueScope response to me when I made inquiries of the company last Tuesday. The minister simply has no idea what is happening in the Illawarra to address the skills shortage crisis. Instead, he makes the claim that since the Howard government was elected in 1996 apprenticeships have increased by 202 per cent in my electorate. No, not an increase of 20 or 50 or 60 or even 80 per cent but 202 per cent since 1996. I will certainly be asking the minister to both fully detail and verify this claim in the future. That 202 per cent figure is certainly a mysteryas my colleague the member for Throsby would confirm-to businesses, trade unions, TAFE and other training organisations in Wollongong and the Illawarra. The Howard government has in fact ignored the growing skills crisis in Australia, and particularly in regions like ours, for the past eight years. Now it has dreamt up an inadequate and flawed response by establishing these technical colleges, one of which will apparently be located in the Illawarra. Where? We do not know, although I suspect it is more likely to be in a government held electorate in our area. Labor have been warning of this skills shortage crisis for a long time. We did it in the last parliament and I remember the discussions in the parliament prior to that. During the campaign I worked closely with the member for Throsby and our shadow minister at the time, the member for Grayndler, in talking to local groups. We had many meetings with them and raised the issue on many occasions. Last week the Illawarra Regional Development Board released a phase 1 report on the skills shortage in the Illawarra. It is a very compelling report. Perhaps the minbeen in ister would like to read it carefully. Aside from this recent report, local businesses, unions, TAFE, the University of Wollongong, training companies and regional development stakeholders have been actively talking about issues and pursuing innovations to address the skills shortage in our region. In the supplement in the Illawarra Mercury today there was an overview of what has been and still is taking place in the region to address the skills shortage in the Illawarra. There are pilot programs under way, auspiced by the Illawarra Business Chamber. The area consultative committee has gone to the length of establishing a skills shortage task force. We are dealing cooperatively with all the stakeholders involved. Instead of leadership, this minister-who I doubt has ever even visited our region-has displayed arrogance about what is happening in the Illawarra. He trumpets the 202 per cent figure. The minister should be aware that there is offence taken at this approach in my region when we are working so hard to seriously address the issue.  TAFE.",143
227,Ms BIRD,ADJOURNMENT,"Indeed. They cannot get into TAFE, and businesses cannot find apprentices. They are not creating skills task forces and developing major reports funded by local organisations in order to address a phantom problem. The minister should recognise this. The minister should stop speaking about our region in a flippant and ill-informed manner. On 1 April-and I acknowledge it was April Fools' Day- (Time expired) Road Safety",145
228,Dr JENSEN,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to address the issue of Australia's road safety performance in the last 10 years. This is basically the period since very harsh speed enforcement has become standard policy in the states. The states generally trumpet harsh speed enforcement for reducing the fatality rate on our roads. The reality, however, is that you need to have a look at the trend of Australia's road safety performance and contrast this with the OECD median. On that basis, we are doing relatively worse than we were 10 years ago. In other words, the fatality rate decrease that Australia has seen in the last 10 years has been less than the fatality rate decrease that has been noted in the OECD average. It is quite interesting to note that one of the scientists at the Monash University Accident Research Centre, Stuart Newstead, did a very comprehensive evaluation of the crashworthiness of cars. He found that, if you examine the improvement in crashworthiness between 1970 and 2000, two-thirds of the fatality rate reduction can be explained purely in the improved crashworthiness of cars. This does not consider improvements to the roads themselves. It does not consider improvements to cars' handling and braking capabilities or improvements in driver training that have taken place since then. This has to make you wonder about the value of the rigid speed enforcement policies that have been undertaken. The states Australia wide have used the results of a study by Kloeden and MCLean of the University of Adelaide. Their claim is that, for every five kilometre an hour increase above the speed limit, there is a doubling in the risk of a casualty crash. The simple fact is that this study has numerous significant faults. I have gone through the research report myself, and there are numerous procedural errors in the methodology used. Also, Minister Haermeyer of Victoria has claimed that recent speed camera versus speed radar tests that were undertaken show that the speed radar is three kilometres out in many cases. Mr Haermeyer makes the point that the speed cameras were fine when measured in the laboratory. Mr Haermeyer, the fact is that the real world is significantly different from the laboratory. For example, if cars are not travelling exactly parallel to the laneways then you will get an erroneous result. You also have factors such as radar scintillation which can cause erroneous results. Ministers need to accept these real-world errors. Another interesting factor that has come up-and this really demonstrates the need for improved driver training-is that the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in the United States did an evaluation of vehicles fitted with electronic stability controls, and found that the fatality rate in vehicles so fitted was 35 per cent lower than in vehicles without. This clearly indicates that there is potential to improve the fatality rate by 35 per cent by having improved driver training, because drivers will be able to use adequate skills to avoid crashes, rather than, in many cases, not having the skills and having crashes. In terms of road safety, we must make sure we measure what is important and not make important what we can measure. Speaker: Election  Speaker, I do not have much time but I do wish to convey to you formally my great pleasure in your elevation as Speaker. It is a great honour to be Speaker of this House. You follow a number of your predecessors from a distinguished career on committees. I have in mind in particular the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, where you served long and honourably and were held in affection by those committee members. Mr Speaker, I know that the job you have is a very important one because you have to uphold the rights and privileges of all members of parliament-especially backbenchers-but I would like to say that you occupy your high office with my best wishes and, I know, overwhelmingly, those of many of my colleagues. I would like to offer you my sincerest congratulations on your high office. Question agreed to.
