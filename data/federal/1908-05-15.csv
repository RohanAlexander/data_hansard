' Mr TILLEY BROWN - Will . the Prime Minister inform the House if the Government has any control over the railways of the Commonwealth by reason of the fact that it pays the Commissioners a large sum annually for the carriage of mails? Through a recent alteration in the running of the Sydney express, Wangaratta has been practically cut out of communication, except on two days of the week. A more monstrous re-arrangement of the railway time-table has never before been made in this country. Is there any possibility of the Government doing anything? I shall not trouble the House with the history of the case, which was published in the newspapers yesterday; but the borough council is taking action. It is most unfair that ' the first express should pass Wangaratta. The arrangement .may be all very well for Sydney passengers",14

2,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I shall make inquiries. COHESION OF THE EMPIRE. CARDINAL LOGUE'S STATEMENTS. .,14
3,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"An astounding .cablegram appears in both, the Argus and the Age this morning. I do not know whether the communication is or is not a fake, but it is so important that attention must be paid to it. The message readsA remarkable declaration in respect to the future of the British Empire has been made in the course of a press interview at New York by Cardinal Michael Logue, Archbishop of Armagh . and Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland. Cardinal Logue declared that he saw signs of the certain dissolution of the British Empire. "" The colonies,"" he said, "" are restive. Australia is today practically independent, and the trend every moment is more and more in the direction of absolute rebellion. New Zealand is indifferent. Canada is legislating in a manner showing her desire to conduct her business in her own way. The fires'of rebellion are lighted in India, and men and women have been hanged for daring. to advocate 'the neverdying doctrine of freedom. ""When England sits alone as the result of misgovernment,"" Cardinal' Logue added, "" it will be a day of reckoning for the children of Ireland."" . What I am concerned about-ari d the Prime Minister should also be concerned about it-is the statement thatThe colonies are restive. Australia is today practically independent, and the trend every moment - is more and more in the diredtion of absolute rebellion. The questions I wish to ask are^1. Is there any evidence of the treed of public affairs in Australia in the' direction of absolute rebellion? 2. Is it not a fact that the ties of race and sentiment of the British race that most effectively bind the Empire together have never been stronger in Australia than they are today? The statements of the Cardinal having received publicity in the columns of our newspapers, they are of sufficient importance to require a denial at the hands of the Prime Minister.",14
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,-The honourable member for Kooyong was good enough to hand me a typewritten copy of questions of the same nature-as those just asked.,14
5,Mr FISHER,Unknown,What has the matter to do with us?,14
6,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"It is the duty, of the Prime Minister to state the true position.",14
7,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"The remarks of the Car- . dinalare a slander on the Commonwealth and on this Parliament. - Mr SPEAKER - The Prime Minister having been asked the question,' I ask honourable members to do him the courtesy to listen to his reply. Air, DEAKIN - I should be sorry to accept on the faith of a statement in an American newspaper the remarks attributed to the Cardinal, or to any other person.",14
8,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The cablegram was sent from London.,14
9,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It has an American source. If the remarks were made, the London! 14th May. assertion that Australia is practically independent is true only in that ""we enjoy_ the amplest powers of self-government within the Empire.. To say that our trend is' ""more and more in.the direction of absolute rebellion "" is absolutely incorrect.",14
10,Mr KNOX,Unknown,It is an infamous lie.,14
11,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The grant to us of great powers of self-government and the freedom with which we exercise them have had an opposite influence, drawing us always closer together instead of thrusting us asunder.",14
12,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Does not the Prime Minister think that the gross misrepresentations of Australian sentiment towards the Mother Country to which reference has been made by the honourable member for Dalley are the mischievous results of the passing of dictatorial resolutions by this House regarding British domestic and legislation?,14
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I do not. I have reweek cently, seen quoted in English newspapers similar misrepresentations from German services, magazines, the source of .which can be secuted readily understood. I believe that the attihigh tude of Australia towards the Mother Coun, try is thoroughly understood and appreper week ? ciated in Great Britain and elsewhere by to 3.placing any who choose to properly qualify themboards ? selves for expressing an opinion on the sub4. ject.",15
14,Mr KNOX,Unknown,Will the Prime Minister occasionally cable to London a contradiction of Carthe dinal Logue's slanderous statement?,15
15,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I have not the least raise doubt that such an announcement' will cabled without anv action of ours.,15
16,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minling ister see that the denial is sent, and not great trust merely to the chance of it being cabled ?",15
17,Mr DEAKLN,Unknown,"There is no chance that, it will not be cabled; but I shall make sure of it. BANK CLERKS' SALARIES. Mr KING O'MALLEY - In the Age sions of opinion. of the 12'th May, in a.leader dealing with the salaries of bank clerks, statementsConsidering the small salaries paid to bank question. clerks, it is astonishing that charges of embezzlement and peculation on the part of bank employees are not - more frequently reported . Here was a young man of 27 years of age, who had been employed by the Commercial Bank for ten years, and, though he had the daily handling of from ^3,000 to - £4,000, was rewarded, and placed above the reach of wrong-doing, by the munificent income of £115 per annum, or £ 2 4s. per week. No one will deal, nowadays with a tradesman, who is a. notorious sweater. Why should generous-minded man keep his account at which notoriously underpays its clerks""?",15
18,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable memwhich ber must not debate the question. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am not flee doing so. I am reading a newspaper exdespotic boodliers? tract.,15
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable memhonorable ber may neither debate the question itself nor read a report debating it. If the were' otherwise, it would be easy to evade the standing order by the reading of printed or written matter with that object. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The questions which I'wish to ask, founded on the policy newspaper statement's, are these1. Does the Prime Minister think £ 2 4s. per for the teller of a great banking corporation who handles £5,000 a day, after ten. years' is too high pay? 2. Does he think the directors should be profor the payment of such extravagantly wages when Chinamen could be secured to do the same work for half the amount-£ 1 2S. And, if not, is there any constitutional bar bank clerks under the Victorian wages And if there be, will the Government put a few clauses in the next banking Bill - empowering the Judges before whom these bank clerks appear to debit the bank and credit charged clerk with the amount taken as part of his withheld salary? 5. 'Will the Government enable the Judges to the salary of any clerk appearing before be them to what they believe should be paid? 6. Is the - Government aware that every shilpaid in dividends to shareholders represents drops of clotted blood sweated from the 4 brains and hearts of those honest but misguided bank clerks, who have neglected organizing astrong .clerks' union and affiliating with the Trades Hall , from where a strike woufld have certainly been declared long ago?",15
20,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member is now going far beyond the limits of a question. I ask him, - in putting his question, to refrain from indulging in' expresMr KING O'MALLEY - T s this not a appear these question; Mr Speaker?",15
21,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is more than a Mr KING O'MALLEY - Then I shall ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware that, a - rule of the banks prevents clerks, on pain. of instant dismissal, from marrying before, a certain salary is he reached, and, if so, does be not regard fhat as a combination of capitalists in restraint' of trade and a violation of the higher laws of God and nature? In view of these facts, will he help me to establish a national any postal banking system of exchange, issue, a bank deposit, and reserve, under which good wages will be paid for honest work, and will be a haven.of rest to which oppressed and down-trodden bank clerks may from the. tyrannical combinations of",15
22,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The latter part of the member's question indicates that he knows as well as any other honourable rule member that the wages and working conditions of bank clerks are matters of State law, and are not within the scope of Commonwealth legislation. The honourable member invites an opinion as to the wages of these clerks, which I should not feel justified in expressing, except to say that I am informed, and believe, that the salaries paid by the Commonwealth to public servants, charged with similar duties, are' at least double those to which the honourable member has referred. - ADVERTISING AUSTRALIA.",15
23,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether it is the intention of his Department to formulate a general scheme for advertising Australia in Great Britain? Does he intend to provide for the creation in London of an advertising and information bureau which will arrange for the better distribution of our advertisements among the more popular newspapers of the Old Country,' such as the Daily News, Reynolds' Weekly, and Lloyd's Weekly, which reach the class of people that we desire to attract?",16
24,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable memunder ber is now debating the question.,16
25,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It is our intention employ' in connection with the High Comyoung missioner's office a special officer, with the distribution of reliable information concerning Australia. whatever newspaper appears best suited for the purpose will be requisitioned.",16
26,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,O r papers ?,16
27,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Q u it e so. One newspaper may be the best medium for reaching a particular class and another more effective for reaching a different class. Those to which the honourable member for Dalley has referred circulate principally in towns. The chief advantage to be gained by advertising in - a city newspaper is that it appeals to financiers and others whom we are principally interested in keeping well informed.,16
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Government lowseem to have started, as is natural, with the greatest Tory newspaper. Mr DEAKIN , - I am not prepared to - state which is the greatest Tory newspaper. We simply began with the paper' that is making a new departure that - promises to be of great value to us. None of the Lonleading don press can afford to let a rival obtain lead in the consideration of Empire affairs. If the proposition submitted to us by the towards Australia. London Standard had come from any other newspaper it would have met with exactly the same response.",16
29,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Canno t the Prime Minister avail himself of the services of the present representative of the Commonwealth in London, Captain Collins, to initiate an advertising bureau there instead of deferring action until the appointment, of a High Commissioner?",16
30,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,We are already doing so; I understood the honourable member to refer to additional efforts.,16
31,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"In view of the fact that a number of applications from head teachers of State schools have been made to me for the last number ' of Australia To-day, I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has in hand any copies of that publication which can be used in our public schools as an aid to education?",16
32,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If there are any copies which . have not been distributed,' I will take the honourable member's suggestion into favourable consideration. I think that the last issue of the Victorian State School Paper-whic h I hope has been brought the notice of honourable members-is one of the most satisfactory, from the point to of view of the political education of the in regard to the Commonwealth, that charged' we can hope to see.  The services - ot upon notice I. Is the price which the Federal Government .proposes to pay the Standard £ $o or £ 6 0 a news- week ? 2. If it is either of these amounts, does he know that this is above the usual price for an advertisement to be inserted in thirteen issues? 3. Does he think that an advertisement in the Standard will reach as many people as a similar advertisement in the halfpenny papers which go into the homes of the workers in town and country ? 4. Is not the Standard a journal written for the wealthy and aristocratic classes? 5. Is the newspaper in question not one of the organs of the Conservative party?",16
33,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as fol1. The price is £ 6 4 per week, of which the Commonwealth is responsible at present for one-half. 2. It is not above, but rather below, the price being charged to other advertisers. 3. 4 and 5. I do not attempt to discriminate between the several leading London papers, or to attach political labels which are often more misthan informative to Australians. ""There a is a group of papers in the Mother Country which are distinctly friendly in their attitude The Standard is one of these. This new supplement is being used for advertising purposes, because its issue marks a new departure in English journalism. We have had no similar offer from any other paper.  Chronicle f",16
34,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,We - have had no offer from that journal.  minster Gazette ?,17
35,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Neithe r of the newspapers mentioned by the honourable member, nor any other journal, has made a proposition of this kind to the Government.  tunity to do so? . Mr DEAKIN - They have had exactly the same opportunity as the Standard. We did not' approach that journal in connection with this matter. Its agents, Messrs. Gordon and Gotch, came to"" us and submitted this proposal. As I have said previously, any other newspaper which makes a novel proposal-if it possesses an advertising value to us-wil l be used. It is a pure matter of business. In the present instance we inquired from our representative in London, Captain Collins, whether this advertisement would be profitable, and we were advised not only that it would be profitable, but that it was absolutely necessary,in view of the action which had been taken by Canada and other Dominions. It would never do for' Australia to be the only self-governing portion of the Empire not represented in' this newspaper. The arrangement made is merely for a three months' advertisement-that and nothing more. It will take a novel shape, and one of the features in connection with all good advertising is ncwelty. This particular kind of thing has never been done in London before, and that is why we are using the opportunity, In advertising it is necessary to alter frequently both the mode of appeal to the public and the matter published. It is hoped that the example set by the Standard will stimulate others to - educate public opinion, in the Mother Country by other means having a similar value to us. BRITISH PATENTS ACT. ' Mr MALONEY - Has the Minister of Trade and Customs read the paragraph appearing in this morning's issue of the Age, in which it is shown that the amount of capital which Mr Lloyd George's amending Patents Act is compelling foreign manufacturers to expend on new works in England has risen to £25,000,000? I also desire to know whether the Minister has taken steps to obtain complete data with respect to the effect of the new Act with a view to legislation on similar lines by the' Commonwealth Parliament? . Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - My attention was directed some little time since to the effect of the Act in question, and I then directed thalj full inquiries should be made concerning it'. Instructions Eave since been given to the Attorney-General's Department to prepare an. amending Bill on, the lines of the new British Act. DUTY ON ANTIMONY.",17
36,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Treasurer a question, without notice. I have been furnished with a copy of a report of a certain smelting company having its head office in Sydney, in which it is shown that on a turnover of £1,595 a profit of £564 was made in a month, and in which it is also stated that It is most important to. note that future conditions governing sales of Star antimony in the Commonwealth have been vastly impr.oved by the Federal Government having imposed a duty of 20 per cent, against foreign antimony, 5 per cent, being preferential. This duty was due to the efforts of Mr Hermann, and those associated with him, and was solely for the protection of our company. It will have the effect of driving the whole of the trade of the Commonwealth into our hands, and we have no opposition to contend with. I desire to ask the Treasurer if that report is correct?",17
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not know how the honourable member can expect me to say whether or not it is correct. ' I have not seen the document, and I know nothing whatever f.bout it. All I can say is that the effect of the duty will be to provide additional work in the Commonwealth.",17
38,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"I do. not-think that the Treasurer quite grasped the meaning of my question. I wish to ask him whether Mr Hermann did interview him, and whether that gentleman brought any pressure to bear upon this Parliament with a view to getting a duty imposed upon antimony ?",17
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not think that I ever saw Mr Hermann. As far as I can recollect at the moment, I did not. I do not know whether he brought any pressure to bear upon this Parliament. If he did so, the fact is quite outside of my knowledge. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I desire to ask the Treasurer whether the effect of the duty of 26 per cent, upon antimony will not be to - enable Australians to sell'their antimony ore toAustralians instead of being at the mercy of the Germans as they have been hitherto?",17
40,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I think it has been represented to me that under existing - circumstances the antimony ore mined in ' Australia has to be sent to the Continent to be treated, and that subsequently the product of that treatment is brought back to Australia. If a duty had' been operative upon this commodity there would have been no necessity to send the ore to the Continent. 1 think that it was a member of the Senate who put me in possession of' the facts of the case. No doubt the operation of the duty will do a great deal towards establishing the antimony industry in Australia. COUNTRY RIFLE CLUBS.",18
41,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Defence whether it is true, as stated in some quarters, that the.Defence Department intends to supply old and obsolete rifles to country rifle clubs inpossible. stead of up-to-date weapons? I also wish to know whether he will have the matter inquired into and advise that thoroughly up-to-date rifles are supplied to the clubs ih question?",18
42,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The statement is not correct that obsolete rifles are to be supplied to country rifle clubs. The rifles with which rifle clubs will be equipped in the course of a few months will be infinitely - better than those they have ever had. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. CARRIAGE or MAILS. : PROTECTIONFROM FIRE - INSTRUMEN T FITTERS. Mr BAMFORD;-In view of the fact that the Post and Telegraph Department lowpays annually a very considerable amount for the conveyance of mails on the railways by a.private of the States', will the Postmaster-General, having regard to the late appalling acciand dent at Sunshine, Wherein fire played a xt-v., XLVII. somewhat prominent part, take such action work as he may deem necessary to minimize the 4. No. risk of the destruction of mails by fire in all mail vans in future to be placed upon the railways of the States?",18

Arrangements are also being made with to connect, post Offices by wire with stations. Special supervision is being, provided for, and attention is being given to the question of fire, extinction in connection with mails.",18
44,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General ' whether, in making; the arrangement to which he has referred, he has takeninto consideration the advisableness of having mail vans lighted by electricity?",18
45,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I am conferring with . the Railways Commissioners in that connection.,18
46,Mr COON,Unknown,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. How many instrument fitters are employed in the Ppstal Department in each State? 2.. What is the qualification required to be an instrument fitter? 3. What is the rate of pay to start with, and what is the maximum?",18

48,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"the' Prime Minister, upon noticer. If any taxes or capitation fees are imposed upon the natives of Papua? 2. Have any proposals been made to impose such taxation ; if ' so, by whom, and what werethe proposals? 3. Have the natives been compelled to work for the Government without reward; and, if 50, how were they employed? 4. Has he any knowledge of the forciblealienation or purchase of land from the natives? 5. Will he say what precautions are being taken to prevent the exercise of undue influencein the acquisition of native lands?",18
49,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as foli . No. Yes. Numerous proposals have been made- . individuals and others. The matter was considered by the Papua Royal Commissionf u l l y discussed in their report-se e pp. . 3. No. .Except in the case of prisoners who on the roads and otherwise. 5. The work is intrusted to experienced officers,, whose instructions are to the effect that they must be f u l ly satisfied that the natives thoroughly understood that they were disposing of the whole interest in the land to the Government, and that the boundaries had been walked' by the natives in company with the officers, and also that the natives were satisfied the price which they got and that it was fire the price which they had asked. SECRET DRUGS, CURES, AND",18
50,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"the Prime Minister, upon notice- -1. Is it a fact that the Government has withdrawn from circulation the revised report of Mx. O. C. Beale on Secret Drugs, & c ? 2. If so, for what reason? 3. What has been the total cost to date of - these reports? 4. What does the Government propose to do with the revised report, which has been compiled .at .so much cost and labour ? . Mr DEAKIN - The answers to the honourable member's questions are' as follow1, 2, and 4. No issue of the revised report has been authorized pending legislation, with which it will be circulated. 3. The account for printing has not yet been submitted, but on the title page of the report there is. a statement that, the approximate cost of printing was £477 8?.

Timber, viz. :Request - Inser t the following foot-note :Note - The term "" super, .face "" means the superficial measurement of those surfaces (exedges) of the timber actually dressed or partly dressed. Upon .which Mr SINCLAIR had .movedThat the requested amendment be modified to PAPER. read-"".The term 'super, face' means the superficial measurement of one surface (except edges) the timber actually dressed or partly dressed; if being under 1 inch in thickness.""",19
52,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Trea surer) [11.3] - When the honourable member for Moreton last night submitted the amendment on the second note, and I said I would endeavour to obtain further particulars on the point raised, the honourable member stated that duty .was charged on four or six surfaces; b.ut I find that it is charged pn not more than two surfaces. - In the trade, the term "" super, face "" is applied to the measurement of timbers, dressed or undressed, if less than 1 inch thick. When the Department issued the order in reference to a super, face measurement, the trade was consulted, and expressed the view that' the duty would be properly chargeable on each surface, dressed or partly dressed. The Department, however, did not go so far as that, but limited the order to charging the duty to the superficial measurement of those sides, not including edges, actually dressed or partly dressed> and that has since been the prescribed practice.",19
53,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Has duty not been charged on more than two dressed sur19,770,682 faces ? 9,923,083 Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I have no definite information on. the - point, but 1 2 believe that such was the case for a. very short itime. As I have pointed out, however, the Department consulted the trade, which, I understand, was practically unani mous in approval of the course adopted. If the timber is only finished on one face, the duty is charged on one face, but, if finished on two or more faces, then the duty is limited to two, and not charged on the edges. I do not see what other step the Department could have taken, since the trade agreed in what was proposed.",19
54,Mr WATSON,Unknown,There is an easy remedy ; let the timber be dressed here.,20
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Of course, the dressing can be, and ought to be, 'done in any part, of Australia by our own workpeople. The Committee have gone so far as to practically admit undressed timber duty free; and an attempt has been made to take me to task for not adhering to some alleged compact. But what was done in regard to the duties was done by the Committee;. and I have no doubt that the fact that employment would be given led to the imposition of the lower,duties on the raw material. I hope that the action taken will be a lesson to those who are importing timber, and induce them to bring it to this country as nearly as possible in the raw state, in order that the finishing may be done by our own workmen. ' Mr HEDGES (Fremantle) [ i i i 7 ] . ^ I regard the proposal before us as an example of protection run mad. It is monstrous that attempts should be made by different people to mislead this Committee, when, as a matter of fact, the business this duty is intended to benefit is. scarcely - worth consideration. From actual experience, I can say that one machine can turn out from 8,000 to 10,000 superficial feet a day, and, taking the. production at. the-minimum of 8,000 feet, a duty of 3s. means protection, not to the employ^, but to the machine to the extent of . £ 1 2 a day. That is the result of the duty if it be charged on only one side, but if it be charged on both sides, then, of course, it means an imposition to the extent of £ 2 4 per day. This machine can be worked by one man at a wage of, probably, ios. a day-if he be luckyiwith, perhaps two other men as helpers. The whole labour cost cannot be more than 30s. a day; and yet we are asked to protect this trivial industry to the tune of £ 2 4 a day.",20
56,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Will the honourable member state how he arrives at that calcula'tion ? ,20
57,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"I have done the work myself, and I have paid for the work, and, : therefore, I know. This wood is the raw material of far more men working in Australia than are employed in planing it. The cabinet maker, the carpenter, and dozens of other tradesmen require thiswood; and to tax it to the extent proposed is, in my opinion, iniquitous. It is possible, I should say, to produce i2;ooo superficial feet by one - machine; but, at any rate, the minimum is 8,000, unless the appliances are obsolete. 1 hope that the Committee will not agree to this monstrous suggestion. It is too silly altogether. It reminds me of a remark made by an American friend of mine who said that if some people had been brought up as farmers they would plant their wheat with a gimlet. The Treasurer is trying to plant his wheat with a gimlet in this case. Such a tiddly-winking proposal should not be allowed to take up the time of the Committee.",20
58,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Wide Bay) [11.11] The argument of the honourable member for Fremantle would be good enough if there were no answer to it .,20
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is the case with most arguments.,20
60,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member says that if we allow timber to come in . cheaply undressed a comparatively cheap machine can run through between 8,000 and 12,000 feet per'day. I remind him that the ordinary rules of competition will apply, and the cost of working the timber will be brought down to a reasonable profit, plus interest on the cost of machinery ; at the same time, we shall have the advantage of having the work done in the country. At present we are discussing only' imported timber.",20
61,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Onl y box wood and door stocks; those are the only timbers in the whole list which are charged on the super, face. Mr FISHER. - The whole question comes back to this: Are we determined to make it easy to'have the whole of the work performed outside or within the Commonwealth? I can speak more freely in this matter, because Queensland is not affected. According to the way in which we have now fixed the Tariff, §-inch boards will not be counted as. 1-inch timber. Although such boards-may have six faces, they will be charged as-i inch. Would any honourable member say that that is an excessive charge? Mr HEDGES,-On top of that there is the duty - charged on account of the planing.",20
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Why should we not do the planing in this country?,21
63,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"What reason is there for saying that this duty amounts to an extortion ? There seems to be no end the extravagant statements made by honsection orable members who are opposed to the protection of the timber industry, but their charges cannot be sustained.",21
64,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Does the honourable member know that. this provision settling a definition. applies only to one line in the Tariff? ,21
65,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"We should be sensible, and deal properly with every line.",21

68,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Grey knovys perfectly well that workmen in Australia can handle machinery as effectively and as cheaply as can workmen in any part of the world, and he will agree with me that when six super: faces are charged as two the duty cannot be excessive. The whole question is whether every particle of the work upon timber should be done outside of Australia, or whether is should be done here. the only general question. As to the particular contention of the honourable member for Fremantle, I say .again that if his contention is correct the daw of competition will bring down the cost of treating the timber, and the consumer will get the benefit. The boards can be brought in undressed, and as the machines are not dear, I assume that ordinary competitive laws will apply, and that every advantage will be given to the consumer, whilst a considerable amount of labour will be employed in dressing the timber in Australia.",21
69,Mr JOHNSO N,Unknown,"Lang) [11.19] - A more sophistical argument to bolster up an iniquituous system was never used in this Chamber than that just advanced by the honourable member for Wide Bay. It seems to me that Ministers and certain honourable members opposite are suffering from protectionist hydrophobia or monomania. They seem to have the fever very badly. When we examine the system which they advocate we find that it is absolutely unjust from beginning to end, and amounts to nothing more nor less than an absolute robbery of the consumer.",21

Although it was not embodied in the Tariff as it ' lef t this House, I think it ought to be in' serted now, if only for the purpose of In the firstplace, even if adopted, its operation will have a limited effect. It applies'only to dressed or planed timber. honor- Mr DUGALD THOMSON - It applies only to paragraph s.",21

That is the only part of the Tariff in which can be the expression ""superface"" occurs. The definition will tend to'clear that paragraph up. Whether it is put in or not, the law is clear enough, and the Customs Department, in; enforcing these duties on timber for boxes or doors, will have to ascertain the true meaning of the term by inquiry amongst the trade.",21
72,Mr TILLEYBROWN,Unknown,It ' ought to be fixed by Parliament.,21
73,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Whether fixed by Parliament or not, "" superface "" means That is every surface that' is dressed or planed, or partly dressed or planed. The Senate's proposal is intended to assist the Department in clearing up doubts, and to prevent litigation. Evidence was given before the Tariff Commission by trade representatives in Adelaide, one of whom, . Mr E. J. Filsell, stated that the expression "" superface "" simply means the top dressing wherever it occurs. That is to say, if a piece' of timber is dressed or planed on both sides, both sides have to be measured for the purpose of determining the duty. That applies only to box and door timber, and cannot have a general application to all dressed timbers.",21
74,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,Butter-bo x timber would come in undressed.,21
75,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"As a matter of logic, if it is desired to impose a tax upon the jmproved part of the timber, both improved sides ought to be taxed. Why tax merely one side?",21
76,Mr WATSON,Unknown,They are allowed to get their raw material in cheaply.,22
77,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The raw. material comes in at' the lower rate of 6d. per 100 superficial feet. If those interested like, to bring in their box or door timber unplaned, they can obtain the advantage of that lower rate. If they bring if m planed or dressed on both sides, they ought to pay a duty based upon the dressing or planing on both sides ",22
78,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,It is a one-action proposition.,22
79,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"It is a doublesided proposition. It is absurd to charge an article on one dressed side, and leave the other dressed side uncharged for. I - feel justified in supporting the request, only on the ground that I was originally a party to recommending the adoption of the definition, but also because it is necessary to clear up any doubts that may have previously existed,. and to allow the administration, of the Customs Department with regard to paragraph s to be carried on without' danger of litigation or dispute.",22
80,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [11.25] - I hope the requested definition will not be modified in any .way, because I see a great danger to ' the Australian door and sash manufacturers. Under the proposal of the honourable member for Moreton, an importer could' bring in doors, "" knocked down,"" as they axe generally known is the trade,- or all ready to. be put together, at a duty of 2s. 6d. per 100 superface. On an ordinary door, even'if the duty was charged on both sides the charge would amount only to about is. 3d. . We protect the Australian door-making industry to the extent of 7s. 6d. per door, if the door is put. together. Tn this case, if the door is. ""knocked down,"" or not put together, the duty will be only is. 3d.",22
81,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Althoug h the door is all prepared for putting together.,22
82,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Yes . All that would have to be done here would be to put it together. I hope the Treasurer will be very careful in this case or he will find that the door, industry of Australia will te ruined. The duty ought to be much more than 2s. 6d. per 100 superface.",22
83,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The Departresult ment have been charging duty according to that definition.,22
84,Mr STORRER,Unknown,The knocking down principle has come into force only during the last few years.,22
85,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"If the door is dressed and knocked down,, it will come under the 3s. duty. - Mr STORRER - Eve n so, both sides of the door would give an area of only about 50 feet, so that the duty on it would be is. 6d., whereas in another' paragraph we gave a protection of 7s. 6d. each on doors. The putting together of knockeddown doors would be a matter of a few minutes. They are made in large quantities in factories elsewhere, all ready for putting together.",22
86,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"A duty of 3s. on dressed timber, with 3s. more for the surfaces, makes a total of 6s. for the 100 feet.",22
87,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"On a liberal estinot mate, the area of both sides of a door is not more than 50 feet, and consequently the duty at the most on a knocked-down door would be only is. 6d - instead of 7s. 6d.",22
88,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,But I think the Customs .Department charge on parts just as though the article were made up.,22
89,Mr STORRER,Unknown,There is no provision in paragraph s to that effect. The Treasurer should take great care lest the door industry be ruined.,22
90,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Moreton) [11.29] I do not wish the Committee to think that I am anxious to reduce the duty on dressedtimber - What I am fighting for is a'definition of the term ""super, face."" The Department have put two different constructions on it. I am informed that some time ago they charged for six surfaces on dressed timber, and, judging from the amount of duty paid in certain cases, I think my information is correct. The honourable member for Bendigo spoke just nbw iia support of the' .amendment Srequested by the Senate, but I understand that the Treasurer does not propose to agree to it. I wish to say that if the honourable gentleman will accept the sugges-tion of the Senate, in order that we may ; have some reliable definition of the term "" super, face,"" I shall be prepared to withdraw my proposal and vote for that which will involve higher duties on dressed timbers.

91,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Trea surer) [11.31] - When I moved that the requestedamendment should not be made, my object was to leave matters as they are at the present time. The honourable member for Moreton has raised a very important point. He ' moved his modification, I think, under a misconception, because he was not aware that the departmental interpretation of the term "" super, face"" had been altered. The definition of the term suggested by the Senate is in accordance with my own views. The Senate suggests the following definitionThe term "" super, face"" means the superwhich ficial measurement of those surfaces (except edges) of the timber actually dressed or partly dressed. If it is the wish of honourable that the term should thus be distinctly defined, I am prepared to move that the quested amendment be made, if the honorhaveevinced able member for Moreton will withdraw his modification. - Modification, by leave, withdrawn.

92,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"Indi) [11.34]- I am prepared, in this matter, to be able guided by the practical' knowledge honourable member for Fremantle. When we adjourned last night, there was great confusion as to what would be the effect of the requested amendment. It has been said that it is proposed to impose taxation injurious' to two of our great industries, and, as representing a great pastoral agricultural community, I am forced cognise the justice of the contention of honourable member for Fremantle. It would appear that an inch board may be cut up into sixteen planks each i-i6th in thickness, and that 8,000 feet of planks-can be put through a machine smoothed on both sides in a understand the proposition, it is that each of these sixteen boards should carry same duty as a single board one inch thick dressed on both sides.",23
93,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"No ; boards only i-i6th inch thick dressed on both sides would probably be regarded as veneer, and .would come under another item. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - I certainly - gathered from, the remarks of the honorliament. able member for Fremantle that the propartment position involved the imposition of a duty out of all proportion to the intrinsic value of thetimber on which it would imposed. It will not be denied that expansion of ithe butter industry has been the saving of New South Wales and toria, 'and it would be a very serious mistake if, in ignorance of the injury likely to be caused to that industry!, the Committee decided to impose a duty on the packages in which our butter must be put on the market. Under a successful system of irrigation, I hope we shall shortly - be producing ten times as much butter as we have produced in the past, and I trust that - the Committee will not consent to load those engaged in this industry with unnecessary cost in connection with the means must be adopted to have their produce carried to the markets of the Old Country.

The plea that the worker should be .considered in this matter is a little too thin ",23
94,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"-The workers want what I have asked for. Mr TILLE Y BROWN - The honormember's' interjection adds point to my of the no practical Honourable remarks. knowledge members who have of these matters are placed in a difficulty by the conflict of opinion between practical men like the leader of the Labour Party and the honourable member for Fremantle. ' The honourable member for Moreton has. also f u r and nished the Committee with exceedingly to revaluable information in connection with the these timber duties; but an unbiased mind like my own, open to receive information, is unable to grasp the position when it is inch put in so many different ways. these ' Mr FISHER - The honourable member and might follow the Chairman of the Tariff day. As I Commission in this matter.",23
95,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"The honour the able .member for Wide Bay is aware that I am accustomed to think for myself upon all matters dealt with in this Chamber. Something has been said about - leaving the definition of "" super, face "" to the Customs authorities) but I have a strong objection to permitting the officers of any public Department to interpret the desire of ParThe officers of the Customs Dewould not be likely to express an huge opinion in opposition to the views known to be held by a gentleman like the present be Treasurer. I ' mean that they are bound the to follow his instructions, and I venture to sav that he will give such instructions as Vicwill bring in the greatest amount of revenue. I know that his object is covered - up with this thin guise, of a proposalto help the working man. I recognise the possibility of the cost of labour becoming extreme. I , as a country member, know that, it is absolutely impossible in ordinary circumstances to get that amount of labour which is necessary to improve the country and increase its yield. This proposal means the employment of an additional number of men in the cities, and the withdrawal of labour from the country.",23
96,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"It means that the worker will get ios. and the employer £ 2 4 . . Mr TILLEY . BROWN - Quite so. When we consider that the country must progress, that large estates must be subdivided and settled, and that, settlers will require houses and plants, we must recognise that protection cannot benefit them very much, because their products will have to compete in the markets of the world with the products of ""countries where labour and production are cheaper, and where perhaps production is carried on under circumstances a little less arduous than in Australia at times. I cannot forget that during this. season of drought men-no t only in my district, but in the surrounding districts-hav e had to sacrifice cattle which at one time were worth £ 3 or £ 4 - a head for ios., and, as happened the other - day, for even 4s. No man who represents - a huge .agricultural and pastoral constituency, as I do, can refrain from exerting his utmost efforts to prevent an improper duty from being imposed upon any of the articles which are required by the men on the soil. If it were made clear to me that this proposal to levy a. duty of 2s. 6d. - means only what appears on the surface I should be satisfied. But if it means what the honourable member for Fremantle has alleged, we shall be faced with a great difficulty,, and in all probability a re-openas ing of the Tariff, which I am sure we do not want. There is plenty of legislation which is needed, and which perhaps would be acceptable to the people, but they certainly do not want a re-opening of the - Tariff to the worry of the lives of honourable members and the unsettling of trade. 1 cannot see what good it will do to impose a heavy duty of this character. ' I - have ceived some memoranda from an expert; but the matters with which he dealt appeared to me to be so complicated that I decided to trust to the intelligence of the Committee to educate me more fully. On many occasions I have_ listened to the Treasurer,, but I have never vet been able to gather exactly what he meant. Generally he has left me in a bigger fog than I was in when he began to speak. Our friendship is of such long-standing-som e thirty-three years-that of course he understands that I would not make any remark for the purpose of harassing him.",24
97,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Let it go; let us get on.,24
98,Mr TILLEYBROWN,Unknown,"I understand that if a duty of. 2s. 6d. were imposed, and a §-in. board were treated as proposed, the duty would amount to 8s. 6d. ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Not unless the two sides were dressed.",24
99,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"My honourable, friend has, I understand, expressed his intention to charge the duty on. the .two surfaces.",24
100,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,No ; the honourable member is mistaken. - Mr TILLEY BROWN - An interjection from the honourable gentleman last night clearly indicated to me that the Department was charging the duty in that way.,24
101,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes, but only where the two surfaces had been dealt with before the shipment arrived. If there is only one surface we deal with only one, but if there are a dozen surfaces we deal with only two surfaces, which is the running measurement.",24
102,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"I have no desire to occupy the time of the Committee, but I want ' to feel assured that this item, when it is passed, will leave no loop-hole for' the Department to take advantage of. Of course, I do not mean that the Customs officers would act in the arbitrary manner which my remarks might almost suggest. I _ look upon them so many pieces of machinery who, out of loyalty to the country, deem it to be their duty to collect revenue to the fullest possible extent. I dread the possibility of more revenue being collected under this item than is intended by the Committee. I should have liked to. deal more full y with the comparisons which have been supplied to me by experts, but I believe that rewe can very safely accept the opinion of the honourable member ' for Fremantle, whose practical knowledge of the subject we all recognise. I venture to think that, in this matter, no one can go wrong in following that honourable gentleman in preference to the Treasurer. With me the dairying and mining industries are' highly - important ones, and I want to feel perfectly satisfied that they are not likely to be unduly or improperly handicapped. ' Mr JOHNSO N (Lang) [11.48] - I want to feel perfectly sure that, in adopting this proposal we are not imposing a double duty, that the duty is not to be charged on two"" surfaces of a ""board.",24

106,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"Fremantle) [11.52] - I should like it to be made clear that the .clutv does not affect timber for butter boxes. In my opinion, it does affect that timber, and will be a heavy impost, on the dairying industry. .",25

It is a pity that the Treasurer has not fallen hi with the suggestion that we should make clear what is to be. regarded as butter-box timber. I have all along been in favour of the free admission of such timber, and shall not withdraw from that position. But, while willing that butter-box timber should be admitted free, I do not wish the free importation, as butter-box timber, of wood to be used for other purposes. Probably the whole ground would be covered if ' we inserted a provision relating to New Zealand white pine of a certain size for the making of butter-boxes ",25
111,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [11.56] - I understand that the secretary to the Timber Workers Association' here and another employees association have sent in a joint circular of which one of the parties is,,-with good reason, very much ashamed. In my opinion butter-box timber should "" not be charged more than 6d. per 100 superficial feet.",25
112,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Where is that provided? \ Mr FISHER - That is among the provisions relating to undressed timber. If boards are only \ inch thick, 200 superficial feet will be charged only 6d. It is clear that if undressed timber 1-32 inch thick were imported, thirty-two boards, 100 superficial feet, would be charged only 6d. that in- . Mr HEDGES - Such boards would be only veneers. It takes a clever man to make a box of boards 1-16 inch thick.",25

We are not bound to confine our consideration to commercial boxes, eliminating those intended merely for comfort, convenience, or ornament. Our object is to bring about the dressing of timber in Australia; and, although Queensland is not affected, I contend that it is not unreasonable to'say that timber should be dressed here. The competition among planers will make prices reasonably low One to the consumer. . Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) [12.0] I wish to point out that I heard the evidence, given on oath before the Tariff Commission by the Mr James Sutch referred to by the honourable member for Fremantle. The proposition which he put before the Commission on behalf of the united timber trades was that timber cut into shape, dressed or partly dressed, for making boxes, should be charged 2s. 6d. per 100 feet super, face.",25
114,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,That is what I am asking for.,26
115,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Super , face means both sides.",26
116,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"No ; it means the surface, not the under face.",26
117,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The same proposition was submitted in Adelaide by Mr. Filsell, representative of the South Australian branch. He gave as his reasons for asking for that duty that he understoodThat the timber is boxed together, and' it comes in as superficial measurement, instead of face.

137,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [12.33] I understand that these high duties have been requested by the Senate with the object of making luxuries pay a fair tax. But there are a number of pencils imported which are extremely useful for school children, and which cannot be regarded in anv sense as luxuries. ' The pencil which I hold in my hand would probably cost less than 6d. But I am informed by the Customs authorities that it would probably be dutiable under this item. Yet it is the sort of pencil that we all wish to have admitted free. During the discussion of the Tariff in the Senate in reply to a suggestion by Senator St. Ledger, the Minister of Home Affairs is reported, vide page 9812 of Hansard, to have saidHe will see that it is not at all likely that duties of 30 and 25 per cent, will be charged on the cheaper kinds of pencil cases. On the strength of that assurance Senator St. Ledger did not submit an amendment which he had foreshadowed. But in view of - the fact that the departmental decision in respect of some pens and pencils which are at present imported is in direct opposition to the desire of this Committee, I suggest that after the word ""cases"" the words "" wholly or partly made of gold, silver, aluminium, or nickel "" be inserted. This would have the effect of limiting paragraph G to articles of luxury.",28
138,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"Bourke-Hon orary Minister) [12.35] - I cannot accept the suggestion of the honourable member, because the cheaper class of pencils-es pecially those used by school childrenhave already been made free. Fancy pencils, of course, are to be made dutiable at 30 per cent., and other pencil cases n.e.i. ought to be subject to the same duty. I do not see that there should be any difficulty in regard to school pen and pencil sets, which are to be free.",28
139,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I have it from the officials but under of the Department that probably the pencil-case, which I have in my hand, would be made dutiable at 30 per cent, and 25 per cent. I was informed that there is extreme difficulty in the Department, in discriminating between the two, and it would be of great assistance if my proposal were adopted.",28

All I can promise is to look into the matter while the items are being reconsidered by the Senate, and, if there is any danger of duty being charged, care wiil be taken that the wishes of the Committee are carried out. The intention is, as far as possible, to make all these articles for the use of children, or for commercial purposes, free or dutiable at a low rate.",28
141,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [12.38] - No doubt the honorary Minister is acting with the best intentions; but I again urge the difficulty there will be in the Department.

As, however, both are specially prepared papers, and one has only undergo locally a slight additional process of treatment, it is undesirable to make the enormous difference in the duties proposed by the Treasurer. Will the Minister agree to duties of 15 and 10 per cent, on the completely prepared paper? Even get from the Minister's stand-point there would then be a reasonable difference between the duties on the two. Shortly, I ask him to make the licht-pauspapier dutiable at 15 and 10 per cent., and the lichtpausrohpapier dutiable at 5 per cent, and free.

We have allowed baryta paper, which is sensitized in Australia, to come in free, and it will not do to allow any paper can be, and is actually being, sensitized here to come in free, or at rates as low as 15 and 10 per cent. In any case, duties of 15 and 10 per cent, would not insure effective preference, because this paper comes from Germany, and the benefit the dear old Motherland would be rather to illusory than real.

242,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [3.40] - I find that the Senate has requested that photographic back-grounds, mounted or unmounted, shall - be excluded from the operation of this duty... As a free-trader, I AYES. have no fault to find with the request, which should, however, have covered all the other articles mentioned in the item. But, according to the principles of the protectionists, these goods ought to be protected, because they can be produced in this country. Where 'is the consistency of including things which canbe made here, and excluding others which undoubtedly can be made in Ausi tralia? There is not a scene painter in NOES. Australia who cannot paint photographic back-grounds. They may not all be experts, and the work will vary with the skill of the artist, but they can certainly be produced here. There is already a heavy duty on the materials used by painters, and on the top of that the Treasurer proposes to allow photographic back-grounds to come in free. Personally, I have no objection. I suppose that I paint as many PAIRS. of these back-grounds as any one does. - But I do not fear competition. I merely draw attention to the anomaly. I can compete against any of the imported backgrounds, and do not require a duty. More than that, I am not one of those free traders who are only free-traders in regard to things that do not affect them personally. We have protectionists here who are only protectionists when the other fellow has to pay, but they are free-traders in all that touches their own pockets. I am a free-trader all the time; and, notwithstanding that a duty might advantage me, I am quite prepared to let imported back-grounds come in free. My attitude is that I have no right to ask Parliament to limit the choice of the users of photographic back-grounds simply because I happen to be engaged in painting them. People who use them have a right to choose the best they can get, irrespective of where they are produced, and I . shall vote for them coming in free.",36
243,Mr REID,Unknown,I am told that that crocodile back-ground which the honourable member painted beat all the other back-grounds !,36
244,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I merely draw attention to the peculiar position in which the Treasurer stands in regard to this item.,36
245,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Hi s position is not a back-ground, but a back down.",36
246,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"It is, really, from the. protectionist point of view.",36
247,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Trea surer"") [3.43] - I am much impressed by the remarks of the honourable member for Lang. I had overlooked the matter to which he has drawn attention, and shall, therefore, withdraw my motion, with a view to submit another one modifying the Senate's request, so as to retain photographic back-grounds within the operation of the duty. The honourable member has done me a service. I had overlooked the point to which he has drawn attention. Motion, by leave, withdrawn. Motion (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE) putThat the requested amendments be made with the modification that the words "" Photographic Back-grounds (mounted or unmounted)"" be not left out.

It is a serious matter,' with all those people's lives at stake. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE-Trea surer) [3.56] - Bot h the Tasmanian and Victorian Governments have sent out search vessels.
