1,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown," This is the first occasion since I entered public life that I have asked the indulgence of the House to make a personal explanation. I do so now because of the remarks of the Prime Minister last night as to something which he stated I had said. As I thought at the time that I might unwittingly have uttered what I did not intend, or might have conveyed a wrong impression, I waited until this morning to reply, so that I might see the official report of my speech. I find, on reference to it, that I used these wordsIt is the duty of the Government to insist on the reasonable despatch of public business. This is the second occasion on which I have entered my protest, and if the conditions to which I object are allowed to continue, I shall take the very first opportunity that presents itself to express by my vote a very decided opinion about the matter. I have no hesitation in saying that if such an occasion again arises the Government should not allow the Opposition to determine, so to speak, the hour at which the consideration of public business shall cease. I object to any Government allowing the Opposition fo determine the conduct of business in this House - I stated last night that I had on a former occasion- I think when a previous Government was in power-pro tested against the waste of time which we have had this session. What I meant when I referred to my vote was that I felt that I had not done right in assenting to the proposition that the honourable member for Bourke should be allowed to continue a speech today which he might have attempted to conclude in the three-quarters of an hour then available to him. had nowish to convey to the Government the intimation that I would at some future time vote against the principles to which I am committed, in order to wreak vengeance upon them, and to gratify a feeling-of resentment or pique. Those who know me are aware that, no matter where I may sit in this Chamber, I shall never allow personal feeling to lead me to commit a violation of my principles. I felt somewhat hurt, therefore, that the Prime Minister should have thought that I was making a threat.",12
2,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,We accept the honourable member's apology.,12
3,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,"I am not making an apology. It will be generally admitted .that a.m., I do not hesitate to say what I mean, and what-1 wished to convey last night was that I was sorry that I had agreed to allow the honourable - member for Bourke to further waste public time by continuing' his speech today.",12
4,Mr REID,Unknown," At the time, I 'thought that the honourable member for Moira was making a threat as to what he would do with the Government, and I am sure that'he would be the first man to feel that under such circumstances I would have been less than a man had I tamely submitted to it. His observations as to the value of public time, and the need for pushing on with business, are such as no one can take the slightest exception to. FREMANTLE FORTIFICATIONS.",12
5,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,I wish to know from the Minister of Defence if he has any further information to give the House with reference to the gun which is to be transferred from South Australia to Fremantle?,12
6,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"In the event of the Fremantle fortifications being proceeded with, it is proposed to transfer there from Adelaide a mark 7, 6-inch breech-loading gun, which is the latest pattern of breech-loading gun used for land service by the British Army. The honourable member therefore need have no fear that the weapon will be obsolete. Mr CARPENTER' - What about the carriage ? - Mr MCCAY - I forget the technical description of the gun mounting, but I can assure the honourable member that it will be of modern design. I MINISTERIAL STATEMENT.",12
7,Mr REID,Unknown," I promised last night to make a statement this morning with reference to the conduct of public business, but as I understand that it is the intention of the Opposition to make another attack on the position of the Ministry on Tuesday next, I think it better to postpone what I have to say as to the business of the session until that attack has been disposed of. - CONVERSATI ON INTHE Mr SPEAKER. - Since the business of ,the day was called on, I have been waiting for three honourable members who were conversing across the Chamber to cease before asking the honourable member for Kooyong to proceed with the question of which he has given notice. 1 hope that conversations of this kind will not be repeated. I make that request: in the interests of order, and of honourable members themselves. LETTER - B OX CLEARANCES ",12
8,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"the Postmaster-General, ufon notice- . 1. ' If he. is,aware that the withdrawal of the late clearances of letters has created great inconvenience' in several of the suburbs of Melbourne ? 2 - As presumably .the Department does not wish to reduce postal facilities to the public, what are his fntentions in regard to this matter?",13
9,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :- . r 1. The Postmaster-General is aware that complaints have been made through the newspapers, that inconvenience has been caused by an earlier clearance of letters in some parts of the suburbs of .Melbourne, and also that, in - some instances, such complaints .were made in'suburbs which were not affected, and in which no change has been made. The earlier clearance has been made experimentally in order that letters posted in the suburbs for Ballarat, Bendigo, and intermediate places, might have the advantage of despatch by the trains leaving at 2 a.m. 2. It is not the desire of the Department duce postal facilities to the public, but rather to increase such facilities, and it is the intention of the Postmaster-General to inquire full y as.to the night clearances, with a view to make them as convenient as possible to the whole of the persons affected, and to ""secure the early despatch of the letters posted at night in the suburbs. NA , - ENCOURAGEMENT BILL. Debate resumed from 20th October (vide page 5895), on motion by Sir WILLIAM LYNEThat the Bill be"" now read a second time.",13
10,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURES," Some complaint' was made last night about what was termed the w i l f ul delay of the Opposition in dealing with this measure, and that sentiment has found further expression this morning. I,t is rather singular that those who have' made the complaint are for the most part absolutely opposed to the Bill , Manufactures [REPRESENTATIVES.] Encouragement Bill. while those who are supporting it have had CHAMBE R. nothing whatever to say on the subject. The honourable member for Moira has told the House that I have been wasting public time, and that he felt that he had neglected his duty in not compelling me to conclude my speech last evening. If he feels so keenly about the waste of public time, why did he not protest in his place yesterday when another matter",13
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Is the honourable member in order in replying to a personal explanation ? , %",13
12,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"I was on the point of calling the attention of Ihe honourable member for Bourke to the fact that he must discuss the Bill , and not the conduct of the honourable member for Moira. A personal, explanation may not be d'-'bated.",13
13,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Of course, I bow to your ruling, Mr Speaker, but the honourable member for Moira was one of those who complained of my action in wasting public time.",13
14,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,The personal explanation of the honourable member' for Moira may not be debated.,13
15,Mr HUMECOOK,MANUFACTURES,"I did not desire to refer to his personal explanation, but to what he said last evening. However, the matter is of no great importance. The fact' is 'that a great deal of time was deliberately wasted yesterday by those who complained of my action. I was willing to proceed with my speech, but at twenty minutes tQ eleven .o'clock, when the debate was. ad; to re- jou'rned, the House was tired, and honourable - members wished to go home. . The importance of this measure warrants us in occupying some little time in discussing it. Its issues, are so wide, and the ambunf of money proposed to be expended is, com-j paratively speaking, so large, that I , for one, would be the last to complain of a full - - and fair consideration, of the whole, pro-' posal. Then, too, the Prime Minister lasf SECOND READING. night made a very vigorous attack upon theprinciples of the measure, and as the report of his speech wil] be sent all over the Commonwealth, those who differ from him have surely the right to state their views', at reasonable length. I do not know'how the Minister of Trade and Customs feels in regard i o the matter; but I should"" think that,' after the attack which was made on the principles of ' protection, and - QÂ£ bounties, which I imagine are dearest to his heart, he will be induced to put beforethe House the opinions of the other half of the Government on this subject. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member is stating the Minister's views for him.",13
16,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member for Parramatta reminds me of those insect pests in the district which he represents, which spoil all that they do not destroy. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Ver y severe; but it comes from an insect.",14
17,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURES,"I asked why it is that free-traders who oppose the Bill continue to repeat the question. ""Why is there a need for a bonus?"" the They affirm that our deposits very large, that their quality has been proved beyond doubt, that there is a certain marhad ket here for the iron that may be produced, and that under these circumstances there is a good opening for capitalists withwithout out State assistance in any shape or form. ber. These statements are pertinent, and require to be answered, and I shall endeavour, the best of my ability, to reply to them. first answer lies in the fact that the ness of manufacturing iron is distinct from unfairly. almost every other. It requires the investment of a large amount of capital-a amount so large that probably no indivitioned dual would be prepared to enter upon it. Those who might be disposed to combine gether upon a co-operative basis, or upon the share system, would naturally be timid about incurring a large outlay unless they had some assurance that they would be able to obtain a satisfactory price for their goods.",14
18,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURES,"Are not those good argumight ments in favour of nationalizing the indusagreeing try? ; Mr HUME COOK - If the honourable member will kindly wait until I have cluded my remarks, he will find it been unnecessary to ask that question. Those who are most deeply interested in the industry, of Australia are the importers, and we know . from, past experience that whenever an attempt is. made to bring locally-produced goods into competition the imported article, the-importers combine together with the object of crushing out the rangement. local production. Evidence was given before the Iron Bonus Commission, that the price of iron, which stood at purchase Â£ 8 per ton, was reduced to Â£ 3 ios. per ton immediately local competition was tened in New South Wales. As a consethough quence of this the local iron works be closed down, and upon the local compeoperations tition being swept away prices were restored to the original figure. Evidence to this effect was given by Mr Robert Morison,. on the 16th May, 1903, at questions 2259 and 2260. Mr Morison saidWhen we were producing iron in the Fitzroy district, pig iron cost about Â£ 8 a ton; but afterwards it fell to about Â£ 3 ios. a ton, and that caused the works to be closed.",14
19,Mr LONSDALE,MANUFACTURES,Was not that reduction owing to a general fall in the price of iron last night all over the world ? Mr HUME. COOK - No ; not at that time. It was the result of an attempt on part of the importers to crush out the of iron ore are local producer.,14
20,Mr LONSDALE,MANUFACTURES,The local iron works not the material with which to carry on.,14
21,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member for Bourke is entitled to make his speech the assistance of the honourable memI f the honourable member for New England, who has already spoken, persists to in his present course of conduct, he will The seriously interfere with the honourable membusiber for Bourke, and will be acting very",14
22,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURES,"It is well known n that tactics similar to those I have menare resorted to in all. cases where local competition is threatened. In view of to the conditions to which I have referred, some guarantee must be given to those who engage in the iron industry that they will be protected, for some time, at least, against the unfair tactics resorted to by the importers. In the absence of such a guarantee-suc h as be given by the States Governments to take all their supplies for a time from the local manufacturers-it is necessary for us to grant' a bonus, conor to adopt some other method. It has stated that if the persons interested in this business could induce the States Goiron vernments to co-ordinately - agree to take from them all their supplies for a certain number of years; at the average prices now obtaining, they would not require a bonus'; with but it-is clear that the States'Governments cannot or will not enter into such an arTherefore, we shall need to give the manufacturers such a guarantee as would be afforded by'our undertaking to their output from them at a'satisfactory average price, or pay them a bonus. threaAnother reason is that our market, in a sense fairly extensive^ had to presents better opportunities for the of trusts than do the larger marI ke'ts of the world. After all is said and done; Â£6,000,000 worth of steel and irongoods would be a. mere flea-bite compared with the. valueof similar, commodities annually cqnsumed . in .other parts of the world. Our requirements in that direction could be controlled, in such a country as the United States, probably by one man. Under these circumstances we are justified in stepping, between the producer and the importer in order to secure to the public'' benefits which cannot be. conferred under ordinary conditions. I find that the average imports of all classes of iron and steel goods, including metals and machinery, into the Commonwealth represent a value of about Â£5,000,000 per annum. That, of course, is the present importation. If our business grew as it might and should dch-as I "" shall presently show - our consumption of iron and steel goods would increase very rapidly in the near future. Taking, however, our present requirements as a basis, we find that something like 1,500,000 tons of iron ore would have to be treated each year, and in addition to that, 1,500,000 tons of coal would be used in smelting operations. Probably 500,000 tons more would be consumed, because coke is the principal fuel used in smelting operations, and we all know that a certain amount of waste occurs in the conversion of coal into coke. Therefore, we may fairly assume that 2,000,000 tons of coal would be required. Then, again, thousands of tons of various kinds of fluxes would be used. Incidentally, therefore, the iron manufacturing ""business would af-. ford considerable employment. I am not favouring the granting of these bonuses merely because they would afford employment. If that were our only object, the taunts and jeers of free-trade honourable members would be justified. At the same time, it is satisfactory to know that probably something like 3,000 person's would find employment in the iron industry, that some 15,000 persons would be sustained by the expenditure in connection with it, and that the workmen would receive fair rates of - wages', according to the Australian standard. If is estimated that fully Â£500,00 0 would be required annually to pay the wages' of the operatives, and this fact must afford some consolation to those honourable members who observe that the adult population of the Commonwealth is decreasing, instead of increasing.",14
23,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURES,Where ?,15
24,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURES,All over Australia.,15
25,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURES,The population is industry creasing rapidly in' Western Australia.,15
26,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURES,I grant that for the last year there was an increase in that : State.,15
27,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURES,And it is still going on.,15
28,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Eve n so; that does not alter the fact that for the whole of Australia the emigrants exceeded those coming into Australia - by over 6,000 persons. I am speaking of the Commonwealth,, and not of any particular State. The advancement of the Commonwealth is our concern, and, although we may rejoice when we see that this State or that is increasing its numbers, it must be a matter of> deep regret to know that the adult popu-, lation of the Commonwealth as a whole is decreasing. It behoves us to find out the cause, and, if possible, to apply, the remedy. I believe that we may check the present falling off by providing further, employment for our people, and, there-' fore, the establishment of such an industry as that contemplated would be a step in the right direction. The honourable and learned member for DarlingDowns has just placed in my hands the population returns for the Commonwealth. These show'that there is a slight increase in all the States. But the addition of children to the total population will not make up for the adults lost to it.' We want, not merely the natural increase of births, but a regular inflow of adult workers in addition. The establishment of the iron industry would help to find them' employment. Now it may be pointed; out that a large initial outlay would have to be incurred in connection with the erer.tion of the necessarybuildings and plant in connection with the proposed iron works. These alone would provide a large amount of employment. It is not, however, this consideration which leads me to support the measure. I am more impressed with the ultimate advantages which are bound to accrue from the production of the raw material which forms the very basis of our largest manufacturing concerns. Some reference has been made to Canadian experience. Some honourable members have stated that the iron industry in that country has proved a failure, and"" the honourable and learned member for Angas some time ago endeavoured to prove, by quoting statistics, that the payment of the bonus, in Canada, so far from having stimulated the iron industry, had absolutely failed' in its object. Further than that, he endeavoured to show that the position of the inwould probably have been better if no bonus had been granted. He showed that the production of iron in 1885, two years after the establishment of the bontal uses, amounted to 29,000 tons, and that 1900 theoutput had increased by only 5,000 tons. On the other hand, the exports had been reduced from 54,000 tons in 1885 to 5,500 tons in 1900. These figures are approximately correct, but it is singular ever since 1900 a very substantial increase has taken place all along the line. I took the trouble to extract from the Canadian Year Book, which was quoted by the honorin Australia. able and learned member, the figures for 1901. I find that in the year following that quoted by the honourable and learned ployment. . member, the production of pig iron increased from 5,503 tons to more than bring 83,000 tons-a n increase which is almost unprecedented in connection with that busiCapital ness. In 1902, 71,664 tons were proof elsewhere; duced, whilst the exports had also increased by leaps and bounds. In 1901, the export of iron ore amounted to 59,737 tons, and 1902 it had increased to 527,310 tonsdifference in output of 467,573 tons. Surely capital to that country. these figures afford the best contradiction of the affirmation that there was no contributed substantial increase in the iron outpractical put in Canada during the years in which the bonus operated. The honourable and emphasis at my hands. learned member also omitted from his calthe culation one very important circumstance, namely, the increasing local consumption the locally-produced article. In the dian Year-Book, the following footnote attached to the statistics I have quotedThe figures represent the excess of the production of iron ore in Canada over the tity of Canadian ore used in Canadian furnaces. So that as a matter of fact the honourable and learned member took no account of local consumption,, and the figures which have quoted represent an addition to that lished in the newspapers. local consumption. Everybody knows that Canadian manufacturers are progressing such a rapid rate that they are at once the upon oversea supplies. envy and the admiration of quite a number of people. The proof of their growth is be found in the footnote to which I have directed attention. . But the most striking testimony that one could possibly obtain the successful operation of the iron and the duty in Canada is that the Ameripeople can Steel Trust proposes to establish iron duced iron. and steel works there at a capital outlay Â£2,400,00 0 in an endeavour to secure thes large stocks as they do at present. Canadian market against the local manufacturer.' That trust is the greatest cern of its kind in the world, and if it isuccessfully compete in Canada without 1being under the necessity of taking its capiand furnaces there, we may be quite sure in 1that it would do so. It would not incur such an enormous outlay without vtry great justification. Yet we know that that trust,, recognising the utter impossibility of competing with Canadian manufacturers in their that own country, has decided to take its capital, engineers, and employees to the Dominion, with a view to commencing operations, there. The same thing may possibly occur",15

30,Mr HUME COOIC,MANUFACTURES,"We should then artisans here instead of, as at present, permitting them to send their goods here. would be invested locally instead I repeat that the greatest tribute which can possibly be paid to the success of the Canadian experiment is the in acknowledgment of defeat on the part of a the American Steel Trust by its transfer of The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs to this debate not merely a very speech, but a very well considered one. He made one point which requires no He dwelt upon utility of establishing the iron industry from the stand-point of providing means of of defence in case of national emergencv. But Canathere are other considerations which are is almost as important. Within the past few weeks deputations have waited upon the total Premier of New South Wales, asking him quanto give to local manufacturers certain contracts for the supply of engines for that State, or to undertake the work as a State concern. Only today the report of an inI terview with him upon the subject is pubI n connection with our railway construction generat ally, we are almost absolutely dependent The deputation in question pointed out that during the past"" to five years something like Â£ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 had been paid for engines and railway material in excess of what might have been necesof sary had there been local production. It bonus would be a substantial advantage to our to be able to purchase locally-proOur manufacturers would not of then be under the necessity of carrying such They - would also be able to undertake contracts conwhich they dare not accept under existing couldI I conditions, because of the uncertainty respecting supplies. At the present many contracts go to the old country, cause local firms are not sure that they be able to obtain a supply ofiron, and because they cannot definitely estimate cost, or the conditions under which they receive it. An assured local supply would therefore, mean a reduction in the amount of interest upon the capita] outlay necessary for the purchase of stocks. In connexionness - with our railways there would be very great advantage in the establishment of iron works. Indeed, the marvel to is that under existing circumstances, one our States has not seen fit to enter into industry upon its own account. The est consumers of iron and steel in the monwealth are the various States Governraces ments. In a great State like New South Wales or South Australia, where large posits of ore exist, it is a wonder that Government have not established works tions. upon their own account, in order to supply their own needs.",16
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable memcommodities ber for Hume was in power in New South Wales upon two occasions, and he did thing in that direction.",17
32,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURES,"I am not contake cerned with what individuals may or may not have done. I am merely expressing wonder that those who have been in authority-irrespectiv e of whether they belong to the free-trade or the protection tionist camps-hav e not recognised the vantages of producing their own iron local requirements. The Premier of New South Wales, though a free-trader, realizes that something might be done in this direcWe tion. Speaking to the deputation which waited upon him in regard to the local manufacture of locomotives, he saidDuring the term of office of this Government, it was its intention to take some very vigorous action in the direction of establishing that try. The Government would not be frightened by being accused pf breaking some of the canons of their old free-trade principles. To that sentiment, of course, I can 'only say, "" Hear, hear."" I am delighted to know that the New South Wales Governwe ment is prepared to take into consideration the advantages which they would derive as consumers of this material. As a fact, the States Governments would be the first to benefit by the establishment of the industry. In the next place, those facturers whose raw material is chiefly iron and steel would be greatly conveniwill ences by having a local market in which time, they could purchase local supplies. Then beit must be recognised that there will be will great openings for a further consumption also of iron and steel, not only in regard to 1 its our railways, but also in the manufacture will of motor-cars. But the chief point which I desire to make has reference to an industry which hitherto has received scant attention in Australia. I refer to the busiof shipbuilding. Honourable members a scarcely need to be reminded that Australia is an island continent. In my judgme ment, our people have wisely determined of to 'retain their European characteristics, the and to maintain the British standard of livlargeing. Now, we are almost surrounded by Comother countries which are peopled with entirely different from our own; and to whom at no distant date we shall sell delarge quantities of materials manufactured the by Australians under Australian condiWhen we commence this export trade-as we inevitably shall-w e ought to be assured that the ships which carry to our customers shall be made in our own shipyards. Nevertheless, I fail noto see how we can ever embark upon the shipbuilding industry unless we first underthe manufacture of iron. In Britishspeaking countries there is no industry so great as that of shipbuilding. But we shall never succeed in establishing in connection with Australian affairs that posiof which we sometimes dream; we adshall never make Australia not"" merely the for manufacturing but the maritime power of the Pacific until we have very largely developed the manufacture of iron and steel. have a pretty extensive coastal trade at the present time, and if our population increases and our manufactured goods are to be transferred from State to State, that business must also increase. Consequently we shall require to employ a large indusnumber of shipping carriers. My ideal is that all these ships should not merely be locally-owned, but locally-built from locallyproduced iron and 'steel. Nof until we have taken into consideration all the giant possibilities of this great enterprise shall rise to the heights to. which we sometimes - aspire. I hold that Australia will some day become the trade centre of the Pacific. It is rather remarkable to note that even now there are very great forces iron at work which are tending towards the manuconsummation of that great end. In iJapan today, efforts are being made which eventually lead to the opening up of a large trade with Australia. The whole of the British-owned press in Japan is strongly advocating the utilization of British and Australian manufactures. Articles are constantly appearing newspapers there, urging Australia to wake up to the fact that America is gradually securing the market, which Australia ought to control. In an article recently published by Mr J. W. Styles, after a visit to the East, some striking observations are made regarding what may be done in Japan and other countries. He says, amongst other thingsWhile we are seeking to enlarge our markets on the other side of the globe, America deadly earnest securing for herself what ultimately prove to be one of the greatest of world's markets. As a further indication that she really means business, a huge cargo carrier, the Mongolia, a vessel of 22,000 tons, was maiden trip from San Francisco to the Far He says furtherA marked feature of the awakening of East, is that the wants of the people gradually increase through contact with western civilization. The vast number of troops now being fed, extent, on European diet, will have acquired a taste for stronger fare than they have hitherto subsisted on, and will, on returning to their land, demand bread, meat, and butter. Those are food supplies which they have not hitherto' been using to any great tent ; but I agree with Mr Styles that, the result of the conditions under which they are now fighting, these men, who find Australia that such food is necessary to their warlike operations, will, on returning to their native land, ask for more of our great ducts. I have mentioned these facts as dicative of the nature of the trade some day will be done as between Australia, a European-controlled country,, and those who are not so controlled-ou r neighbours in the East.",17
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,Some day.,18
34,Mr HUMECOOK,MANUFACTURES,"If we are as selfis reliant as we hope to be, and develop resources as we ought to do, we shall tract :population to our shores just as United States and Canada have done, and this debate. when' we have secured an increased population in this way, naturally enough, our plus products will have Â£0 be exported, where better than to the countries of near neighbours, who at present are supplied from other places. This question, however,, is so involved with the fiscal issue, that is almost impossible to consider it without reference to that matter.' There are orable members in this'House who are pared, I .believe, to vote who would not be prepared at a later, stage to support the imposition of a duty to assist the industry. Others are prepared to support a duty, but are not willing to vote in the for a bonus. In my judgment, both will be required. The competition to which I have previously referred, and the unfair tactics Japanese and practices of which I spoke in the earlier part of my address, require to be continuously counteracted on behalf of the Australian public. In addition to the payment of a bonus, we shall, therefore, have to impose a duty to maintain the industry, and to secure to the consumer the advantages . which local competition always means. But is in is is rather disheartening to me to know will that, although we seem to have established the the principle of protection in Australia, there is a never-ceasing assault upon it , and that on her for a long time to come, no definite stand East. will be taken similar to that adopted in America tb-day. In that great country, the no one dreams of altering the protective policy. The value of a continuous policy is everywhere recognised. Even those who to some belong to what mav be termed the free trade party in America, do not go to the native length of altering the Tariff, save in such directions as might still be considered in Australia,, at all events, to be protective. exMy view is that Australia, like America, as must have a continuous line of policy. When we have once adopted a policy for",18
35,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member will recognise that I cannot allow a disprocussion on the relative merits of protection in - and free-trade during the debate on this which Bill. The Bill provides, not for a duty but for a bonus. The honourable member has been permitted to refer incidentally to the possibility of protection through the Customs being required later on to assist the industry : but that incidental reference all that I can permit. A general disour cussion on the question of whether freeattirade or protection is the better policy for the Australia, is certainly outside the scope of",18
36,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURES,"-If I had been persurmitted to complete my remarks on this phase and of the question, Mr Speaker, I think vou our would have found that I did not intend to follow the lines which you have mentioned. I merely wished to say that, whether the it policy of the country be that of free-trade or protection, we ought to be assured of honits continuance, and that a constant change prefrom one policy to the other is most unfor the bonus, but desirable.",18
37,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"That is a discussion now of the fiscal issue, and the fiscal issue, far as I have been able to observe, is not dealt with in this Bill . As I have tioned, it is a Bill providing, not for imposition of duties, but for the payment of a bonus. I waited for the honourable member to develop his line of argument in order to see the direction it would take, and it seemed to me that he was going outside the scope of the Bill.",19
38,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Ver y well, sir. I pig shall content myself by saying that the ment of a bonus in respect of this industry is really an integral part of our fiscal policy. If we desire to develop those great induspect tries to which the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs referred-the agricultural implement trade and kindred manufactures-w e shall require to be sured of a certain consumption of the article to be produced as the result of the of this measure. The payment of these bonuses is designed to bring about the duction of pig iron from Australian ores, but the production of pig iron would - wholly useless if there were to be no conI sumption of it, at a later stage, by our .manufacturers. We should have the raw material for our iron trade produced locally, and I would not for a single instant counfree tenance the payment of a bonus-the expenput diture of these large sums of money, the outlay of the very great amount of capital which is involved, and perhaps the wreckI ing of some private fortunes, as well as the loss of some public money-if I were not assured that when the pig iron is procould duced there will be a sure, steady, and cershould tain consumption of it . That is the whole point of my argument. We require to assured that some continuous benefit will be derived from the payment of these prising bonuses. If this be not assured to us, had better abandon at once the idea of paying them. In these circumstances, think it will be necessary for us to maintain an undisturbed line of policy with respect to the iron industry, and in regard to fiscal matters generally, for unless we do so cannot and will not succeed in the way that we hope. The only other point I desire make is in regard to the' control of the dustry. Almost every honourable member, has expressed his views on this aspect the Question. I am quite free to vote either for a State-owned ironworks or for the pay-; ment of the bonus to' private individuals, Speaking for myself-and my previous re-j marks should easily indicate what I am about to say- I should prefer so to see one of the States undertake the establishment of this industry ; but I am given mento understand that there is no immediate the prospect of that being done. In these circumstances, I have to ask myself whether it is advisable that I should insist on the adoption of the course in which I believe, or vote, as I am perfectly free to vote, for the payment of this bonus to any company or syndicate undertaking the manufacture of iron in Australia. At this stage all that payI have to say on the subject of control is that if it appears to me, after this debate has proceeded, that there is no real prosof the States taking up the business on their own account, and manufacturing iron for their own use, I shall hold myself free to vote for the payment of the bonus as to whatever company or syndicate undertakes the work, provided always that there passing is room for the State to at any time take the works over, and that prowhilst they are under private control proper hours are worked, proper wages be paid, and proper conditions observed. f , on the other hand, it is shown that there is a possibility of any one of the States undertaking the establishment of ironworks at a reasonable date, I shall feel myself to vote for a State-owned industry. To it briefly, I desire to secure further information on the subject before I finally commit myself as to the exact terms for which shall vote. The establishment of this industry in Australia is to me a matter of no small concern. No more important business be transacted by this Parliament. I have infinitely preferred to see this Bill receive the seal and authority of the be Government, instead of being thrown on the table, so to speak, and left to any enterprivate member to pilot through the we House. I am sorry that any personal matter should have been introduced during the I debate. I know that the measure stands in the name of the honourable member for Hume, but it is immaterial to me whether that honourable member or the honourable we member for Eden-Monaro be intrusted with the duty of carrying the Bill through. I 1.0 should have preferred to see it taken inup by the Government, for its importance warrants the placing of the Government's of - seal upon it. This cannot now be done, but we can at least hope that its passage through this House will bring for its sponi sors that return in manufactures and commercial progress which we have so long hoped for and still trust to see realized.

39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Parramatta) The honourable member who has just resumed his seat has delivered a speech that would be most admirable if given before a debating society in one of the suburbs of Melbourne. It was replete with everything bearing upon the theoretical side of the question. - Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - If the honourable member would father it and publish it at - Lithgow it would win a good many votes for him. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member may leave me to deal with Lithgow. I venture to say that I know more about the iron industry than do those honourable gentlemen who make long orations, and pretend to be familiar with everything associated with the manufacture of iron. If the honourable member had been reared, as I have toeen, among the ironworks of the old country, he would speak with more diffidence than he does about the possibilities of iron manufacture.",20
40,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,When the honourable member returned from a trip to the old country he wrote a letter advocating the local production of iron.,20
41,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"Oh , that letter !",20
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"That letter, seems to cause honourable members some concern, but it occasions me not the slightest trouble.",20
43,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member merely spoke of what he saw with his own eyes.,20
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,That is so; and if the honourable member would speak only of the things that he has seen with his own eyes he would not make such a ridiculous political as of himself as he constantly does in this Chamber.,20
45,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,Order !,20
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member for Bourke has expressed surprise that nothing has been done before this date by the protectionists of New South Wales to assist the industry. He ought not to be surprised. shows his complete ignorance of the political history of New South Wales. If he consulted Mr Sandford, who is particularly interested in this matter, he' would find 'that the protectionists in New South Wales have done infinitely less for this industry than the free-traders have done.",20
47,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,That is because the free traders have been more protectionist than the protectionists.,20
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Nothin g of the k in d ; but they have shown a sincere sympathy for the industry, and have tried to help it in every legitimate way, while the protectionists have done nothing but make long platitudinous speeches. This great and earnest protectionist, the honourable member for Hume, who is so devoted to Australian industries generally, and to the iron industry in particular, allowed to remain in existence during the whole of the time that he occupied the position of Secretary for Public Works in New South Wales, a rule under which local tenderers were not allowed to compete for the supply of iron required by the Government of the State.",20
49,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,That is not correct. One of the Ministers of the honourable member's own party made that rule.,20
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member made it, and it was in force when the Government in which he was a Minister was succeeded by the Government of the present Prime Minister, in which I was a Minister.",20
51,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"The question before the House is not the conduct of the honourable member for Hume, or of any State Government, but the second reading of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill . I ask the honourable member for Parramatta to confine his remarks to that question.",20
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"I am simply replying to the statement of the honourable member for Bourke, that he is surprised that the people of New South Wales have not already done something to encourage the iron industry, and to some references which were made as to the conduct of the present State Government in relation to it. He argued that if the Governments of the States guaranteed a permanency of orders, the granting of a bonus would not foe necessary for the establishment of iron mills; and I am pointing out that more sympathy has been shown It only towards the industry by free-trade Governments than has characterized protectionist Administrations.",20
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"That is not cor-, rect.",20
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"The first thing that the New South Wales Government of the present Prime Minister did when it succeeded that in which the honourable member was a Minister was to abolish the absurd rule which had obtained in the Works Department under his administration, which prevented Mr Sandford from tendering for the supply of iron to the Department.",20
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,That is not true.,21
56,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member for Hume must withdraw that statement.,21
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I but I would point out ihat the honourable member for Parramatta is repeating what I have said is incorrect. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I feel certain that the Prime Minister will support the statement. I have made. I cannot accept the disclaimer of the honourable member for Hume, because the facts are as I have stated them ",21
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"No , they are not. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Mr Sandford, if - appealed - to, would confirm all that I have said. The present attitude of the Government of New South Wales is only in keeping with what has been done by previous free-trade Administrations. May I remind the honourable member for Bourke of what is on the tapis in that State now ? The arrangement which its Premier is trying to bring to completion is similar to that which the Government of the right honourable member for East Sydney made with Mr Mitchell some time ago.",21
59,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"That arrangement was made by a previous Government, in which I was Secretary for Public Works. Mr JOSE PH COOK - Nothin g of the kind. .The honourable member is making rash statements, for which there is not a tittle of foundation. The arrangement was made with Mr Mitchell by the Government of the right honourable member for East Sydney, and would be in operation today but for Mr Mitchell's death.",21
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,It was proposed three years before the right honourable member had anything to do with it .,21
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member cannot produce proofs of the truth of that statement. When members of the Opposition expiess surprise that nothing has been done in New South Wales to encourage the iron industry, I would remind them that two protectionist Administrations there certainly did not lift a finger to assist them, and that what was done was not done by the protectionists - ",21

65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,There are records.,21
66,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"I have no in tention to discuss the provisions of the Bill now before us, because they have been discussed ad nauseam in this Chamber during the past three years. Not a single fact, has been adduced during the present debate which we have not heard before. The statements which have been made with regard to Canada were only repetitions of what we had been told previously by the right honourable member for Adelaide. Those who profess to be anxious to estab-' lish the iron industry in Australia have taken the right way to secure the rejection of this proposal, because they know that not much more time can be spared for the consideration of the measure this session. It would' be all very well to debate the matter in a highly intellectual-and academic manner, if it were one of no immediate practical concern; but as the question is ripe, for treatment, the sooner we arrive, at a decision in connection with it the better. The honourable member for Bourke spoke of the American trusts/ and their relations with the Canadian trusts, as if he had been at their board meetings, and knew all their motives - It is amusing to hear an honourable member who, I believe, has never left Australia, professing to know exactly the springs of action which govern great industrial enterprises in other parts of the world. He has spoken of orchard pests; but he reminded me of 'an insect crawling over a vast cathedral, and criticising the proportions and symmetry of the huge building, which it was utterly impossible for him to appreciate. I appeal to honourable members to come to"" a decision on this matter. If the Bill be lost, and there appears to be a likelihood of that, the fault will be with those who profess to be its friends.' Mr ' KNOX (Kooyong) - Every honourable member must regard this measure as one of too much importance to be rushed through without full discussion. No one deprecates more than I do unnecessary debate; but in this 'instance we are dealing with a new departure in Commonwealth policy which is of the first importance. Reference has been made to the maladministration which has taken place under the Victorian Butter Bonus system, but, notwithstanding the exposure which has recently been made, it must be admitted that the granting of a bonus for the production of butter has had beneficial results in fostering the industry in Victoria, and it would be wrong to decry a method for assisting primary industries, merely because of maladministration in the past. I think, however, that a measure which provides for the expenditure of so large a sum as Â£ 3 2 4 , should not be in the hands of a private member. I do not undervalue the abilities of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, but I say that a measure of such importance should be introduced by a Government. Last night, however, the Prime Minister spoke very strongly against the principles of this Bill, while we know that the honourable member for Gippsland, and some of the other Ministers, support them. We are entitled to hear from thathonorable member and from the Treasurer a statement of their views in regard to the proposal. The Treasurer was the only member of the Government who took upon himself original responsibility in connection with this measure. It is due to honourable members that a definite statement should be made as to the way in which funds are to be provided for the payment of the proposed bonuses, and the probable effect of such an appropriation upon the States finances. Mr AUSTIN .CHAPMAN - The Treasurer has approved of an appropriation, and will vote for the Bill .",21
67,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"I consider that a proposal to appropriate such a large sum of money should have been presented to the House by a responsible Minister, and I still venture to hope that some member of the Government will place the position clearly before us. I desire to say a few words upon the practical aspect of the question. I know something of the steps which have been taken to open up one of our large iron .deposits, although I have no direct or indirect personal interest in .the enterprise. I also have some idea of the cost that would be involved in erecting the works necessary for the manufacture of iron upon up-to-dare lines. I would point out that bonus is not likely to affect more than two undertakings, namely, that of Mr Sandford, of the Eskbank works, and that of those gentlemen who are seeking to develop the Blythe River iron mines in Tasmania. Any honourable member who imagines that the granting of a Â£ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 bonus is likely to result in the establishment of more than one ironworks can have no knowledge of the enormous amount of money that will have to be invested.in equipment.",22
68,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,Mr Sandford says that the amount offered will prove sufficient.,22
69,Mr KNOX,MANUFACTURES,"I do not know what Mr. Sandford's position may be; but I would point out that one Pittsburg furnace of the 0 0 0 most recent design would cost Â£125,000. As was pointed out by the Prime Minister, the success of the iron industry in the United States has been due to the enormous quantities of ore treated in immense furnaces in which oil is used as. fuel, and in connection with which the material is handled by means of powerful mechanical contrivances involving the employment of the minimum amount of labour. It is the greatest mistake in the world to suppose that the establishment of the iron industry here would provide employment for a large number of men. The equipment of the works must be thoroughly up-to-date in order to insure success. I have stated from the outset that, in my opinion, we shall never assume our proper position as a nation until we are able to turn put pig iron sufficient to meet our own requirements in the event of our supplies from, abroad being cut off. The iron deposits in Australia are equal in quality and extent to any in the world, and should be turned to profitable account. I propose to vote lor the second reading of the Bill, but when it reaches the Committee stage I shall propose or support amendments having for their object the establishment of a perfect understanding as to the way in which the money granted by us is to be applied, and as to the amount we shall vote. It is perfectly idle to suppose that the bonus will benefit more than one or two firms, and it is necessary that we should stipulate that those who are to derive the benefit of the bonus shall give ample proof of their bona fides, and show what they are prepared to do in the future. I would be no party to granting bonuses which would merely have the effect of assisting the promoters of a gigantic company. Provided that the Government demand specific and the satisfactory - guarantees, we should be justified, upon national grounds, in appropriating a certain amount of money for the encouragement of the iron industry. If , however, the bonus granted in the first instance is to be merely the forerunner of further grants, I shall not countenance it. It must be understood, from the outset, that we cannot grant application after application for further assistance. An abundant supply of cheap pig iron is undoubtedly the basis of industrial prosperity in the United Kingdom and the United States, and we must not hamper our manufacturers by restricting their opportunities for obtaining raw material at the lowest possible rates. Therefore, we must not impose any undue surcharge upon them. Take the mining industry, for instance. Honourable members know how largely iron manufactures enter into mining operations, and, therefore, if any heavy duty were imposed upon such commodities, that industry would be seriously interfered with. The agricultural industry would also be injuriously affected. I shall vote for the reduction of the bonus, and if , after the Bill has passed through Committee, its provisions are not, to my mind, clear and satisfactory, and such as will prevent the creation of a monopoly prejudicial to the nation, I shall hold myself perfectly free to vote against it upon the third reading. Reference has been made to the bonus proposed to be granted for the production of spelter. I have just come from a meeting of the directors of the company which can produce the largest amount of zinc concentrates in Australia; in fact, it is the seventh largest zinc producer in world. What is the use of talking about giving us Â£20,000? We do not want it. and it is the greatest rubbish in the world to suggest such a thing. Since Mr Courtney gave evidence before the Iron Bonus Commission, a complete transformation has taken place in connection with the treatment of zinc ores. The companies interested in the production of zinc have spent three times Â£20.000 in carrying on their experiments, and need no bonus for spelter. We desire to be left free to carry on our work peaceably, and that' reasonable consideration shall be shown for the enterprise and ability of those in charge, who are now producing satisfactory results. In connection with the bonus proposed for galvanized iron and wire netting, I understand that the industry carried on by Messrs. Lysaght and Company, in Sydney, is being seriously affected by the Tariff. We have adopted a moderate protective policy, and if the industry referred to is suffering in the way that has been represented, the whole' matMr Knox. ter should be referred to the Tariff Commission. We should not be asked to deal with this matter until we have complete information before us. The Prime Minister has proposed a rational scheme. He wishes to appoint a Commission composed of practical business men to investigate the operation of the Tariff. This is one of the questions which should be submitted to that body, because we have had a number of ex - parte statements put before us. which may or may not be correctOf course it may be urged that a Commission has already investigated this matter. But I would point out that that body was equally divided upon the question. I wish to make my position absolutelv clear. In my judgment, we shall never become a nation until we are in a position to produce pig iron for our own requirements, and that result can never be achieved by individuals promiscuously, because of the enormous expenditure which would necessarily be involved in establishing this industry. The cost of erecting a Pittsburg furnace, without any accessories whatever, would be Â£125,000. Inasmuch as I believe that the iron industry, in its initial stages, is deserving of support, I feel that I shall be justified in supporting the second reading of] the Bill. At the same time, I think that before any parties are allowed to participate in this bonus, we should insist upon their clearly establishing their bona fides. I dothe not for a moment wish it to be understood, that [ am in favour of the proposal tonationalize the industry - My whole career; is evidence of my opposition to such a suggestion. It is impossible to point to a' single industry, the nationalization of which, has proved a success. At the same time,.' if there is any industry which might fairly be managed by the State, it is the production of iron. I base my support of this-' measure upon national grounds, although I cannot see that the establishment of iron works in Australia will provide a very large amount of employment. I trust that in Committee we shall insert some provision which will secure a quid Pro quo from those who participate in the bonus.",22
70,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES," The . honourable member for Kooyong, as a practical business man, has stripped this proposal of all sentiment. He has declared that there is no question of patriotism involved in the. Bill. He says; in effect, that the idea of nationalizing the iron industry does not commend itself to thoughtful men, and that those who wish to secure' a bonus upon the production of iron, do so purely from commercial motives.",23
71,Mr CONROY,MANUFACTURES,Pur e and simple.,24
72,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"They are pure, but they are not simple. As representatives of the people, we are called upon to consider, not merely the sentimental aspect of this question, but also the practical trend of kindred legislation elsewhere. The honourable member for Kooyong scorns the idea that the Broken Hill Company, in which he is interested, should receive assistance from the Commonwealth. He affirms that the commercial experience of its directors, demonstrates the absolute futility of granting it a bonus of Â£ 2 0 , 0 0 0. He proposes to give a sort of left-handed support to this measure. In that respect he is not singular. There is scarcely a member of this House who has straightforwardly declared himself a believer in the bonus system. Instead, honourable members have hedged round their support of this measure with all sorts of qualifications. Some have stated that they will vote for its second reading, but will slaughter its provisions in Committee. As an opponent of the bonus system, I prefer that it should be slaughtered upon its second reading. Some honourable members have declared that they clesire to place the industry under the control of the State, and others again insist that it should contain a provision for the payment of a minimum wage. Some go so far as to say that unless we have a guarantee that the industry will be permanently established we shall not be justified in expending such a large sum of public money. The whole-souled supporters of the Bill can be numbered upon the fingers of one's hand. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro, as a staunch protectionist, is quite justified in taking up the position that he has. Similarly, the honourable member forHume has for years advocated the establishment of the-iron industry. member the time in New South Wales when a proposal was made to give certain contracts to Mr Joseph Mitchell. agree that the honourable member for Hume was right in his correction of the statement which was made by the honoiable member for Parramatta. The latter, I take it, was referring to the first occasion upon which the Premier of New South Wales officially recognised the iron industry.",24
73,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"In 1891 we invited tenders for the supply of 175,000 tons of steel rails.",24
74,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"The statement of the honourable member puts the position in a nut-: shell. Even' one is aware that immense, deposits of iron exist in Australia. It has been alleged that if we produced our own iron we should provide a good deal of employment - To my mind that theory has been successfully combated. Moreover, we have the statement of Mr Jean, secretary of the Steel and Iron Association, that if the iron industry were established, only 2s.' 6d. out of every pound would be absorbed by wages. Consequently labour members' desire to insert a clause providing for the payment of a minimum wage. That, in it-self, shows that the theory that the industry would provide a large measure of employment is without foundation. The idea that we should support the measure from patriotic motives is thus absolutely destroyed. The mere fact of paying the bonus will not increase wages. The bonus proposed will be a free g if t to the syndicate which is lucky enough to capture it. We all know that the iron masters are the wealthiest capitalists in the world. Seeing that we possess such vast deposits of iron ore, is it not strange that they have not attempted to establish the industry here, especially if the enterprise is likely to prove so profitable as honourable members suppose? To them a bonus of Â£320,000 represents merely a drop in the bucket. Why, in America, one syndicate alone has a capital invested of Â£70,000,000. The same remark is applicable to the tobacco industry. The iron masters of the world would not require the encouragement which is offered by the proposed bonus if they knew that they would have a market for the product. The greatest users of iron in Australia are the States Governments. They own the railways, and railway material comprises the bulk of the iron that is consumed within the Commonwealth. I re- We have no guarantee that the States Governments will purchase their railway supplies from this syndicate. They reserve I quite to themselves the right to purchase them in the open market. When we bear that fact in mind we must realise how small is the balance of our consumption. I represent a district which contains an industry which is the largest user of iron in Australia. A m I to vote for the imposition of stiff charges upon its raw material ? MV MCCAY - A bonus will not increase the cost of the raw material.",24
75,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"It is suggested that upon the expiry of the bonus period, a protective duty should be imposed. The Minister knows perfectly well that the industry cannot stand without State assistance. wise where is the need for granting a bonus ? It w i ll require either the imposition of protective duties or the direct assistance of an additional bonus to enable it to compete with the foreign manufacture. Every effort will be made to further coddle the industry, either by extending the bonuses or by imposing Customs duties. The bonus system, after all, is simply the gilded pill of protection. It is only right that I should remind the House of the vigorous attack which the Prime Minister made on the bonus system^-a n attack which was in keeping with the attitude taken up by him for many years. He warned us that if we passed this Bill we should hand over money for the establishment of one industry and neglect others. If we were to give a bonus to assist the iron industry, he asked, why should we neglect to help any other industry in a similar way? Would honourable members be prepared to vote a bonus to encourage shipbuilding in Australia? That is a work in which my electors are particularly interested, and if such a proposition were made. I should seriously consider it. I might also ask honourable members whether they would be prepared to grant bonuses in this way for the encouragement of the deep sea fisheries of Australia. That is an industry which, like the iron industry, might easily be supported on sentimental grounds. The waters of Australia are today teeming with some of the finest fish in the sea, and if a bonus were given to encourage deep-sea fishing, factories for curing fish, and dealing with them in other ways, might be established, and a large export trade built up. If it be true that it be necessary to expend millions of pounds to insure the establishment of complete iron works, how can it be said that a paltry grant of .Â£320,000 would be of any assistance? The suggestion that if we grant Â£320,00 0 in this way, works will be established on which millions of pounds will be expended is mere moonshine. sooner we remove the mask the better. We should say openly and squarely that the gentleman interested in the industry is afraid that he will not be able to form a syndicate unless these bonuses be granted. The people of Australia are practieally asked to head the subscription list with a grant of Â£ 3 2 0 , 0 0 0 . The position' reminds me of. the politician of Baratari'a who, in resigning office after many years' service, thought it about time the electors recognised his philanthropic efforts in their Otherbehalf by raising a f u n d to present him with a testimonial, and, in order that a movement in that direction might be successful, headed the subscription list with a donation of Â£ 2 5 . However enterprising this gentleman may be, we know that his object is to induce capitalists to subscribe to the erection of iron works, and he thinks that the granting of this bonus would be of assistance to them. We are a^ked to head the list of subscriptions in order that a company may be floated with this object in view. I am absolutely opposed 10 the Parliament doing anything of the kind. The experience of Victoria in regard to the bonus system has not been a happy one. At the present time the members of a Commission are remuneratively employed in inquiring into malpractices arising from the system. The introduction of the bonus system in France and other countries led to malpractice, and legislation was necessary to cope with the evil. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Hear , hear.",25
76,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member for Darwin says, in effect, that it means plunder. That is an out-spoken statement, and in these days of syndicate mongering, plunder is the proper word to describe the system. The people may be disposed, from national considerations, to build up an industry in this way; but, time after time, the public have been plundered by those who have obtained State bonuses.' In France an attempt"" was made to deal with industries on scientific lines. Bounties were given to encourage the production of corn, and, after will a certain high point of production had been reached, a request was made for the imposition of a bounty on exports, in order to keep the trade in a healthy state. Similar results might follow the establishment of the iron industry in Australia. When the bonuses provided for in this Bill had been exhausted, those interested in the industryThe would appeal to us for a further vote. It would be urged that they had just got their works into running order, and that if the bonus were extended for a further period of three or four years they would be able to complete their coup, and to do without further assistance. In that event those who believed in the bonus system would, undoubtedly, support the request, while those who were opposed to it would find themselves in an awkward position. It would be said that a further bonus of, ' say, Â£60,000, was necessary in order to keep the works going, and that if we did not grant it, Â£320,000 of public money, spent in this way, would be absolutely lost for all time. That would be the bait held out to us, and we should be practically compelled to throw good money after bad. The Prime' Minister last night put the case very fairly when he urged that if we were prepared to coddle the industry for all time we should, by all means, vote for the second reading of the Bill ; but that we must not shut our eyes the. fact that once we started these works we should have to keep them going. If we did not grant them assistance, by way of increased bonuses, a' request would be made for a duty.",25
77,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,We shall have a big crop of Oliver Twists asking for more.,26
78,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"If we passed this Bill we should have a larger crop of Oliver Twists than of iron twisters in Australia. Day after day changes are being made in the plants of the great iron works, and the powerful ironmasters of England and America would not allow those embarking in the industry in Australia to prevent the rapid development of their works. The fight today is so keen that the plants of the large ironworks are completely, revolutionized every two or three years. The honourable member for Kooyong gave us a simple illustration .of .the position when he spoke of the. changes made., in the treatment of spelter. He mentioned that a new prpcess was. recently discovered,. and that those engaged ,in the business in Australia found it necessary for'their own gain to immediately adopt it. And sp.with the iron industry. Changes must be made in the plants from time to time. If it were simply, a matter of looking out for loot, I should readily .vote for . this Bill. New South Wales would undoubtedly be the chief gainer by. the establishment of the industry. For the most part,. this .money would be spent in that State, so .that if I were to adopt a short-sighted policy, and to say, ""The other States have done.very well out of the Tariff. ' Now is the time for me to wade in, .and take all I can get,, because this Bill would give immediate assistance to New South Wales,"" I should be found assisting the honourable member for EdenMonarp to pass the measure In passing I may-say that the honourable, member for Hume is a well-known and trusted protectionist in New South Wales, and that I am certain he will not allow any petty jealousy to deter him from helping the honourable and learned member for Eden-Monaro to pass the Bill. Whatever slight political differences these honourable members may have, I feel confident that they will work together for the establishment of the iron industry. On the other hand, whilst I recognise that New South Wales is today in a very parlous state so far as employment is concerned, and that the expenditure of money in that State, which would immeto diately follow the passing of the Bill, would temporarily relieve her, I feel that I must look further. I have to consider, not merely those who might receive immediate assistance from the passing of this Bill, but the people of New South Wales generally, who would have to pay an enhanced price for their iron, and would be at the mercy of the syndicates controlling the works. If J voted for this Bill, I should not. be able to refuse to support the giving of a bonus to any other industry. The shipbuilding trade, to which I have referred, would employ more men, and give a higher wage fund, if Australia could see its way clear to. establish it on a healthy foundation, than would all the iron industries that might be created here. The leader of the Opposition, who is a welhknown protectionist, signed that section of the report .of the Commission which disagrees with the proposal to pay these bonuses to private individuals. That part, of the report deals briefly with the position. Those who signed it say that this Bill would make a present of Â£324,000 of the people's money to a syndicate without any commensurate gain to the State. It is admitted that no hostile witnesses were examined by the Commission. It is certainlyremarkable that while those who gave evidence were all favourable to the establishment of the industry, and wedded to the bonus system, the - Commission was nevertheless equally divided, and that even those members who supported the granting of a bonus, imposed the qualification that the Bill should provide for the payment of a minimum fate of wage, and for reasonable conditions of labour: The* other six members of the Commission, including the honourable member for"" Bland, a strong and active protectionist, were against the granting of this money'to private individuals ",26
79,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,It was not thought necessary to call evidence in rebuttal.,27
80,Mr WATKINS,MANUFACTURES,That is not correct.,27
81,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"Perhaps it was felt that even allowing for the evidence of those who favoured the proposal, the information obtained by the Commission would not warrant them in recommending the adoption of .this system. When the Bill was before the last Parliament, I said that I would vote for the appointment of a Select Committee to collect the necessary data, and that if the information so obtained showed that I had been misled as to the possibilities of the industry being established without loss, I would follow the decision of the Committee. A Committee was appointed, and subsequently became a Royal Commission; but I find - myself to=-day in the same position as before. The opinions which I then expressed have been verified by the information secured by the Commission. There is another point which I should like to emphasize. It may toe a coincidence that this measure was introduced at the fag end of last Parliament. History is now repeating itself, and the Bill has again been brought before a wearied House at the fag end of another session.",27
82,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,It was. introduced at the commencement of the session.,27
83,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"Yes , but the debate was adjourned, so that this is the first opportunity that we have had to discuss it. The bonus system always leads to abuses. That is an irrefutable statement, in support of which I need only instance the revelations made by the inquiry into the working of the Victorian butter bonus. Then we have no guarantee that, even if the iron industry were established by the granting of a bonus, it would not be necessary to continue to give it assistance; and the people of Australia are certainly not prepared to spoonfeed an industry for all time. men do not embark in industries of this kind for patriotic reasons. They invest their money as a commercial speculation, in the hope of obtaining a profitable return. Of course, if Parliament is prepared to make a g if t of Â£ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 to those who wish to promote a company for the smelting of iron ore, I do not blame them for taking the money. But if we make this g if t to those engaged in one industry, why should we not make similar gifts to those engaged in other industries? Why, for instance, should not the poor unfortunate laundry-woman-it is iust as well to be pathetic now and again, because members of the Opposition are alManufactures [REPRESENTATIVES.] Encouragement Bill. ways ready to be emotional-ge t a bonus? I may be told that I do not take a proper view of this subject, because the iron industry is a national one. In reply may I ask why is it more than any other industry a national one? The only really national industry is that in which you and I , Mr. Speaker, are both engaged at the present time. Every industry, of course, is national in so far as it benefits the nation. The development of the deep-sea ' fishery would, no doubt, give employment to those engaged in catching the fish, to others engaged in its transport, and to still others engaged in its sale. Therefore, that industry might well ask for assistance, and similar requests might be made by eveiy industry, which would reduce t h i whole thing to an absurdity. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who is in charge of the Bill , will not be able to reply to the criticisms which have been passed upon i l , because he did not move the.second reading; but, no doubt, the honourable membei for Hume will do his best to repel the attacks which have been made on its principles, and I hope that he will give some reason for the apathy which has been shown in regard to the proposal, not on the part of himself and the honourable membpr for Eden-Monaro, but on the part of other honourable members. I do not like tc suggest that that apathy is due to the fact that the industry, if established, would be located not in Victoria or South Australia, but in New South Wales; but such is the case. Furthermore, it is significant that, notwithstanding that fact, at least eighteen of the twenty-six representatives of that State are not asking for a bonus. The honourable member for Parramatta might well be excused for advocating the proposal, because there are in his electorate numbers of men who would benefit by the granting of a bonus. He, however, thinks too much of Besides, his free-trade principles to stoop tb personal considerations, and his attitude in the matter does great credit to him. At the same time, we all acknowledge that if the Bill were passed, and there were an opportunitv for his constituents to get this bonus, he would be a fool to stand in their way. Mr Sandford is a man whom to know is to admire, though he probably would - rather have o.ur votes than our admiration. For twenty, or thirty years past he has, in spite of the most formidable obstacles, been carrying on an iron business, and now he wishes to extend it, and to become the ironmaster of Australia'. Apparently he thinks that, if the Commonwealth votes this bonus, he will be able to get support from persons in the old country. It is not our business, however, to help him, or Mr. Jamieson, or any one else, to float a public company, however worthy its objects may be. If it were absolutely certain that the granting of this bonus would establish a profitable iron industry, I might view the proposal in another way; but as it is I see no reason for voting the money. Even if iron mills were established, we have no guarantee that those who use iron as their raw material would bind themselves to take the local product, and surely even the leader of the Opposition would not try to retard the development of Australia by requiring the users of iron to pay an increased price for. it, or to limit the operations of the vernments of the States iby increasing the price of railway material. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro is sanguine of carrying the second reading, but his troubles will commence when, the Bill gets into Committee, because it will then be altered beyond recognition. Most of those who promised to vote for the second reading have stated, either that they think that the industry should be under State control, or that they desire to impose such qualifications as neither Mr Sandford nor any other man would accept. The debate - will show that honourable members on this side are not, prevented from expressing their opinions on fiscal subjects, and that the free-trader is not as extinct as the dodo.",27
84,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"He is very nearly extinct. Mr Wilks' - He is no more extinct than the honourable member is extinct as a protectionist. Although he is nominally the leader of the Labour Party, he will, on provocation, express strong protectionist views, like the sleeping volcano which may at any moment burst out into eruption. However disquietening the speech of the Prime Minister last night may have been to those who support the Bill, it shows that he is a man who keeps to his principles. I can imagine the howl which would have come from the Opposition if he had wavered in the matter, or had watered the expression of his views. There would not have been room in the columns of the Age this morning for that newspaper's opinion of his conduct, while next week honourable members opposite would be jumping up like rockets to remind us of it.",28
85,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,The debate is a clear indication of the perfect fiscal freedom of honourable members on this side.,28
86,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"Yes . Of course there is no advantage to be gained by riding one's hobbies to death. Recent events have shown that free-traders can associate with protectionists, because, apart from the fiscal question, they have much in common. That, however, does not compel them to sink their fiscal views. But, while honourable members may speak about national ideas and aspirations in the drawing-room, they get back to the kitchen and the ordinary every-day apartments of the house when they are be. fore their electors. However much they may like to display themselves in their fancy clothes as statesmen elsewhere, they have, in their own constituencies, to study the Go- immediate necessities of their electors. In the Dalley electorate there are che'mical' works, wire-netting manufactories, docks, and other robust industries, which have established themselves in the face of great difficulty without Government assistance. At Mort's Dock, where from 2,500 to 3,000 men are employed, I am sorry to say that the position of affairs is now worse than at any previous time in its history.",28
87,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,Why ?,28
88,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,Because of the protective duties which were insisted upon by some honourable members of this House.,28
89,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,"The manager of the - dock does not say that, but quite the contrary.",28
90,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"I know what both the manager and the men say in regard to the matter. I could not go back to my constituents and tell them that after having advocated free-trade for years I had consented to the granting of a bonus for the encouragement of the iron industry. I should not be able to justify my action unless bonuses were granted in a general way, irrespective of the character of the industry. I see no reason why we should ask the people of Australia to pay Â£250,000 for the encouragement of one industry. No reasons in support of such a proposition have been advanced by the Iron Bonus Commission. The report of the Commission - or of that section of it which included the leader of the Opposition - is opposed to the granting of the proposed bonuses, and I trust that the Bill will be so mutilated in its passage through Committee that honourable members will see fit to vote against it at the third-reading staged Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) am not quite in accord with those honourable members who have condemned the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for having taken up this measure. Whilst we all rewhich gret that the honourable member for Hume has been deposed from his position as member in charge of the Bill, I am satisland, fied that that result was not brought about with the connivance or by the scheming the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. I an: sure that that honourable member would no more think of grabbing the Bill than large industrial enterprises. he would of abstracting a sixpence from the pocket of a Christian. When the Minister found that his mixed Ministry were divided upon the subject of the Bill, he showed excellent judgment in handin ing it over to a private member. turn I. believe that the time is not distant when we shall elect our Ministries, and go on for the three years for which each Parliament isreturned, without any fighting over the positions on the Treasury bench. I intend to vote for the second reading of the Bill, but my support of measure at subsequent stages will depend upon the shape it assumes. . suspicious of trusts and combinations. have in my possession a great deal of formation with regard to the the great American shipbuilding syndicate, .which is now being proceeded against Governor Odell, of the State of New York, who is seeking to recover Â£220,000, put which he claims to have been swindled. syndicate includes some of the leading anciers of the United States. When a capisuch talist has to choose between men and soveat reigns he invariably prefers the gold and sets the men on one side. To-day there are two great - irreconcilable armies facing each other-the army of the capitalists, which is solidly organized, and the army the workers, which is only partially organaway ized. Capitalists are purchasers who wish to Buy their raw material in. the cheapest markets, whilst labour is a seller seeking; obtain the highest possible price. Capitalus ists buy labour in the same way that they purchase other raw material. The proStates moters of the scheme for the establishment' of the iron industry in Australia are asking us to grant them Â£300,000, but they have given us no guarantee that the whole of the money . handed over to them will be invested in plant. From the report of the proceedings in connection with Governor Od'ell's case, it appears that the shipUnited building syndicate of New York, which I started with a capital of only Â£600', floated a shipbuilding company for Â£14,000,000. The whole of that amount, with the exception of about half-a-million was devoted to the purchase of plant, passed into the pockets of the syndicate, the and tens of thousands of persons in Engas"" well as in America, have been plundered by these Christian monopolistic genof tlemen. Under these circumstances, we should be particularly cautious in our dealings with large companies or promoters of The honourable member for Kooyong has stated that Prime one large blast furnace would cost Â£125,000, and I find on reference to the records of the blast furnaces of Duquesne, Pennsylvania, that such a furnace would out 700 tons of iron per day. .Multifar plying that output by 365 days- ",28
91,Mr MCCAY,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member should not include Sundays. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Oh , yes. The blast furnaces are worked on Sundays just the as on other days, because the capitalist pays no respect to the law, and has no I am very regard for the Sabbath. I - Mr KNOX - But the furnaces inust be inkept going continuously in order to insure operations of successful results. Mr KING O'MALLEY - If we multiply by the daily output by 365 we find that one furnace would produce 255,500 tons of iron of per annum, which would be sufficient to The supply the requirements of , the whole finSouthern Hemisphere. If iron works of a large capacity could be established an outlay of Â£125,000, there should be no .necessity to grant a bonus. The honourable member for Kooyong and myself might embark upon the enterprise, and conduct it for the benefit of the Commonwealth. The of fact that we are 10,000 or 12,000 miles from the world's markets should be sufficient to show honourable members that we could not possibly manufacture iron for to export - Therefore, it would be absurd for to assist a private company to establish a monopoly. In view of the fact that the Governments are the ' largest purchasers of iron manufactures in the Commonwealth, it would be better for us to establish works under State control. If the manufacture of iron were under private control, and we were cut off from outside ; sources of supply by an outbreak of war, the manufacturers could-as they did in the States in 1861-deman d their own ' prices for the war material which would .enable the Christians of this country to shoot down other Christians. We should thus place in the hands of half-a-dozen gentlemen the control of our power to protect ourselves against aggression. I was educated in America, and the idea strikes me as ridiculous.",29
92,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"And yet they do similar things in America. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They have been mad there, but they are waking up now. A proposal to municipalize the tramways of Chicago was recently carried by a majoriiy of 80,000 ratepayers. The proposed ironworks would not afford direct employment to more than about 500 men. They would, of course, prove of indirect advantage to a much larger number of persons, but I am sure that the benefits conferred would not equal those arising from the operations, carried on at the Mount Lyell mine in Tasmania. This Bill contemplates .taking ,Â£324,000 from the taxpayers of the Commonwealth and placing it in the pockets of five or six good respectable gentlemen. That amount is to be a sort of charitable donation to them. The honourable member for Kooyong has already pointed out that one up-to-date furnace is capable of supplying 255,500 tons of iron per year. According to the report of the Royal Commission, Australia consumes only 142,000 tons of pig iron annually, so that one blast-furnace would, supply all our requirements by working about six months out of the twelve. Under this beneficent scheme for the encouragement of private enterprise, the artisans employed would be engaged only six months in the year. Any one who is familiar with the history of the United States knows that when the North was at war with the South those who had possession of the Pittsburg mines did not sell their product to the Government at its cost price, but at the highest price charged, in the world. They doublebanked that Government to such an extentthat the latter was called upon to spend more than $1,000,000,000 in excess of what it would have expended had it been able to supply its own materials for carrying on the war. No consideration of patriotism is involved in this question. It is one of coldblooded boodle. All my life I have been associated"" with the finest Christian millionaires-me n who would climb a greasy pole to get a shilling. But these same individuals will contribute .thousands of pounds towards the despatch of missionaries to convert the Chinese. case of the great magnate of Boston, Mr. Lawson, who is a partner of the millionaire Rockefeller. He describes how in one day Mr H . H . Rogers made a profit .of $36,000,000, and addressing Mr William Rockefeller, said, "" William, I feel as though I had done an honest day's labour."" It appears that they bought a copper mine for $33,000,000, and, by means of cunning, sold it within three hours for $79,000,000. That was a good ""honest day's work."" We are asked to create the same sort of institution in Australia. The power of money is so great that these men do not need to buy the President or the legislators of the United States. They can control legislation without that. Nobody claims that the legislators of America are to be bought any more than are those of Australia. Look at the way in which Tattersall's sweeps have been conducted in Tasmania. To say anything against that institution in the island State is almost as much as one's life is worth. Yet that enterprise is, comparatively speaking, a small one. Should I have been required to put up the fight that I did at the last election if I had declared myself in favour of Tattersall's sweeps?",30
93,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,"Did the supporters of that concern oppose the honourable member? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I had every man who favoured the granting of a bonus upon the production of iron, and every individual who believed in Tattersall's sweeps, slandering me, morning, noon, and night. I am under no obligation to those gentlemen. I am not prepared to take Â£300,000 from the pockets of the people for the benefit of a few individuals, and to condemn the taxpayers as a whole to the payment .of Â£12,000 annually to ""the money lenders of England for all time. If we start this industry it will have no permanency' unless it be bolstered up by the State.' Whilst I oppose the Bill, I am perfectly willing that we should vote Â£300,000' to settle 3,000 young, able bodied men upon the good lands of Australia under a system of perpetual lease: That would represent an expenditure of Â£100 per man'. An outlay of -Â£200 per man would seftle 1,500 farmers upon good agricultural land. They would be permanent producers, and would supply the railways of Australia with products which would enable them to put a big amount into the Commonwealth exchequer, and thus to benefit the whole community. I remember Take the the timewhen people were settled at RiverManufactures [REPRESENTATIVES.] - side, in Southern California - many of them by private subscription. To-day the railway which traverses that country is crowded with produce, and ships are engaged in conveying it to all .parts of the world. ""Unless the iron industry is controlled by the State, the 'money which it is proposed to spend by - way of bonus can be expended to far - better advantage.",30
94,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,"If the industry be placed in the hands of the State, it will not re'quire a bonus. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Accordin g to the honourable member for Kooyong, the proposed bonus will equip the enterprise with the latest and best machinery. It will enable a real American to be brought from Pittsburg to "" run the show."" Should the State subsequently desire to impose-a protective duty against the outside world, it will be in a position to do so. Personally, I would much prefer to impose a duty of 15. per cent, upon iron than to offer this bonus, because I know that, when the period .during which it will be operative has expired, it will be necessary to protect the industry. The one thing is the natural corollary of the other. Of course we might do as the Japanese have donetake over the mines. We might imitate - their example by nationalizing them, just as the Russians have acted in connection with the whisky interest. The Commonwealth would not then be called upon to continue .manufacturing for a profit, in order to pay - dividends upon watered stock. The curse of nearly every commercial enterprise in the world is that the money subscribed is never put into the venture. Instead, seven or eight Christian brothers meet in a nice, .quiet room, and arrange- "" This is your - bit, and this is my bit."" They split up the profits. If Â£1,000,000 is subscribed for the establishment of ironworks in Australia, and if Â£500,000 finds its way into the pockets of seven or eight individuals who own the plant, they will be called upon to pay dividends upon the former, aftd not unon the latter, amount. Who pays the dividends? They are paid by the toil and sweat of the workers of the Commonwealth, who never buy or sell stocks, and who do not run the broad palace pawnshops which are to be found in this country upon the corners of the best streets-places where human souls are pawned for gold. I claim that we should hesitate before yre encourage this private enterprise. Encouragement Bill. But rather than that the iron industry should lie dormant, and our resources not be utilized for the purposes for which the Creator intended them, I shall even vote for the second reading of the Bill, provided I can obtain a guarantee that if one dollar the taken out of the subscribed capital, and put into the hands of a private individual, except in the form of wages, the bonus shall be forfeited. But I shall want to have .these capitalists in steel bonds-in gridirons. Honourable members who have lately read the proceedings in connection with the Butter Bonus Commission must realise what a beautiful system has obtained in Victoria. Not a member of . the Labour Partv was concerned in that matter. Not a member of that party made a dollar out of it. That inquiry has revealed the fact that pig-grease, or hog-fat, has been branded as "" prime No. 1 butter,"" with stamps stolen from the State Government, and forwarded to London. We have been told that the Labour Party is 'ruining the English market. In 1891-2 the banks and building societies of Sydney and Melbourne-no t including the twelve banks of issue which suspended .payment-faile d for Â£25,067,663, repre-. senting money of the people subscribed on the good faith of prospectuses. Of this sum, Â£3,952,000 was British money - the money of widows and of orphans, sent out for investment in these various building societies and banking institutions, just as the money of such people would be invested in this industry if we handed over these bonuses to private enterprise. These widows were robbed and plundered. Over Â£25,000,000 was thrown in the gutter, and except for one poor little man, without friends, who suffered a year's imprisonment, not one of the financiers of Australia was sent to gaol in connection with this business. That is a serious matter from the stand-point of the credit of Australia. The Pall Mall Gazette, and some of the great financial journals of England, have declared that the Labour Party has come to save the Commonwealth. We are determined that this Parliament shall not enable private individuals to secure the investment of funds in this undertaking on the good faith of Australia. If we granted these bonuses, the syndicate would say to the English investors, "" The Commonwealth backs up this undertaking to the extent of Â£320,000. Do you think that it would do so if it were not a legitimate and honest proposal, having a solid foundation? Would the Commonwealth support the establishchuria, ment of the industry if the ore were not .Australia? You must see that the ablest men of the Commonwealth are backing us up."" The result would be that hundreds of widows in the old land would realise their securities, and send their money to Australia for investment in this industry, 'solely for the benefit of the boodle barons the Commonwealth. I am opposed payment of these bonuses for the encourwhole agement of private enterprise, but I am deable the few to plunder the many. termined to vote for the second reading the Bill . The question to be determined 'is, who would be benefited by the payment of these bonuses.? We must deal with the whole matter as a business transaction, ask ourselves what benefit would accrue the people from the passing of this 'sure? What are the farmers of the Northformation West Coast of Tasmania, or the miners the West Coast of that State, to receive ^of the Â£ 3 2 0 , 0 0 0 to be paid away in this .States for a penny. fashion?. What are they to receive out .the perpetual mortgage of Â£ 1 2 , 0 0 0 a 1 for all time that this would involve .for interest alone? No one ever thinks. :at the present time, of paying off .the national debt, but I believe that we ought to make a start in that direction. .The time has come for the imposition of !tax, with a limitation of Â£ 2 , 0 0 0 , rproved land values, and with the money obtained we should form a sinking - pay off our debt-that is, if we wish place the credit of our country on a solid basis. Does it not seem strange that great ironmongers of Australia should be prepared to put their money into the ture without any assistance from the monwealth? As an honourable member has - said, they are among the richest men - Australia. It is unnecessary for ""go to England or the United States for his State. money; there is plenty of it here. 'are honourable members in this House who would be glad to invest money in these works if they considered the undertaking a the whole show. legitimate one. It is plain, however, it is not a legitimate industry for private enterprise. I confess that I think it be wise for the States to take up the ness. It would be right for the CommonThese wealth or for any of the States to carry ironworks upon a small scale, if only we might be independent in time of sion. There is no danger, however, of inva sion. Whenever a move is made to invade 'country we quickly hear all about it. hear every day what is happening in Manthousands of miles away, so that I in do not think we have anything to fear in the shape of a sudden invasion of Australia; but I do believe that if ever there was an industry which should be taken up by the States, it is the iron trade, inasmuch as they own most of the local institutions that have use for the raw material. If .we allowed great of combinations to obtain control of our primto the ary industries, or of those things that the of the people require, we should enI f we of agreed to the Bill as it stands, a state of - affairs might be created in Australia similar to that which obtains in America as the result of the .operations of the great shipand building company, which is supposed to to 'have a capital of $70,000,000. The only meadifference between this proposal and the of that company is that those of who .were interested in the latter did out not ask the Government of the United They started to plunof der the people for themselves. They said year to the Government, "" Give us fair play. All we ask is that you give us police protection, and we will do the thieving ourselves."" The Government of the United States of America gave them that protection, and they were legally authorized to steal $70,000,000, a or 14.000,000 guineas,"" from the rest of the on unimpeople of America. Do honourable members so desire to have anything of the kind in the fund to Commonwealth? The Governor of the to great State of New York- a State which has a population of 8,000,000, and is richer the than any other State in the world-is now not bringing an action against this company for venthe recovery of $200,00.0. I do not imagine Comthat the Governor of this State would invest in the Australian iron industry, because, in perhaps, he would not have in it that faith them to which a native of New York would have in I have an extract from a newsThere paper, which I wish to read in order to show what might happen if we allowed fifty or sixty capitalists in this country to run Can anv one deny that that about fifty men hold the best part of the Commonwealth in the hollow of their hand ? would F if t v bank managers run the whole show, busiand the people are their helpless slaves. fifty men can absolutely close up any on business, ""shut up any shop, burst up any that institution, and compel any number of men invato go on the highway with swags on their - backs. All this is the result of private ena terprise. Let me tell you. Mr Speaker, We as a politician of considerable experience, what may be done by these men. If a man does anything with which his bankers do not agree, they will at once call upon him to reduce his overdraft. I do not care what security he may have; but if he takes one action which they consider to be against their interests, he is called upon to reduce his overdraft, and if he cannot do so, his securities are sold, and he is turned out on the highway. It is for these reasons that I believe that the time is coming when we should own not only the ironworks of Australia, but the whole banking system of the Commonwealth, so that special privileges shall not be enjoyed by any individual. No man should have the right to ruin another, because of his political creed, or because of actions taken of which he may not approve. Here is the heading of an article from an American newspaperGovernor Alleges that Promoters of Great Trust retained Large Portion of Money paid foT Subsidiary Companies. Mercantile Trust Co.'s Subscription Bogus. This refers to one of the great financial institutions of America, against whom the Governor of New York has brought an action for the return of $200,000, which he was induced to invest in the cornpany on the good faith of certain men connected with it. One of these men is Mr Schwab, the great philanthropist. Because that gentleman was a member of these institutions, several widows",31
95,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,Will the honourable member please discuss the Bill?,33
96,Mr KING OMALLEY,MANUFACTURES,"I am endeavouring to point out that if this Bill becomes law, the very things which are happening in America in connection with this company may happen here, and anything I can show that may induce honourable members to refrain from handing oyer the iron industry to private enterprise must be germane to the Bill . The Governor of the great State of New York is alleging fraud against the company. Before I read the statement of the case, I should like to give the House the list of directors of this great institution. It is a very short one.",33
97,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"I must ask the honourable member to connect his remarks alittle more closelv with the question before the Chair, instead of merely hinting at the connection. The question is whether or not we shall grant a bonus for the encouragement of the iron industry of Australia. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The position is that if we decide to give these bonuses for the establishment of the industry by private enterprise, we may have the same system of plunder in Australia as has been associated with ship-building in the United States.",33
98,Mr THOMAS,MANUFACTURES,"The same as has occurred in connection with the Victorian butter bonus system. , Mr KING O'MALLEY - Exactly . The report states that three of the defendants against whom the Government make such serious chargesare men of immense",33
99,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"I really cannot permit the honourable member to digress so far from the question under discussion. I must ask him to discuss the Bill, and not questions which, if at all related to it , are so remotely related that I fail to discover the connection.",33
100,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURES,The granting of a bonus would be sure to create a monopoly similar to that referred to by the honourable member. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes .,33
101,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,"What class of citizens would be concerned in the affair?' Mr KING O'MALLEY - The men who wish to go to London to borrow money on the strength of the Commonwealth grant. If we pass the Bill as it stands, we shall be assisting a few men to raise money to start an industry which must be a failure, and will bring ruin to thousands of persons who will invest their savings in it . The same thing will occur here as has occurred in connection with the great ship-building company in the United States to which I have referred.",33
102,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,Hav e the persons concerned there been prosecuted? Mr KING O'MALLEY - They are being prosecuted now.,33
103,Mr SPEAKER,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member must either conform to the Standing Orders or resume his seat, and allow some other honourable member to proceed with the discussion. I ask the House to support me in seeing that effect is given to the rules of debate. If the honourable member for Darwin can show that the companv to which he refers was granted a bonus by the Government of the United States, or can reasonably connect his reference to it with the question before the Chair, he will be in order; but I fail to see any connection which would justify him in proceeding further on the line which he is now taking. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They do not call them bonuses there; they call them subsidies. That is what I was trying to point out. However, it is not necessary to go into that matter.

They brought capital into the country, but it all went into their own pockets. - Mr SPEAKER - r understand that, in the instance to which the honourable member is referring, a concession given by the Government of the United ""States was exploited by certain persons.; but, as the proposal before the House is not to grant Â£ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 for the establishment of a company, but to provide for the payment of a bonus on the production of iron in various forms, the American case is irrelevant to the debate. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Then I will putaside that case altogether. It is claimed that the granting of the proposed bonus will lead to the investment of Â£1,000,000 in Australia. That money, to enable the investment to be profitable, must earn a return of from Â£ 6 0 , 0 0 0 to Â£ 8 0 , 0 0 though it is not likely that more than one blast furnace would be set up. The question we have to ask ourselves is, are we justified in taxing the people of the Commonwealth for this purpose?",34

I should like to see the Commonwealth develop the industry itself; but we are not justified in taxing the people for the support of a private enterprise. If we grant the bonus, the same thing will happen as happened in Canada; every two or three years applications will be made to Parliamember ment for another bonus, or for an increased duty. It would be better to agree to a duty of 15 per cent, right away.",34
109,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,Has the Commonwealth the right to undertake such a work?,34
110,Mr KING OMALLEY,MANUFACTURES,"If it has not, it can get it, and the ore which has lain in the ground for so many centuries will not spoil while we are waiting. It would be to my interest to vote for this proposal, because it Would probably mean the employment of 100 men at Blythe River immediately, and forty or fifty afterwards, all of whom would be my supporters. It is not likely, however, that smelting works would be established there, because the probability is that all the ore would be taken to New South Wales. If the industry is developed by private enterprise, however, those who are concerned in it will not have gone into it for their health, or for patriotic reasons. They will want a cash return, and, consequently, there will be a watering of stock. Then, as no dividends will be forthcoming, we shall be told that the works must be shut up, and hundreds of men thrown out of employment, unless further assistance is granted, and. eventually the Commonwealth will have to take over the 0 a year, whole concern, just as the United States has taken over the Panama Canal scheme. If it were a Government concern, however, those employed would obtainpermanent work, because the State could afford to keep the mills constantly going, and to accumulate stock if the market were unfavorable. While I shall vote for the second reading of the Bill , I shall strive to have it amended, so that we shall not be increasing the wealth of the few at the expense of the many; because I am not prepared to tax the miners of the West Coast, or the farmers of the North-West Coast of Tasmania, to enable half-a-dozen Commonwealth gentlemen to live in Mayfair, London, or in F if t h Avenue, New York. I am sorry that I have not been able to refer to the American case, in which a number of high-toned I am Christian gentlemen conspired to plunder . the Governor of a State. Of course, they will not go to gaol, because no one goes to gaol who has got money. Everywhere the rich go to Government House, while the poor go to gaol.",34
111,Mr DAVIDTHOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"Capricornia). - I have listened with interest to the volhere uble speakers who have preceded me, including our Yankee friend, the honourable for-Darwin. I am altogether opposed to the granting of a bonus for the development of the iron industry by a private company, though I should like to see the industry developed. At the present time, the only ironworks in Australia of any pretensions at all are those of Mr Sandford, at Lithgow, and he does not manufacture pig iron from the ore, but chiefly works up scrap iron. In my opinion, the payment of a bonus alone would not establish the iron industry here. The imposition of protective duties on iron would also be required. I think that instead of offering a bonus it would be preferable to enter into some arrangement with a gentleman like Mr Sandford, of Eskbank, under which the States Governments would agree to take from him the iron required by them. For instance, if the construction of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway line is undertaken there will be a large demand for rails and other manufactured iron. If any of the States Governments started iron works it would be necessary for the Commonwealth to impose duties which would have the effect of shutting out imports from countries where cheap labour is employed. Unless something of that kind were done we should not be able to maintain the wages of our workmen at a satisfactory standard. I believe that there is more iron in Central Queensland than in any other part of Australia. The Queensland Government are sending the Government Geologist into that part of the country to report on some of the iron deposits, to which references have been made in the annual reports of the Department of Mines. It is well known to those who have taken an interest in the coal measures of Australia that upon the Dawson River there are valuable deposits of anthracitic coal, which is found in only two other parts of the world, namely, in Wales and Pennsylvania. The Dawson River anthracite contains 80 per cent, of carbon, and is therefore of very high grade. Some people state that it is only semi-anthracitic coal, but if it runs to 80 per cent, carbon it does not matter much whether it is anthracitic or semi-anthracitic. At present there is no market for this coal in Australia, because it can only be used upon warships using forced draught, or in blast furnaces. In the absence of a market for the article, the development of the anthracitic deposits referred to has been hung up, but an effort is being made to induce the Admiralty authorities to use the coal upon the warships. Bituminous coal is Mr David Thomson. found upon the Mackenzie River, and iron deposits exist at Gladstone, and coal at Callide Creek, and in the Broadsound district, and in many other places along the coast. There is coal close to the ore in nearly every case, and also abundant supplies of fluxing material. There is no prospect of the manufacture of iron being carried on with successful results unless coal, iron ore, and fluxing material are to be found in close proximity. In Queensland Ave have all these materials conveniently situated, and, in addition, abundant supplies of manganese and wolfram. There are good ports close to the iron deposits, and there would be no heavy freight to pay for the carriage of the iron by rail for long distances. If iron works were established at Lithgow, the pig iron, or'the more highly manufactured products, would have to be conveyed a long distance by rail. Therefore, I contend that Queensland possesses greater facilities than does any other State for the successful manufacture of iron. From a report published in the Queensland Mining Journal I extract the following particulars with regard to some of the iron deposits in Queensland: At Iron Island, the ore consists in greater part of cryptocrystalline, magnetite, with massive haematite, and scarcely a trace of visible impurity.' Its specific gravity is 4.5 to 4.6. Blocks of ore,up to ten feet in diameter, weathering with every appearance of slate, are piled up round the base of the island, as seen in the accompanying photograph. A rough surface sample was taken from the whole of the. iron ore area, and its. analysis is, given below, together with that of a single specimen from the south part of the island. Sample. Specimen.

The road to the river has a down grade all the way. There are five outcrops, from one to five chains in length, and from two feet to two chains across-forme d of boulders up to ten feet in diameter. The main bodies lie on north and southlines, between portions 2371 and iS v. Owing to the thick grass at the time of my visit, it was difficult to determine the extent of ""the deposits, but it is believed that the areas shown have not been exaggerated. Taking the depth of the deposit as equal to one-half the length, and only considering the three main ones, which are two, two, and four chains long, and two, one, and one-third chain wide, the amount of ore here is over one-quarter of a million tons. The ore consists of massive haematite and magnetite (specific gravity 4.8), with scarcely any visible impurity except a little quartz in cracks far apart. A sample from the eastern line of outcrops (that marked, i , c, d), assays (Mount Morgan)Iron 67 per cent. Phosphorus trace Another from the western line yields (Mount Morgan)Iron 73 per cent. Phorphorus nil (This result is slightly higher than that necessary for pure magnetite.) The ore is thus specially suited for the Acid-Bessemer process, and of value for mixing with phosphoric ores, such as that on Iron Island, to render them low enough in phosphorus to be treated by the same process. . . Kabra is a junction on the Central railway, eleven miles south-west from Rockhampton and the Fitzroy River. Ore has been worked on portion 973, Gracemere, about a mile north-west of the station, and other small deposits are found capping a ridge running south-east through portion 146 v., Gracemere. . . . The ore consists of massive magnetite of specific gravity 4.75, the analysis of a specimen of which is (Mount Morgan)Water Silica Alumina Iron Manganese Lime Magnesia Phosphorus Titania This shows the ore to be quite equal to the Scandinavian product. Were there any large quantity available it would be of value for mixing with the Iron Island ore. Constitution Hill is three miles north-east of the Mount Morgan terminus, on the eastern side of the Dee River. Between the Dee and the Rockhampton railway line the country presents considerable obstacles to transportation, so that the ore would have to be taken down the river to the terminus in case of it ever being worked. The greater part of the ore on the south is magnetite, of specific gravity 4.53, that on the north is haematite, the former being, as a rule, more siliceous than the latter. Samples of the less siliceous material over an average width of six feet were assayed (at Mount Morgan) for the following results :Water 0.46 Silica 4.00 , Alumina 2.02 Lime 9.20 Magnesia 6.14 Phosphorus ... trace Iron ... 55-8Â° 9x The ores are thus specially pure, though that from the south-end shows a rather high percentage, of phosphorus-that is, for the Acid-Bessemei: process, which is the more likely to be used. Iron Gully, one of the head branches of Boulder Creek, is six miles west south-west of the Mount Morgan railway terminus, in very rough country. The ore is bright and solid magnetite, with small cavities filled with powdery limonite and haematite.

The only deposits of any considerable size are at Glassford and Many Peaks, but the outcrops at several other points, notably those on the Boyne River, are well worth testing. The places visited are described below, in order, from north to south. Targinie head station lies nine miles west of Gladstone, a little over three miles north-north-west of the railway station of same name, and two and a half miles from the shores of Port Curtis. The head of navigable water for small boats on Boat Creek is four miles distant by road. The 0.17 outcrop of iron ore is half-a-mile south-south2-85 east of the head station, and has been included in a lease of ten acres adjoining portion 402, Tari-43 ginie (in which the station stands), on the southâ¬6.0 0 - eastern corner. 6.61 trace Ore - The ore is massive haematite and magtrace netite, crystalline in parts.

I should like to see the enB terprise undertaken by one of the States Governments. I know that Tasmania possesses valuable iron deposits, and also coal supplies close at hand. Western Austrathe lia is handicapped in not having a coal ply suitable for smelting purposes. Coke is the principal fuel used in connection with the smelting of iron, but in Queensland we should be independent of coke, because our matters very considerably. anthracitic coal would be equally suitable for smelting purposes. If coke quired the coal measures on the Mackenzie River could be utilized. If none of the States Governments take the matter up trust that an opportunity will be afforded to Mr Sandford, of Eskbank, who has been struggling for many years without much encouragement from successive trade Governments in his own State, to extend his enterprise and make the iron industry what it should be.",34

Why should a few speculators, who propose to produce from native ores, receive encouragement which we are not prepared to extend to those connected with other primary industhis State. tries?

Of course it may be urged that iron has a utilitarian value, miners. whilst gold is merely for exchange and ornamental purposes. But we must not forget that the individual who possesses the gold can always purchase the iron. Let us consider this question closely.

We, as a Federation, propose to ask the miners who are assisted in this way by the States to pay a subsidy towards the encouragement of iron producand tion. The gold mining community, and those engaged in producing silver and lead, ? will be called upon to contribute to these inbonuses, but will derive no direct benefit Manufactures [REPRESENTATIVES.] - from them. That is a gross injustice. Parliament should not lend itself to the aggrandizement of any one section of the - community.

It would be far preferable to encourage the farming industry by a direct vote. As the honourable member for Darwin pointed out just now, if we expended this sum of' Â£320,000 in putting men on the soil, and assisting them to carry, on farming on a scientific plan-if the money to the education of their sons, so that they might take up farming at a point considerably in advance of that at which their fathers started-we do something that would be of lasting benefit to the community. .Such a proposal would be immeasurably better than is this proposition to establish an industry which, on the admission of its own supporters, cannot be started first-of all without a bonus, and cannot afterwards live without some form of Tariff assistance. These are considerations which, in themselves, should be sufficient to make the advocates of the Bill pause; but if they turn to the report of the Commission which investigated this question, they will find that it offers no inducement to them to go before the people of Australia and defend this measure. It is, to say the least, curious that no attempt has been made to obtain information about the'iron industry from persons outside Australia. Every experiment so far made on the large scale contemplated by this Bill, in the production of iron, has been made in other countries, and when the Commission was being appointed, I certainly understood that if it did not visit America, or the Continent, it would at least take steps to collect first-hand from some of the highest experts abroad. But what do we find? The whole of the information sought by the Commission was obtained from men whose experience is confined almost entirely to Australia. Government geologists and mining engineers were called by the Commission; but, for the most part, the witnesses examined were men actively engaged in the manufacture of iron products. I hope that I am not casting any undue reflection on these gentleMr Mahon. Encouragement Bill. men when 1 say that their financial welfare would be distinctly improved by the passing of this Bill, and by the grant of a bonus from the Treasury. It is extraordinary that any Government, proposing an innovation of this kind, should limit their inquiries to this ConI put it tinent, and should not obtain the best information available in the outside world. As I have previously pointed out, this will"" not be a cheap experiment. It will commit the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, not merely to the payment of the original bonuses, but to the expenditure of a very large sum, and may possibly lead to complications and difficulties which the wisest man in this country cannot clearly foresee. That is the we devoted first objection that I take to this measure, but there are several paragraphs in the report of the Commission which show that there are other objections. I propose to should refer to what may be called the majority report of the Commission, since the Chairman seems to have exercised a deliberative, as well as a casting, vote. Paragraph 5 in the majority report contains the following most remarkable statement:Little attention has hitherto been given to iron mining in Australia, and your Commissioners are of opinion that future operations are likely to result in further valuable discoveries of iron deposits. We are not told where the evidence upon which this statement is based, is to be found in the report. It reminds me of a little episode which occurred at an early stage in the development of the Western Australian gold-fields. I became interested in a lease not far from the famous Bayley's Reward mine; and an expert, who was then held in very high repute, was employed to report on the property. There was considerable excitement at the time in the mining market, and great expectations were based upon a favourable report being obEngland, tained from this celebrated expert. On the strength of his report, other mines had been information floated, and the promoters of this concern were relying very largely upon a favourable report from him to recommend the lease to speculators in the various cities of Australia. The report eventually reached the proCertain moters of the company, and it was found that after a great flourish of scientific, technical terms, the expert, in describing the property, went on to say "" Gentlemen, I see no teason whatever to doubt but that Bayley's reef does go through your property."" Unfortunately, lhat did not satisfy those < who were expected to take up shares in the venture, because, although the expert ""saw no reason to doubt"" that Bayley's reef went through the property, that which the owners of the lease required from him was some assurance that it did pass through it. This paragraph reminds me of that little incident. In the opinion of these respectable Commissioners-no t one of whom I venture to say has ever been down a mine in his life-futur e operations are likely to result in further valuable discoveries of iron deposits.",38
128,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MANUFACTURES,-The honourable member for Bland has been down a mine.,40
129,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"I am referring not to the report signed by the honourable member, but to the majority report.",40
130,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,On e honourable member who signed the majority report worked in a mine for many years.,40
131,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"I am speaking, not of a coal mine, but of gold and iron mines. I had forgotten for the moment .that the name of the honourable member for Newcastle appeared at the foot of the majority report. In the natural order of things, one mightTKave expected to find him signing the minority report. But here we have the statement that in the opinion of these Commissioners, "" future operations are likely to result in further valuable discoveries of iron deposits.""",40
132,Mr CROUCH,MANUFACTURES,"There , is evidence by the geological surveyors of the States in support of that belief.",40
133,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"The average miner, who is as good as any geologist, will .tell you that he cannot see "" beyond the point of his pick."" That is what his experience teaches him, but these members of the Commission are much more sanguine, and disregard the experience of practical men. I do not think that fRat statement is worth the paper on which it is printed. I invite honourable members now to turn to paragraph 10, in which it is said that this industrywould be an important addition to Australian industries, giving employment to capital and labour. The iron industry is by many well described as the foundation of all other induspractically tries. I believe that to be true. I hold the opinion that the establishment of the iron industry would increase the employment of labour in Australia; but I take it that we ought to inquire first of all, what would be the cost of giving this encouragement. We as a Parliament ought to inquire whether the increased employment so obtained would not lead to decreased employment in other directions. The Commissioners say that the iron trade is at the foundation of all other industries, and, therefore, if we do anything to increase the cost of iron-if we y impose a duty, or grant bonuses calculated to result in the cost of iron to the men who use it being increased-the tendency must be to decrease employment in those dependent industries. Paragraph 12 of the report contains the rather extraordinary statement thatThe existence of powerful rival vested interests elsewhere, and the novelty of the enterprise, so far as Australia is concerned, induce some hesitation in investing on the part of capitalists. I wish to know from any business man who may be present in the Chamber whether the novelty of an enterprise has ever deferred investors from taking up a scheme in which they could see a profit ? The remark which I have quoted is an instance of the absurd statements with which the report bristles. We have capitalists investing in every new invention that is brought out. The fact that inventions ' are novelties does not deter people from investing their money in them, but probably is an inducement to many to put money into them. In paragraph 14 of the majority report it is stated thatYour Commissioners draw attention to the fact that the bonus system of Canada has immensely stimulated iron and steel production in the Dominion, and your _ Commissioners are sanguine that the course now proposed will be productive of good results in Australia. Although six of the Commissioners declare that the bonus system has immensely stimulated the production of iron and steel in Canada, the other six Commissioners, who heard the same evidence, watched the same witnesses, - and deliberated upon and dealt with the same facts, state thatThe Canadian experience is not encouraging. The bonus system for iron production was first instituted there in 1883. Subsequently, a Bill was passed in 1897 further continuing the system. Another Bill was carried in 1899 providing for the diminution of the bounties by a sliding scale expiring in 1907. In July of this year the Dominion Government decided to postpone the operation of this sliding scale for one year, which means a further increase in the bounties paid. That is a. palpable contradiction of the other statement, and the House is entitled to more information on the subject. We cannot fairly be asked to legislate on the strength of such mutually destructive statements. Paragraph 17 of the majority report reads as follows: No evidence has been produced which would lead your Commissioners to believe that any State Government contemplates undertaking the establishment of ironworks or any abandonment of its position as indicated in the correspondence between the Federal Government and the States laid before the House of Representatives on the 29th July, 1902. Surely the determination of a State Government is not, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, unalterable! Since that paragraph was written the personnel of at least two State Governments has been radically changed. There is now in power in Queensland a Government which is largely sympathetic with the proposal that the S^te should carry on enterprises of this kind on its own account.",40
134,Mr MCCAY,MANUFACTURES,Queenslan d is not likely to have much money for enterprises of this kind for some time to come. Mr FISHER.:-It would have much less if we passed the Bill.,41
135,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,That is .so. Queensland's contribution to the bonus would be considerable.,41
136,Mr MCCAY,MANUFACTURES,"In any case, it would have to find a good deal to carry on an enterprise of this kind.",41
137,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"I do not think that the honourable and learned gentleman should assume that the people of Queensland are "" dead broke.""",41
138,Mr MCCAY,MANUFACTURES,I do not assume anything of the kind.,41
139,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"That is the inference to be drawn from the honourable and learned gentleman's remarks. Although there may be a deficiency in the finances of Queensland, due to the operation of the Federal Tariff, the money is still in the pockets of the people, and it only requires taxation in some other form to extract it. I believe that 'the resources of that State and the enterprise of its people are equal to the task of establishing ironworks there.",41
140,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,Without assistance from the Commonwealth Government ?,41
141,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,Yes .,41
142,Mr FISHER,MANUFACTURES,"At any rate, they do not propose to send round the hat.",41
143,Mr MCDONALD,MANUFACTURES,"If they can get the money from the Commonwealth Government, so much the better.",41
144,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,Surely the Minister of Home Affairs will admit that it is better for us to assist a State Government than to assist a private syndicate?,41
145,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,I am favour of doing either.,41
146,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"I am not very enthusiastic on the subject, but if a choice has to be made between what the honourable gentleman may consider two evils, surely he will admit that assistance can more advantageously be given to a State Government than to a private syndicate?",41
147,Mr SPENCE,MANUFACTURES,And to a foreign syndicate at that.,41
148,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"I should like to know, before proceeding further, if it is the intention of the Government to take a vote on the question this afternoon ?",41
149,Mr MCLEAN,MANUFACTURES,We intend to keep on until the usual time.,41
150,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"I would point out that honourable members are somewhat exhausted by the long sittings which we have had during the week. Furthermore, the hours that we sit here are not our only working hours. An honourable member is not necessarily idle because he is not sitting in this Chamber, and, of late, a great many questions have come before Parliament which have required a considerable amount of study. Personally, I feel rather tired, and therefore should be glad to have an opportunity to continue my speech on the next day of sitting; but if the Government will not consent to an adjournment of the debate, I shall deal with one or two other statements in the report. In paragraph 20 of the majority report it is stated thatYour Commissioners recommend that provision should be inserted in the Bill . . . (* ) securing to the Commonwealth or to the State in which the work for the earning of bonus is being chiefly carried on, a right of purchase of the undertaking after a fair interval, at a valuation. I think that that arrangement would be altogether inadequate. If we legislated on those lines, and ultimately desired to resume this monopoly, wemight, at the end of the time, be obliged to pay a very handsome sum for the good-will of the concern.",41
151,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,-If it were successful.,41
152,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,Yes .,41
153,Mr CONROY,MANUFACTURES,"Perhaps the Government would have to pay for watered stock, too.",41
154,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"I thank the honourable and learned member for that observation. I was just going to refer to that matter. We might, perhaps, have some'clever bookkeeping done, and the stock might be watered several times over. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We should have that.",41
155,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"Furthermore , we might have worn-out machinery thrown on our not in hands, to be paid for at a high price. Whenever enterprises of this kind have been carried out by private persons, and afterwards resumed by Government, they have been sold at an extravagant price. Several cases of the kind have occurred in Western Australia. The Great Southern Railway, from Albany to Beverley, was built on the land-grant principle, and was afterwards resumed by the State for about jÂ£i,100,000, or about 50 per cent, more than any private person would have paid for it. Like the present privately-owned Midland Railway, from Perth to Geraldton, its directors would not move with the times, by giving the settlers a sufficient number of trains, and fair rates for the carriage of their produce, so that the State was absolutely forced to resume it at their own price. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The same thing has occurred with the Emu Bay Railway in Tasmania.",41
156,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"We ought not to deliberately place on the shoulders of the Commonwealth an incubus which we can get rid of later on only at enormous expense. If we are going to give this bonus to private individuals, we should insert in the Bill a clause requiring that where the net earnings of the industry exceed 5 per cent, or 6 per cent., the surplus should be returned to the Commonwealth in repayment of the money advanced. Such a clause would, of course, necessitate very strict inquiry into the transactions of the company, to ascertain what their real profits were, and to insure that they were not writing off an excessive amount for depreciation and wear and tear. Honourable members may laugh at that suggestion, but unless we wish to make an absolute gift to private individuals we must be involved in these complications. Now I come to the minority report, signed by the honourable member for Bland and the other members of the Commission who were associated with him. Here I find a statement which certainly ought to act as a danger signal to those who contemplate proceeding in the direction of subsidizing private enterprise. In clause 3 the Commissioners sayThe Bill provides for the payment of ^324,000 of the people's money to private individuals engaged in an enterprise for' their private gain. There can be no guarantee that the bonuses proposed would permanently establish the industry, though it is probable the inducements offered might be instrumental in forming speculative companies. That paragraph lies right across the track of this Bill. The honourable members who constituted half of the Commission, deliberately say that the bonuses proposed would not permanently establish the industry, although it is probable that the inducement - offered might be instrumental in forming speculative companies. These honourable members say furtherNearly all the witnesses examined agreed that the payment of bonuses would be useless unless followed by a duty. These warnings ought not to be disregarded, because if they are we shall embark upon a course which will involve us in very serious complications. The Commissioners who signed the minority report, say furtherNo effort was made to bring forward witnesses against this Bill . If that be the case, we can imagine how the conclusions at which the Commissioners arrived would have been strengthened if witnesses against the Bill had been called.",42
157,Mr WATSON,MANUFACTURES,Opportunitie s were afforded to every person who desired to give evidence.,42
158,Mr WATKINS,MANUFACTURES,Every member of the Commission had the right to nominate witnesses. As many persons gave evidence from the consumers' stand-point as from the producers' point of view.,42
159,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"So far as I can see, very few consumers gave evidence.",42
160,Mr WATKINS,MANUFACTURES,"A large number of engineers, who are consumers, gave evidence.",42
161,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"They are middlemen, not consumers. I am reminded of some questions that were put to Mr Franki, the manager of Mort's Dock and Engineering Company, Sydney, who is a middleman,and not a. consumer, because he passes on to his customers any charges that He may have to defray. He was askedDo you think the proposal justifiable from the point of view of the consumers of raw iron ?- I think that the bonuses proposed are far too high. It is proposed that a bonus of 12s. 6d. a ton shall be given for the production of pig iron?That would be an outrageous amount. We now have to pay 82s. a ton for pig iron landed in our yard. I understand, however, that it is claimed that pig iron can be manufactured at Lithgow for 35s. a ton. Adding another 15s. for freight and charges- a very liberal allowance-that would make the price 50s. a ton. If they sold at 70s. the price would be ios. below what we pay now, and would give the producers Â£ 1 a ton profit. The honourable member for Newcastle says that the witnesses represented consumers and producers in fair proportion, but after having gone carefully through the list of witnesses, I cannot agree with him. I do not consider engineers to be consumers.",42
162,Mr WATKINS,MANUFACTURES,Who are consumers?,42
163,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"The people who ultimately use the articles, and who have to pay for them, are the real consumers. I am not prepared to accept as impartial the evidence given by middlemen, because whatever charges they may have to bear are merely passed on to their customers.",42
164,Mr TUDOR,MANUFACTURES,A man who kept a boot shop could not be called a consumer?,43
165,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,-Certainl y not.,43
166,Mr WATKINS,MANUFACTURES,"To the extent to which he used leather as raw material he would be a consumer, and in that respect he would occupy exactly the same position as an engineer who used iron as his raw material.",43
167,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"It is very significant that the Commissioners who signed the minority report should have stated that "" No effort was made to bring forward witnesses against the Bill . "" The report is a very negative kind of document altogether, and I leave honourable members to imagine what shape it would have assumed if witnesses hostile to the Bill had been brought forward.",43
168,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,They could not make out a case even with favourable witnesses.,43
169,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,Exactly .,43
170,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,"Person s whc were unfavorable to the Bill were invited to give evidence, but did not appear.",43
171,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"That is all very well. The honourable and learned member imagines that every one is as public-spirited as he is, and that all the members of the community are only too eager to avail themselves of an opportunity to testify upon such a subject as that which was being investigated by the Commission. I did not know that any one was free to go before the Commission. I am a member of this House, and I did not know what the honourable and learned member assumes every member of the public knew. I thought that the members of the Commission nominated their own witnesses, and, apparently they did, because I do not see any evidence of witnesses having volunteered to give evidence.",43
172,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,They were all pressed men - har d pressed for the bonus.,43
173,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"I now return to the original point. We have no' right, in my opinion, to give away enormous sums of money without first obtaining information from experts who cap tell us if we are proceeding upon right lines. We should have sought the guidance of men who are acquainted with the circumstances attending the establishment of the iron industry in America, or upon the Continent, or elsewhere.",43
174,Mr MAUGER,MANUFACTURES,The Commission should have gone to America.,43
175,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"I think it should. In any case I contend that bonuses are objectionable. I have in my hand a report which indicates some of the results brought about by the operation of bonuses in the United States. Mr Thos. W. Lawson, writing in Everybody's Magazine upon the effect of bonuses upon the political life of the United States, saysAt no time in the history of the United States has the power of dollars been as great as now. Freedom and equity are controlled by dollars. The laws which should preserve and enforce all rights are made and enforced by dollars. It is possible today, with dollars, to ""steer"" the selection of the candidates of both the great parties for the highest office in our Republic, that of President of the United States, so that the people, as a matter of fact, must elect one of the ""steered"" candidates. It is possible to repeat the operation in the selection of candidates for the executive and legislative conduct and control of every State and municipality in the United States, and with a sufficient number of dollars to "" steer"" the doings of the law-makers and law-enforcers of the national, State, and municipal governments of the people, and a sufficient proportion of the Court decisions to make absolute any power created by such direction. It is all, broadly speaking, a matter of dollars to practically accomplish these things.",43
176,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member must admit that there is a distinction between a bonus and a bribe.,43
177,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"I am not now alluding to bribes. The article refers to the indirect influence which bonuses granted in connection with the creation of artificial industries in the United States exercise upon politicians at critical times. Mr Lawson continuesI shall go further and say that there exists today uncontrolled in the hands of a set of men a power to make dollars from nothing. That function of dollar making which the people believe is vested in their government alone, and only exercised under the law for their benefit, is actually being secretly exercised on an enormous scale by a few private individuals for their own personal benefit. In reply to the honourable member ' for Moira, who, I think, misunderstood the effect of what I was' reading, I should like to mention a concrete case. Suppose that by the operation of this bonus we established, in, say, some part of New South Wales, an enormous industry, employing 5,000 or 6, ooo men, who, with those dependent upon them, would - probably represent 15,000 or 20,000 persons. Suppose further that a crisis was brought about, such as occurred a week or two ago, when one honourable member held the Government of this country, as he proudly boasted, "" in the hollow of his hand."" Let us try to conceive the extent of the pressure which might be exerted by the representative of the number of people mentioned, if they came here and asked for further concessions. Just consider the illegitimate power that they would be able to exert.",43
178,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURES,That is an against the establishment or maintenance of any industry.,44
179,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"B y State assistance, yes. It is an argument against granting State subsidies to industries, because the State has the power to increase a duty, and thereby add to the earnings of the operatives, or to decrease the protection, and bring about an opposite result. The extract which I read referred to the indirect influences exerted by the granting of State subsidies to private enterprises. We need not travel even to the United States in order to ascertain the effects of granting butter bonuses and sugar bonuses.",44
180,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURES,"If the bonus now proposed has the same effect upon the iron industry that the butter bonus has had upon the dairying industry in Victoria, there will be no reason for complaint.",44
181,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"I was referring only to one of the by-products of the bonus system. I believe that so far as the butter bonus is' concerned, it has proved of great advantage to the farmers of Victoria. Unfortunately the farmers did not get all that they were entitled to. I am merely referring to the by-products of bribery and corruption which have been the resultant of the bonus system, and whi'ch I am sure the honourable member for Moira condemns as strongly as does anybody else. I feel certain that he is disgusted with the revelations made by the .Butter Commission, and with the exposure of some ""clean."" politicians who have controlled the affairs of Victoria in the past. The House must have felt disappointed that the honourable member for Panamatta, who is one of the most valiant antagonists of the bonus system, confined his opposition to this measure to a few sentences. On a previous occasion he spoke at much greater length, but I doubt whether time will admit the reading of quotations from his address. I therefore ask leave to continue my remarks upon a future occasion.",44
182,Mr KENNEDY,MANUFACTURES,I object.,44
183,Mr MAHON,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member for Parramatta's address on a former occasion filled many pages of Hansard. As there are many new members in this House, I think they ought, to be put in possession of the arguments used against this Bill when it was first introduced. Surely, in these circumstances, the honourable' member for Moira will not persist in his objection argument to the course I suggest. Leave granted; debate adjourned. House adjourned at 4.4 p.m.",44
