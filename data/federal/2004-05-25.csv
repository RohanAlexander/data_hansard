3,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind him of his promise in December 1995 when he said: No community which holds dear practical mateship as a core national value can feel comfortable with a youth unemployment level of over 30 per cent. After eight years in government, why has the Prime Minister failed to deliver on this commitment, given that communities like Wollongong, the northern suburbs of Adelaide and Wide Bay have youth unemployment rates of over 30 per cent?",7

6,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are other forms of the House, member for MCEwen!",7
7,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"With communities like Wollongong, the northern suburbs of Adelaide and Wide Bay having youth unemployment rates of over 30 per cent, will the government now adopt Labor's policy of a youth guarantee, including our jobs gateway policy of 10,000 wage and training subsidies to get young Australians into real, lasting jobs for our unemployed youth?",7
8,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I genuinely thank the Leader of the Opposition. I really mean it. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to have a debate about youth unemployment-if he wants to compare the record of his government and, indeed, the appalling record of his two great heroes, Gough Whitlam and Paul Keating, when it comes to youth unemployment-I am perfectly happy to do so. Let me start my answer by saying that the level of youth unemployment in Australia now is dramatically lower than it was when we came to office. The level of general unemployment in this country is dramatically lower than it was when we came to office. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that teenage full-time unemployment was 26.8 per cent when Labor left office. It had peaked at 34.5 per cent in July 1992. The teenage full-time unemployment to population ratio reached 10.1 in July 1992. The teenage full-time unemployment rate was 20.6 per cent in April 2004. The full-time unemployment to population ratio for teenagers is now 4.8 per cent, which is less than half what it was under Labor, less than half of the legacy that the Labor Party left us with. The Leader of the Opposition invites me to join Labor in adopting the youth guarantee policy. Let me tell you I have no intention of joining Labor on the youth guarantee policy, because it is a bad, inadequate, weak policy. To start with, the youth guarantee would only be phased in from 2006. It would not come into full effect until 2009. It is now, for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, 2004. In the meantime, under that policy all that would be provided for teenage job seekers would be 13,000 intensive training places under a so-called link-up program-8,000 places in 2005 and 5,000 in 2006. This assistance would amount to little more than a two-week training course. It is only a fraction of the assistance that disadvantaged teenage job seekers already receive under the Job Network. This year no fewer than 31,000 teenage job seekers will be assessed as highly disadvantaged, and every one of that 31,000-not 5,000 or 8,000-will be eligible for access to the highest level of support, no matter where they live. In summary, Labor's plan is confused and confusing. But it is not really Labor's plan after all. It is certainly not the plan of Latham Labor. It is certainly not the plan of the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa. Some people have been unkind enough to say that the Leader of the Opposition pinched it from them. Some have said that he plagiarised it. Bruno BouchetHonourable members-Bruno!",7
9,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, they know Bruno. Perhaps he leaked it to them. They know Bruno. What he said at the national youth parliament-listen to thisHonourable members-The youth parliament.",8
10,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are up here wearing our heart on our sleeve about the young of Australia, but we are deriding what is said at a youth parliament! This is what he had to say: ... the purpose of this bill is to ensure that people are either learning or earning ... Where did you hear that before? From Bruno: ... learning or earning in the workforce, not simply doing nothing. Bruno said: We went to Canberra to give them our ideas and we deserved to get credit for that ... I think that is right. Just as Bill Clinton should have got the credit, so should Bruno. He said that would be ‘the right thing to do'. Remember that slogan? I think it may have been attributed to a New South Wales Labor government-I had better be careful on these attributions-of which the member for Kingsford Smith was a member. I think the late Paul Landa may have been responsible for the program that had the title ‘Do the right thing'. You should do the right thing when you pinch somebody's policy; you ought to do the right thing and you ought to give them credit for it. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 18 May, Bruno Bouchet said, ‘Latham accused of stealing ideas again ...' But it is also interesting that the plagiarism did not stop with Bruno. In November 2002 Premier Beattie's education reforms aimed to ensure that young people would be ‘earning or learning'. This has quite an ancestry. He is still in office. But let me give you one who is no longer in office. A former Victorian Labor Premier, John Cain, used the description ‘youth guarantee' for an education program in 1988. All I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is that when Labor were last in office they failed the young of Australia when it came to giving them employment. Based on the Leader of the Opposition's youth guarantee, if Labor were ever in office again, they would again be monumental failures so far as caring and delivering for the young work young force of Australia is concerned. This government has a proud record of having slashed youth unemployment. We have driven unemployment down to a level that has not been seen for a generation, and it is one of the government's proudest achievements. Prime Minister: Overseas Visit",8
11,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister inform the House of the purpose of his visit next week to the United States, the United Kingdom and France?",8
12,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Herbert for that question. As the House is aware, I will be visiting next week the United States and after that going on to the United Kingdom and briefly to France to join the 60th anniversary celebrations of the DDay landing. When in Washington, as well as meeting President Bush and other members of the administration, I will have the opportunity",9
13,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,9
14,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I expected, when the Leader of the Opposition asked his question, that he would be heard in silence. Precisely the same courtesy will be extended to the Prime Minister.",9
15,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As well as conferring with President Bush and other members of the administration, I would hope to have a wide range of political contacts. I will also have the opportunity of meeting senior Republican and Democrat senators, congressmen and key business leaders to further advance the case for the American Congress to ratify the free trade agreement. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition is nodding. I hope that connotes that the Labor Party may be moving towards supporting the free trade agreement. In addition to those discussions in Washington, I will on the way over to Washington call on the Governor of California.",9
16,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It's Twins again!,9
17,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Banks will be dealt with shortly!,9
18,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will be accompanied by Mr Don Argus, who is the Chairman of BHP Billiton. The purpose of this call is to join BHP Billiton-and I will be accompanied, as I said, by Mr Argus and senior executives of the company-to lobby for the company's bid to develop an offshore terminal to permit Australian LNG to be supplied to southern California. This terminal in itself, and its associated upstream facilities, is a project that is worth several billion dollars. If this project can be won for Australia, it will be an enormous additional export victory for this country and it will add increasingly to the export earnings of the natural gas and resource sector. The terminal in itself, with its associated upstream facilities, is a project worth several billion dollars. The associated gas supply from the gas fields off the Western Australian coast would last over several decades and would be worth billions of dollars more to the Australian economy. The value of these deals to the Australian economy, if they can be achieved, would be worth about $15 billion. As the House is aware-certainly those on this side of the House are aware-when it comes to winning many of these major resource contracts, cooperative effort between the government and business leaders is necessary. Just as the involvement of senior members of the government was instrumental in winning the LNG contract with Guangdong province in China, so it is that the association of the government with BHP Billiton's effort-and there are quite a number of competitors and the company has no more than an even money chance of winning the contract-is important. It is important that the voice of the government be the same as the voice of BHP Billiton. I will be promoting the Australian national interest. I would have thought that the purpose of prime ministers going overseas was to promote the national interest of the country. I also would have thought that it would have been in the national interest of this country for the alternative Prime Minister to feel able to visit Washington. But apparently the alternative Prime Minister of this country felt unable to visit Washington because he would not receive much of a welcome. That is a matter that the alternative Prime Minister of Australia will have to deal with. But, as for the rather phoney excuse that we were about to have an election, as I have said on numerous occasions, I can promise the Leader of the Opposition that we are not going to have an election in June. I will be looking after the interests of Australian companies and the Australian national interest. After visiting Washington I will, as I said, have a meeting with the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in London and then attend the commemorative celebrations for the D-Day landing in France the next day. While I am on my feet could I just say that, inevitably, the issue of Iraq will come up during the time that I will be in Washington. Can I take this opportunity of welcoming the speech that was made by President Bush earlier today, setting out in greater detail the goals of the United States and the coalition in relation to Iraq. I take this opporof tunity of repeating-particularly in the context of some opinion polls that reflect current Australian opinion on our participation in Iraq-that this government has absolutely no intention of altering its position in relation to being part of the coalition in Iraq. We did not enter the coalition on the basis of opinion polls last year and we have absolutely no intention, on the basis of opinion polls, of altering our position at the present time. I would remind the House and, through the House, I would remind the Australian people that the policy of the Labor Party is not that Australia should leave Iraq in December; the policy of the Labor Party is that Australia should leave Iraq immediately after 30 June. In the current context of what is occurring in Iraq, nothing could be more calculated to encourage anarchy and further bloodshed. What Iraq needs after the handover of sovereignty is the continued presence, at the request and with the consent of the Iraqi people, of international forces. However much the Leader of the Opposition may argue, ‘We're effectively arguing for troops to come out by December'because that is based on his not unreasonable calculation that he cannot pull them out unless there is a change of government and, for practical purposes, that would not be until December of this year at the earliest-it is very interesting, when you analyse what he said and what the member for Griffith has said, that what they are advocating as a matter of policy is that we should go after the handover. I cannot imagine anything which is more irresponsible and more calculated. If that advice were taken by others, I think that would condemn Iraq to a very, very dangerous future. So let me take the opportunity of saying to the House again that this government did not decide that Australia should join the coalition the willing as a result of an opinion poll and, equally, we have no intention of changing our position on the basis of an opinion poll. Education: Technical and Further Education Fees",9
19,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of concerns about local youth problems, in particular the number of students dropping out of school and dropping out of society, expressed at my community forums around Australia? Will the government now adopt Labor's policy of abolishing TAFE fees for secondary school students and increasing school participation rates by 15,000?",10
20,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not aware of what has been said at the Leader of the Opposition's community forums, but I am aware of what has been said to me as I move around different electorates in Australia, particularly in Sydney recently-and that is that working people are very cranky with Labor governments for jacking up TAFE fees. That is what I get from people when I go to the western suburbs of Sydney. So the last bloke who can come into this House and start wringing his hands about TAFE fees is a member of the Australian Labor Party. Some of the increases by Labor governments have been 300 per cent and 400 per cent in outrageous charges for TAFE fees. If the Leader of the Opposition had any genuine commitment-as opposed to some kind of rhetorical flourish with a stolen description which is the product of somebody else's idea-he would prevail upon Bob Carr and all those other people who are his friends in the New South Wales Labor Party to do something about the outrageous increases. While I am on my feet, I will add to what I said in the earlier answer in relation to youth unemployment. In his budget reply speech a couple of weeks ago, the Leader of the Opposition said-and I think he repeated it today, or words very similar to it: In some communities, the problem is critical: youth unemployment rates of more than 30 per cent in places like Wollongong, the northern urbs of Adelaide and Wide Bay in Queensland. Bear in mind that he made this remark in a nationally televised speech. It was his formal reply to the budget, so it was not an off-thecuff remark on a radio program, safe in the knowledge that the transcript would not be put out, so nobody might pick it up. I specifically point out to the Leader of the Opposition that, since 1996, in the Wide Bay region the rate has fallen by almost 10 per cent to 18.9 per cent. This was a budget reply. This was not a community forum where you think you can get away with anything; this was a budget reply to a television audience of several hundred thousand Australians waiting to hear the alternative economic policy-and they got a downright misrepresentation from the Leader of the Opposition. Iraq",10
21,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister advise the House of what actions the United Nations Security Council is taking to ensure that the handover of authority to Iraq takes place on 30 June?,11
22,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. The Australian government welcomes the draft resolution which was tabled by the British and American governments in the United Nations Security Council yesterday. This resolution is a very important component of the end of the occupation of Iraq by the Coalition Provisional Authority. It will deliver authority to a sovereign, interim government in Iraq by 30 June. The draft resolution endorses a timetable for Iraq's transition to democracy, as agreed by the Iraqi governing council back in March this year, and also provides for elections in January 2005. It calls for significant United Nations support for the process and recognises the continuing security challenges in Iraq. Importantly, the subdraft Security Council resolution reaffirms the mandate of the multinational force in Iraq for a further 12 months and calls for contributions to that multinational force. I think a lot of the debate here in Australia about this issue will be influenced by the fact that the Security Council will now be considering these issues. If the United Nations Security Council endorses the continuation of a multinational force in Iraq, then it would be a strange thing for Australia to suddenly withdraw from that force endorsed by the United Nations Security Council. Significant progress has already been made in the international community's plan for the transition of sovereignty in Iraq, and Australia has played its part in that. Twelve ministries have been set up and their authority has been handed to the Iraqis. Importantly, the Australian government has played a significant role in helping to rehabilitate the Iraqi agriculture ministry, and that has now been transferred to the Iraqis. The Australian Defence Force is doing a good job with the training of the Iraqi army and is helping with the training of Iraq's navy. Our police will help train the Iraqi police. Australian experts are helping to strengthen Iraq's legal, financial and trading systems. The United Nations envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, is nearing the end of his consultations on the formation of an interim government. We will have to wait and see, but that announcement is expected to be made by the end of this month. I think that if we do have that Iraqi interim government, as appointed by Mr Brahimi, the United Nations expert, it will be a very significant development. June 30 will constitute the day when power is handed over to the Iraqi people. This will be a very important moment because Iraq as a country will move into an era that it has not known for a very long time. There have been 3½ decades of dictatorship, and there has been coalition control over Iraq for a bit over a year. The establishment of an interim government in Iraq will hand to Iraqis control of Iraq's ministries; it will mean that Iraqis are in control of their economic policy. Very importantly-and the Australian government strongly holds this view-Iraq's oil resources will be in the hands of Iraqi authorities, not in foreign hands. Democratic elections will then follow, as I said, in January 2005. The road ahead for Iraq is not going to be an easy one, and there is no doubt that terrorists will redouble their efforts to subvert the plans and wishes of the Iraqi people. There is absolutely no doubt about that, and we have to confront that. As an international community, we have two choices. We can either cut and run from Iraq-and the Libyan foreign minister said to me the other day that, if we were to do that, we would leave Iraq, like Somalia, in a state of anarchy-or we can work, including with the United Nationsand I am optimistic about the passage of the Security Council resolution-under the auspices of a Security Council resolution to provide stability for Iraq so that, for the first time in 3½ decades, the Iraqi people can look forward to a stable and decent government. That is something that will be very important not only for the Middle East but for the world. Youth: Employment",11
23,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I suspect he might now be aware that,12
24,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Jagajaga will come to her question.,12

She would not appreciate my having to call for a later withdrawal. I am taking her word for whatever she said. She will deal with the matter before the dispatch box as she thinks appropriate.",13
36,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Minister for Employment Services put out a press release on 21 May this year, just four days ago, attaching a table which set out teenage full-time unemployment data that shows that for the Wide Bay-Burnett area the full-time unemployment rate is in fact 33½ per cent?

41,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer advise the House on the benefits flowing to Australian families as a result of the budget? How could these benefits be jeopardised under alternative schemes?,13
42,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question, and I pay tribute to the way in which he so well represents the electorate of Eden Monaro. The budget introduced new benefits for Australian families. It increased the amount of the family tax benefit by $600 per annum per child. In addition to that, it changed the taper in relation to the maximum family benefit. In addition to that, it changed the income test and the taper in relation to family tax benefit B. It introduced a new maternity payment of $3,000 per child, and in addition to that it increased child-care places for those parents that want to return to work maybe on a part-time basis. There are now going to be 40,000 additional outside school hours care places and more family day care places. The effect of all of that is that 87 per of Australian families with children will receive benefits under the changes to the family tax benefit scheme-87 per cent. Including tax cuts in the budget, there will be 99.8 per cent of Australian families with children which receive benefits by way of either the family tax benefit or tax cuts announced in the budget-99.8 per cent of Australian families with children. This is of enormous benefit. If we go down some of the electorates, there are 47,000 families in the electorate of Werriwa, 99.8 per cent of them receiving benefits. In the seat of Eden-Monaro, there are 53,813 families with children, and 99.8 per cent of Australian families receive benefits-and so we could go on. The family tax benefitMr Gibbons interjecting",13
43,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Bendigo is warned!,14
44,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Bendigo? Yes, the member for Bendigo asked about Bendigo: there are 48,945 families in Bendigo, and 99.8 per cent of Australian families benefit. The people of Bendigo ought to know that, if it had been for the member for Bendigo, there would have been no benefits for families in the budget. What is more, they ought to know this: if they vote for the member for Bendigo, there is no guarantee that those benefits will stay, because the Australian Labor Party reserves the right to take away the family tax benefit and the income tax cuts. So a vote for the Labor member for Bendigo is a vote against family tax benefits and tax cuts, and I hope the people of Bendigo remember that in the next election. You can claim the family tax benefit under the tax system or you can claim it as a fortnightly payment. If you claim it under the tax system, the effect of the family tax benefit means that a single income family with two children do not pay tax until their family incent come goes above $40,975. Let me say that again: if you claim it through the tax system, the effect is that a single income family with two children do not pay any tax in net terms until their income reaches $40,975. If you claim it through the tax system and you are a two income family with an 80-20 split and three children, the effect is that your family do not pay net income tax until the family income goes above $51,633. So for families on incomes of $40,000 and $50,000 it is much better than income splitting. In fact, they do not pay net tax with those cameos that I have previously illustrated. What do the Australian Labor Party say about all this? They say they reserve the right to take away the benefits and they reserve the right to take away the income tax cuts. They say that they are in favour of more tax cuts, but they cannot tell you what the thresholds will be, what the rates will be, when they will come into effect, how much they will cost and how they will pay for them. We have been doing some work to try to figure out what the income tax thresholds of the Labor Party would be. What would you do if you wanted to find out what the likely policy of the Australian Labor Party was? A government member-Ask the ACTU.",14
45,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. We have been reading every State of the Union address ever delivered by Bill Clinton to try and out what the Australian Labor Party tax thresholds are likely to be. We find out when we read these State of the Union addresses that Bill Clinton favoured much larger tax cuts for people on higher incomes. In the United States you do not start paying top marginal tax rates until well in excess of what they are in Australia. So looking for guidance from Bill Clinton is not going to justify the criticisms that the Australian Labor Party have been making in relation to this budget, nor indeed the Third Way of Mr Blair and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown. The whole of Australia has been promised by Labor that it will announce tax cuts, and Australia waits. I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition has cancelled his trip to America, allegedly to stay home for the election. But the tax policy is presumably going to be announced by the member for Hotham, and the member for Hotham has not cancelled his scheduled trip to Kenya and Zambia in view of the imminent election. In fact, now joinsome wags have suggested that the ALP has asked the member for Hotham to extend his visit to Kenya and Zambia, given the imminence of the election. The time is now and the Labor Party has made the promise. Back it up and answer this one question: where is the money coming from? Youth: Employment",15
46,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question again is to the Prime Minister, and I refer to his answer to a question earlier today when he referred to claims by Bruno Bouchet that the Leader of the Opposition had plagiarised its ‘learn or earn' policy statement from material presented to a youth parliament. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Chief Executive Officer of the National Council of the YMCAs of Australia-the organisation responsible for the youth parfind liament-has written to the Leader of the Opposition today saying that they apologise for any embarrassment.

63,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware of a recent survey of doctors practising in regional Australia? Does this survey show the impact of government policies encouraging more doctors to practise in the area of regional Australia?,16
64,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed, a recent survey by Monash University has just revealed some pretty good news-that is, that the policies we have been adopting as a government to trainMs King interjecting",16
65,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Ballarat!,16
66,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"more doctors for rural service and to encourage them to move to rural areas and stay there is working very well indeed. In this budget, with an $830 million commitment, we take that further forward. The findings of the survey establish that there is a surprisingly high degree of satisfaction on the part of rural GPs with their lot in life and with their general practice in regional areas. Three-quarters of rural general practitioners, both male and female, are satisfied with rural practice. Even more are content with their life as a rural doctor. That is a very important measure and one that I think rural communities around Australia will welcome and use in their efforts to attract still more doctors back to rural and regional practice. The study found that ‘training programs are working'. There has been a significant increase in the number of female doctors who felt prepared for rural practice since 1996, and the doctors make it plain that it is feeling prepared for and familiar with country work that gives them the confidence to work in country areas. That feeling of being prepared has risen from 51 per cent over the last eight years to 66 per cent, and the proportion of male doctors who now feel prepared for rural practice has increased from below 70 per cent to well over 70 per cent. The Monash University study also found that the demographic profile of rural doctors is changing. In fact, compared with the national average there is a higher proportion of female doctors in the 45 to 49 age group in rural practice, and that suggests that female doctors are staying in practice longer. That is very welcome. For male doctors, compared with the national average the survey found that there are fewer rural doctors in the over60 group and more in the under-35 group. In other words, more young male doctors are being attracted into rural practice. All of this is very encouraging and it reflects on our efforts in government to address what has been at the top of concerns for everyone on this side of the House who represents a regional area, I think it is fair to say, for the last 15 years-the shortage of doctors, specialists and allied health care workers. We set out to address that problem. The way the Leader of the Opposition talks you would think that he alone had discovered some things in life, like teenagers and fatherhood and community forums. But as one who has run community forums and participated in them in regional Australia for 15 years and does them all the time, I can tell you that, as he might not have been out there in regional Australia. I don't think he has; I do know the member for Hotham almost never goes out there-he would not be in a position to clearly identify what comes up all the time when you talk to country people and regional Australians, and there are seven million of them, about their concerns on health. There is the chronic shortage of doctors and specialists, which we are now correcting, and we have that chronic shortage in very large part because the ALP went to sleep at the wheel on this. They let the country intake of kids into our medical schools fall from around 25 per cent to five per cent, and we have got it back up to about 25 per cent. That is giving us the pool we need for the future. You can get reaction to a few things out in the bush-you really can. If you say, ‘If you get Mr Latham, you'd get Mr Crean running the economy,' you can see them visibly taken aback. If you want a second rise out of them, you say, ‘If you have Mr Latham running the place, you get not only Mr Crean but also the MUA under Martin Ferguson taking over transport again.' But if you want a complete failure to get any reaction at all-just a blank stare-you say to them, ‘You know, the member for Batman, Martin Ferguson, is also their spokesman for regional affairs.' They say: ‘Really? We didn't know they had one. We certainly haven't seen any policy direction from them.' Let me issue this one challenge to the Labor Party on regional policies: if it is beyond them-if it is beyond the wit of the Labor Party and beyond the wit of the member for Batman-to come up with any positive initiative at all for regional Australia, they might at least confirm that they will retain the policies we are so successfully implementing in the interests of country services. Youth: Employment",16
67,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Does the minister stand by his media release of 13 May 2004 that Labor is trying to manufacture a youth problem and that the youth problem is just a myth? Is the minister aware that teenage unemployment in the electorate of Richmond is 25 per cent-that is, one in four teenagers is not in full-time study or work? Will the minister now admit that young people in Richmond and other parts of Australia need Labor's youth guarantee and adopt this policy?",17
68,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Grayndler for his question. It is not often I thank the Labor Party. Mr Albanese interjecting,17
69,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank them for the opportunity for answering it, too! But I will say this about the youth guarantee: the Prime Minister will remember that the last guarantee given to this parliament was a guarantee by Bob Hawke that no child would live in poverty. There was not too much on that guarantee, was there? But I can tell you what we will be guaranteeing. As the Prime Minister mentioned before, this government has created more job opportunities and more employment prospects, and more young people are in study today than there ever were under the old ALP regime. Indeed, it is interesting because Bruno's ‘learn or earn'which we know was plagiarised, even though you sort of heavied him, and we know he gave it to the Dusseldorf forum",17
70,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will address his remarks through the chair.,17
71,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would just like to quote-and I think this is important-a transcript of the John and Ross breakfast show on 4BC. They were talking about Bruno from the national youth parliament, who accused opposition leader Mark Latham of plagiarising his learn or earn policy. Learn or earn-I think it is more a ‘churn' policy, but I will come back to that-for young people was presented by something that you have been highly critical of, the national youth parliament, at the Dusseldorf forum. He said that he is seriously upset with Latham over the pinching of the concept. However, he is disappointed that Latham has not given credit to the group for bringing this concept to the table. I think that puts tive. When it comes to employment prospects it is interesting that, when the now shadow Treasurer was the Minister for Employment in the halcyon days of KeatingHawke, youth unemployment was at 19.8 per cent. That figure is substantially lower today. Indeed, in my federal seat of Richmond, the level of unemployment for youth is significantly lower than it was when the ALP was last in government. Interestingly, when you look at it, the risks to young people today are some of the industrial relations policies that you would put into place, if you were ever to gain government, which would have a devastating impact on young people. Of course, they are abolishing junior wage rates and making casual workers permanent. I would have thought that the greatest thing that this government has been able to do is create an employment environment where young people have opportunity. Indeed, when we introduced Youth Allowance it was opposed tooth and nail by the Labor Party because back in those days it was easier to get the dole than it was to go on to further study and education. This government has a very good record when it comes to creating employment opportunities, particularly for young Australians. Ms Macklin-I seek leave to table a letter from the National Council of the YMCA, which includes a statement of apology from Mr Bouchet. Leave granted. Health: Services",17
72,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister inform the House of government actions to boost the number of doctors in outer metropolitan areas like Dickson. How will this help Austrait into perspeclian families?,18
73,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dickson for his question, and I know how keen he is to get even more doctors into his area. I can inform him and the House that the Howard government is spending about a half a billion dollars over the current four-year period to get more doctors into medical practice in Australia. Under the MedicarePlus program announced late last year and strengthened earlier this year, there will be 246 extra medical school places every year. That is almost a 20 per cent increase. There will be an extra 700 suitably qualified, overseas trained doctors helped into practice in Australia. Doctors who have taken early retirement or extended maternity leave will also be encouraged to return to medical practice. As well as increasing the number of doctors, we need to improve the distribution of doctors, because too many doctors have tended to cluster in inner city areas close to traditional teaching hospitals and longestablished medical schools. But I can tell the House that, since January last year, under the More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas program, some 160 doctors have relocated from inner to outer metropolitan areas. They have gone from areas that are relatively well served by doctors into areas of greatest patient need. Under this carefully targeted incentive program, the House will be pleased to know that there are 18 new doctors in Dickson, 11 new doctors in Macquarie and five new doctors in Dobell. Lest anyone think this program is in some way politically targeted as well as targeted to areas of need, I can inform the House that there are eight new doctors in Lalor and three new doctors in Werriwa, but I am not expecting any time soon to get a congratulatory press release out of either the shadow minister or the Leader of the Opposition. Let me quote Dr Christopher Harrison, who has moved to Tuggeranong: Usually for a GP when you start it takes a fair while to build the practice up, but it has been really busy from the word go. He said of the government's policies: It certainly did influence my decision to work Tuggeranong, rather an easier environment. Let me make it very clear that this government does not believe in medical conscription. We certainly cannot force doctors to work anywhere other than a place that they choose, but we do believe in carefully targeted incentives and these are delivering more doctors to Australians who need better health care.",18
74,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition tabled with our leave a letter from the National Council of YMCA, and it refers to a statement of apology from Mr Bouchet but the statement is not there. It is only the covering letter. Mr Crean interjectingMrs Crosio interjecting",19
75,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Let me point out to the member for Hotham and the Chief Opposition Whip-so anxious to interrupt whether she has the call or not, as if there were some extra licence in being the Chief Opposition Whip-that the Prime Minister rose, sought indulgence, was granted indulgence and has illustrated a difficulty with the tabling that I think could now be resolved in consultation with the member for Jagajaga.",19
76,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a letter from Bob Nicholson, the chief executive officer, and he says here, ‘I have attached for your information a statement of apology.' The statement of apology is not attached. That is the only point I am making.",19
77,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has made the point. It can be sorted out with the member for Jagajaga. Budget 2004-05,19
78,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services. Is the minister aware the Department of Family and Community in Services has provided information to Senate estimates indicating that more than 600,000 families are likely to have family debts from last financial year? Is it the case that the debts of these families, including more than 4,000 in your electorate, will claw back the promised $600 from the government due later this year? Is it the case that around one in three families will not receive the full $600 payment promised in the budget because of their debt?",19
79,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before I call the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I point out the member for Lilley that the term ‘your electorate', within the context of the question, was not appropriate.",19
80,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lilley for his question. I have got the quinella today. The inference that the shadow minister is making is that families will not receive this. The fact is that every Australian family will receive $600 per child-the first payment before 30 June, and in the next financial year they will receive another $600 payment; that is every Australian family. In fact, the greatest risk to Australian families with the introduction of the family tax benefit is the Labor Party, who have not given a guarantee of supporting the second payment that will be made next year. There has always been a knowledge in Australia that families are receiving very generous family tax benefit, and I must say that since the coalition came to government that has increased by more than 111 per cent from 1996 through to today. All Australian families were major beneficiaries in the budgetMr Swan-All of them?",19
81,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The facts are that Australian families will all receive-as the Treasurer mentioned, at least 87 per cent receive family tax benefitOpposition members-Oh!",20
82,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and 97 per cent of Australian families or higher will receive tax or family tax benefits. Given the line being run by the shadow spokesperson here, the only hope that he can give to Australian families is to scare them. The fact is that will be receiving $600 per child by 30 June and they will be receiving $600 for every child forever. The average payment now, if you are a single-income family on $40,000 a year, is $4,300. That will go up to around $6,300, an increase of $2,000. All Australian family tax benefit families will get it. Budget 2004-05",20
83,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Would the minister inform the House of measures announced in this year's budget for Australian exporters? How will these measures help exporters take advantage of free trade agreements the government has negotiated?,20
84,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I am sure he is aware that as part of the budget the Treasurer brought down a couple of weeks ago there was an extra $19.6 million allocated to Austrade to assist exporters to take advantage of the bilateral free trade agreements that we have negotiated over the last couple of years with Singapore, the United States and Thailand and also to take advantage of the opportunities since China's accession to the WTO and the work we are doing with China in scoping the possibility of a free trade agreement. The objective of the government is to open up new opportunities for Australia's exporters so that we can grow the economy and provide extra economic activity in the community which delivers jobs. That has been happening under the guidance of this government since 1996, and over a million jobs have been created. This is another policy that is aimed clearly at generating good jobs-and jobs in export industries on avercuts age are better paid and under better conditions and provide better training for employees. So we are going to allocate this extra funding to Austrade to work with the private they sector, with the business community, to seek out opportunities as a result of those free trade agreements. Those new export opportunities equal new export sales, which equals new jobs for Australians, particularly young Australians, in the Australian economy. It is interesting to note some of the analysis that has been done on some of the agreements. For the information of the House, the actual text of the Australia-Thailand free trade agreement is now publicly available, along with the economic modelling on that agreement. That shows a benefit to the Australian economy of $US2.4 billion over 20 years, which is certainly a very good outcome for the Australian economy. I note and understand that the Australian Labor Party are going to support the Australian government on the Australia-Thailand free trade Agreement with that sort of benefit to the bottom line. Yet that free trade agreement and the benefits that accrue to the economy from it are dwarfed by the opportunities and the benefits that will be delivered to the Australian economy as a result of the US free trade agreement, arguably $US6.1 billion after 10 years. It begs the question why the Leader of the Opposition would be prepared to support a trade agreement that is going to deliver $2.4 billion and yet he will not support a trade agreement that is going to deliver $6.1 billion. If you convert that into job opportunities in the community and in our economy, it is many thousands of jobs. If the Leader of the Opposition is serious about generating new jobs, real jobs for Australians in exporting industries in Australia, he will get behind the government and support the United States free trade agreement. Environment: Water Management",20
85,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Given that the 1995 Council of Australian Governments agreement included recognition of water property rights as a prerequisite for water reform, and given the Prime Minister's commitment in September 2002 to put in place the appropriate benchmarks to deliver property rights for water entitlement holders, will the Prime Minister ensure that these rights will be finally recognised at the upcoming June Council of Australian Governments meeting?",21
86,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will do my best but I, as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, and the federal government, given the nature of the Australian Constitution, do not have the ultimate say in relation to this. I have to say I regret that that is the case. I think it an issue which is increasingly national in focus. Rivers flow across state borders and the Great Artesian Basin lies beneath the boundaries of various states and territories of Australia. In order to get a satisfactory outcome we need the cooperation of the states. So far there has been a good deal of cooperation. I welcome that fact. I will be working very hard indeed to do what I can to bring about an agreement. We have put Commonwealth money on the table. We have initiated the discussions. The Deputy Prime Minister has done an outstanding job on behalf of the federal government on this matter. He has done more for water reform in this country than any person I have known in federal politics, and he deserves a great deal of credit for all of this work. But in the end the property rights of this country are determined by the state governments. That might be okay with land; I am becoming increasingly doubtful that it is a good idea in relation to water, because of the fact that it is a national challenge. I take the opportunity in answering the member for New England of appealing to the state premiers to put aside their parochialism on this issue and to recognise that it is a national challenge. I am distressed to hear arguments between Queensland and New South Wales about water entitlements. I think it is a great pity. Seeing that we were able to resolve the impasse over the Tugun bypass between New South Wales and Queensland, I hope it is possible to do the same in relation to water. We will be trying very hard indeed at this meeting. It will be the main item on the agenda. If it does not come off, it will not be for want of the Commonwealth trying and it will not be for want of the effort of the Deputy Prime Minister. Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker, on indulgence: the Prime Minister was asking a quesis tion about a document that I tabled. I want to let him know that the opposition has been requested by the YMCA not to table",21
87,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,21
88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Jagajaga has indicated why the document was not available. Ms Macklin-I have not finished yetand it is very important. The opposition has been requested not to table the accompanying statement by Mr Bouchet in order to avoid further embarrassment to him. If the Prime Minister wishes to confirm the authenticity of Mr Bouchet's apology, I would be happy to provide him with a copy.",21
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is an unusual sequence of events, but I have initiated it, will allow it to continue.",22
90,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on indulgence: the whole basis of this was to found a request that I apologise to the Leader of the Opposition. That was the whole idea of it. The member for Jagajaga has tabled an inadequate document. The member for Jagajaga should have made it plain to the House when she tabled this document the circumstances to which she has now alluded. It is only because we bothered to pursue it that she has stood up-and this is the person who was accusing me of misleading the House! Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I am quite happy to hand a copy of this statement to the Prime Minister.",22
91,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honourable members interjecting Ms Macklin-Oh, you do not want it? I will give the Prime Minister a copy later. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Jagajaga said that she was going to table a letter and a statement.",22
92,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting Mr Abbott-She did! She did say that she was going to table the statement. I have to come to the reluctant conclusion that she was misleading us.,22
93,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Let me clarify for the sake of the House that the Prime Minister sought indulgence over a matter of tabling. The member for Jagajaga has sought to clarify that matter and offered to make the letter available to the Prime Minister. I consider the matter closed. Environment: Greenhouse Gas Emissions,22
94,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. Would the minister inform the House of actions being taken by the so I government to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies? How might these policies impact on employment prospects and consumers?,22
95,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for what is a very timely question, because an important difference has opened up between the policies of the government and the policies of the Latham Labor Party over Australia's response to climate change. The difference is simply this: the Howard government has put in place policies that will bring Australia in or under its internationally negotiated target for greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. That is the first point-our policies have succeeded; we will produce the level of abatement of emissions that is necessary for Australia to reach its international target. The second point is that we have done this in ways that have not imposed huge costs on Australian industry and families, and we have not undermined Australia's international competitiveness in doing so. We are in fact investing over $1 billion in carefully targeted measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and we have involved almost all major Australian companies in effective action. The third point is that we can position Australia very responsibly to act for the future in relation to climate change without taking action that will cost jobs, damage our competitiveness or hurt the families of Australia. That is where the massive contrast with the Labor Party has opened up, because despite the fact that the government policies are positioning Australia to reach its international target the Labor Party wants to go further. The Labor Party's approach is to deliberately cut back on Australia's economic growth and to impose huge burdens on Australian industry that will cost jobs and drive investment offshore. There are two planks to Labor's policy. The first is to ratify the Kyoto protocol and introduce an emissions trading scheme. The second is to lift the mandatory renewable energy target to five per cent. Each one of these will impose massive costs on Australian industry and cost jobs. As evidence of this, we have a report that was apparently commissioned by the Victorian government-I suspect on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition-from Allen Consulting to study the impacts on the economy of an emissions trading scheme. Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting",22
96,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Wills!,23
97,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On 19 May, the Australian reported the results of the Allen Consulting study. The Australian stated that this scheme: ... would knock out 15,000 jobs, slash the national economy and lead to an explosion in power prices ... Indeed, one of the scenarios in this report would have raised electricity prices by 27 per cent. I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he ensure that this report is made fully public as soon as possible. It is an emissions trading scheme, which I suppose is as good for workers in the Latrobe Valley as tolls on the Scoresby Freeway are good for all motor car drivers in Victoria. It is a scheme that will take away thousands of jobs from working Australian men and womenMr Kelvin Thomson interjecting",23
98,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Wills!,23
99,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and their families. Why is the Labor Party doing this? Why is the Labor Party trying to put the brakes on the Australian economy? Because it wants Greens preferences. Because the Greens party does not support economic growth and the Labor Party has been forced, in order to try to get these preferences, to move towards these incredible, crazy policies. Yet, Mr Speaker, there is more, because the Labor Party has gone further down this dangerous road with the Greens party: it has agreed to a five per cent mandatory renewable energy target. The effect of this five per cent target would be to impose an $11.5 billion cost on Australian industry by the year 2020, with a cumulative negative impact on GDP of billions of dollars. So what the Labor Party's cynical effort to buy Greens preferences means is that it is prepared to put the brakes on the Australian economy, to destroy thousands of Australian jobs, to take out the futures of tens of thousands of Australian families, and all for cynical, opportunistic political purposes. The Leader of the Opposition, through the Labor Party's climate change policies, is now playing dice with the future of Australian families and Australian businesses. The Leader of the Opposition is not about climbing the ladder of opportunity; he is now sliding rapidly down the snake of opportunism. Australian Broadcasting Authority: Professor David Flint",23
100,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to today's disclosure in Senate estimates that the ABA received legal advice from Julian Burnside QC that its chairman, Professor David Flint, should disqualify himself from adjudicating on matters regarding John Laws and Alan Jones because of possible perceptions of bias. Given Professor Flint's political interventions now raise such possibilities in regard to issues which may involve 2UE, 2GB, the ABC, even Channel 9 and political advertising, how does the Prime Minister justify retaining Professor Flint in office when so much of the area he is required to regulate is off limits because of a perception of bias?",23
101,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I start my answer by reminding the member for Melbourne that the Chairman of the ABA does not hold office at my pleasure or, indeed, at the pleasure of the government. It is a statutory appointment and there are certain procedures in relation to it. I have already indicated that I had sought advice in relation to certain matters concerning Professor Flint. When I have received the totality of that advice I will have something further to say. Workplace Relations: Small Business",24
102,Mr SOMLYAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I address my question to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister outline to the House the government's response to the decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to expose small business to massive new redundancy costs? Is the minister aware of any alternative views?,24
103,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fairfax for his question and his ongoing concern for the many small businesses that operate in his electorate. Tomorrow I will be introducing legislation which seeks to protect small business from unaffordable increases in the costs of running their business. This arises from the decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission which lifted the 20-year exemption for small businesses from redundancy payments. The government has taken the decision to introduce this legislation because the imposition of more business costs on small business will simply mean the loss of jobs for Australians. The commission's decision seriously underestimates the impact that redundancy pay would have on small business. Picture a small business, for example, with seven employees, each with six years of continuous service. Under this decision, that small business would now face a contingent liability for redundancy pay of nearly $30,000. Small business cannot afford this type of impost, and the government will not allow it to occur. Since 1996, the Australian government has taken a series of tough decisions to reform Australia's workplace relations system, which, in turn, has assisted in the creation of 1.3 million extra jobs in this country. This has not come about by way of accident. It has come about because of the consistent, disciplined commitment to reform of the Australian economy. By contrast, the only consistency from the Australian Labor Party has been its consistent opposition to any workplace reform in this country. It should come as no surprise to members that since 1993 the Australian Labor Party has not supported any major reform of the workplace relations system in Australia, and indeed it has been pointed out to this House on other occasions that it stood in the way of reforming the unfair dismissal laws on some 40 separate occasions. It appears also that the Labor Party intends to stand in the way of this legislation. In fact, when asked about it, the Leader of the Opposition said: We're not here to overturn the independent decisions of the commission, I can assure you. This government will not stand by and let decisions like this damage Australia's economy and lead to the destruction of jobs in this country. What this indicates, once again, is that the Leader of the Opposition does not understand the impact on small business. He does not understand the impact of standing in the way of reforming the unfair dismissals legislation, and he does not understand the impact of his crazy, casual policy. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition does not understand the detail on these positions whatsoever. We saw, today, another example of the lack of attention to detail by the Leader of the Opposition, who confused, either wittingly or because of his sloppy research, the difference between youth and teenage unemployment in this country. This total, sloppy attention to any detail is something which he has repeated on a number of occasions now. It is little wonder that the Combined Small Business Alliance of Western Australia has said that small business should ‘be afraid, be very afraid' of the Australian Labor Party. The refusal of the Labor Party to support small business is further evidence that the Leader of the Opposition does not understand the detail of the Australian economy and therefore could not be trusted with it.",24
104,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Youth: Employment",25
105,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have a question to you. I understand that in question time today the member for Jagajaga said, ‘ Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table a ter from the National Council of the YMCA, which includes a statement of apology from Mr Bouchet.' That is my understanding of what she said. My question to you is: would you please check the Hansard record and, if that is in fact what she said-given that she has definitely not tabled that statementwould you please require her to apologise to the House.",25
106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I will check the Hansard record, as I always do at the conclusion of every question time, for very obvious reasons, and consider what action, if any, is appropriate. Parliament House: Security",25
107,Mr MURPHY,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, last night, courtesy of a news bulletin on the public broadcaster, I learned that, concomitant with the security upgrade of the forecourt of Parliament House, the windows of the ministerial wing of Parliament House were being reinforced to withstand a blast. I ask you: what about the rest of us?",25
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Let me state the obvious to the member for Lowe. The Security Management Board of the parliament determine the security risk of all parts of the parliament. There is no desire to ensure that any human beings in any one part of the building are more protected than others; and, on their professional advice, all the works are done. Budget 2004-05",25
109,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I have a question to you. It relates to the budget papers concerning employment in the parliament. In particular, the departmental budget statements at page 21, with regard to the House of Reps, indicate that the average staffing level in the House will fall by 22 because of a transfer to the Department of Parliamentary Services. Although you are not responsible for this, just for letbackground the Senate papers say something similar relating to a reduction in staff of 52 for the same reason. I was surprised to see this and ask if you could explain to the House why the Department of Parliamentary Services budget statement indicates that, notwithstanding that transfer of 74 staff to them, their average staffing level will fall by 19which seems to be a loss of 93 other jobs somewhere in the parliament. I wonder if you could explain that to me.",25
110,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Let me attempt, without a briefing, to address the question raised by the member for Fraser and retain the right to come back to him in the House with more detail should I be in error. The decision to rationalise the parliamentary administration and go from five departments to three came with the understanding that there would be a reduction in staff positions; and, as I recall it, those staff positions would all be voluntary reductions. I will check the figures, but I am not surprised at the fall in the number being employed by the three departments compared with the previous circumstance. If I have your question in error, I will come back to you with a more comprehensive answer. Questions on Notice",25

120,Mr TOLLNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, the member for Port Adelaide is reported to have told members of the media that on Qantas flight 708 on Sunday evening, 23 May, I rose from my seat while the seatbelt signs were still on, that I annoyed Qantas cabin crew, and that I sevbehaved in a boorish manner. This report has considerably embarrassed me and it is greatly exaggerated. I have spoken with a colleague, the member for Barker, and he confirms my memory: that I did rise from my seat in order to retrieve my bag, which was located in an overhead locker",26
121,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! Would the member for Solomon come to the point of his misrepresentation.,26
122,Mr TOLLNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I have several points, Mr Speaker. I did rise from my seat in order to retrieve my bag, which was located in an overhead locker several seats behind where I was sitting",26
123,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The member for Solomon needs only to indicate that he has been misrepresented, not to advance an argument.",26
124,Mr TOLLNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"but this was after the plane had landed and had come to a stop. I did speak with the member for Sturt and with the member for Port Adelaide during the flight, although my conversation with the member for Port Adelaide was limited to a very brief exchange. I tapped him on the shoulder and he indicated",26
125,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The member for Solomon will resume his seat. This is a matter of constant problem for the chair. Members on both sides seek to use personal explanations to advance a great deal more information than is necessary. The member for Solomon must indicate that he has been misrepresented by a particular report and therefore seek to have the report corrected.,26
126,Mr TOLLNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, I have been misrepresented in a number of reports and I am alluding to those areas where I have been misrepresented.",27
127,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I understand, and I have not required you to resume your seat. I have allowed you the courtesy of continuing. But I expect you to come quickly to either the misrepresentation or any correction. In future, it would be helpful if matters of misrepresentation were brought to my office, as other members have done, in order to minimise this sort of exercise.",27
128,Mr TOLLNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I did not, as reported by the News Ltd journalist, slap anyone, nor did any Qantas crew member speak with me directly. I understand there was no incident report from the Qantas crew that evening. I note the member for Port Adelaide has today denied in a radio interview some parts of the printed media reports-all from the same source-in particular, that I slapped the member for Sturt. He now states that I ruffled the member's hair.",27
129,Unknown,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Honourable members interjecting,27
130,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The member for Solomon will conclude his statement.,27
131,Mr TOLLNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"While I say the printed media reports are a considerable exaggeration of what actually occurred, I apologise unreservedly to any member who took offence. The report was untrue and exaggerated for, I believe, the clear political purpose of embarrassing me",27

136,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The member for Port Adelaide may proceed.,27
137,Mr SAWFORD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The personal explanation of the member for Solomon with regard to me is untrue. The truth is his behaviour was contemptuous of the safety requirements of Qantas and the flight crew of QF 708 last Sunday evening from Adelaide to Canberra.,27
138,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The member for Port Adelaide will resume his seat. The member for Port Adelaide has just illustrated the very fact that causes all occupiers of the chair so many problems over a facility that should simply allow members to ensure that they are not misrepresented.,27

146,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Jagajaga proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The urgent need to assist the 45,000 fifteen eighteen year olds who leave school early every year and do not go on to either a full-time job or further study by implementing the Youth Guarantee: Learn or Earn policy. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",28
147,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I hear on the grapevine that the government has been scrambling for a response to Labor's youth guarantee. Once again it is the case that the government has been completely floored by Labor's initiative, and apparently it is frantically rushing around trying to catch up with the latest of Labor's great policy ideas. The government is in disarray trying to put together a response to our learn or earn youth guarantee. It must have known for years that youth unemployment is out of control, but unfortunately it has been prepared to just mouth empty platitudes. Now I hear, though, that the Minister for Education, Science and Training and his department have been spurred into action. Of course, that is only because they have to follow Labor's lead. We saw it first of all with parliamentary superannuation, then we saw it with Labor's baby care payment and with Labor's policy on children's literacy. Now, I gather, we are seeing it inside the Department of Education, Science and Training in relation to Labor's youth guarantee. Labor have put all of these issues on the national agenda-each and every one of them. We are leading the policy agenda, and all the Howard government can do is copy each of these great policy ideas. We can only hope that at some point in the near future, for the sake of the young people of Australia, to they will do the same when it comes to our youth guarantee. I am told that just last week state offices of the Minister for Education, Science and Training's department were instructed to hurriedly summarise all the state and territory youth initiatives, just to see what ideas the Commonwealth could use. You can just imagine it-the minister for education sending them off in a panic. The ministers certainly cannot agree on which songbook to sing from. They are all over the shop. They cannot decide which unemployment figures they will use. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations-the senior minister-was trying to talk down the issue of youth unemployment. He said in a statement that youth unemployment in Queensland's Wide BayBurnett region was just 18.9 per cent. But at least we have a Minister for Employment Services who can get it right. Just three days after his senior minister said that, the Minister for Employment Services came out and said that the youth unemployment figure for Wide Bay-Burnett had magically risen to the much more accurate level of 33.5 per cent. The Prime Minister got caught in this crossfire today in question time. He got the teenage unemployment rate in Wide BayBurnett wildly wrong and had to be corrected-and, I am pleased to say, in the first instance by his own minister. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has, as usual, thrown in his two bob's worth. He is claiming that the youth problem is just a myth, even though youth unemployment in his own electorate is 25 per cent. All this sudden activity by this government and all these mixed messages are yet another effort by the government to try and protect its political hide. It has been three long years since the government released a very good report called Footsteps to the Future, which is about how record numbers of young Australians are falling through the cracks. Mind you, the government were not that keen to release that report. They sat on this very important report for nearly a year before it was finally released. This report told a shocking story-a shocking story that continues today-of the circumstances of growing numbers of Australian young people; staggering numbers of young Australians not in either full-time study or full-time employment; record numbers of young people being afflicted with serious social problems, like alcohol and drug dependency, mental health problems and youth suicide; and more and more young people engaging in crime and antisocial behaviour. The report made no bones about the fact that the key to addressing any of these risks to young people involved supporting their transition from school to further education or employment. The Howard government was told that three long years ago, yet there has been next to no response from it since. The sum total of new activity has been a smattering of tiny pilots for just a handful of young Australians. This is something we have come to expect from this Prime Minister. In the lead-up to the 1996 election, the Prime Minister talked about youth unemployment as ‘the biggest social problem facing Australia'. He repeated it again before the last election. Just days before the 2001 poll, the Prime Minister declared: A focus on early intervention means looking to our young people, and ensuring that they have every support as they move from school and dependence on their families to further education or training, the paid workforce and independent adulthood. What a truckload of empty rhetoric from this Prime Minister-something we have come to expect. Clearly the Prime Minster was more than happy to talk about youth unemployment when an election was coming up, so maybe we can expect to hear a bit about it over the next few months. But what the people of Australia-parents, and young people who are at risk-should recognise is that this Prime Minister will not do anything. He certainly will not act once the election is behind him. We know that the government has just been engaged in little bits of window dressing. There has been a grand total of 20 career and transition projects, or CATS; a grand total of 21 partnerships outreach education models, or POEMS; and a few more Jobs Pathway programs-and that is across the whole of the country. What is more-and this is causing a lot of distress out in the community-the government has refused to commit to even this piddling number of programs for more than 12 months at a time. That means not only that the future of these programs has been hanging in the balance and shrouded in uncertainty but also high staff turnover and an inability for young people and program staff to form ongoing trusting relationships, something which is very important and necessary and something which one would expect the minister for education to know. Schools have become reluctant to take these program workers into their schools because of the damage that is done to students when there is no guarantee that these very important workers will be sticking around. What we are seeing is vulnerable young people who need certainty being used by the government as political footballs and not getting the support they need. All the while, youth unemployment has been steadily climbing in many regions in Australia. Let us take, as an example, the northern suburbs of Adelaide, an area blighted by high youth unemployment, an area I know the minister for education is timately familiar with. When the Footsteps to the Future report was released back in May 2001, youth unemployment in that area was already almost 28 per cent. Now it has hit a staggering 37.3 per cent. What has the government done? Nothing-absolutely nothing. There was nothing new in the budget to tackle the staggering levels of youth unemployment in Australia and there was certainly nothing to help those teenagers in the northern suburbs of Adelaide. I heard that the government is now scrambling around because Labor has again taken the lead on this critical issue that should on the national agenda. It has taken Labor to put it on the national agenda. Once again, we have a government in frantic catch-up mode. The policy announced by the Leader of the Opposition just over a week ago is that in government we will introduce a youth guarantee. We want to make sure that all teenagers are given the backing they need to learn or earn. There will be no third option, if Labor is in government, of doing nothing about teenagers getting into trouble on the streets. We want to make sure that 15to 18-yearolds are given the support they need to stay at school, get a place at TAFE or at university, get a job or an apprenticeship. We will have a number of strategies-to keep more young people at school, for example. It is extraordinary that we have a minister for education who does not think that we should encourage more people to stay at school to finish year 12. Unlike this minister for education, we will make sure that schools that really need targeted support get that support and that schools with high drop-out rates will get the resources to help students stay at school. Most importantly, a Latham Labor government will pay the fees for secondary students who want to study TAFE courses. This in- means that any student can undertake a TAFE course while at school and their parents or school, as a result of Labor's policy, will save hundreds of dollars in fees. Quite absurdly, the minister for education, in response to this terrific promise of ours, has released a statement saying that we cannot do any such thing and that such matters should be left to the states. I am happy to tell the minister that we can and we will abolish TAFE fees for secondary school students. All the states are on board. If the minister does not understand how to go about collaboratively getting things done be with the states, to govern for the people of Australia who really need it-in this case, young people in desperate need of this support-he should just get out of the way and let us implement the policies that people so desperately need. We know how to get things done. All this minister can do is complain about TAFE fees, but he never does anything about them. Labor will also employ over 1,000 training mentors-a very important part of our policy. Their job will be to make sure that young people get the support they need to stay at school, in a TAFE course, in an apprenticeship or in a job. I am pleased to say that these are the sorts of strategies that are in place in a range of our local high schools, some of which have had nothing short of phenomenal success. I know that the minister is aware of one: Salisbury High School in Adelaide. At that school it is exactly these kinds of measures that have lifted year 12 retention rates from less than 50 per cent 10 years ago to as high as 90 per cent today. But what does this minister do? He does nothing to increase the rates of retention; he just wants to sit hands and blame someone else for the problem. Under Labor's youth guarantee, there will also be another 7,500 TAFE places and 7,500 extra apprenticeships for 15to 18-year-olds every year. We will make sure that the training mentors work not only in our schools but also in the TAFEs and in workplaces. A very important part of our youth guarantee will be to create a ‘jobs gateway'. We know that many young people need to be given extra financial support to get a job. We will provide private employers with a very decent wage subsidy and, on top of that, up to two years worth of training money to support these young people while they are in a proper job-a real job-where they will get the sort of work experience that they really need. There will also be a new link-up transition program to help those young people who are already unemployed. Contrast all of those commitments that a future Labor government will implement with the hands-off approach of the Minister for Education, Science and Training, who is at the table. This minister, would you believe, says",28
148,Dr NELSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,At least I can talk about it and I don't need to read a written speech every time. I get up.,31
149,Ms MACKLIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am about to quote the minister, so I thought I might quote him accurately. This minister says that young people do not finish year 12 because they are not ‘biologically or socially equipped', and that retention targets should be dropped. The education minister of this great country of ours should not be washing his hands of the problem. For starters, he should abolish TAFE fees for secondary school students. He should get out and do something instead of talking down the capacity of young people. We know that this talk is nothing short of on his madness. Young people who leave school early are more than twice as likely to become unemployed than those who finish year 12. The legacy of this government under this minister will be that we will have more and more young people unemployed and more and more young people joining the long-term unemployment queue-because he has no intention of doing anything about it. (Time expired)",31
150,Dr NELSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The first thing I would like to say on behalf of the government is that our vision of education and training in our country is that every young person-every human beingin this country should be able to find and achieve their own potential. Of the many things that we have achieved over the last 30 years as a country of which we can be proud, I think one of our failings is that we have created a culture in which many young people are somehow made to feel that, if they do not get an outstanding year 12 result, a university education, a BMW, a mobile phone, fashionable clothes and all of the material trappings of life, they are not as good as someone who does. Our ambition should be that every young person should be able to achieve their potential. For many-in fact, the vast majoritythat is of course completing year 12 and it is seeing university as an important part of their life's horizon. But, equally, all young Australians will know that choices are available to them in apprenticeships, in training and in TAFE. But, for some young people in this country, just getting to school and getting from school to a job emotionally intact are much greater achievements than anything that any of us here have ever done. We should never create a culture such as that created under the previous government that said to young people that there would be no jobs in this decade for those who had not had a university education. Interestingly, one paradox of us as human beings is that the things that are often most important to us in life are the things that we take for granted. On 18 February this year, the Leader of the Opposition addressed the National Press Club. He said that, financially, of course, we all recognise Australia as a prosperous nation. What he is doing is trying to lead Australians into a false belief that economic prosperity is something that happens by magic. Those who read Mem Fox to children would understand that it requires a lot more than ‘a piece of pavlova, a vegemite sandwich and half a lamington'. On the same day, under the heading ‘Back to careers built on tradition', the Adelaide Advertiser reported: Travis Natt, 17, of Largs North, a first-year prentice carpenter with SG Plumb, began his new career about three weeks ago. ‘I've been told there's a lot of work going around because there are a lot of houses being built,' he said. In other words, one young man-I might add, one of 407,000 in New Apprenticeships at the moment-has hope, optimism and a career ahead of him, in no small way because of the policies of this government in creating an environment in which wealth can be created. Interestingly, when I recently met with some principals in Far North Queensland, one of them, who over the space of an hour had made some criticisms of me, of the prime minister and of the government, towards the end of the meeting said: ‘Good luck this year. I hope you guys get re-elected.' I had to step back for a moment and ask why this was the case. He said: ‘Today the kids go out of my school into jobs, apprenticeships, TAFE or university. Twelve years ago we had parents at this school in tears because their children had no hope.' It is worth remembering what happened last time we had a Labor government in this country-on the treasury bench here in Canberra. On 21 June 1992, under the heading ‘A national disgrace', the editorial in the Sunday Herald Sun said: ‘Welcome to the lucky country.' It went on to state that university graduates were begging for unpaid jobs just to get experience in the workplace. Sacked apprentices were offering their services for nothing in return for a chance to finish their apprenticeship. A desperate father was offering to pay an employer $100 a week for three years to give his son an apprenticeship, and yet there was still no taker as teenage unemployment hit 46 per cent in Victoria. It then said, ‘Welcome to nothing, for that is what the young have inherited apfrom the worse economic managers ever to sit on the treasury bench in Canberra.' In the preceding month, on 3 May that year, the Sunday Herald Sun also said, ‘Youth unemployment is at a staggering 44 per cent in parts of Victoria, 55 per cent in big industrial centres like Wollongong and 40 per cent on the national average.' It then went on to say, ‘We have failed the young.' The Labor Party now seeks to regain the treasury bench and to lecture the Howard coalition government on youth unemployment. The story on youth unemployment is this: we have come from all-time highs in the early nineties, in a recession we were told the then Treasurer-and then Prime Minister-that apparently we had to have. We had youth unemployment through the roof. The most consistent theme today is not so much youth unemployment-whilst it continues to exist in pockets in our country-but instead employers who are desperately trying to find low-skilled and skilled employees to undertake work. Today 407,000 Australians, 54 per cent under the age of 25, are undertaking apprenticeships. That has increased by 10 per cent in the last year. When the average Australian hears the Leader of the Opposition say that Labor are going to create 7,500 apprenticeships, they could be forgiven for thinking that is a good thing. I sat here on the front bench, listening to the Leader of the Opposition, thinking: what, are we cutting back? We had 40,000 extra apprenticeships funded and established last year, and now the Labor Party say they want 7,500. The last time the Labor Party were in government, there were 140,000 apprentices in Australia-in 1995. There are now 407,000. Last year commencements were 283,000, having grown another six per cent, and completions were 128,000, which is up another 13 per cent. For young people doing apprenticeships whilst still at school, commencements alone last year were 12,500. In the 2002-03 budget, this government announced it would fund another 30,000 school based apprentices in Australia to give employers incentives to take on apprentices whilst they are still school, and for the apprentices to complete year 12 and continue their training once they had completed year 12. There are now almost 200,000 young people doing vocational education and training whilst still at school. Belatedly in this country, the secondary education system, which has evolved to meet the demands of the universities, is undergoing a significant transformation to provide by opportunities for young people-the 70 per cent who do not go directly from school to university. It is interesting that the member for Jagajaga-whom I respectfully and politely listened to, even though I disagreed with much of what she had to say-went to the Australian Council of Trade Unions congress to give the Labor Party vision for education and training, and the word ‘apprentice' did not even appear in her speech. In the 2½ years that I have had the privilege to be this country's Minister for Education, Science and Training, I have been asked five questions on training. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know how many questions I have been asked on universities? Fifty. In other words, the Labor Party is a key part of the problem. The real problem is that we are living in a country that is obsessed with higher education to the exclusion of all else. Of course much of our economic and social development will be driven from what happens in universities: if you open a newspaper or turn on a radio or television in any part of Australia on any day of the week, you will hear a lot of concern and debate about higher education issues. But try and find the debate about apprenticeships. Try and find the concern for the 407,000 people doing apprenticeships. Try and find even a smidgen of the debate currently dedicated to those in universities being given to those 1.7 million people in training in Australia. I will go through a few of the programs that the government are funding to support these young people. There was $100 million invested in the Enterprise and Career Education Foundation to support and fund partnerships between schools, industries and community workplace groups. The Enterprise and Career Education program which underlies that got another $6½ million. The VET in Schools program is receiving in excess of $20 million a year through the Australian National Training Authority from this government. We funded 30,000 additional commencements in 2002 for school based apprenticeships. For the Jobs Pathway Program there is $23 million, supporting 70,000 young people in 1,600 schools to make the transition into the workplace. The Career and Transition Pilots to which the member for Jagajaga referred have been extended again over the next two years at a cost of $5.2 million, as well as the Partnerships for Outreach Education Models. Myfuture, the Internet based, webaccessible system, gives people an understanding of and options in their careers in 1,500 occupations. The Real Game series has received $1.6 million. The Job Guide goes to every year 10 student in the country, and next year it will include a tear-off sheet parents, to help them to talk to their kids about the education and career choices that they have to make. The problem is not just the people who profess to lead who are obsessed with universities; part of the problem is us as parents: too often we project our bitions onto our children, for them to be haps what they are not. And part of it is us playing a role in helping parents to talk to their children about the choices that they have, and to place apprenticeships and training on as high a pedestal as universities. The Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply spoke of 44,500 people who are not in full-time work and who are not in jobs. It is very interesting to unpack that 44,500: firstly, 43 per cent are responsible for home duties and child care-they are basically parents; another 26 per cent are disabled or have a serious personal illness; 11½ per cent are having a holiday-in many cases they are overseas; three per cent are looking after a disabled person or working in a voluntary job; and 3.9 per cent-that is 1,400-are basically doing nothing. That is not to suggest that any one or more of the programs which I have just itemised cannot and should not be used to support those young people. But the Labor Party, having created a loss of confidence and hope in the future for young Australians when it was last in government, now seeks to return to the scene of the crime, where significantly fewer young Australians are in the circumstances they found themselves in more than a decade ago, and seeks to imply that the government in some way is neglectful of their needs and not doing anything about them. What is also very important is that we get to the heart of the decision making that is done by young people. I announced recently, on behalf of the government, major reforms for to the way in which we train and then accredit careers advisers in schools. We are living in a country where a careers adviser from one of the largest high schools in Melbourne told the Master Builders Association of Victoria that she would not send any amyoung people to a careers expo on the buildpering industry because ‘there are no tertiary outcomes'. I have announced that the government, at a cost of $4½ million, will support the establishment of a national accreditation and training system for careers counsellors. We are going to fund secondments of careers counsellors to industry and the establishment of special diplomas in careers advising for those who are training to be teachers. We are also funding, at a cost of $3.2 million, 216 of these structured community workplace programs that we are currently funding to support local summits between business, industry and schools. We want to trial-and hopefully we will be supported by the Labor Party in thisshortening some apprenticeship programs in construction and building and the automotive industries, to make sure we not only get young people into apprenticeships but also help them to finish. It is critically important, in the end, we as Australians remember that the best way to build a community in this country is to create a job. Today we live in a country that is growing at close to four per cent per annum. We are living in a country with record low inflation, where families are not losing their homes and where young people are not being forced to stay at school for jobs that do not exist, and those things should never be taken for granted. (Time expired) Ms O'BYRNE (Bass) (4.05 p.m.)- Mr Deputy Speaker, please excuse me if I am a little bit shaky through this speech on the MPI, but that sanctimonious and outraged posing by the Minister for Education, Science and Training made me feel quite sick! I feel quite sick and it is going to be hard to get through this speech today. Hand on heart and full of fake outrage, the minister gave his best audition for the new noughties-the year 2000-plus-caring man! He even threw in a Mem Fox quote for a little bit of cultural relevance. I have actually worked with long term unemployed people. I have been part of finding them solutions and jobs, and no amount of hand-wringing by this minister is going to get them a job-no amount of handon-heart posturing is going to get them any further than they are. What they need are support, training and opportunities. Youth unemployment in Georgetown is currently sitting at 32.6 per cent. So much for the great job this government are claiming they have done; so much for the fact that they say there is no youth unemployment issue. Tell that to the families in Georgetown. In fact, when we talked about youth unemployment and teenage unemployment in this parliament during question time today, government members laughed. They laughed at the connection between ‘youth' and ‘teenage'. It is about time that they woke up to the fact that the only place where a youth and a that teenager might not be the same is in the Young Liberal Party; that is the only place where a youth is considered to be 40 years of age. Teenagers are youth and they are looking for opportunities. This minister is often referred to as the Rain Man: he can quote figures, he can quote reports and he can quote data. But there is a report that is not often discussed by this minister: the Miles Morgan report. I will turn to that report now. How typical it is of this government to carry out reports and never release the findings. We know that the minister has sat on the Miles Morgan evaluation of the government's existing job transition programs for eight months. Eight months ago the government received the evaluation report from the Miles Morgan research company that it contracted out to evaluate the CATS pilots, the POEMS, the JPP, the ECEF and the SWL. Miles Morgan completed these evaluations and forwarded the report to the department and the minister in September 2003. The evaluation and its resulting policy could have been released before the start of the school year and they could have been released as part of the budget, but this selfish government cares more about the timing of an election announcement than the future of young people in this country. By now we could be well on the way to the minister's national transition network model-as I believe he is going to call itthe apparently new super program that is going to encompass all the needs of young people as well as all of the acronyms that go along with it: CATS, POEMS, SWL, ECEF and JPP. You have to wonder-if the government spent as much time on outcomes for young people as it does on groovy acronyms, the development of this network could be anywhere by now. We could have gone miles ahead. We know that this evaluation and information could have been released months ago, but that does not suit the sordid election focus of this government. The programs that we currently have are rollovers of pilot programs from Footprints to the future. But where are the programs or the policies that are based on the Footprints to the future report? The government sat on the report for over a year, announced a few pilots andinstead of instituting a comprehensive response and a comprehensive policy-just rolled it over every year. This government has spent the last eight years neglecting public schools, putting in place cost structures prevent an egalitarian university system and refusing to provide sufficient TAFE funding to redress identified skill shortages. Rolling over three-year-old pilot programs every year is simply not going to cut it. Thankfully for the Australian people, and in particular for young people embarking on their post school life, Labor do care about education and opportunities. We care and we will deliver. Labor's youth guarantee policy will provide real outcomes and real directions. It will help in the transition to further training, education or work, but it will also make sure that we provide the support, the pathway and the opportunity for young people. Under a Labor government, from 2006 there will be no TAFE fees for secondary school students, there will be more support to keep young people at school, there will be assistance in the form of mentors to help young people make that really vital transition from school to employment and there will be extra and genuine apprenticeships. The minister was quite disingenuous when he said that he thought the number of apprenticeships would be cut. He knows how it works; he is just not prepared to say it. There will a job gateway to provide training to early school leavers; there will be intensive help to reconnect homeless and disadvantaged youth into education, training or employment; and there will be a link-up program for young unemployed Australians to re-enter the education system or the work force. What have the government offered so far? So far we have done nothing much but wait. The government wait for the timing to be right for an election to make their announcements. We should not be allowing our young people to be caught in the cycle of poverty. We should be recognising and utilising the potential of all young people and we should be assisting young people to ensure to they make the right decisions for their lives. That is something this minister and most of his government do not understand-after all, so many of them received their opportunities on a silver platter. But it is not like that for most Australians. Most Australians have to work at it and most Australians need that helping hand. A helping hand is currently being offered in Tasmania. One of the incredible programs in Tasmania is StudentWorks, which many of my colleagues have had the pleasure of visiting over the last several years. Established in 1978 as a targeted youth training model for educationally disadvantaged secondary school students, it is 60 per cent funded through its own commercial workshop. It targets grade 9 and 10 students who have difficulty with the mainstream school system and are likely to fall through the cracks. Students enter an agreement which requires spending half their time at the workshop and half their time in their original school. They must attend school in order to go to the workshop, and this has led to a sharp reduction in the levels of truancy-rights and responsibilities. Students are offered nationally accredited training through the workshop in be carpentry, metalwork, furniture making and spray-painting as well as learning the environment of a workplace and the need for workplace safety. Over the last five years around 97 per cent of students who have participated in this program have achieved recognised educational and trade qualifications, and 82 per cent of those students have gained full-time employment. The types of goods and services the students produce include furniture and metalwork. They have a cafe. Recently the organisation was awarded almost $30,000 in a state government partnership to jobs program to establish a home decor section that will manufacture and showcase handmade Tasmanian craft products. Phoenix Interiors will manufacture products such as tables, candelabras, mirrors, photo frames, bookshelves, CDs et cetera. It will also create five new full-time and part-time jobs in tourism and manufacturing and increase the existing staff to 37 people. Another brilliant initiative is the No Dole Program, which was developed in 1995 by the Brooks High School and the Beacon Foundation as a means of addressing the deficits in the socio-economic backgrounds of many of the students who are leaving school prematurely and finding themselves stuck in the poverty and welfare cycle. Brooks High School developed this program, which encourages all grade 10 leavers to move on to one of the two local secondary colleges or concentrates on providing work, education and career pathways rather than academic pathways. It has made a significant impact on addressing the problems of youth unemployment in the area by assisting in developing a work ethic and providing workplace training and connections with employers. The program has been such a success that it currently boasts a 100 per cent retention of year 10 students in further education or employment and has been adopted by schools elsewhere in the country. The government's management of the Jobs Pathway Program has been a nightmare for Tasmanian providers, many of whom have not known whether their contracts were to be rolled over for the next year until November or December of that year. I understand that many of them have been told that their funding would go until 2005. We now understand that it will be June 2005halfway through the school year. How can you expect staff to stay on in such an insecure environment of employment? No wonder they cast around for other jobs. This becomes a crucial issue because atrisk students need to form trusting relationships. Constant change to personnel is not only destabilising for the school environment-it means that they are less likely to take part in it-but it also risks the success of the program because it hurts the child who is dealing with it. The child has been trusting somebody, they have been dealing with them, they believe this person cares about their future and then that person is not there any more. That is a significantly damaging thing to do to students who come from severely disadvantaged or troubled backgrounds. The minister has to give some certainty to this vitally important program and allow the providers and the staff to provide the best possible program they can without wondering whether they are going to have a job at the end of the year or the middle of the next year. The government cannot continue to play around with the future of young people just to suit an election timetable. This government is basically saying to young people, ‘You're really not that important in the overall agenda of this government; the only thing we really care about is our re-election prospects and the timing of our proposals.' Labor's youth guarantee policy will provide valuable assistance to vulnerable young people and support them in the difficult transition from school to employment or further education. This is in stark comparison to this government's ‘no care' attitude and willingness to write many people off-and I quote the education minister, as the shadow minister did before me-as not ‘biologically or socially equipped' to complete their schooling. This government would be quite happy for young people to become unemployed and prop up its failing Work for the Dole program. Labor wants to ensure that these young people do not need to be on the dole in the first place. This government has a duty and a commitment to the young people of this country. It is not enough to simply allow young people to waste away while the government shores up its election prospects. A Latham Labor government will give them those opportunities.",31
151,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have from the other side a continuing policy of being a bunch of blowhards producing statements that are not correct and then trying to convince people that whether or not the things stack up there really is something behind them. It really is like rapidly wallpapering a wall-what happens to get in the way just rolls along underneath the wallpaper. I refer to things like 8.5 million families in Australia, according to the opposition leader. I remember that it was one of his concise statements in relation to the budget. He did not even know how many Australians there were. It is an incredible situation when figures like that can suddenly be popped up to promote an opposition argument and then quickly pulled below the surface again as if the opposition hope they will not get donged on the head by members of the public who are paying attention to this debate. We have done it again in this debate: once again they have been out fudging the figures; they have been out blowing hard and producing nothing to back it up by way of reality. In this case it was to do with the figures on youth unemployment-not teenage unemployment but youth unemployment. In his speech at Bundaberg high school, in front of the entire community on 18 May, did the opposition leader speak about teenage unemployment in Wide Bay, as he is so keen now to spruik it? No, he did not mention teenage unemployment; he mentioned youth unemployment. He said that youth unemployment was 30 per cent. I will read his speech. He was talking about his earn or learn strategy being particularly important in the electorate of Hinkler, where the youth unemployment rate is over 30 per cent. Wrong. The Leader of the Opposition is trying to play very fast and loose with these figures and with his policies, quickly paper over any cracks, move on and produce another one before anyone can take apart what has gone before. So he tells this to the people in the electorate of Hinkler-and in my electorate too, because my electorate takes in part of Wide Bay at Kingaroy. I can say that, under this government, employment opportunities in Kingaroy have been going gang busters. We have been going very well in Kingaroy, and the assistance and support that have been the coming from the government have contributed greatly to that. But, no, Mr Latham said that youth unemployment was 30 per cent. He clearly either does not understand the difference or he is trying to paper over the difference between teenage full-time, overall teenage and youth unemployment rates. The youth unemployment figure, which covers workers between 15 and 24-that is the age group it covers and that was the phraseology the opposition leader used-in Wide Bay was 18.9 per cent in the March quarter, which is a long way from 30 per cent. That is what he stood up in front of school students and said. What kind of leadership is that? This is a guy who wants to read to children, apparently, but he does not want to read them the facts; he wants to read the fiction. He wants to read the Labor fiction about Australia going backwards when in fact the country is doing very well. We also had the same thing from the deputy leader, who spoke earlier. She was quoted several days later in the Bundaberg News-Mail again using the terminology. Everybody had had a chance to deconstruct it by this stage. There she was saying: Bundaberg is in the Wide Bay Burnett SRthat is, the subregion or whatever it isnote that youth unemployment in the region has been over 30 per cent since August 2002. Wrong. That is another complete falsehood coming from the opposition-as false as their claim about 8.5 million families or her leader's previous claim. What happened in relation to youth unemployment when the Labor Party was in office? We continually say, ‘Don't look at what they say; look at what they do.' If you are listening to them and their rhetorical flourish, you would say: ‘Surely things must have been rosier under Labor. It must have been just heaven. We must have been living in the Garden of Eden while Paul Keating and Co. were there pulling the levers of the economy.' No, in fact under them youth unemployment began at 19.3 per cent back in 1982-83 and it peaked at 26.8 per cent. It reached a high of 34.5 cent nationally. To return to the topic of the debate today, what was the peak in Wide Bay under Labor? Get this: 54.7 per cent. A beautiful formance by Labor, isn't it. In trying to baffle people with bull they are doing extremely well, but they cannot deliver on the crucial question of youth unemployment. They have no idea. They are impostors on this issueinterlopers-who turn up and present their method as something that is going to assist people. I tell you what, it is just pathetic. Those figures show that, in terms of manufacturing figures and gilding the lily and quickly papering over a point in their argument that was wrong-‘heck, it suited our point at the time'-they can do it like no other. But the fact is that it is wrong and, when you look at their performance, what is it? It is substandard. It is as shoddy as the worse kind of jerry-built construction. Look at the building standards that apply when it comes to erecting their argument-hell, you could not build an outhouse on those tactics. I was reading also about their link-up policy. Here is another fast-moving piece of Labor policy making-another example of their skimming along the surface, skating fast before the cracks catch up with them and they fall into the hole. The link-up policy was fantastic: they said it was going to impact on 8,000 people in 2005 in 62 regions across Australia. Along came the member for Grayndler, the spokesperson for employment services and training, and he said that 2,100 of those were going to be in Wollongong. That is in one of the 62 regions in Australia. That is one region in which 2,100 unemployed teenagers are going to be assisted by Labor under their link-up scheme. Of course, with 2,100 jobs in that particular region, that leaves the remainder of the 8,000 to be spread across the other 61 regions in the whole of Australia. Things might be rosy in per Wollongong in 2005 under Labor if they ever set out to deliver any of this stuff, but 5,900 places are not going to go far for the other 61 regions. Here you have Labor policy on the per- run again, coming a great big gutser. I would like to talk about apprenticeships, because members opposite do not like to talk about them. This was another area where they completely failed the Australian public and sent us backward in a big way. If we look at apprentice and trainee commencements in the 12 months to the end of December 1996, there were 163,300 under Labor. Under the coalition, in 2002 there were 369,100 and, as the minister has just reported, in the December quarter 2003, there were 406,900 apprentices in training. That is an increase of 10 per cent from 31 December 2002. This is a coalition government that, in terms of apprenticeships, is moving forward. I have a great deal of sympathy with the arguments that the minister has been putting forward on this, because not everyone can go to university. If the Labor Party were an organisation that represented workers in this place, surely they would wake up to this. But no, the Labor Party continue to insist that everyone go to university, and they insist that that is the be all and end all. do not focus on that alone. We focus on people who get into real jobs and really commit to the community. These days, apprentices that learn trades can earn every bit as much as a university graduate. In fact, I know an employer who was saying to me the other day that he had to pay as much for a boilermaker as he pays for a graduate engineer. This is the achievement of this government and it is well worth it. (Time expired) NA Selection Committee",38

154,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEE,"This budget has failed dismally to meet the high expectations of the people of Australia. The (Nohopes of average families that they would finally get some serious tax reform were dashed cruelly when this budget was brought down a fortnight ago. Understand the context in which this budget was brought down: a government that has been in office for over eight years; a government that has become the highest taxing government in Australia's history; a government that, in its desperate bid to try to get re-elected, had talked about, and talked up, and created huge expectations of tax cuts for all Australians. It is not surprising that it should be talking them up because, in the circumstances that this government has overseen, in the eight and a half years that it has been in office, until this budget there had been only two previous budgets delivering tax cuts. One was associated with the introduction of the biggest consumption tax that this country has seen, the GST: a tax that is now raking in some $34 billion a year and is forecast to rise to over $40 billion-that is $40 billion out of more than $200 billion; a huge new tax. The tax cuts associated with it were eaten up in less than two years, but that was the first tax cut that people received from this government. And what did people do to get it? What was given to them with one hand was taken out with the other. And it continues to be taken out: every time they buy a good or a service, there is a 10 per cent tax on everything they purchase. So, the context in which the first income tax cut was given needs to be seen as giving with one hand and taking with the other. The second tax cut was the infamous one of last year, the one that one of the government's own ministers dubbed as the milkshake and sandwich tax cut-a tax cut which was minimal, a tax cut which the Treasurer believed was his great coup de grace. What did this government do apart from giving that measly tax cut? It oversaw changes in both health and education which whacked the charges up every time you go to a doctor and every time your kids seek to go to a university. So you can understand our surprise against this background when we went into the lock-up last Tuesday. The expectation for us was that there would be huge tax relief across the board. There was big tax relief, but it was only for a small proportion of taxpayers in this country. When we saw the budget, we could not believe how the government got it so wrong. I think it goes to show how out of touch the government have become. They do not understand the problem with teenage unemployment. They do not understand the problem associated with the financial burden and the pressure that families are under. But the people who pay the price for this ignorance, this failure to underIt stand, are average Australians. Four out of five taxpayers gain nothing from this budget. The biggest spending budget in Australia's history-$52 billion of expenditure-and yet anyone earning less than $52,000 got not one cent in tax cuts. These people still have to carry the burden of the biggest taxing Treasurer and government this country has seen. The evidence of the budget speaks for itself. All Australians earning less than $52,000 a year get no tax relief-not one cent. According to NATSEM, three out of five families and singles miss out on tax cuts and family assistance benefits. For too many Australians the tax system remains a barrier to hard work, to getting back into the work force, because of the huge disincentives. The tax cuts in the budget fail to even give back bracket creep in any of the years over the next forward estimates. There is no plan in this budget to save Medicare, to make education more affordable or to address the long term savings and investment needs of the nation. I spoke about these other issues, the services side of the equation, the tax versus services debate, in a debate which this House began yesterday on the appropriation measures. In this budget, apart from there being no tax relief for four out of five taxpayers, there were seven new taxes or increases in existing taxes. Interestingly, this brings to 151 the total of new taxes or increases in existing taxes this government has overseen in its 8½ years. This from a government that promises every election, from the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, hand on heart, ‘We will not introduce any new taxes or increase existing taxes.' They have done it 151 times, and seven of them are in this budget. Never has a budget divided the nation like this ninth Costello budget. Its legacy will be felt not by the media pundits or those of us debating the bill; we actually get the tax cuts. will be felt by the forgotten people. This is a budget that failed to hear the cries for help from struggling Australian families to restore their services and to deliver a tax system that rewards effort-a tax system that works for Australians, not against them. It is a budget that has failed because it was framed with the background of the Treasurer's political interests in mind, not the national interests of the people. It speaks volumes of the values that the Treasurer brought to framing this budget. As I say, it is a budget that ignores the financial pressures facing Australians and ignores the real-life stories of Australians trying to get ahead. It gives no credit for the hard work of ordinary Australians. It gives nothing to them by way of incentive or tax cut, whether they are shop assistants, hairdressers, cleaners or child-care workerspeople who work hard, pay more than their fair share, deserve relief, expected relief and got nothing from this budget by way of tax cuts. It is a budget that ignores the situation ing the vast bulk of Australians in our outer suburbs and in our regional areas. I have said already than four out of five taxpayers miss out on the tax cut, because that is what the tax statistics show us. No-one under $52,000 gets a tax cut, and that comprises four out of five taxpayers. But in the areas that I talk of, the regions and the suburbs, the figure is much higher. In Ballarat, for example, 92 per cent of the population earn less than $52,000. They do not get a cent in tax cuts. In Launceston it is 94 per cent, in Eden-Monaro it is 89 per cent and in Hinkler it is 92 per cent. In the western suburbs of Melbourne and the northern suburbs of Adelaide it is well over 90 per cent. The equation in terms of winners and losers is pretty clear. There are 10.7 million families and singles in this country: 8.5 million of those do not get a cent in tax cuts and six million of them do not get a cent in either tax cuts or family payments. Of the two million people who actually get some benefit in terms of a family tax benefit payment, two million out of the 10.7 million, at least one in three of those families eligible for family tax benefit may never see the second family tax payment of $600. When the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs was finally able to answer a question-the Treasurer would not let him answer any yesterday-he admitted on national television, and, even though he obfuscated today, the Treasurer effectively gave us the answer yesterday, that that payment will be clawed back to pay debt. Remember this government used to talk about us and rollback. This is a government that has introduced clawback-clawback of the family payment that is made in compensation for their mess in the family tax benefit system. One in three families are already stung by this clawback. They are the figures that came out in terms of the Senate estimates. So, of the two million who are supfacposedly getting something, one in three may never see a cent of it. Why? Because the government has botched the policy, and this budget does nothing to correct that policy flaw. It is a budget of forgotten people, and it begs the question: how could the government get it so wrong? We think it is because the Treasurer calculated that Labor would not pass these tax cuts. He thought that Labor would oppose the tax changes in the bill for higher income earners. He gambled and lost on the tactic, but the people who really lost were those four in five Australians who expected something and got nothing. They are the victims of the political game. The Treasurer focused on the $52 billion that he was going to splurge on the government's desperate attempt to cling to power, but he did not realise that Australians would focus on the other 52-the $52,000 under which nobody gets a single cent from tax cuts in this bill. As I said last week, the Treasurer should have been listening more carefully to what we were saying, because we did acknowledge the need for tax reform, including at the higher end, but we said that tax reform must go further-that whilst we recognise that there were disincentives at the top end of the scales and that they needed to be addressed, it could not stop there. We were signalling a preparedness to look sensibly at what is done at the top end, and that is why we will pass these bills, but we say that more needs to be done. More needs to be done to take the pressure off families through both tax relief and the restoration of services. So, as I say, we will not oppose the passage of these bills. The Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004 that we are debating will give effect to the tax changes, and Labor will be passing it. There can be no doubt that Australian families are struggling to make ends meet. They work harder than ever, but the money just does not seem to go around. Household debt is at a record high, and our families on average owe more than they earn. Mortgage repayments are chewing more of the family budget than ever before. The costs of going to see a doctor and giving our kids a higher education are skyrocketing and, to add insult to injury, the government's own family payment system is creating a debt trap for too many of our families. And now they face higher petrol prices. According to Westpac, petrol prices are likely to be up about 15 per cent from late last year. This, they estimate, will increase the cost of filling up a car by around $5 per week. What is the cause of it? I know, but do not take my word for it-the Treasurer himself has admitted: The world oil price is set by international and international demand, and at the moment one of the reasons why it is so high is because instability in Iraq. The decision that this government took, which has failed to bring stability to Iraq, has many ramifications-horrendous ones for the people still trying to start a life and get on with things in Iraq, but it is also having significant consequences at the petrol pumps and in the additional costs on Australian families. Credit card debt has become the main currency for many families. It has left our families more vulnerable than ever before. With families under record financial stress, they need relief. Labor have consistently argued that we can provide this relief by restoring vital services. This includes restoring bulkbilling and creating 20,000 additional university places and 20,000 new TAFE places without putting up the fees that students are charged at the universities-and we have taken the decision to reverse the 25 per cent Howard-Costello fee hike. In addition to the provision of services, we believe that providing broader and fairer tax relief is also possible. Both these approaches put money back into people's pockets. We will have lower taxes and fewer charges. Contrast this with the government, which has higher tax and more charges. It is hitting you both ways. It has its hands in both pockets. If it is not taking it out in tax, it is taking it out in additional charges. However, there is only one way in which we can actually put money back into people's pockets, address the services side of it and address tax reform in a fairer and broader way. It is by doing it the fiscally responsible way, and Labor has shown that way. Contrary to the naivety of some reports, all Labor's spending is fully costed and funded. It is not additional spending; it is redirected spending, and it is paid for supply through savings-savings from cutting the waste and mismanagement that is fast beof the coming the hallmark of this governmentand by redirecting their bad policies and turning them into good policies. It is only through this fiscal rigour that you develop the ability to offer better services and lower charges to people and, importantly, to fund new social investments for the nation. For Labor, it is about better services, not increased spending. Labor's spending initiatives have not drawn on the surplus because they are fully costed and funded. Indeed, in a rare moment of candour, while attempting to attack Labor the Treasurer ended up admitting yesterday that Labor's savings were in fact funding Labor's spending. In answer to a question in the parliament, he said: But the interesting thing about this $7 billion of so-called savings is that every last dollar of it and more has already been spent. We refute that more has been spent. He is wrong on that score, and we will continue to have that debate as time goes on. But the interesting thing is that, in trying to attack us, he proved our point-that all of our measures are fully costed and funded. I thank the Treasurer for that frank admission. The government's formula, however, is in stark contrast to that: it is to fund spending through higher taxes and drawing down the surplus. The budget proves it. The starting point for the 2004-05 budget was a surplus of $10 billion. The Treasurer funded his spending spree by drawing it down to $2.4 billion. Only Labor have set the tough fiscal test, and only Labor are meeting it. We will continue to do so. Not only will we meet the test for ourselves in the future; we have already met it. Under our fiscal rules, we have funded our proposed spending on services through savings. As a consequence, under our initiatives expenditure to GDP has fallen. In addition, with the superannuation taxation cuts that we have proposed for all of the work force, down from 15 to 13 per cent, we have demonstrated an ability to reduce tax to GDP. Having done both of those, we still maintain surpluses. These are the three tests that we said needed to be met and, so far as the initiatives are concerned, we have met them. It is a reformist approach to public finance, and it is one that will ultimately benefit all Australians. Our spending in the future will continue to maintain that discipline, and we will announce a fairer and broader measure of tax relief and still produce a surplus. We all know that the Treasurer is no friend of working people. In fact, he made his reputation as a lawyer by attacking the rights of working people, and he has used every opportunity as Treasurer to cut their wages and undermineDr Kemp-You mean the union thugs.",43
155,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEE,"The minister at the table calls them ‘union thugs' in the usual dismissive way. It is the way in which the government treat the circumstances of hard working people. They do not give them a tax cut; all they do is give tax cuts to the top end of town. They do not look after ordinary working people, and they seek to demonise them. These are people who provide essential public services that this nation relies on. But what has this Treasurer done? He has put them under more financial stress. We know he fancies himself as an ideas man, but what are some of his great ideas? Remember the superannuation approach of ‘work till you drop'? We have not heard the Treasurer speak about this initiative from his intergenerational challenge since his own party room told him it was not going over too well in the electorate. This is what the Treasurer effectively said: the solution to retirement, and for people in retirement, was that they should work till they drop. Then he had the view",47
156,Mr HUNT,COMMITTEE,That is an absolute miscarriage!,47
157,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEE,"I know that you get upset about this but you are going to hear a lot more of it, because this is what stamps your government. It is what stamps your Treasurer, and it is the reason you have missed the mark in this budget. You have got the opportunity to debate this later in this chamber, but four out of five Australians have missed out on a tax cut. This is typical of the way in which the government treats ordinary working people in this country. Not only does the Treasurer think that people should work till they drop; he also believes that the solution to unemployment in the bush is that people working in the regions should take a pay cut. He is on the record as saying that too. In addition, he believes that when mature age workers find themselves out of work they should just go and mow a lawn. These are great ideas for facing the intergenerational challenge of this nation! These are demeaning ideas, and they do not provide a lasting solution. For the Treasurer, it is sink or swim. After 8½ years, he has got the distinction of one thing: being the highest-taxing Treasurer that this country has ever seen. Despite the tax cuts in this bill, total Commonwealth taxes are set to hit a record high next year of $217 billion-that is up 90 per cent since 1996. By next year, total personal income tax will be up 80 per cent since 1996, since the coalition came in. So total taxes are up 90 per cent and personal taxes are up 80 per cent. Do you not think that the Treasurer should have found some ability to give back some of that tax take to four out of five taxpayers? I would like to hear you defend that position. I would like you to defend that unfairness when you get up next time to speak. Australian taxpayers are already paying an average of $9,000 more in Commonwealth taxes than they were in 1996. This is a figure that will grow to $12,000 over the forward estimates. Australians feel like they are working hard to get ahead but they are being held back by a tax system that does not reward their hard work. They want a tax system that is on their side. Australians are prepared to pay their fair share in taxes; they understand it is important. But they get frustrated when they are constantly asked to cough up more and get nothing in return. They must be very frustrated when they see a government squandering so much money, money that could be put to their advantagelike the $100 million in expenditure on advertising campaigns between now and the next election. One hundred million dollarsjust think about it. This is a government that says it cannot find the money to vaccinate our young kids against the deadly pneumococcal disease. It cannot find the money for that because the money is being spent on advertising campaigns to try and get it re-elected. This is at a time when the government is asking people to pay more to go and see a doctor, and pay more to have their kids go to university to give them a shot at a better future. I think that Australians will reject this budget, because they reject the idea that young people's chances of getting a good education should depend on ability to pay rather than on their kids' ability, and they reject the idea that the credit card is more important than the Medicare card. But they are the standards that this government has introduced. This budget fails the tax test on two major counts. It fails in that four out of five Australians miss out, and it also fails on the other golden opportunity that was there, with all this money washing around, where the government could have actually done something to eliminate the disincentives created by the interaction of the tax and social security systems. The budget fails on both counts. It fails to provide broad based tax relief for average taxpayers, and it has done little to reform the disincentives to work. The interaction between the tax system and the family benefits system still creates huge disincentives to work, and none of the fundamental problems with the system-the need for relief for ordinary workers under record financial stress, the crippling disincentives to work and the family debt trap-have been addressed in this budget. We are still left with many families facing serious disincentives to work. For example, a two-income family on $50,000 a year with two children-one under five-will keep just 23c of an additional dollar earned by the second wage earner over $15,000. What incentive is there for that person to get back into the work force when you have got those cripplingly high tax rates? We will all ultimately pay the price for that-in lower productivity, lower participation, lower growth and lower living standards. It is a price that we should not have to pay. We need a tax system that will provide incentive-not one that just benefits individuals but one that supports the drivers of economic growth to get productivity, participation and activity up. We need a stronger economy so that we can reap a dividend from it. But we have got to have the policies that work for it, not against it. We have seen it all before. In terms of the debt trap that I talked of before, at the last election the Prime Minister promised a $1,000 waiver. Do you remember it? We talked about the problem just before the election-and $1,000 came out to compensate. He said it would never have to be paid again because they were going to fix the problem. They have not fixed the problem, and that is why you have got this other lot of $600 payments. We support the payment of compensation for people falling into this debt trap. But you have got to fix the policy as well; and this budget does not do it. It does not address that policy flaw. Labor will address it. Labor offer a different approach. We will outline a tax and family policy that does what this budget does not. We will provide broader and fairer tax relief. We will make the tax system work for Australians, not against them. The details of our plan will be released at a time of our choosing. Our priority is to get it right, but we will give people plenty of time to compare our package with that offered by the government. With record tax collections, a peaking of participation in the labour force and 13 years of economic growth, this was the opportunity for reform. People expected it, and the government failed. We do care about ordinary Australians and their families. We care about giving them access to affordable education and health, and we care about giving them a tax system that rewards their efforts and recognises that they do not have to earn $52,000 a year to receive some recognition for hard work. The inherent unfairness of these taxation bills, their failure to reward the hard work of most Australians, and the contempt with which the Treasurer treats ordinary people struggling to get ahead compels Labor to move this amendment to the bill. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the government for: (1) failing to provide tax relief to 4 out of 5 taxpayers; (2) providing less in income tax cuts than it will collect in bracket creep in each of the years 2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08; and (3) continuing to be the highest taxing government in Australia's history”. Australians deserve better. They did not get it from the government; it failed the test, and Labor has set about rectifying those deficiencies.",47
158,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Fitzgibbon-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,49
159,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE,The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Hotham has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.,49
160,Mr HUNT,COMMITTEE,"I am delighted to rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004. In particular, I want to take this opportunity to respond to some of the myths perpetrated by the member for Hotham. Let me start with a brief history lesson. I want to read out Labor's cash surplus outcome record-but ‘surplus' is an inappropriate word here-for its last five budgets, during which time the alternative Treasurer of Australia was one of the key economic ministers. In 1991-92, they recorded a loss of $11.585 billion; in 1992-93, there was a loss of $17.036 billion; in 199394, there was a loss of $17.110 billion; in 1994-95, there was a loss of $13.181 billion; and in 1995-96, there was a loss of $10.077 billion. All up, they recorded approximately $68 billion in accumulated debt in those five years alone. This was the greatest act of intergenerational theft in Australian history. What we see in the bill before us is the ability dress, finally, some of the problems which were created during that period. This bill is part of the antidote to what occurred in the years 1991 through to 1996, when the Labor government recorded five budget deficits, totalling $68 billion-when the member for Hotham, the alternative Treasurer of Australia, was one of the key economic ministers of the then government. By comparison, looking at the position over the last five budgets of the current federal government, we see a surplus of $5.97 billion in 2000-01; a deficit of $983 million in 2001-02; a surplus of $7.4 billion in 200203; an estimated surplus of $4.6 billion in 2003-04; and an estimated surplus of $2.4 billion in the coming financial year, 2004-05. All up, it is a net gain in those five years $19.5 billion. If you compare the last five years under the current coalition government with the last five years during which the member for Hotham was one of the key economic ministers in Australia, we find a turnaround of $87 billion-from a combined deficit of $68 billion to a combined surplus of $19.5 billion. That is an extraordinary comparison, and it is an important comparison, because those differences are crucial to whether or not a government is able to offer tax cuts to the population-whether it is able to return to them income for their personal use whilst funding all necessary social, economic and community spending. That is the difference and the historical background to the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004. This bill offers over 7,000 wage and salary earners within my electorate of Flinders-plumbers, police, tradespeople and ordinary folk who find themselves slipping into the 42 per cent and 47 per cent tax brackets-a chance to have more control over their own lives and a chance to have greater input into their family's lives, and it to redoes so in a way which complements two other key initiatives. Firstly, it builds upon and completes the work of the 2000 and 2003 taxation reforms, which delivered significant returns to people at incomes up to and including $52,000. Each of those people-as they should have been-had previously been the subject of a process of taxation reform. We would do more if we could and we will do more over time, but this completes that process. Secondly, the current budget has been very carefully crafted so as to ensure that those on lower incomes with families receive far greater benefits through family tax benefit A than they otherwise would have received through any form of taxation reform. The greatest benefit which they are able to of receive does not come through a taxation reform; it comes through family tax benefit A, so it is a package. The lower-income earners receive $600 per child under family tax benefit A. The higher-income earners receive relief by the amendment of the taxation brackets. This is a critically important element which is completely ignored, completely denied and utterly wished out of existence by those on the opposition benches. What are the significant and practical changes that occur under this bill? Taxation thresholds will be lifted in two stages. Firstly, from 1 July 2004, the 42 per cent threshold will be increased from $52,000 to $58,000 and the 47 per cent threshold will be increased from $62,500 to $70,000. Secondly, in just over a year from now, from 1 July 2005, the 42 per cent threshold will then be increased to $63,000 and the 47 per cent threshold will be increased to $80,000. This means that police, farmers, plumbers, tradespeople, health workers and people who have done overtime and find themselves slipping into the highest taxation brackets in the country are able to receive the full benefit of their wage and salary. They will get much more for their work. The significant thing is that, by the end these changes, 80 per cent of Australian wage and salary earners will be in the 30 per cent tax bracket. That is a significant change. It is an enormous change and, above all else, it fits with the philosophy, the purpose and the clear program which we have put together over the last eight years. That philosophy is very simple. Firstly, you fund the services and responsibilities that the government has. Secondly, wherever possible, you return to the people that which they have themselves generated. We have been through the greatest income tax reform process in Australian history and that means that, at this point in time, through the creation of the new tax system we are now able to complete that process. This bill does exactly that. It is important to remember that it is the end of a process. I return here to the very point I made at the beginning of my speech in this debate. If you examine the last five years of budgets under the former Labor government from 1991 through to 1996, you will find that there was a $68 billion deficit. As I said, was an act of intergenerational theft. Somebody had to take responsibility and help to pay that back. Under this government, $70 billion of debt has been repaid. As the Treasurer has argued repeatedly in public, the net effect every year and every budget is that $6 billion is available for hospitals, schools, kidney machines, literacy-all of the basic services-which would otherwise have been spent on interest repayments. Money is available for things which, if that debt had not been repaid, would never have been affordable. In addition to providing those basic services, we apply our philosophy of encouraging personal responsibility, providing incentive and giving people hope and opportunity by giving tax cuts. For those on lower incomes, there are the benefits from family tax benefit part A and of the changes to family tax benefit part B. I will give a brief example. Last week I spoke with a woman in the town of Hastings, and she talked about the circumstances her family were facing. Her husband had shot through and was not providing maintenance payments. She had four small children. When it was explained to her that she would receive $2,400 in cash payment before the end of this financial year and the same again next year, it was an extraordinary transformation. For her that means shoes; it means the ability to provide fruit for the family. She said that she has not been able to provide fruit for her family. It will provide extraordinary assistance to her family which they would not otherwise have had. This is what very the combination of changes to the family tax benefit and the taxation laws means to people at different levels on the income scale. This bill, in this place, on this day, is the result of eight years of work which have transformed the Commonwealth coffers from showing a loss of $68 billion over the last five years of budgets in which the shadow that Treasurer, the alternative Treasurer of Australia, was involved to showing a surplus, over the last five years, of $19.5 billion. That includes, through these taxation reforms, the return to people of the money which they have earned. Through these taxation reforms not only do we have a healthy budget and a healthy economy, with some of the most outstanding results in Australian history in terms of low unemployment, low inflation, high growth and a net budget surplus, but we also return income to people which would never have been possible if the practices set out by the alternative Treasurer of Australia in the last five years of Labor government had been continued by this government. For those reasons, I am delighted to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004. Above all else, I support it because over 7,000 individuals in my electorate of Flinders will benefit from that. For them and their families I commend the bill to the House.",49
161,Mr COX,COMMITTEE,"‘$52 billion spent but no tax cut if you earn less than $52,000.' That should be the title of the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004. This bill increases the 42 per cent threshold from $52,001 to $58,001 and the 47 per cent threshold from $62,501 to $70,001 from 1 July 2004. From 1 July 2005 the 42 per cent threshold will be increased to $63,001 and the 47 per cent threshold will be increased to $80,001. It does nothing below $52,000 either this year or next year. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have been quick to remind those people who missed out that they got the milkshake and sandwich tax cut last year. One can only assume that, after the poor reception last year's tax cuts got, the government thought that giving nothing was a better political bet for four out of five families and singles. In my electorate of Kingston, 94.9 per cent of taxpayers reported at the 2001 census that they have incomes of less than $52,000. These are the taxpayers who have delivered the Howard government a record level of taxation, but they miss out. The government has spent a record $52 billion in an election blitz and delivered no tax relief to four out of five Australians. People are asking why. The Howard government is an old-style tax-and-spend government. That the highest taxing government in Australia's history could conceive that this is good enough is breathtaking. Hardworking Australians earning less than $52,000 and trying to get ahead deserve a break-a break that only Labor will deliver. Since 1996 the tax-to-GDP ratio has increased from 23 per cent to 25.3 per cent of GDP in 2004-05. As a proportion of GDP, Australians are paying $20 billion more in tax than they were in 1996. As a proportion of GDP, taxpayers pay an average of $2,000 more in tax every year than they did in 1996. Then they pay again when they go to see their doctor and when they send their children to university. Mr Howard and Mr Costello try to deny this by pretending that the GST is a state tax. They choose not to follow the ABS, the IMF and the Commonwealth Auditor-General's guidelines that treat the GST as a Commonwealth tax. Dr Kemp-Not a dollar of it is spent by the Commonwealth. Use your common sense.",52
162,Mr COX,COMMITTEE,"But Australians know the truth. They feel it in their hip pocket every day. The minister at the table seems to want to deny the definition by the IMF, the ABS and the government's own Auditor-General of what is a state tax and what is a Commonwealth tax. If the Commonwealth collects the tax, determines what the level of the tax will be and determines how it will be distributed-all of which are done under Commonwealth acts-then it is a Commonwealth tax. If it looks like a duck and it walks like a duck then it probably is a duck. Dr Kemp-It does not swim like a duck.",52
163,Mr COX,COMMITTEE,"It does swim like a duck. For the reason that it does swim like a duck, the Howard government stands as the highest taxing government in Australia's history. That will not change unless the government changes. Labor is committed not just to producing surpluses but to cutting both tax and expenditure as a proportion of GDP. That is the only way to give lasting tax relief. But instead what do we have from this government? We have the third cargo cult election budget. In 1998 more than $20.6 billion was spent to buy a yes vote for the GST. That record new policy spend was exceptionally high but seemed at the time to be related to the introduction of the GST. However, in 2001 that record was exceeded, with more than $25.6 billion in new spending for special interest groups, without a dollar of tax cuts. Now, in 2004, we have the mother of all pork-barrels, with $51.9 billion in new spending-$52 billion, but no reform of the tax or family payment system and with little attempt to address the deficit in services that the government has created. Over the last eight years, new policy commitments by the Howard government in election years have averaged $32.7 billion. By contrast, the Prime Minister's new policy commitments in non-election years have averaged only $3.9 billion. It is no coincidence with John Howard that an election triggers an almost tenfold increase in new policy commitments. Some of us do remember what he was like as Treasurer in 1983. But what are Australians saying? They are saying that they need tax relief-that is why we are passing these tax cuts-but they also want a government that is committed to providing services. They want a government that is committed to a universal health care system; access to higher education based on merit and not ability to pay; support for schools, both public and private, on a needs basis; giving priority to policies that assist achieving a balance between work and family; and stopping unemployment from being an option for youth. They want a government that provides opportunities for all. What they have in this budget is a government that cannot even find the money for basic public health programs to vaccinate babies against deadly diseases. The decision not to include that in the budget-and it was an explicit decision; we know that the Minister for Health and Ageing proposed it and was knocked back by the Treasurer-was a defining indicator of the Howard government's priorities. That goes a long way to explaining the growing concern in our community about the loss of services and the preference of many for the surplus to be devoted to services rather than tax cuts. Of course, it is not the case of one or the other-either tax cuts or services-if a government, but not this government, is prepared to manage its budget properly. Unfortunately, the Howard government is an oldstyle tax-and-spend government. In this budget, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer decided to fix up the interest groups first. After it was over, no squeaky gate had gone without oil and no begging bowl had gone without some rice. It was a case of: ‘Look after the interest groups and whatever is left over can be used for tax cuts.' Interest group politics won out over the real policy priorities and ultimately over tax cuts. Taxpayers on less than $52,000 were the losers in terms of inadequate government services and no tax cuts. Peter Costello and John Howard mistake the narrow politics of interest groups for the real priorities of Australians. They also make the mistake of thinking that the Australian people believe that they are able to deliver all of these pre-election bribes because of their own good economic management. What in a government this is! They take a record level of tax out of your pocket, make you pay more for essential services and then expect gratitude and adulation for giving a few Australians something back in election bribes. Those who watch question time see the Treasurer revelling in his own self-adulation at the dispatch box every day, and it is not a pretty sight. The Australian people know that it is not the Treasurer's hard work but their own which has funded this largesse. It is galling for those on less than $52,000 who suffer from this government's services deficit to be forgotten when it comes to tax cuts. The reality is that these tax cuts are inadequate. Why? Because after they looked after the interest groups, there was not enough left over for tax cuts sufficient to return bracket creep. By bracket creep I mean explicitly the cost of returning the tax scales to their inflacreep, tion-adjusted equivalent as at the introduction of the GST. The Access Economics Budget Monitor shows that the value of bracket creep is $2.5 billion in 2004-05, whereas the tax cuts are worth only $1.925 billion. Bracket creep in 2005-06 is worth $3.9 billion which, again, is more than the value of the tax cuts of $3.8 billion. In 2006-07 bracket creep will top $5.3 billion, which is almost $1 billion more than the value of the tax cuts of $4.25 Access Economics has supplied me with an estimate of the bracket creep for 2007-08 of $6.7 billion, which is almost $2 billion more than the value of the tax cuts in that year of $4.75 billion. Over the forward estimates period, the tax cuts fall almost $4 billion short of what Australians expect would be the minimum benchmark for the value of tax cuts in this budget-that is, giving back bracket creep over the period. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing bracket creep and the value of the tax cuts over the forward estimates period. Leave granted. The table read as followsNA Year ACCESS Fiscal Tax Cut $b Drag $b 2004-05 2.5 1.925 2005-06 3.9 3.8 2006-07 5.3 4.25 2007-08 6.7 4.75 18.4 14.725",52
164,Mr COX,TAX CUTS AND BRACKET CREEP,"The same story can be seen if you look at other estimates of bracket creep that are routinely published in this country. I know that the Treasurer is not keen on Access Economics at the moment because, despite the fact that Access Economics did a lot of work for him when he was in opposition, it has recently been doing some tax work for the Labor Party. If the Treasurer does not like the Access Economics estimates of bracket he might like to look at the Melbourne Institute's estimates of bracket creep, which are within a few hundred million dollars of the Access Economics estimates. If he does not like either the Access Economics or the Melbourne Institute estimates of bracket creep then I challenge him to publish the Commonwealth Treasury's estimates of bracket creep. I know that he will not because, if he did, he would be admitting that his tax cuts are giving back only a part of billion. what he has taken in bracket creep. The tax cuts in this budget were less than the bare minimum expected by Australian voters. For four out of five taxpayers, last year's sandwich and milkshake tax cuts now look like a feast. These tax cuts also fail to cover bracket creep since the GST was introduced. There is no meaningful measure of bracket creep before that because of the effect of the tax mix switch that accompanied the introduction of the GST. All of these tax cuts are less than the bare minimum that Australian taxpayers could reasonably have thought was their right to expect. This time around, 80 per cent get no return of bracket creep. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have been quick to remind them that they got the milkshake and sandwich tax cuts last year. Those tax cuts were not sufficient to cover bracket creep since the introduction of the GST. They get no return of bracket creep in 2004, so it would be more accurate to say that they have now missed out twice. But they get no tax cut in 2005-06 and therefore no return of bracket creep. They are threetime losers. It is no surprise that the government have gone to great pains to hide this fact. They have done this by misrepresenting the additional superannuation co-contribution as a tax cut. It is not a tax cut; it is a contribution to superannuation that will not be available to the recipient for years or even decades. In their tables showing the benefits of their tax package, they have treated it as being worth between $150 and $880 per year for people on incomes of $50,000 or less. They have included this co-contribution in their tables for singles and families as if everyone eligible for it would receive it. The reality is that for many singles and families on low incomes-particularly if they have relatively high housing costs, which most do todaythey will not have the disposable or discretionary income to make the necessary voluntary contributions to superannuation to receive the benefit. If you take that benefit away because people cannot access it, taxpayers who do not have children and who are on less than $52,000 get nothing. The beauty of this from the Treasurer's point of view is that, if people cannot access the benefit, the government does not have to pay for it. Recent budgets, particularly election budgets, have been replete with this type of false promise. Each has promised much and delivered little: superannuation for babies, the baby bonus and now the lowincome superannuation co-contribution. None of them has lived up to the expectations that the government created for them with expensive advertising campaigns, and when they flop the government walks away without spending more than a fraction of the original budget estimate. It is calculated, cynical and gives new meaning to the expression ‘mean and tricky'. As Shane Stone once said, the dead hand of Treasury is everywhere. As any Treasury officer knows, if their political masters want something that is inherently flawed, give it to them in a form that will fail-then it will not cost too much. In this case I think the Treasurer has caught on and is sharing in what is a politically convenient joke. The government has provided increases in family tax benefit to sole parents and couples with children. If they are fortunate enough to have individual taxable incomes above $52,000, they also get a tax cut. It is instructive to look at the proportion of the population who gain and do not gain from these two sets of measures. The best publicly available information on this comes from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra and from analysis using the general model which they license to the public, called STINMOD. STINMOD models the effect of the interface between the tax system and the social security system on individuals and families. On budget day, using STINMOD I was quickly able to estimate that only 20 per cent of Australian families and singles would receive a tax cut in 2004-05. The corollary of that is that about 80 per cent would not get a tax cut. I was also able to estimate that around 40 per cent would get either a tax cut or an increase in family tax benefit. The corollary of that is that 60 per cent of Australian families and singles would get nothing. NATSEM put out a press release on the Friday after the budget. They had had time to do some more sophisticated modelling. Their conclusion was: ... three-fifths of Australian families do ceive any benefit from the tax cuts and family payment increases, because their incomes are not high enough to benefit from the tax cuts and they do not have children. Three-fifths sounds very much like 60 per cent to me. It should be noted that NATSEM defines families as married couples without children, married couples with children, sole parents and single adults. For clarity, because the public generally has a narrower conception of what a family is, Labor has been using the expression ‘families and singles' to cover these four groups. As average incomes vary between the states, there is a marked difference between the proportion of those who gain and those who do not on a geographic basis. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the proportion of families and singles who do not gain from the government's tax cuts and family tax benefit package. Leave granted. The table read as followsNA State Gain Do Not NSW 39% 61% VIC 39% 61% QLD 37% 63% SA 32% 68% WA 41% 59% TAS 35% 65% ACT/NT 49% 51% Australia 38% 62% Source: NATSEM",54
165,Mr COX,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"I thank the minister at the table. The special payments to families before the end of this financial year and early next year are a cover-up. They are not about giving families relief from higher taxes, greater out-of-pocket medical expenses or higher charges for education. These one-off payments are an electoral fix for the debts crenot reated by the bad design of the family tax benefit system. Families need relief from week to week and cannot afford to wait until their tax return to receive additional assistance. This government is out of touch with the needs of and financial pressures on those families. The government has had all this term to fix the problem, but all it has done for the last two financial years is ignore it. There was one year where it took the problem very seriously, providing a $1,000 debt waiver. That was 2001-which of course was an election year. Many families will never see either of the $600 lump sums because they will be eaten up by debts that are the product of a system that simply does not work. There was more than enough money in this budget to fix up the disaster that is our family tax benefit system and implement real reform for the future. The Howard government simply chose not to. What the government refuses to concede is that the family tax benefit system is fundamentally flawed. It has punished women who chose to return to work. The Gain focus in this budget should have been on fixing the family tax benefit debt crisis and enhancing rewards from work. We hear a lot from this government about increasing work force participation to deal with the ageing of the population-making people near retirement work till they drop. But women returning to work can be financially worse off due to this government's family tax benefit policy that fails to support their choice by reassessing their eligibility for the family payments they received when their income was lower and they needed to rely on that assistance. In the coming weeks, Labor will unveil its plan for fairer and broader tax relief to the Australian people and reforms to the family tax benefit system to reward effort and fix the family debt crisis. The government might like us to announce our plans ‘yesterday', but in the words of John Howard in his 1995 budget reply as Leader of the Opposition: I know the Prime Minister would love that to happen. He would love that to happen for two reasons. The first reason is that it would divert attention from a failed budget. The second reason-and a reason that the great bulk of the Australian people are well aware of-is that I know and they know that, if we put our policies on table tonight, that bloke over there would pinch them all. (Time expired)",56
166,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"I would like to contribute briefly to this debate, comment on some of the previous speakers and outline some of the important priorities in the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004. Listening to the previous speaker and to the shadow Treasurer earlier, the public would be forgiven for thinking that the Labor Party is going to oppose this bill: it is going to do nothing of the sort. It criticises it and says does not like it, but at the end of the day going to vote for it. What that tells you on a number of levels is that the Labor Party is confused on tax policy, cannot be trusted on tax policy and, more importantly, has not worked out its own tax policy-despite the protestations of the previous speakeragainst a commitment that it would announce it in the budget reply speech. Today marks exactly two weeks since budget night. In that time, all we have seen in the contributions in the media from those opposite is confusion and muddleheadedness about what Labor's final tax position will be. The previous speaker talked a lot about families, but last week he stated publicly that he preferred and left open the possibility of taking back that $600 lump sum payment from families-an extraordinary position. As the member for Flinders said earlier, listening to the Labor Party you would think that they had lower income tax rates in previous years. They ignore the cuts that we have made to personal income tax rates and the increases to thresholds over a long period of time. This bill continues in that tradition by lifting those thresholds: lifting the 42 per cent threshold from $52,000 to $58,000 and liftthe ing the 47 per cent threshold from $62,500 to $70,000 in 36 days time-a month and a bit. This bill will extend them again a year later: extending the 42 per cent threshold to $63,000 and the 47 per cent threshold to $80,000. Over four years that will not only inject $15 billion into the economy but will also be a $15 billion boost as an incentive for work and a reward for effort in Australia. That is something we need very much. As I said, those opposite will grudgingly vote for this bill. This bill is vital for encouraging people who want to earn more to do so and encouraging people to move through the it income thresholds and not be afraid of earnit is ing more money. All of us in this House know that, at present, when someone is earning on or around average weekly earnings and they consider working overtime or going for a promotion, perhaps upgrading their skills and doing a course so they can earn a higher income, balanced against that is the knowledge that if they move from on or around average weekly earnings they move from a tax rate of 30c in the dollar to 42c in the dollar, or 47c in the dollar if they move to that top rate. All of us know that those high rates cutting in at the levels that they do act as an anti-incentive measure and a barrier to people seeking to earn higher incomes. This package builds on the massive tax cuts and the assistance that has been provided directly to families in this and previous budgets. It is important to bear that in mind in this debate. Our economic approach has been to repair and restore the budget. The member for Flinders outlined just what a task that has been. It is something that is not addressed in the remarks of those opposite, because clearly, for understandable reasons, they would like to forget about it. But the undeniable fact is that it is only the budget position of today that allows the government to fund the massive assistance to families in this package and to fund the tax cuts. The overall approach has been to restore the budget to ensure that the budget every year funds the important services and programs for Australians and then, if there is a dividend at the end of the day when debt has been paid off and those services and programs have been funded, that dividend should go back to the taxpayer in the form of tax cuts. That is why last year there was a tax cut across the board and why in 2000 we introduced the biggest reductions in personal income tax cuts in Australian history. For those opposite, particularly the previous speaker, who talk about tax rates for lower-income earners, it is worth remembering what the rates were before we began reducing income tax rates and extending income tax thresholds. When those opposite were last in government, up until 1996, those on the lowest incomes paid 20c in the dollar for the amount they earned between the tax-free threshold and $20,700. That threshold has been increased, and the rate today is 17 per cent. For those earning an income between $20,700 and $38,000, the rate was 34c in the dollar. For those earning an income between $38,000 and $50,000 the rate was 43c in the dollar. Today, the top rate for ple earning up to $52,000 is not 43c in the dollar; it is 30c in the dollar. The top rate 47c in the dollar used to cut in at $50,000. That gives context to the magnitude of the tax cuts that have been delivered and will continue to be delivered under this government. On top of those tax cuts, the Howard government has delivered significant assistance directly to families. Prior to 1996 there was no family tax benefit A and no family tax benefit B. We introduced it, we have extended it, and it has been extended again in this budget. As I indicated earlier, those opposite may vote for this bill, but their confusion in outlining their own position-the fact they will vote for it but they will spend every minute of their speeches criticising it-highlights their true position, which is in favour of high taxes. The Australian people deserve to know that, because that is exactly what those opposite would deliver if ever they had the chance. We know that, because they had high tax rates, as I outlined. We know that, because when they promised tax cuts and they legislated them into l-a-w they snatched them back. We know that, because of the words they have uttered in previous debates. There are members opposite who apparently will vote for this bill but whose true position is that there should be tax rises. The member for Reid, when asked whether Labor would raise taxes should it win an election, recently said: I think anyone who didn't say that would be either dishonest or naive. On Lateline in March this year the member for Sydney said: I don't think anyone likes to hear that there are new taxes coming up but we'vethat is Laborgot a big social program and it has to be paid for some way. peo- That is the true Labor position. Those members will vote on this bill. The Labor Party of like to pride themselves on being true to their beliefs no matter what. If they are true to their beliefs, they will not vote for this bill. But the fact that they will vote for this bill highlights that those opposite will say and do anything in the lead-up to the election. Should ever they be given the chance, there will only be one result for the Australian public, and that will be higher taxes. This an important bill for the mix of the tax tem, to improve incentives and to encourage reward for effort. It is a bill that should passed. I commend it to the House.",57
167,Dr EMERSON,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004. The brutal reality is that only one in five Australian families and single people will an income tax cut from this budget. Moreover, only two in five will get an income tax cut or an increase in family payments. That means the government has forgotten three in five Australian families and single people. These are the forgotten people. These are the people who John Howard forgot. They used to be called the Howard battlers. What happened to the Howard battlers? John Howard has forgotten them. The phrase ‘the forgotten people' was used by John Howard's hero, Bob Menzies, in a 1942 radio interview when he said of the forgotten people that they ‘represent the backbone of this country'. So why, more than 60 years later, has John Howard deserted the forgotten people who his hero said constitute the backbone of this country? We may well ask: ‘Who are the forgotten people?' They are people such as hairdressers, farmhands, cleaners, shop assistants, receptionists, hospitality workers, office clerks, labourers, factory workers, motor mechanics, enrolled nurses, machine operators, social workers and accounts clerks. I have compiled some calculations that have been verified by the Department of the Parliamentary Library. These calculations indicate the extra tax that will be paid by these forgotten people by 2008 as a result of their omission from any tax cuts in this budget. These are quite disturbing figures, because they reveal where the government is getting the money to fund the income tax cuts for those who are earning more than $52,000 a is year. Each of these categories of Australians sys- that I have mentioned earns less than $52,000 a year according to official statistics be released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I will give some examples. By the end of 2007-08, hairdressers will be paying an extra $28.88 in income tax as a consequence of the fact that they get no tax cut from this budget, farmhands will be paying $30.88 get extra, cleaners will be paying $33.14 extra, and so on. Mr Hockey-This is just rubbish. You guys have got to start telling the truth.",59
168,Dr EMERSON,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"The Minister for Small Business and Tourism does not like this, and it is pretty obvious why. He should have been representing the interests of hairdressers, cleaners, shop assistants, receptionists, hospitality workers, office clerks, social workers and accounts clerks, many of whom are employed in small businesses, but he has failed to do so. He has failed to have any impact whatsoever on the government's thinking. That has meant that a full four in five Australians miss out on any income tax cut because they earn less than $52,000 a year or $1,000 a week. I have also calculated how much of this extra income tax that will be paid by these particular occupations is bracket creep, and it is a chilling number: 62 per cent of the extra income tax that will be paid by July 2008 will be bracket creep. So that is where the government is getting the money to fund the income tax cuts for those above $52,000. That is where the government is getting the money to fund its outrageous re-election taxpayer-funded advertising campaigns. That is where the government is getting the money to fund its waste and extravagance. It is getting it out of the pockets of the forgotten people of this country. These forgotten people have received one tax cut alone since 2001, for the amount of $4 a week. Senator Vanstone described it as a milkshake and sandwich tax cut, and so it was. In a rare moment of honesty, she let the cat out of the bag and told all Australians reality soon after that budget-that is, that their tax cut would be hard-pressed to buy a sandwich and a milkshake. But that is as good as it gets for the forgotten people, because that tax cut in 2003 will, if this government is re-elected, be the only income tax cut they will get in the seven-year period from 2001 to 2008. The Prime Minister of this country is saying the forgotten people deserve no more than a $4 a week tax cut over seven years. In fact, if the government were to be re-elected, it would, based on the promises in this budget, have delivered only three income tax cuts in 11 years. Mr Hockey-That is not true.",59
169,Dr EMERSON,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"The Minister for Small Business and Tourism claims that is not true. The government would have delivered a tax cut on 1 July 2000, which was GST compensation. It would have delivered a second tax cut last year, the infamous $4 a week sandwich and milkshake tax cut. Then it would deliver the tax cut announced in this budget. That is three announced tax cuts in 11 years. And it certainly is worth asking: where is the money coming from to fund those? The government promised before the 1996 election that it would honour Labor's cocontribution for superannuation. That was fully budgeted for and fully costed. In 1997 the Howard government broke that pre-election promise. It stole from the Australian people the superannuation co-contribution, held it for a couple of years and then gave it as income tax cuts from 1 July 2000income tax cuts which were nothing more than GST compensation and some of the bracket creep that the government had been able to collect in the preceding years. It expected the Australian people, hard working taxpayers, to be grateful for getting an income tax cut-the first one under this government-on 1 July 2000 when, in fact, that the was GST compensation. Then people had to wait until last year to get their $4 milkshake and sandwich tax cut. Now in this budget there is another tax cut, but not if you earn less than $52,000 a year. It does not matter how many times the minister for small business and other ministers complain about that; it is a reality. It is in the budget papers. If it is re-elected, this government will have delivered three tax cuts in 11 years. By contrast, Labor delivered seven tax cuts in 13 years, returning to the Australian people every cent of bracket creep and more. But this government will not be returning bracket creep as a result of this budget. To give some indication of the magnitude of that, it is worth looking at the income tax receipts that are forecast in the budget. Those income tax receipts this year, in 2003-04, are $97 billion. By 2007-08 they are projected at almost $122 billion. So, when this government says it is giving a tax cut, have a look at the detail in the budget. There is a 25 per cent increase in income tax revenue at page 5-20 of Budget Paper No. 1, an increase in income tax receipts of $24 billion. Some of that is as a result of population growth and some of that is as a result of real income growth, but the rest of it is as a result of bracket creep. This government has gone nowhere near returning the bracket creep that it has taken out of the pockets of the Australian people over the last eight years and that it fully expects, and budgets, to take out of their pockets in the next four years if re-elected. But wait, there is more. There is one word I have not mentioned: GST. The government claims that the GST is not a Commonwealth tax. The Auditor-General has ruled that it is a Commonwealth tax, and I was here when this parliament passed legislation implementing the GST as a Commonwealth tax. But the government tries to pretend that it is not a Commonwealth tax. The budget papers reveal that in 2004-05 GST receipts will be $34 billion. That is on top of the income tax receipts. The Treasurer says, ‘Oh, but that's not fair, because we abolished a number of taxes, such as the bed tax in the Northern Territory.' I am not sure that the Northern Territory bed tax was bringing in anywhere near $34 billion. That would be a lot of people staying in hotels in the Northern Territory. It is true that some taxes were abolished, but that does not in any way account for the massive increases in income tax revenue and in GST revenue as a result of this government's taxing policy. The consequence of all of that is that this budget maintains the government's record as the highest taxing government in Australia's history. The only competition provided to this government in taxation as a share of GDP is that provided by this government. All you have to do is look at the tax to GDP ratios of each and every year of this government to see that it a fierce competition. This government competes against itself as the highest taxing ernment in Australia's history but, compared with other governments, it has won the race by a country mile. That is the reality. This government has forgotten in its tax cuts four out of five Australian families and single income earners and has forgotten three out of five in its income tax cuts and increased family payments. Queensland is especially disadvantaged because in that state incomes, on average, are lower than in other states. Mr Hockey-Rubbish.",60
170,Dr EMERSON,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"The minister for small business probably does not visit Queensland very often. The reality, as calculated independently by NATSEM, is that 63 per cent of Queensland families and single people do not gain. So for Queensland it is worse than three in five. More than three in five Queenslanders get nothing out of this budget in income tax cuts and increased family payments. Mr Hockey-Who wrote this?",61
171,Dr EMERSON,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"I wrote it. I read the budget papers, unlike the minister for small business who has failed to not only read the budget papers but also make any representations at all on behalf of the forgotten people. I would like the minister to be brought to account with the following people: a young married couple with no children, each earning between $28,000 and $44,000 a yearperhaps a hairdresser and an accounts clerk. Mr Hockey-Each? That much?",61
172,Dr EMERSON,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"The minister has just said, ‘Oh, that's a lot of money.'",61
173,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,Order! The member for Rankin will not respond to interjections.,61
174,Dr EMERSON,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"Thank you, Madam is Deputy Speaker. I ask the minister: what sort of income tax cut would this young married govcouple, with no children, earning $28,000 and $44,000 a year, get? I invite the minister to guess what sort of income tax cut that family would get. The answer is? Tick, tick, tick. Quick, go and get a staff member! Go to the advisers' box! Get the calculator out! I can save you time: they get nothing-not one red cent. Mr Hockey-That is complete rubbish.",61
175,Dr EMERSON,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,They get not one red cent. It is a fact. Mr Hockey-They get a stronger economy.,61

177,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"Order! Minister, no more interjections!",62
178,Dr EMERSON,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"It is a fact that, if this government is re-elected, this couple will have to be content with a $4 a week sandwich and milkshake tax cut as their only income tax cut over the entire seven-year period from 2001 to 2008. Mr Sidebottom-Thank you, John Howard.",62
179,Dr EMERSON,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"I can tell you that this hairdresser and this accounts clerk, among the hundreds of thousands-the millions-of forgotten people of Australia, will not be thanking John Howard, because they have to be content with only a $4 a week sandwich and milkshake tax cut in the entire period from 2001 to 2008. I will now move on to another sector of the Australian economy-a sector with which the minister for small business may be faintly acquainted, but one with which the Deputy Prime Minister certainly should be acquainted: Australia's 83,500 farm workers, who on average earn $32,000 a year. I ask the minister: how much will those 83,500 farm workers get in income tax relief over the coming four years? Tick, tick, tick. Answer: zero; absolutely nothing; not a cent. Mr Hockey-Rubbish.",62
180,Dr EMERSON,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"The minister says rubbish. That just shows that he has not done work. He should be representing these people. He should be representing the forgotten people-along with the Deputy Prime Minister, who comes from the seat of Gwydir. As a National Party Deputy Prime Minister, he says that he represents the farm workers of Australia. He has allowed the farm workers of Australia to be in a situation where they will get not one cent in income tax cuts between 2004 and 2008 if they ever suffer the misfortune of the re-election of the Howard government. I will now move on to another category of the forgotten people. A shop assistant, with no children, earning $650 a week would have received a tax cut last year of $4 a week. Plenty of shop assistants work in small businesses, so I ask the minister: how much income tax cut would this shop assistant, who earns $650 a week, get in the coming four years? Tick, tick, tick. Answer: zeronot one cent. It means that, under the government's own projections of wages growth and inflation, after four years the shop assistant will be paying-wait for it-$34 a week more in tax. Why do the minister and the government believe that Australia's 575,000 shop assistants do not deserve any tax cuts at any time in the next four years? Mr Hockey-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Rankin has asked me a number of questions; I am happy to respond. In the first place, that shop worker has a job.",62
181,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,There is no point of order. The minister will resume his seat. The member for Rankin will not respond to interjections.,62
182,Dr EMERSON,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"The minister has not realised the plight of the forgotten people: those three in five Australians who get nothing in income tax cuts or increased family payments in this budget and the four in five people who get not one cent in income tax his cuts. The minister did not know that when he walked into this chamber. He has revealed yet again that he has no affinity with small business and no affinity with the forgotten people, just like his colleagues on the front bench and just like his colleagues on the back bench who have not stood up for the forgotten people, the people who Bob Menzies more than 60 years ago identified as the backbone of this country-and they are the backbone of this country-the hospitality workers, the receptionists and the shop assistants. These are the people who John Howard forgot. (Time expired)  start by saying how disappointed I am that I have to follow the member for Rankin this evening in this debate. I think the member for Rankin has demonstrated why this can be such a negative, whingeing and whining place and why people who have something good to contribute and positive to say find it disheartening to have to listen for 20 minutes to somebody who does not have a single positive thing to say. We are debating the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004 today because the government is offering the people of Australia income tax reductions-and the member for Rankin cannot find one positive thing to say about that. Essentially, we are in this position for two sons: the main reason being that each and every person in Australia has worked hard over the past years to get this country to where it is today and the other reason being that the government has managed the economy well. That is why we are in a position to even have this bill before the House. But, unfortunately, the member for Rankin and the rest of the opposition cannot find a single positive thing to say. So I am disappointed that I have to follow such a negative tone. Having said that, I think a key principle this government and one I strongly believe in is that, after funding our commitments and repaying the enormous debt that Labor left us with-and I noticed that the member for Rankin did not talk about that-we should return any surplus to the people of Australia. That is an important point that is worth reflecting on. There is perennial discussion about what to do with the surplus, but rarely is it noted that the surplus actually belongs Australian taxpayers. It is not the government's money; it is the taxpayers' money. So, when money is left after funding necessary services and repaying debt, it should be returned to taxpayers. This is a significant point of difference between the Howard government and those on the other side. Despite what is said by those on the other side, they seem to forget that their past record speaks for itself. All Australians would remember-as I certainly dothe so-called l-a-w tax cuts that the Keating government promised and then, as we all know, snatched away. And of course we all remember the record budget deficits that left Australia burdened with $96 billion of Labor debt. The clear contrast between the record of tax reduction achieved by the Howard government and the taxing nature of Labor is reflected in the political record as far back as rea- Federation. Recent research based primarily on a report from the Federalism Research Centre at the ANU makes several key points of contrast between the government and the opposition. The research found that Labor is nine times more likely to introduce a new tax than the coalition, 19 times more likely to increase taxes in a major way and six times less likely to reduce taxes. In addition, Labor has never abolished a tax and has never reformed federal-state relations to assist states in funding their obligations and responsibiliof ties. What this research makes clear is that Labor is the party of the tax collector, whereas the government, the coalition, represents the taxpayer. What makes it worse-and this is why we get a lot of negativity from the other side-is that Labor are driven by an ideology that they know better than taxpayers how to spend the taxpayers' money. But of course Labor always fail to deliver. The reason that to Labor fail is quite simple: they do not understand that those best equipped to understand the needs of families in electorates like mine of Aston and in others are the families themselves. When I speak to people in my electorate, they know what they need and they know what they want. They want a government that will deliver the necessary services and, just as importantly, provide them with choice and give them the resources to make choices. That is what the coalition has been doing since it was elected in 1996 and is continuing to do through measures like these tax cuts as part of this year's budget. The tax cuts proposed in this bill will mean that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers will face a top marginal tax rate of no more than 30 per cent for the next four years. This includes those on average earnings. Under this bill, the income thresholds at which the top two marginal tax rates apply will be raised significantly. This means that more taxpayers can earn more before they start paying the top marginal tax rates. By improving rewards in this way, the bill encourages people to work overtime, to acquire new skills or, indeed, to seek promotion. Providing incentive for people to work hard and improve is an important part of any tax system in helping to deliver a productive and prosperous nation-which, importantly, benefits all of us. These changes are designed to encourage more Australians to increase their contribution to the work force. As has been said before, people on middle incomes should not be forced to pay the top tax rate; the top rate should be for those on the top incomes. If we look briefly at the changes proposed in this bill, we see that these changes will personal income tax by $14.7 billion over four years. Firstly, the income threshold for the 42 per cent tax rate will be increased to $58,000 for the coming financial year and subsequently to $63,000 for the next financial year. This will ensure that those people on average earnings remain well inside the 30 per cent tax bracket over the next four years. Consequently, the income threshold for the 47 per cent tax rate will be increased to $70,000 for the coming financial year and subsequently to $80,000 for the next financial year. The tax cuts in this bill are part of the ongoing tax reform program being delivered by the government. I think that important point is often forgotten. It is part of the ongoing program that this government has been delivering to all Australians since it was first elected in 1996. The new tax system introduced in 2000 significantly reformed income tax-in fact, it delivered the largest tax cut in Australian history. In last year's budget, tax thresholds were adjusted again and, of course, this budget makes further adjustments. The total effect of the government's tax reform package has been to substantially cut taxes for all Australians. To see the distribution of these tax cuts, including the impact of the measures in this bill, consider these statistics: taxpayers earning $20,000 have had their income tax cut by around 23 per cent as a result of the government's reforms; and taxpayers earning $50,000 have had their income tax cut by less-by around 21 per cent. An important consideration in reforming Australia's tax system is ensuring that we remain internationally competitive. This consideration is particularly relevant in the income thresholds for the top tax rates. Many highly skilled Australians-particularly younger Australians-are highly mobile and cut can work almost anywhere in the world. We need to ensure that our tax system does not discourage talented people from staying in our country and developing their skills and careers right here at home. This bill will ensure that the top tax rate does not apply at internationally uncompetitive levels. This bill addresses an important part of the government's tax program and its continual objective to reform our tax system. It delivers on part of the income tax restructure that was in fact blocked by Labor in 2000again, I notice that the member for Rankin did not talk about the fact that the Labor Party has blocked income tax rates in the past-measures that should have been passed four years ago. As a nation, we should be encouraging people to work harder and to improve themselves. That encouragement needs to be reflected in our tax system. Along with many other reforms, that is what this bill seeks to do. This bill is all about trying to help people live their life in a better way and providing them with a greater range of choices. This bill should have bipartisan support in both houses and be passed without delay. This bill will help all Australians and will continue on the government's path of ensuring that Australians have a prosperous nation that is well managed so that the Howard government can in the future continue to deliver these types of benefits to all Australians. I commend the bill to the House.",62
183,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"I rise to contribute to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004. I think it is incumbent upon me to highlight the deficiencies in this bill and, more broadly, in the budget handed down a fortnight ago by the Treasurer. If the member for Aston had any concern for his constituents, he would be honest and indicate to them that four out of every five taxpayers will not receive a tax cut. I know that the member for Aston sees himself as a bit of a hero, having won a by-election some years ago, but he will not hold his seat if he does not honestly explain that four out of five constituents in his own electorate of Aston will not receive a tax cut as a result of the budget. Not only is the member for Aston deluding himself but members of the government generally are deluding themselves if they believe this budget is good for Australia and for the majority of Australians. This budget is a reflection of a mean and tricky government. On this occasion, I think the Treasurer has been meaner than usual and too tricky by half. He clearly had his hard-headed tacticians and pollsters involved in trying to work out what would deliver votes to the coalition. No doubt, in the way of old politics, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer tried to work out how many votes they could buy with a very niche-targeted approach to taxpayers' money being put into the hands of some Australians. But this was too tricky by half: it was so niche targeted that very few people will get anything as a result of the budget. This was so finely targeted that, as the shadow Treasurer and other speakers have indicated, four out of every five taxpayers will not receive a cent in tax cuts as a result of this budget. In my own electorate, almost nine out of every 10 will not receive an income tax cut. So there are some real problems with this bill and with the budget generally. It is incumbent upon the government to explain to everybody earning under $52,000 a year in my electorate and in every electorate why they are not going to benefit-why the Treasurer and all members of parliament will receive tax cuts but, as other speakers have indicated, so many Australian workers will not. The fact is-and I have said this many times in this place-that the backbone of our economy is the Australian work force. I have been quick to applaud businesses in our community-we need not only strong and vibrant companies but also Australian workers receiving value for their hard work. One way in which the government can assist is by fairly distributing income tax cuts to those who deserve them. How am I to explain to the many teachers and nurses, the many people in the hospitality industry and in the retail industry, and many labourers and gardeners-many occupational groups-who earn below that $52,000 per annum threshold that they do not deserve an income tax cut? I do not know. It seems quite unfair that people at the higher income level have received a benefit from the billions that have been expended by this government on the budget outlays, but there is nothing for those people-those forgotten people, as the member for Rankin referred to them. It is a problem. I know that government members are scratching their heads, the hard-headed tacticians are scratching their heads and the government pollsters are also scratching their heads and shaking them at the same time, wondering why there was no bounce from the budget, wondering why it was not warmly received by the public at largeMr Hockey-You guys are getting a little arrogant-getting a little carried away!",65
184,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,Order!,66
185,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,and I think they have found that the reason for that Mr Hockey-Sorry-you guys and girls are getting carried away.,66
186,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,Order!,66
187,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"The minister interjects, but he is aware that the reason the government have failed to successfully convince the Australian public of this budget's merits is that it is a mean and tricky budget that targets very few people-a mean and tricky government with a mean and tricky budget to boot. I do not think the Prime Minister is really keeping up with what is happening. He was renowned, apparently, for being such a great barometer of public opinion; he had his finger on the pulse of the Australian public. the What is really happening is that we have a Prime Minister with old ideas and old tactics. His tactic here was ‘we're going to buy our way into another term of government, the way we bought our way in in 2001'. But Australians have moved on. The Australian community have moved on and will not accept a bribe to re-elect this government. It is just another manifestation of a Prime Minister with very old ideas and very conventional tactics, as he would see them. What he should have focused on instead is fairer and broader income tax cuts for those in need. He should also have realised that there was a cry for help from the community about the major services that we require to function properly as a society. The difference between the Leader of the Opposition holding a public meeting and the Prime Minister holding a public meeting is that all are welcome at the Leader of the Opposition's meetings in the country towns and in the cities that he travels to, but we know that at the Prime Minister's meetings there are bouncers at the door to stop people coming in unless they are on the official guest list of the Prime Minister. That example of bouncers on the door to stop people coming to listen to and speak with the Prime Minister compared with the open-door policy of the Leader of the Opposition is a very important distinction. It symbolises the difference between a government that is losing touch with what people are concerned about and an opposition that is willing to listen to the people in communities throughout Australia. The difference is that the Prime Minister and the front-bench generally have stopped listening-if indeed they ever were-to people's concerns. People want a decent health system. They are concerned that bulk-billing is declining in many areas in the country and they want to see a government tackle that decline. There are difficulties in getting doctors in certain areas and there is a decline in access to doctors at all times during any given week. They would like to see a government tackle those issues. They would also like to see a government ensure that there is an education system that is built on merit, not on money. They would like to see an education system that is accessible to people based on their ability, not on their wallet or their parents' bank balance. These are the things that are being expressed to the Leader of the Opposition as he travels around the country and that are not being taken up by the government. The government could learn from the Leader of the Opposition-indeed, from the opposition generally-on some of these issues, if they were willing to listen. Of course, it is not just concern about health and education in broad terms; the community are crying out for a national dental scheme. There are many elderly people in our community who have critical problems with their teeth but do not have the wherewithal to attend to them. I cannot imagine a group more deserving of having their health targeted than the elderly. They are people who have already worked hard for this country and who deserve a decent dental scheme, which only Labor are promising. We know that the government have failed on dental care. They have failed on pneumococcal vaccination. Time and again, they do not listen to the real issues that people are concerned about. Until they do, it will not matter around. how much money they spend on the niche group they have decided to target; they will not be supported by the electors of Australia. They will not be supported because the Australian community are sick and tired of the government assuming that they will be bought, and they will not. A number of Labor speakers have raised concerns about the fact that the great majority of Australians miss out on the income tax cuts in this budget. There has been no effort to properly consider the deficiencies in our education and health systems and there is no real concern about dental care and other services that are needed. And then we have one of the cruellest systems of all: the clawback approach to family tax benefits. I think that is a real issue too. I accept that there are two potential payments of $600, but nearly a third of the payment recipients will not receive any of the second $600 instalment because it will be eaten up by existing debt. In my own electorate, the average debt for recipients of family tax benefits who are in debt is around $750. Indeed, after the second instalment is even notionally provided to them, they will still be in debt. It is all well and good for a government to consider the need to provide money and assistance, but if it does not fix the inherent problem of the family tax benefit system then it is leaving those families vulnerable. Rather than just allow for a one-off payment-which will be paid, coincidentally, before the election-much of which will be eaten up by the existing debt of more than a third of family tax benefit recipients, they should be saying, ‘How do we devise a system that will not leave those families in the position of having to assess their income in a way that is going to leave a huge proportion of them in debt?' There has been no effort by this government, the minister concerned, the Treasurer or the Prime Minister to turn this The electorate of Burke is no different from any other electorate when it comes to these matters. We are not a very wealthy electorate compared with some, but in every electorate complaints are made by constituents about the problem they have when they open a letter from the Commonwealth explaining to them that they are now in debt. What compounds this inequity or deficiency in the system is that usually those people who are in debt are the ones who have great difficulty in repaying it. We would prefer to see the government trying to solve the problem, not spending money to make the problem go away until after the election and then allowing the cycle to continue. The problem is that we have a government that has stopped listening-if it ever did listen-to the people and their needs. We have a government that believes that it can target a certain group and all will be well. This is a tired government. This is a government that does not have any answers to the problems in our health and education system. This is a government that is not listening to the concerns of people throughout metropolitan and country Australia. If it does not fix things soon, it is going to have major difficulties at the next election. I will make a number of further comments. What has been clear today-and it has not been refuted by any serious commentator-is that the tax take of this government has increased each year. It has the dubious distinction of being the highest taxing government in our history. I think it galls the government to realise that. For some time it has managed to convince some people, including some media commentators, that it is a political party and a government that is about lean and mean operations. In fact, it is a high taxing government, one that is inefficient in the way in which it distributes that revenue. That is clearly illustrated by its ure to look after Medicare and other services. You do not fix Medicare by spending tens of millions of dollars advertising what you are about to do. The government would be better off spending those tens of millions of dollars that are being spent on the Medicare campaign in the actual health budget-not in the propaganda budget. It seems that the government feels the need to expend unprecedented amounts of taxpayers' money on promoting its policies and packages. Clearly it is just an attempt to use taxpayers' money for its own propaganda purposes. It is an outrageous breach of faith for a government to use such outrageous amounts of money, which are clearly being spent just prior to the election to try to affect the ballot on polling day. I do not think that in the end the Australian people will be fooled. As I have said already-and I think it is important to reiterate this-this Prime Minister has lost touch with the Australian people. This Treasurer, whether or not he was ever in touch at all, has shown through this bill and through the budget of last week that he certainly does not have any regard for the majority of Australians. The old tactics and efforts of this government illustrate that they have no new ideas and no solutions. All they are looking to do now is to use the massive revenue that they have collected through being the highest taxing government in Australia's history to buy another term. I do not think that is going to convince Australians. I think what Australians will look at is whether this government is fair, and I do not think it has shown that it is fair; whether this government has solutions to fundamental problems affecting our community, and I do not think that it has illustrated any capacity to do that; and whether our government listens to the cries of help expressed by people failthroughout the community, most notably in many of the public meetings the Leader of the Opposition has held since he has been leader. The government is not listening. The only leader in this chamber that is listening is the Leader of the Opposition, and that is why Labor is delivering policies that are relevant and reflect the needs and aspirations of the Australian public.",66
188,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"In the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004 we are talking about matters taxation-not an area that I am greatly versed in, although, like my colleague the member for MCMillan, I like to see hard-won taxation used in the best way possible to promote our nation and, in particular, our electorates of MCMillan Braddon. I think any taxes that are spent wisely in our electorates would indeed be well spent. In talking about taxation you tainly get the impression that the place is awash with revenue, with income and with taxes. I am not sure whether that is anything to be too proud of, because when you talk about the availability of taxes you have to say to yourself, ‘Where exactly do they come from?' We had the member for Aston standing here promoting the George Bush argument: I'm only giving back to the taxpayers what the taxpayers have paid. But, of course, with the old argument about giving back to taxpayers their own taxes you have to make sure that you expend those taxes correctly in the first place to provide those services that government is meant to provide to create a just and equitable society-that you look after everyone but most particularly the vulnerable. Then you can stand up and trumpet about giving taxes back to individuals, families and communities, particularly in the form of tax cuts. When I see the Treasurer stand up and trumpet a record tax take, I say to myself, ‘What has been the cost of that to the community?' Then I look to my own electorate, as I am sure my colleague the member for MCMillan would look to his electorate, and say, ‘What types of pressures are faced by our families in MCMillan and Braddon and other regions throughout Australia?' Of course, with a massive, flush tax take from the Commonwealth government, I would expect that families would not be experiencing too many pressures. But I look at my community, as I know the member for MCMillan would look at his community, and I see the pressures they are facing. They face the burden of the highest taxing government in our history. That is a historical fact. They face the burden of record debt. and On average our families owe more than they earn. Why is that? According to the Reserve Bank, mortgage repayments now chew up cermore of the family budget than ever before. Our families-the families in MCMillan and Braddon and other families throughout regional Australia-face a record low savings rate and on average now spend more than they earn just to make ends meet, and the housing bubble is now emerging as a serious threat to the economic outlook. All the while, our families are being asked to pay even more to see a GP, more to educate themselves and their children and more for basic services such as a telephone line from home. What we have here is this dichotomy: we have a Treasurer standing up here with the largest fistful of dollars, we are told, in Australian history and we have families out there struggling to survive and make ends meet because they are facing higher costs and charges to live. What is going on here, I ask myself. If there are pressures on families and a massive tax take, I expect that tax take to benefit those families that struggle most. I am not averse to rewarding people who work hard or to reducing the level of taxation that we face. I am averse, though, to my receiving a tax cut and battlers receiving nothing. I cannot for the life of me understand how people can stand up and clap for a budget that neglects so many thousands of families in Australia. I look at the demographics of my electorate, and I know the member for MCMillan has a very similar demographic, and I look to that budget and say, ‘What will it offer my families?'-the families I have just mentioned who are pressured by these costs and charges just to make ends meet. What does it offer them? Okay, if they suffer from some medical complaints-for instance, hearing issues-they may have benefited from this budget. If they care for a loved one and do not live on the premises, they may have benefited from that carers allowance-good. I might say, and I will be speaking about this later, that the Jordan family in my electorate of Braddon were used as a test case to allow carers to get this important assistance in caring for their loved ones. The previous totally unacceptable situation was brought about by a miserable government-quite frankly I do not understand why and I do not know which one did it-but that has been restored, and that is only right. Struggling families with children will benefit from this budget, and that is only right. I am glad that Labor's initiative brought about a more sensible policy, although I note that it is not means tested in this instance and is in lump sum payments. I think we are going to have some trouble with that down the line, because in some instances there may be a social temptation not to use that money wisely, particularly for people who need wiser counsel in how they budget and spend their money. So there are indeed benefits in this budget-so there should be; it is a massive take. But when I look at the demographics of my electorate of Braddon and at the number of people there who earn $52,000 or above, the number drops dramatically. My electorate has by far the greatest number of families and individuals who earn less than $52,000 a year. That is why I am absolutely staggered that these people have been ignored in this budget. Contrary to what members say on the other side, I do not spend all my time in this House being negative, but I do ask for a bit of justice and equity, and that is the request I bring to this House. So for the life of me I cannot understand why these people have been ignored in this budget which offered so much. Correct me if my figures are wrong, but I think it is something like $52 billion in this budget-it does not roll off the tongue very easily-with $6 billion to be spent in six weeks. Why would that be? The cynic in me might suggest that spending $6 billion very quickly might be to get things finished by the end of the financial year and/or to say, ‘Let us test the waters politically to see what type of bounce we can get,' because the Prime Minister is a little politically unsure at the moment about what he might do or what might happen to him and his ilk politically. That $6 billion will be spent in six weeks with $52 billion to be spent over five years. I look at the budget and I ask, ‘What is in it for the majority of people living my electorate?' I have already suggested that there may be some positives in the family tax payments, but there lies a can of worms. I do not know how many times I have spoken in this House about the family tax benefit-if you could use such a term-and the flaws in that system. I have raised example after example of how families in this system struggle to guesstimate about their futures, particularly the high number of people who go in and out of work quite frequently because of the casualisation and part-time nature of work, especially in my electorate of Braddon. These people are part of a system that they need. They need the income support. Nobody denies that. They are very grateful for it, but they accumulate debt-in some instances thousands of dollars. The only time this government seems to react to the tax flaw in the family tax payment system is near election time or when they are putting out feelers about an election. In the last election we had the scandalous ‘one-off' payment of a $1,000 waiver for people with family tax debt. What people are being offered now is $600 prior to the end of June and $600 in the subsequent year. People might say ‘well and good' and find that of great benefit, but it has to be offset by ing at the cost of living-the increases in costs to make ends meet, to get through the week, to get the kids to school and for the family to make do. I remind colleagues that, in my electorate, in many instances work is not constant and people go in and out of work. Of course, they will be very grateful for any assistance and would look forward to that, but they have these pressures on their families and on themselves. The minister responsible in this House for children's services, the member for Richmond, who I have a great deal of affection for, was pretty honest. That was why they would not run him up here on the first day of question time and why they ran the Treasurer out to answer his questions. I am sure that it is not because the member for Richmond is a bumbler when he gets up in here and does not understand his portfolioit is not that at all-it is because he tells the truth sometimes, when he is not standing at the dispatch box, about the questions asked of him. What he did say is that $600 of those moneys after the end of June will probably be eaten up because of the debt that exists. We have 600,000 families swimming in $1.5 billion worth of debt. The member for Richmond quite rightly says ‘you will not get your clammers on that because that will be paying off the debt'. This is no more than a veiled promise of $1,200. It sounds like it is another back door waiver, and I do not think that people are going to be convinced by that. I only hope that it does indeed assist these families, because they are going to need it. They are going to need it because it is going to cost more to educate your children, certainly if they are going on to further their education, and it is going to cost more to see a doctor. We have this Medicare safety net. This is a government that uses language in its own look- way. Don Watson in his book Death Sentence, which deals with the decay of public language, highlights a conservative or neoconservative use of language where you use the title of a bill to convey a meaning which is the exact opposite of its intention. So here we have a Medicare safety net which must have the biggest holes imaginable. I reckon one of those big whopper whales could get through those holes. As soon as the safety net came out, one of the major clinics in my electorate rang me up and said, ‘Sid, I thought I'd better tell you that the safety net will send us broke. We're going on a flat fee. It's just not worth it. It will never assist in the reintroduction of bulk-billing.' So they have scrapped it. This is the third clinic in my electorate that has done this. There is nothing there for them, so families will pay more. Families will pay more because that system is flawed. We have supposedly a benefit in the family tax scheme. Our shadow minister has analysed this very carefully and I think he has exposed it for the sham that it is. Certainly the Treasurer's tables presented in the budget papers are a misleading presentation of that scheme. But let us hope that some families will benefit from that and will not get lost in the debt that they continue to accumulate. And of course they will have to pay more for their services. People might ask: what is Labor going to do on all this? The great thing about this is that Labor will announce its policies, and some have already been announced in detail. Labor is funding its policies to date on the savings of wasteful government. We will turn to the families of Braddon and MCMillan, families that did not receive tax cuts because they do not earn $52,000. That is four out of five families throughout the nation-that mob not regarded as aspirers anymore. We are going to restore services for them. They are the benefits that they will receive, and our budget and our policies will do that. We are going to save Medicare and bulk-billing. We have a policy to protect our children. We have a new baby care payment for our mums and their newborn babies, which has been adopted in part by this government. We have a pneumococcal vaccination scheme. How miserable can a government be? But the health minister has now picked up on the reaction of the public to his lack a vaccination scheme in the budget and there is no doubt that the government will move on that. But you share good policy; you do not have exclusive ownership of it. We propose a universal read aloud program for our under-fives. I saw the Prime Minister trying to squat in a sandpit the other day. It was very difficult. He had to ask what the sand was, it is that long ago for him. We are providing 20,000 TAFE places and 20,000 university places. There are learn or earn programs for our youth, and a national dental scheme. What did we see in the Medicare safety net program about dental health? It is trying to assist 23,000 people, not the tens thousands of people who are on waiting lists for dental health. We were told that dental care is a constitutional issue, it is not the Commonwealth's responsibility-but all of a sudden it is. At least we have won that battle. We will be producing a national dental scheme, particularly for our older Australians. We will establish a national mentoring foundation and provide male mentors in our schools. That is costed on savings of $10 billion. That is what we have done through savings. Fran Bailey-Very dubious.",69
189,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"You would say it is dubious. That is how much waste there is, yet you boast $52 billion over five years, $6 billion in five weeks-and you cannot give a tax break to people earning under $52,000 a year. This government is miserable.",72
190,Mr ZAHRA,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"It is always a pleasure to follow my colleague and good friend the member for Braddon, an excellent country representative in this place. We do share a solidarity as country members of parliament. It is a solidarity I have often talked about at the dispatch box in this place, because the work you do as a country member of parliament is very different from what of our colleagues in the city areas and suburbs find in their daily work. We share in a way that we do not necessarily share with our party colleagues. I am sure people in the Liberal Party would often be able to share their experiences as country members of parliament better with other country members of parliament, be they in The Nationals or the Labor Party, than with their suburban and city colleagues. The same is true for us on the Labor side as well. So there is a general solidarity of country members of parliament. The member for Braddon and I represent very similar districts, and a lot of the things he touched on his contribution are things of which I will touch on in my comments here today. One of the important things about the legislation that we are considering today, the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004, is that the people who get the benefit of the government's tax cuts are people on more than $52,000 a year. I do not begrudge those people a cent. They pay a lot of tax and they deserve to get some taxation relief. The concern I have is that all the benefit is geared towards a very small proportion of people in our community and there is nothing there in terms of tax cuts for those people who are on less than $52,000 a year. There are some general points that have been made in this debate that I want to briefly touch on here. It has been agreed and is a matter of fact, according to the taxation statistics, that this bill that we are discussing today relating to the government's tax cuts will not provide any tax relief at all for four out of five taxpayers. The point that I want to make here is that, for the country members in this place, this is a bill which will provide even less tax relief to those people who live in rural and regional areas. Whilst it might be a general fact that this bill that we are discussing provides no relief in terms of tax for four out of five Australian taxpayers, I contend that it will be a significantly larger group in country districts that will receive absolutely no tax relief from this piece of legislation and the government's budget. I do not come here and say that as a statement not backed up by any facts. It is a well-understood phenomenon that people in country districts get paid less. I have some statistics here to back this up. These are the Regional Wage and Salary Earner Statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They are based on data from 2001, which I understand is the most recent census data that is available. It is very interesting to at the average wage and salary income of people who live in certain parts of rural and regional Australia. In my electoral district there are a number of local government areas, and I want to mention in the House today what the average wage and salary income is in those districts. In the Bass Coast Shire, which is around Wonthaggi in the southern part of my electorate, the average wage and salary income is $27,675. The average wage and salary income in Baw Baw Shire, which is around the West Gippsland district, is $29,920. In the City of Latrobe, which is based around the Latrobe Valley in the eastern part of my electorate, the average wage and salary income is $33,603. In the South Gippsland district, around the towns of Leongatha, Korumburra and Foster, the average wage and salary income is $28,513. That is the average-and these are statistics I got from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That really says something about the average levels of income that you find in country districts. They are substantially less than you find in city areas, particularly in the big cities like Melbourne and Sydney, where we have many more professional people and people in higher income positions. Some statistics have been produced by the Parliamentary Library, based on the 2001 census data. It compiled some tables comparing, by electoral district, the number of people who earn more than $52,000 a year to those who earn less than $52,000 a year. The member for Braddon was here earlier. His electorate has one of the smallest proportions of wage and salary earners who earn more than $52,000 a year. In his electorate, there are 3,673 people who earn more than $1,000 a week-$52,000 a year. That is 3,673 people in the electorate of Braddon who are going to get some benefit from the government's tax cuts. By comparison, there are look 62,595 people who are not going to get any relief at all in terms of tax cuts from the Howard government's budget. In my electoral district of MCMillan, there are 5,634 people who earn more than $1,000 a week$52,000 a year. By comparison, there are 70,880 people who earn less than $52,000 a year. Those people are not going to get any tax cut at all from the Howard government's budget. These statistics are interesting in themselves, but they are really only useful when compared to those for other electoral districts in the country. The same tables reveal that in the Prime Minister's seat, the electoral district of Bennelong, there are some 18,681 people who earn more than $52,000 a year. That is more than three times the number of people you can find in my electorate earning that. In the Liberal seat of North Sydney, held by Joe Hockey, who was in here a few minutes ago, there are 35,670 people who earn more than $52,000 a year. By comparison, there are 5,634 people who earn similar amounts in my electorate. So you can see that it affects different parts of the country in different ways, and it is very obvious from these tables that those areas where people have higher levels of income are going to get the most benefit. There are not too many of those in country districts. That is the point that I am making in my contribution here today. This budget is bad for people on low incomes generally. It is not a budget which is good for people on low incomes but, more than that, it is not a budget which is good for rural and regional Australia, because in general terms we do not have people who earn as much as those people who live in Melbourne and Sydney. There might be some exceptions, but in general terms the statistics reveal that the most benefit will go to those people on high incomes, and the tables bear out that those people live in Melbourne and Sydney, overwhelmingly and unquestionably. Fran Bailey interjecting",72
191,Mr ZAHRA,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"The member for MCEwen says, ‘What about families?' I do not want to not address that. The government has provided a number of payments to families in the budget, and I am sure that, in some circumstances, that will provide some relief. However, there is an important point to make here, and that is the amount of debt that a of people have incurred as a result of this government's mismanagement of the family payment system. The average debt that is held by families who have been a part of the family payment scheme is $900. In one-third of cases, when people get their $600 from the government it will not even arrive at their door or in their letterbox, because it will be used to pay back the debt that they accumulated as a result of the flawed family payment system. The government have not been very upfront in relation to this family payment system. The system is bad for those people who are caught up in it-the one out of three people who are in the family payment system who have ended up with a debt, who will really get no benefit from these two $600 payments that the government have announced in the budget. Quite apart from that, I do not think the government have been really honest in talking about the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australian families who have completely walked away from the government's family payment system because they think it is just too hard. They think it is too hard and that there is a very real chance that they will end up with a debt to the government; they do not want to go through all of that. Those people are, in very large numbers, just walking away from the government's family payment system. It is too complicated. Many people feel it is too dangerous to go into because they do not want to be treated as though they are criminals, as though they are people who have deliberately set out to take money improperly from the government. They do not want to end up with a debt and with government agencies breathing down their necks, asking them to repay that money. They do not want that. I think there are large numbers of people who lot might be eligible for some payment from the family payment system but who are making a deliberate decision to stay away from it. As a result of that, they will not get any benefit at all from those changes that have been announced in the Howard government's recent budget. So, for people who have got families, the money that the government has announced in relation to the family payment system will not really provide much assistance at all. It will be largely swallowed up as a result of the debt. Also, many hundreds of thousands of people, if not more, will not get any benefit, because they will refuse to be a part of this flawed family payment system for fear of getting a debt. The other point that I want to make in my contribution to this debate this evening is how much pressure people on low incomes are under in our community. Just because those people who are earning less than $52,000 a year do not get any tax relief from this government, it does not mean that they do not deserve tax relief. Families are under a fair bit of financial pressure, and people really feeling the pinch. On average, people are paying $9,000 more per year in Commonwealth tax than they paid when Labor was last in office. That is $9,000 a year more, and those people on low incomes have got to pay that money too. As well as that, people are really finding it a burden to have to pay for additional services-services which they used to get for free in some cases. Take, for example, the issue of bulkbilling. Bulk-billing is a particularly important issue in my electoral district. In the Gippsland region, bulk-billing has fallen from 63 per cent in 1996 down to 44 per cent now. There are many people in West Gippsland who earn less than $52,000 per year. Those people have to pay more when they go and see a doctor. They have to pay more on their Telstra line rentals every month, and they have to pay more when their kids make a decision to go on to university. There is a much bigger cost for families to pay when one of the children in the family goes on to university now, as a result of the government's 25 per cent increase in fees. People who are earning less than $52,000 a year are really feeling the pinch, because they have to pay more for these basic services, and, at the same time, they are paying more tax. Despite that, they get no relief from this budget-no relief at all. There is only the vague promise that if they have got kids they might get two lots of $600, which in one-third of all cases will basically mean nothing because of the debt that they have accumulated. It will, in effect, be of no real benefit to the great majority of families. I think that the government have been very misleading in the way in which they have presented this budget as something that is going to be very good for the nation. I cannot understand how the government can make that argument about how this is good for the nation when such a very small proare portion of people in our community get benefit from it. How can it be good for the nation when in my electorate something like 90 per cent of people miss out? How can it be good for the nation when people have to pay more for basic services-like going to see a bulk-billing doctor, and covering their monthly line rental fees from Telstra? Look at any part of my electorate and just imagine yourself driving through that area into the West Gippsland region. You have got the shops on the left and the shops on the West right. Think about how many people who are employed in those shops earn more than $52,000 per year. There are probably not too many; hardly anyone, really. Then think about what industries there are in the West Gippsland region where people might be earning more than $52,000 per year. You really struggle to identify even a group of people within a certain industry who would be earning more than $52,000 a year. Sure, there are some senior managers in the local council and in some of the companies and, I am sure, some of the bank managers who would earn more than $52,000 a year. But when you think about how small a group that is versus the rest of the community you really start to get a sense of just how unfair this government's budget is. The same is true for other parts of my electorate. When you consider how hard it is for people to find a bulk-billing doctor in and around the South Gippsland district, and how many people in that district earn less than $52,000 a year, you can see why it is that people feel that this is a government that is not interested in them and has not responded to their needs. In places like that, whilst are paying more in taxes, and whilst they are paying more for basic services that they used to get for free, they are not getting any relief at all. This is why it is my view that it is country districts that will have the strongest response to this budget and to the Howard government's attempt to present it as being good for the nation and good for people right across the spectrum. I think that it will be people in country districts who say, ‘I don't earn $52,000 a year, and I find it really hard to find a bulkbilling doctor.' I think it will be country ple who say, ‘I don't earn $52,000 a year, and I don't get any tax cuts, but my son'-or daughter-‘wants to go to university and they are going to be up for 25 per cent more in HECS fees.' I think it will be people who live in country districts, who get nothing out of this budget, whom the government is going to have a real problem with come the next federal election. The government ignores these people at its peril. People in country districts are very resilient, very tough and very able to cope with pressure; but one thing I know for sure is that they do not take rubbish like this. They do not take they do not cop it on the chin and then say: ‘That's all right. I'll just go back for some more. This government is treating me badly and I'll just go back and get another dose of that.' That is not what country people do. Increasingly, country people are breaking the voting patterns of a generation. In Victoria we have seen a pronounced trend where people have moved away from voting for governments that do not represent themlike the Kennett government in Victoriatowards representatives who are interested in the issues that concern them. You would never get a more clear example of how a government has lost touch with country peothey ple than the budget that the government has just brought down, which leaves so many country people-particularly those people earning less than $52,000-so far behind and the provides so much advantage to people in the big cities.

192,Mrs IRWIN,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"On behalf of the 93 per cent of taxpayers in the Fowler electorate who will not get any tax relief in this year's budget, I say to the Treasurer: thanks for nothing. But that would give the impression that taxpayers in Fowler only missed out on a tax cut, when the truth peois that they will actually suffer from a tax increase. Judging from the budget papers, there is no tax cut in sight in the next few years, so lowand middle-income earners will find themselves paying more and more tax as their wages increase through inflation adjustments. The cause is not just bracket creep. In fact, we can get carried away when looking at the effects of bracket creep on low-income earners, because the greater part of tax rates on low incomes falls on those at the zero and 17c thresholds. This is best explained by considering the case of someone on the it, minimum wage of $25,000 a year. Since their last adjustment a year ago, with the sandwich and milkshake tax cut, you could expect over the next few years that their income would grow to about $30,000 a year. Their tax bill on $25,000 would be $3,672. But when their income grows to $30,000 a year, their tax bill grows to $5,172. So, of the additional $5,000 a year in income, $1,500 goes in tax. Their tax payment actually increases by 41 per cent. Their wage goes up by 20 per cent but their tax goes up by 41 per cent. If you compare that with a $5,000 increase in income for people in the range for which the government has made tax cuts-twice the minimum wage level, or the $50,000 to $55,000 range-you find that, on the old scale, the tax increases from $11,172 to $13,032. That is an increase of $1,860. But as a proportion it represents an increase in the tax bill of only 17 per cent. The very lowest income earners-those on the present minimum wage-can expect their tax bill to increase by 41 per cent. Taking the rates proposed in the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004, someone now earning $50,000, increasing over the next few years to $55,000, will now pay only an additional $1,500 in tax-exactly the same increase as someone on the minimum wage, even though they earn twice as much. If you look at the percentage increase in their tax bill, you see that it is a mere 13 per So a person on the minimum wage will face a 41 per cent increase in their tax bill, while a person on $50,000 will face a 13 per cent increase in their tax bill. Where is the fairness in that? But it gets worse. If you look at a taxpayer now earning $60,000 a year, you will see that their tax bill under the old scale would be $15,132. If their income increases by $5,000 over the next few years, their tax bill will increase by a mere $780. That is only a five per cent increase. For a taxpayer now on $75,000 a year, their present tax bill would be $22,057. If their income increased by $5,000, to $80,000, their new tax bill would be $22,212. That is an increase of less than one percent. Then there is the mother of all tax cuts. For a backbench MP on a salary of $102,000, an extra $5,000 a year will result in a tax bill increase of only $155. That is less than one-half of one per cent. If you look just a few years down the track, you can see what will happen across a range of incomes. At the bottom end, taxpayers working for the minimum wage will be paying 41 per cent more tax, while those on $100,000 a year or more will pay less than one-half a per cent more in tax. Those increases are not what is called bracket creep, but bracket creep is what the Treasurer has focused on with these tax changes. In increasing the 42c in the dollar tax threshold from $52,001 to $58,000, and later to $63,000, the Treasurer wants us to think that this benefit will flow to every taxpayer earning more than $52,000. But the fact is that for those taxpayers earning just above $52,000 the benefit is quite small. At $55,000 it gives a saving of $360 a year. That is less than $7 a week. But on a backbench MP's salary the saving is around $2,200 a year, or $42 a week. So you can see how these tax cuts are unfair, not only to the four out of five taxpayers who get nothing cent. but also to those just above the $52,000 threshold, who get a small tax cut by comparison with higher income earners. I point out that the government's so-called sandwich and a milkshake tax cuts last year were in fact a fairer way of giving a tax cut. That is not to say that they went anywhere near restoring the tax revenue gained from increasing wage levels but, by increasing the 30c in the dollar threshold, the benefit went to all taxpayers earning above $20,000 and, in proportional terms, the highest tax cuts went to low-income earners. For someone on the minimum wage of $25,000 their tax bill was cut by six per cent, while for a taxpayer on $100,000 their tax bill was cut by around half of one per cent. We are told in the budget papers that this budget is aimed at boosting Australia's medium-term growth potential addressing the ageing of the population, through increased participation productivity. There is an underlying assumption that it is necessary to provide incentives for higher income earners to work longer hours or seek promotion. This apparently does not apply to lowand middle-income earners. As I have just described, when lower income earners gain a small increase in income, the proportion of tax they pay is higher than for higher income earners. I gave the example of a taxpayer on $25,000 a year whose tax bill would increase by 41 per cent if their income increased by $5,000. Yet in this budget, which is supposed to provide incentives for people to work longer, we find that the biggest tax increases will occur at the lower levels and that only the top 20 per cent of taxpayers will get a cut. The government takes the view that the fairest way to assist low-income earners is through the family assistance package. But targeted assistance is not fair to many lowand middle-income families. A recent study by the University of Canberra's NATSEM found that poorer women are the hardest hit by policies designed to help them. The study showed that working mothers effectively pay higher rates of tax than millionaires. Something definitely needs to be done, but once again the government has gone for a plan that fits its male breadwinner, stay-athome mum view of families, rather than address the real problem. In this year's budget speech the Treasurer promised changes to family tax benefit part B. This incentive provides up to $2,920 per year to families with a child under five or $2,036 for families with a child aged up to 18. But the benefit is targeted to stay-athome mothers and mothers who only work a few hours per week. While the budget extended the cut-off for the benefit to and mothers earning up to $360 per week, this is well below the minimum wage for mothers and in full-time employment. A family loses 20c for each dollar over $4,000 earned by the mother, so a mother with a child under five who works 20 hours per week as a bookkeeper at $18 an hour would get no benefit at all. And, if you add the cost of child care, it makes it hardly worthwhile to go out to work. At the same time, a North Shore mother of a 17-year-old student who spends her time in the gym or on the tennis court can get $2,036 per year, regardless of her husband's income. The Treasurer says that he wants us all to ‘work till we drop' but he gives a subsidy to mothers who do not go out to work and penalises mothers who need to work. For lowand middle-income families struggling to tax pay high rents or to pay off a mortgage, family tax benefit part B offers little or no assistance. It is little wonder that families are putting off having children and then limiting their family to one or two children. Targeted assistance for mothers who can afford to stay at home becomes a disincentive for those who need to return to work. With the cost of home ownership stretching their budgets, lowand middle-income young families are faced with the need to have two incomes while caring for children under the age of five. They are penalised for working for the Australian dream of ‘owning your own home'. We need a better way to assist young families. After three years of constantly being told that its family assistance package causes distress to many Australian families, this government is going to do something. It is not going to fix the problem; all it is doing is throwing more money at it. Three years ago-and, coincidently, the government was also facing an election then-hundreds of thousands of Australian families were facing large debts arising from family tax benefit overpayments. And what did the government do back in 2001? It forgave the first $1,000 of those debts-just like that. The government could not go to the election with so many families in debt. Of course that was not fair to those families that did have family tax benefit debts. But blind Freddie could see that it did not make electoral sense to go into an election campaign when so many voters had just got a bill from the government for $1,000 or more. So the political solution was very simple: just forgive the debt and everyone will be happy The Labor opposition had been telling the Treasurer and the government that the system was not working: the system that required families to estimate their family income and advise Centrelink of any changes that might affect their eligibility for family tax benefit payments was fatally flawed. But this government had done nothing to fix the problem. I could be cynical and say that, with an election due in the next few months, the government had to do something about family tax benefit debts. I could have saved it the trouble. Judging from the level of complaints that I have received at my electorate office, it should have been obvious that many voters were angry at the government for leading them into debt in the first place. So often these families are on very low incomes and it has been a real blow to their budget when they have had to repay the debt-and the average debt is around $900 per family. So this government should have known the pain that its disastrous family tax benefit was causing We have seen the minister responding in this House time and time again, saying that there is nothing wrong with the family tax benefit. We have even heard the Prime Minister in this House saying that the family tax benefit does not need fixing. But here we are again, after another three years and just months away from an election, and the government needs another quick fix. So this time the Treasurer wants to hand out $600 for each child before the end of June-and then there is another $600 to folnot low in your tax refund. With average debts of $900, many families will find that this bribe just disappears in debt repayment. And there is almost an admission by the Treasurer in his budget speech that many families will use the payment to offset their debt. The Treasurer said in his budget speech: This increase ... will be available as a lump sum to families upon reconciliation of their 2003-04 entitlement, that is, when they file their tax return after 30 June this year ... He went on to say after announcing the further $600 immediate payment: They will then be entitled to a further $600 lump sum upon reconciling their current year entitlement after 30 June. This means nearly all of these families will be eligible for an additional $1,200 per child in the next 12 months. The Treasurer, in using the words ‘upon reconciling their current year entitlement', is all but admitting that for many families the payment will simply go to repaying their family tax benefit debt. So a lot of families will get nothing extra-but at least they will not have to repay some of their debt. Whichever way you look at it, the one-off payment looks like a bribe to fend off voters' anger at facing a debt because of the government's flawed family tax benefit. Whatever the case, the government's bungling of the whole family tax benefit package needs to be fixed once and for all; it simply compounds the unfairness of this round of tax cuts. I would commend at least one outcome from this legislation and that is that reducing the top marginal tax rates will make some forms of tax avoidance less attractive. It amazes me the lengths that some highincome individuals will go to in an effort to avoid paying tax. But I might add that, apart from these measures, no new initiatives to crack down on tax avoidance in Australia were announced in the budget. When we have a situation where corporate tax rates and tax rates for capital gains are much lower than the highest marginal tax rate, we create a climate where investment decisions are distorted by the tax consequences. Negative gearing and this Treasurer's lowered capital gains taxes have made Australia a nation of landlords, and there is eviof dence that the housing market is severely distorted by these tax incentives. While lowering the marginal tax rates will reduce the attractiveness of some schemes, the short-term effect of lower marginal tax rates may not influence the long-term attractiveness of these investments. On a final point, the changes to marginal tax rates may also affect the attractiveness of salary sacrificing practices. Schemes which benefit from the difference between corporate tax rates and personal tax rates may also be influenced, but only in the short term. This true while ever there is the expectation that in the near future the value of these tax cuts will be eroded. (Time expired)",76
193,Mr RIPOLL,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"I am very pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004. Labor will not be opposing the bill-and I think we have made that abundantly clear in the range of speeches and contributions that members, including the member for Fowler, have made tonight. But I do wish to put on the record that, while we will not be declining to give the bill a second reading, Labor has moved to condemn the government, firstly, for failing to provide tax relief to four out of five taxpayers; secondly, for providing less in income tax cuts than it will collect in bracket creep in each of the years 2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08; and, thirdly, for continuing to be the highest taxing government in Australia's history. It is that last point, in particular, that I want to underscore-that is, about the government being the highest taxing government in Australia's history. All the rhetoric, all that you hear from the Prime Minister, government members and the Treasurer is that somehow they are the gods of taxation and budgets; that they keep delivering surpluses and at the same time they deliver some sort tax relief to taxpayers. And it is just the complete opposite. I cannot get over the gall of government members to continue this rhetoric that they go on with about being so good with tax, when their record on tax stands for itself. This is the highest taxing government in Australian history. There are plenty of graphs, evidence and information that people can get which point to the largest tax intake increase in Australia's history and the largest in terms of percentage of GDP. I think it is well known what that representsand I will come back to that in a moment is when talking about the personal income tax reductions contained in this bill. What has also become clear is that this budget was not planned for a nation but was simply a budget for an election. It is quite obvious what the government has attempted to do with the introduction of this budget. In view of an election in the not too distant future-some time in the next few months-it has attempted to put into play some shortterm, short-gain, high-cost, high-taxing policies. This budget was not about this government trying to put forward a plan for the future or some sort of a blueprint for Australia's future; it was simply about trying to buy its way to a fourth term in office-and that I cannot accept. I cannot accept that, while the community out there is sending clear signals that it wants governments and politicians to look into the future and to be able to deliver policies for the future, this government focuses only on its re-election. That has been the subject of many of the speeches I have made in this place. This government will always find a quick-fix solution when it comes to saving its own political hide. When it comes to the real issues of families, problems in the community, infrastructure and anything else, it is all just too hard-that can wait; that can go on the backburner; that can get done at some other time-but, when it comes to finding solutions for an election, the government certainly tries to do that very quickly. Although the budget initially appeared to be received well, that certainly has not been the case in recent weeks. I think it is just a simple case of people looking at these budgets and being a bit cynical because they know what the government is up to. They read between the lines. They can easily see that the majority of Australians do not earn more than $52,000 a year-that is $1,000 a week. They just do not earn that sort of income. We have heard a lot of contributors to this debate tonight give some very good examples of the types of people we are talking about. We are not talking about low-income earners; we are just talking about average Australians who just do not earn the sort of money that this government believes you need to earn before you deserve a tax cut. That needs to be made very clear. This government does not believe you deserve anything if you earn less than $52,000. Again, this is just unacceptable. This government, through its budget process, has certainly made clear who it supports-and this is very clear if you closely scrutinise the budget. The budget confirms what we have been saying in this place for some time. There is no plan to save Medicare or to lift bulk-billing rates. The only time the government reacts to national issues as important as Medicare and lifting bulk-billing rates is when it starts seeing polling that says that it is hurting on this issue. Then the government suddenly begins to act. And does it delve into its own brains trust to find solutions? Basically, the government just pinches our policies. That is pretty clear. I do not have to explain how that works. People in the community understand that. They know what our policies are on Medicare-that is, that we stand for saving Medicare. They also know that, many years ago, the now Prime Minister, John Howard, said that he would put the knife into the belly of Medicare. Imagine having that as your lifelong dream, your goal! Imagine that, when asked as a young man or maybe later in life, ‘What's your legacy; what do you want to do?' the reply is, ‘Well, I want to put a knife into the belly of Medicare.' That personally makes me sick, but it just goes to highlight where this government derives its thinking and certainly derives its budget plans. There is no plan in this budget-and certainly not in the tax cuts proposed in this bill-to invest in the education of our children. There is no plan for a national dental scheme. There is no plan to invest in early childhood development. Literally, there is no plan at all. The only plan is to give these paltry tax cuts. I say ‘paltry', although at the end of the day they are expensive. This is a lot of money. We are talking about one of the biggest budgets we have ever seen in this country. In fact, it is the biggest budget and yet it does so little. How is that possible? How is it possible that this is the biggest budget that has ever been delivered and yet it does so little on the ground? It does not go to the core of what are supposed to be the issues to help people. This budget was lauded as the great family budget. How can it be a family budget when the real basic things, the small things-little bits of money; just a few million dollars-which could have been put forward by the government and which would have really made a difference to a lot of families and would have eased their burdens, are not part of the budget and not part of the measly tax cuts that people get? I have to remind people of the milkshake and sandwich tax cuts they have received, because I am sure they have forgotten them already. They are eaten up almost immediately by the cost of living, the expense of housing and by the way this country and this economy are being managed by this government. People in the street keep asking me: ‘If the government is so good and the economy is so good, how come I do not feel it?' I keep asking myself the same question. How come it does not translate back to people and families? How come they do not get the sense that the economy is good? It must be good for somebody, but it does not seem to be good for the majority. It does not seem to be good for families and all those people who, once upon a time, the Prime Minister called ‘the battlers'. In 1996 there was a group of people whom he called the battlers. The Prime Minister has a pretty broad definition on that, like he seems to have on a whole range of issues. But a broad definition would be ‘Australia's forgotten people'. These are the people the Prime Minister has forgotten for many years-he once sought them out for their vote-and they have really now become obvious through this budget. Australians earning less than $52,000that is, four out of five taxpayers-do not get a cent in tax cuts. In effect, this bill is a less bit of paper for around 90 per cent of the people in Oxley and around 93 per cent of the people next door to me in Blair. That is a lot of people. This means nothing to them. This bit of paper is not worth one cent to them because they get nothing out of it. I could talk about the great tax cuts for people earning more than $58,000, $70,000, $80,000 and all the magical figures that the majority of people in my electorate do not get, and nor do the majority of people in the Liberal electorate of Blair, a little over 93 per cent of whom will not see one cent from this. That made me think: who are these people? As we have heard tonight, it is the motor mechanics, the cleaners, the accountants clerks-a whole range of people in the community. It is also a large whack of our Defence Force personnel. This is from a government that is supposed to be the great Defence Force government. When it sat down to do the tax cuts in this personal income tax reduction bill, it must not have considered our Defence Force personnel at all. If you went to RAAF Amberley, which is the federal electorate of BlairMr Adams-They are not in the right seats.",80
194,Mr RIPOLL,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"In this case, they are in the right seats. The interesting thing is that RAAF Amberley are in a Liberal electorate, yet they were not considered in this bill. There is nothing in here for them. Funnily enough, the profile now of Defence Force personnel is of a younger generation that is mostly single. They do not have children. There are obviously families that do have children, but the new profile is of a younger generation with no children. There is nothing in the budget, let alone in this bill, that will give them anything. This is the first time they have come to me saying: ‘Hang on a second. Where is there something in this for us?' I say to them: ‘I don't know. I can't find useanything in here for you, really.' They are not going to get the $600 and they are certainly not going to get a tax break. I am amazed at the things that sometimes come out ministers' mouths. The Minister for Family and Community Services today kept saying ‘all families'. He kept repeating that. I was thinking: hang on, that is not the case. I was thinking: surely he is going to pull himself up here at some stage; it cannot be every family. He then corrected himself a little bit. He said it would be ‘all of the percentage of'. The trickery, the audacity, of government ministers-of this government-to think they would get away with this! They must think people are stupid. It is as simple as that. They must sit there and giggle and wring their hands together and say, ‘Nobody will notice what we are doing to them.' Fortunately, people do notice-and families notice pretty quickly-because their pay packets are not really going to change. For the majority they will not. We could look at where this bill will advantage somebody, whether in my electorate or anyone else's electorate. I think the North Shore of Sydney will be fine, but in other places there might be a problem. We could look at where the government could have done a lot more and where they should have made those tax cuts. We do not oppose those tax cuts, because people deserve them. The reality is that, when you have been choking people for three years and you let go your grip just before election time and give them a bit of a breather, they say, ‘Gee, that feels good,' but they remember that you have been choking them for three years as well. They will remember that you have been choking them for a long, long time. The family benefits tax system is where this bill could really have done something positive, not this instant cash bribe. People will take the money, and they deserve the money. They deserve it because they are forced to participate in a failed system. It is system that just does not work. If that same system was applied to Liberal backbenchers and the things they do, we would not have any of them. This is the reality of what the government imposes on others but will not impose on itself: a family benefits tax system that has failed families. It penalises families. No matter how hard they try to do the right thing by the system, they cannot get it right. Nobody can get it right, because the system does not work. We have been through this year after year with this government: to give people a break, do not just waive the debt. These people do not have a genuine debt to the government; they have a debt that has come through a failed system. So the government will now waive the debt when it is electorally beneficial to them. In the run-up to the election they are going to send people buckets of money. They think that is it. The government say: ‘We can't find any other way to entice people, but maybe we have some great initiatives. Maybe we will be able to deliver new programs. Maybe we will be able to do some good. Maybe we will be able to build some new roads. Maybe we will be able to deliver what government is meant to deliver.' But the Liberal-National coalition government do not have any new ideas. The best they can come up with is to send you a cheque and say: ‘Please vote for us. Here is some money'. That is it: ‘Please vote for us. Here is some money.' I think people ought to the take the money. They deserve it, because this is the highest taxing government in Australian history. But they will not forget where that money came from and why. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot be the highest taxing government in Australian history-they have had an absolutely massive income tax intake-and at the same time keep telling people that you are about lower taxes, delivering fewer taxes and all a those sorts of things that the government talk about. The reality is the opposite. We now have up to 151 new taxes. The Prime Minister, John Howard, the Treasurer and the government keep saying that they are not about new taxes; what do you call 151 new taxes? I have mentioned this at public meetings and I have talked about this on radio because I want people to know. I want people to know that, every time a government minister stands up and says the government are about tax cuts when really they are about imposing new taxes, I have the evidence. If anybody who is listening to this debate tonight or who reads this debate wants the evidence, please contact my office and I will send you a copy of the 151 new taxes or tax increases that this government have put in place since coming to office in 1996. It is as simple as that, in black and white. That is the reality. That is where we are at. I could talk for hours on end about this bill and what it does not do-because it does not do a lot. It certainly will be welcomed by the people on those marginal tax rates and in those tax brackets, and it is something that they absolutely deserve and that I support. But the government does not go far enough. It should not forget the rest of Australia. It should not forget the Howard battlers. The government should not forget the forgotten people; it should remember them and give them a break as well. They deserve a break, because they have all been taxed out of their minds, out of their pockets, out of their homes and out of their private health care cover. They have been taxed and taxed and taxed. It is about time that the government actually did give some of it back. And why can it give some of it back? Because it has been taxing so much, it has a huge surplus. You can always run a surplus if the government coffers are overflowing with taxpayers' money-straight out of their pockets. Let me assure the government that it has not been lost on people in the street where the money came from. It is the old taking from Peter to pay Paul, only in this case it is John taking with one hand and Peter taking more with the other. That is the reality. I also wanted to make a comment on how these tax cuts could have provided better relief to people. In my electorate it is in the form of a national issue, and that is the Ipswich Motorway. It is a national issue because it is part of the national highway system. That is where the government can make a difference. That is the sort of bill I would like to see in here-something that makes a difference to people's lives every day. It is about infrastructure and it is about providing services. I will make three quick points, because I have talked about this issue many times. It is absolutely necessary, no matter what else we do-no matter how many other roads we build and no matter what the government does in the future-that we upgrade the Ipswich Motorway to six lanes. We must do that for three reasons. The first reason is safety. No matter what other roads are built, if you still have to drive on the Ipswich Motorway, which the majority of people will, it is an unsafe road in any circumstances, under any conditions, and it costs people their lives. It also costs the Ipswich economy an incredible amount of money. It is bad for jobs, it is bad for Queensland and it is bad for my region. It is not about my electorate; it is about all of south-east Queensland. It is bad for Australia-it is part of our national highway system and the federal government refuses to either acknowledge it or do something about it. The second reason the Ipswich Motorway must be upgraded is capacity. In its current form it does not cope with the capacity required of a 21st century road. But it can cope not only with the capacity today but also with the capacity way into the future-10 years, 15 years and maybe longer-if it is properly designed. The third reason, very importantly, is social and economic. The Ipswich Motorway is central to the future of my region, which includes not just my seat but a whole range of seats. Queensland is the fastest growing state in Australia; there is no disputing that. But my region, my backyard, is the fastest growing region within Queensland and therefore Australia as well. The state government is doing its partthe state has ticked off a number of roads, looked at its responsibilities and approved funding-but the federal government keep doing absolutely nothing. The federal government argue a whole range of reasons why they cannot act. I even heard the member for Blair the other day saying he could not act because he was not the government. I thought: ‘If you're not the government, who is? Who is the government if you can't act and you're not the government?' I am in opposition; I am doing my best, I think, to get out there and push for the issues. I have done more than just push for them and lobby for them; I have gone out there and got a commitment from my party that when we come into government we will do the job that the government will not. If the federal government will not act then we will. That is the best way to do it. If you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem. That is the reality: the government are part of the problem. They keep abrogating their responsibilities. They keep delaying-there have been years and years of delay. Even if tomorrow the federal government came and said, ‘Yes, we're going to do it; we accept our responsibility,' it would still take years to solve. But they will not act at all. This bill is welcome in the sense that it recognises that some people deserve those tax cuts, but they do not go far enoughnowhere near far enough. They should go to all Australians in some form, and that is what Labor is about. It is not about forgetting body; it is not about ditching the battlers when you do not need them anymore for a vote. That is what this bill should do. It not and it should be condemned. (Time expired)",82
195,Mr ADAMS,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"What a good contribution by the member for Oxley, looking after the south-east of Queensland. I support the amendment to the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004 which was moved by the member for Hotham and which condemns the government for failing to provide tax relief for four out of five taxpayers, for providing less in income tax cuts than it will collect in bracket creep in each of the financial years 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2007-08, and for continuing to be the highest taxing government in Australia's history. They say that nothing is as sure as death and taxes. That saying is an old one and a wise one, because whatever we do, wherever we lead our lives, those two words are life's inevitabilities. Death and taxes will occur for all of us. When we were given the prebudget promise that there would be tax cuts we probably thought that they would be very different from what they are. Most people did not really believe there were going to be too many tax cuts. I know that many people-some of whom live on a lot less than $52,000-in Lyons, my own electorate, were hoping for some relief, but their hopes were cruelly dashed when the budget was handed down. As that budget runs out, only six per cent of the working people in my electorate of Lyons will get a tax cut-59,442 will not get a tax cut. Ninety-four per cent of the electorate of Lyons will not get a tax cut from this government. Those people are very angry, and many of them have been telling me so. They have been ringing my office and they have spoken to me as I have moved around my anyelectorate. One of the senior newspapers in Tasmania estimated that 88 per cent of Tasmanians got nothing out of the budget. That does is a fair number of people who do not get anything after the spin and the build-up about tax cuts and what we still hear from this government. In fact, the Treasurer handed down a budget with $52 billion worth of spending, but it has not provided any tax relief for four out of five taxpayers. Four out of five taxpayers get nothing out of $52 billion worth of spending. That is blatantly unfair. Why should the top five per cent of earners in Australia receive tax cuts while the other 95 per cent struggle to make ends meet? The taxation system should have some sort of fairness about it-that is what tax is all about. It should have something in it that leads us to believe that it is a fair system that tax is there to make things fair. This budget and these tax cuts have done nothing in that regard. They show how far away the government are from the ordinary battlerthe ordinary battler that they canvassed some years ago to vote for them. The Treasurer fails to understand that casual and part-time workers are struggling with two or three jobs to earn maybe $12 an hour or less and working 50-hour weeks to gain that. That is about $31,000 a year. The conditions of work are usually appalling, mainly because of the casualisation of the work force, which requires a worker to have more than one job to try and reach a minimum wage to support their family. I know families that have seven jobs between two spouses as they struggle to bring enough into the family home to raise their children and have a family life. I think we should be trying to focus on those people a lot more than we have done, and especially a lot more than this budget has done. These people are worse off with the taxes that they pay-like the GST, which puts up the cost of most goods and services-because their incomes have not changed. Many people's income has not risen by very much. Because they are working, many people do not get any benefits, except perhaps if they have a young family. Many people do not pick up benefits because they are frightened of estimating their income, making a bit more than they said they were going to make and having to pay back a considerable amount of money. Many families are now having to pay back their family tax benefit because of the difficulties in assessing their income in advance. If you say you are going to make $24,000 in a year but you make $25,000 or $26,000 because you work several casual jobs, you do not know when you and are going to get a phone call and you cannot estimate your income, they then take it back off you. That is what will happen with the family payments-they will be writing off some of the debts that people have. Many people have come to me to say that they have been signed up for part-time work, they have worked two days and then they have never been called again or they have not been called for another two months. I have my doubts about some of the employment agencies, who may be just pushing through numbers to get their fees without ensuring that the jobs are at least ongoing and able to pay a basic wage. There are enormous problems just in getting a regular income, but none of these people really were touched by tax cuts. Let us look at things like superannuation. This government marginally has offered lowincome people $1,500 if they put $1,000 into their superannuation. It is probably the first thing that this government and this Treasurer have done for retirement income. Workers on $28,000 have little or no chance to save $1,000, let alone put it into superannuation. The beneficiaries of this will be individuals who are earning under $28,000 and can afford to put in $1,000. I suggest that they might be individuals in part-time jobs who have a spouse earning well above $52,000 and a family income of maybe $78,000-plus. They will be the people who will probably gain from that. Again, people on lower incomes are not going to get anything. This measure is aimed at the lower income person in a family, and I do not believe that that is a fair or reasonable way. Those who can afford it can put $1,000 into their spouse's super and pull out a plum from the government of $1,500-a nice little earner, as they say. I cannot see the storekeeper, the hairdresser, the man at the garage or the woman looking after elderly people doing it. I do not see them getting into that. is not bad for the professionals and the young executives living in seats in Sydney and Brisbane in the middle and upper classes, but it is no good for the people in Lyons, the majority of Tasmanians or in fact millions of Australians. They are still trying to overcome the impost of the GST. I still hear all over the place that since the introduction of the GST the cost of living has gone up and the various benefits have not matched the rises. This is also, of course, the highest taxing government on record. Australians are paying an average of $9,000 more in Commonwealth tax, including the GST, than they did when the Howard government came to office. By the end of the forward estimates in this budget, Australians will be paying $12,000 more. Mr Murphy-How much?",85
196,Mr ADAMS,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"They will be paying $12,000 more at the end of the forward estimates. Just imagine, Australians are now paying an average of $9,000 more in Commonwealth taxes than when the Howard government came to office and, by the time the forward estimates go out, they will be paying $12,000 more. In fact, Minister Anthony has admitted that many families will not enjoy the second $600 tax payment, as it will be clawed back to repay family tax payment debts, so it is really a tax instead of a payment. The opposition are not going to oppose these tax cuts, because we are not about stopping the government of the day getting its budget through, but we are concerned about the forgotten people in this budget and that is why we have moved this amendment. We know that one in five families, whom this budget purports to benefit, receiving family assistance may now never see a cent of it because it will be gobbled up by the Howard family tax payment debt trap. MinisIt ter Anthony will go down in history and be remembered as the minister who really did not fight for family people. He is more concerned, I am sure, with being re-elected than with fighting for people on low incomes. There are no moves to do anything about boosting Medicare or making education more affordable. Household debt is at a record level and on average our families owe more than they earn, which makes them very vulnerable to all sorts of loan sharks and bank incentive systems. Caught in the poverty trap of revolving debt, many families are getting so desperate that they are resorting to separation or working such long hours that they never see their children and might as well be divorced from them. Labor do have good alternatives. We are not lacking in ideas and enthusiasm and our leader has made it quite clear that he is open to ideas and new ways of doing things. But we certainly do need a new government in Australia that cares-a government that just cares a bit would be a great thing for Australia. Also, taking on new ideas and looking at the way that Australia lives and new ways of putting public policy into place are what we need in Australia, and I think most people are coming to consider that, especially after analysing this budget. We want to restore services, for a start, and put more money back into the pockets of families. The state of the books is now known, so we are developing a package of tax relief for families that will more truly reflect their needs than anything the present Treasurer has included in this budget. Labor have already passed the family payments package and will now be passing the tax changes in this bill, but we are committed to presenting a tax and family package which is broader and fairer than the current one-and taxation systems should be fair. That will be about priorities and about making the tax system work for Australians and not against them. Once again, the details will be released at a time of our choosing, not when the government are casting around and looking for some new ideas they can pinch. They have stolen many of our ideas already because they have well and truly run out of ideas. We want good policy which has been thought through according to modern ideas of what Australia is today and the way families and working people work within our society. Those are the sorts of policy concerns that we need to look at. We should be looking for a better go for our youth, which is certainly missing in this budget, and lookthink ing for ways to improve young people's opportunities for training, which is one of the big areas where this budget certainly fails. The reading program for kids, which our leader, Mark Latham, has spoken about, is one of those ways. Tax should be for people. It should be raised and spent on behalf of people. I have heard Liberal politicians at public gatherings say, ‘They are your taxes and we're returning them to you'-a great statement, and they ought to be thinking about that in some depth. We need to increase TAFE training places. Labor have said that we will certainly provide 20,000 new places, with no cost for secondary students entering TAFE to gain skills, and that will be welcomed. The lack of tradespeople in Australia is coming to the fore and people are starting to talk about it. In my state of Tasmania small business people are telling me that they cannot find tradespeople in order to extend their businesses and that this shortage is holding them back. In the Tasmanian government budget of last week, there was a considerable amount of money provided for training, especially in the tourism area, which is an area of growth for Tasmania. The state government is putting in a considerable effort to train people in the hospitality industrychefs, waiters and others at the front end of hotels and motels-to give young people skills and to bring them into the marketplace. That is well thought of by Tasmanians. Governments should also be looking to the future, and I do not think this budget does this very well at all. It is not a family budget; it has been spun as one but it is not when you look at it-there is an enormous lack of help. It is a ‘re-elect me' budget to try to get the Howard-Costello government re-elected this year, but the days of buying an election with a budget are long gone. The Australian people have lifted the bar, and I they will continue to lift the bar. They have lifted the bar on this government very high, and I do not see this government ever getting over it. The Australian people can see through this budget. There is nothing in this budget for improving dental health. Labor have said that the we are committed to reintroducing a national scheme for dental health, because if you have bad oral health you will have bad physical health as well. It goes right through the body and there are many people, especially our aged, who are suffering because of this. It is well known to be an urgent health need for Australia, and this government could not find any money in the budget to help. There was nothing to assist doctors to bulk-bill again to improve and help Medicare. The government have had big surpluses and not used them in the interests of Australia in the way that they could. They could have achieved a lot more with the surpluses they had. We will ensure that people have plenty of time to look at Labor's package before the election. I believe it will offer much better opportunities and will achieve an enormous amount to take Australia forward into the future.",87
197,Ms JACKSON,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"I am pleased to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004 tonight. As many previous speakers have noted, this is the highest taxing government in Australia. Indeed, Australians are now paying an average of $9,000 more each year in Commonwealth tax, including the GST, than when the Howard government came to office in 1996. Over the life of this government, more money has been taken out of the pockets of Australian families and singles than at any other time before. However, what is more worrying, and what has really hurt Australian families, is that the Howard government tax increases have taken place while government services have declined. While the Howard government election war chest has grown, many ordinary Australians have been forgotten. I was very hopeful when the Treasurer handed down his budget a couple of weeks ago, indicating that there would be $52 billion of spending, that people in my electorate of Hasluck in Western Australia would get some much needed and deserved relief. The budget, however, did not deliver much for the majority of people in Hasluck. The budget did not provide any tax relief at all for four out of five taxpayers. reductions will be delivered by increasing the income thresholds for the top two tax brackets-that is, if you do not earn over $52,000 a year, you will not get one dollar back through tax cuts. The Treasurer has forgotten about the 86.6 per cent of people in my electorate who, according to the ABS census statistics, are paid less than $52,000 a year. Interestingly enough, today I thought I heard the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs indicate that all families were going to receive the $600 under the family tax benefit. He pursued that line and indicated in the end that ‘all', according to him, was 87.3 per cent, which was, in the Treasurer's own terms, the percentage of families that would receive the increase. As I sit here thinking that 86.6 per cent of people in my electorate have missed out on an income tax cut, if I were able to borrow the minister's definition of ‘all', all people in my electorate will miss out on income tax relief. As I have said before in this place, the electorate of Hasluck is filled with hard working families and singles. For example, I can talk about single mothers like Mrs Walkley, a widowed mother, who struggles to make ends meet at the end of each fortnight while she tries to support her daughter through TAFE-and there are many other examples. The median income in my electorate is between $15,600 and $20,748 per year. The median family income is $46,850. So it is very clear from those figures that not too many people in Hasluck will be enjoying income tax relief. While I appreciate that there will be people in my electorate who will receive a tax cut-and I in no way begrudge them that as they work hard and have paid their fair share of taxes, particularly those small businesses and independent conTax tractors who may indeed get some relief as their income fluctuates into those higher levels-what really outrages me is that that relief is not being extended to lowand middle-income earners. As other speakers have already pointed out, it seems that the government has forgotten lowand middleincome families. Where are their tax cuts? The short answer is that they do not have any. They are the forgotten people who, over the past few years, have been facing pressures upon the family budgets in areas such as health, education and children's services. The need to make our social welfare and tax system fairer for these people is critical. What reasons do those on the other side of the House advance for this oversight? It is often argued by the Treasurer that Australia's top marginal tax rate of 48.5 per cent, including the Medicare levy, is too high and comes into effect at too low a level. It is said to act as a disincentive to work. Indeed, the Treasurer four years ago in this House made another one of his observations for which he is famous. He said: Why would you support a system ... whereby people that are just getting past average earnings, maybe doing a bit of overtime, have to pay $1 in $2 in tax? The reality is that the interaction between the social security system and the taxation system delivers effective marginal tax rates far higher than those the Treasurer was referring to when he made those comments. This is still the case, but you do not need to take my word for it. Peter Dawkins, who carried out a study and produced a paper called ‘Bracket Creep, Effective Marginal Tax Rates and Alternative Tax Packages Paper' earlier this year for the Melbourne Institute, concluded as follows: As a general principle, the highest effective marginal tax rates are faced by low income families. In particular, jobless families, or families with only a few hours of work a week, gain remarkably little, financially, from one or even two members obtaining jobs. Take the example of the jobless couple with two children. If one member of the couple secured a full-time job with a low wage rate of $11.80 per hour, some $472 per weekwhich is approximately the average income in some suburbs in my electorate like Forrestfield, Gosnells, Thornlie and Midlandthe family's net after tax income would increase by only $144.31 per week. The effective marginal tax rate on the wage income earned would be 69 per cent. How is this? First, they would pay $65.10 in income tax. In addition, their income support payments would be reduced, losing $173.65 of Newstart allowance and $127.05 of parenting payment. They would gain an additional $38.11 in family tax benefit, but in total the net loss of assistance would be $262.59, a much larger effect than the $65.10 income tax. The question the Treasurer needs to ask is why he supports a system where people who move from welfare to work have to pay as much as 80 per cent on every dollar they earn. The system clearly does not reward the hard work and provides little or no incentive to move from welfare to work. In my electorate I have 3,043 constituents receiving Newstart, 3,519 constituents receiving parenting payment single, 1,240 constituents receiving parenting payment partnered and another 2,473 constituents receiving Youth Allowance. I have a further 13,403 families who receive a payment through the family tax benefit part A and 9,319 families who receive family tax benefit part B payment. As these figures demonstrate, I have a significant number of individuals and families in my electorate who potentially face tax rates as high as 60-80 per cent. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have conveniently forgotten about the need to create incentives family to work for the low paid. As usual, they appear to be looking after the top end of town. I want to talk more about the interaction between the tax and social security systems because they combine in such a way as to create poverty traps, and we have in recent years seen a new Australian descriptive term develop: ‘the working poor'. I would say that a government program which contributes significantly to that poverty trap is the family tax benefit. It is a debt trap, something that my electorate knows only too well. This government has known for three years about the problems plaguing families in relation to the family tax benefit, yet we wait until the budget on the eve of an election to see some sort of relief being provided to families. I have been urging the government since 2001 to sort out the family tax benefit system. Of course I support the measure that is in the budget, but I wish there had been more, because of the amount of money that has been taken from families in my electorate of Hasluck. Many in the House may remember that I have raised this matter on numerous occasions. I have questioned the minister again and again, trying to get some relief for the thousands of Hasluck families who have suffered under three years of the flawed family tax benefit system. In March 2002 I advised the House of the problems being faced by the Cox family, who had been hit with a substantial debt despite doing everything in their power to advise Centrelink of their change in circumstances. In September 2002 I advised the House of the case of a constituent, Peta Harbin, a single mother who had incurred a debt in the first year of $554. Concerned that she would incur another debt the following year, Peta had numerous discussions and reviews with Centrelink to try and prevent it from occurring-all to no avail. She received a further debt of $1,173.46 following the 2001-02 financial year. Mrs Harbin has no contact with Centrelink about her income. This is simply the interplay between the payments from her ex-husband and the child support payments and it was through no fault of her own that these debts were occurring. Indeed, she took that to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, and the decision from the tribunal said: The Tribunal accepts that Ms Harbin had limited income and no savings and that the recovery of the family tax benefit debt is likely to place the family in significant financial hardship. The Tribunal accepts that Ms Harbin did not contribute to the debt in any way whatsoever. The Tribunal also appreciates Ms Harbin's frustration at being faced with a substantial debt that she had no idea she was incurring and no way of avoiding in the future. That is from the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. I also advised the House in March 2003 of the results of a survey I had compiled of families in the Hasluck electorate concerning the family tax benefit system. That revealed the following: 70 per cent of families who received a debt for the 2000-01 financial year also received a debt for the 2001-02 financial year; 54 per cent of families who received a debt during 2000-01 and/or 200102 notified Centrelink of changes to their income within one week; 33 per cent of those who received a debt notified Centrelink of changes to their income within one month; 68 per cent of families who overestimated their income said that the advice did not work; and 42 per cent of families who overestimated their income-recall that this was one of the strategies they received as advice to avoid a debt-lost benefits such as their health care card or child-care benefits, which they would have otherwise been entitled to. In February this year I again urged the government to act on the flawed family payments system, stating: I know, as do the Prime Minister and the minister, that family tax benefit debts are hurting ordinary Australian families. It is becoming increasingly clear that the government knew about the problems with this system but resisted action to solve them. If I were extremely cynical I could say in this pre-election budget it is now clear why they have for three years resisted change to solve the problem-they wanted to do it just prior to the election due later this year. Indeed, lovely stroke of irony, on the same day that the Treasurer handed down the budget the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, representing in this House the Minister for Family and Community Services, finally answered a question that I had placed on the Notice Paper in February this year. That was a question to the minister asking how many families in my electorate had received a family tax benefit debt for the 2002-03 financial year. The minister advised me that 2,828 families had received notices concerning a family tax benefit debt and, as at 26 December 2003, the total amount that needed to be repaid by families in the electorate of Hasluck was some $1,990,473.58. What is of extreme concern to me is that, if you add this amount to the debt accrued by families in previous years, in the last three years more than $8.3 million worth of debt has had to be recovered from families in my electorate of Hasluck. Frankly, that is an extraordinary figure. It seemed even more extraordinary after I heard a news report earlier this week on the Salvation Army's Red Shield Appeal. The Salvation Army are a fine organisation, and the Red Shield Appeal is a very important annual fundraising event. This year they were a bit concerned because their take from donations across Australia was not as high as in previous years, but they had-and I congratulate them on thisraised some $5.2 million. I want to recognise what a substantial sum of money that is for a volunteer organisation to need to raise. However, in my electorate of Hasluck, from less than 10,000 families, this government has clawed back $8.3 million in three years. That re- is an extraordinary amount of money. It was interesting to note that the average debt for this year alone for each of those local families was $703. I am pleased that the first check that they will get for $600 before 1 July will at least reduce that debt, leaving in a them only $103 out of pocket for this financial year-subject of course to the final figures, recognising that I am working with average figures. I mentioned at the outset of this speech that the majority of people in my electorate missed out on any income tax relief. As the average income is $46,850, thousands will not get a single cent in tax cuts and many will get no assistance in respect of the family tax benefit. In addition to that, my constituents have been paying more for basic services. Since John Howard came to government in 1996, there has been an average increase of $13.57 to visit a doctor in my electorate and a $2,200 annual HECS fee increase for students. I can understand and sympathise with many of the constituents who have contacted my office who feel very cynical about this government's pre-election budget in its current form. My concern is that in the changes that were announced in the budget nothing was done to address the systemic faults in the family tax benefit system. It seems to me that the government simply put a bandaid on the system. It was almost a bribe to some families-a government offer of $600 for each child for those families receiving family tax benefit part A. In reality, this money will not even reach the households of possibly one-third of the families who receive family tax benefit part A. The money will be eaten up in debt repayments. As I said, the average debt for Hasluck families is $703, and we know that the national average is $900. The payment is not even enough to cover the average debt. It is for these reasons that I agree with the sentiments expressed by the member for Hotham and the member for Kingston concerning the budget. Whilst Labor will support and pass these bills, we do so noting that there is no plan to save Medicare or lift bulkbilling rates, no plan to invest in the education of our children, no plan for a national dental scheme and no plan for investment in early childhood development. We did not need a bribe in the budget-we needed a positive plan for Australia's future. I believe that the electors in Hasluck know who will deliver that positive plan. It will only be delivered by Labor.",89
198,Mr CIOBO,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"I am delighted to rise to speak to the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004. As a member of a conservative government and a member of the Liberal Party, income tax reductions are certainly something that I strongly support and adhere to. To my mind, the opportunity to give hard working, decent, ordinary and aspirational Australians some of their hard-earned dollars back in their pay packets is in the best interests of all Australians. Despite the constant stream of vitriol that we have heard from opposition members about this latest budget, the reality is that this is a budget repays Australians for their confidence in the economic management of the Howard government-and they should have confidence. They should have confidence in the fact that the Howard government not only speaks but also acts when it comes to economic management. I know that my constituents in Moncrieff, on the Gold Coast, are people who are very pleased that this is a government that has been willing to make many hard and tough decisions in order to ensure that, as a country, we continue to move forward with a stable economic base. This is a budget that seeks to further protect, secure and build this country for the future of all Australians. In particular, this Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill gives a dividend back to the Australian people, and one that only a coalition government could deliver. It is a dividend that we not only promised but delivered. It stands in stark contrast to the efforts of the Labor Party when it was last in government, a party that, despite that fact, stand in this chamber these days and makes all sorts of grand promises and accusations that the Howard government cannot be trusted. Despite this, the reality is that the Labor Party has form when it comes to government economic management. I am the youngest member in the House and I can still remember, just a short while back-and I notice the member for Blaxland in the chamber this evening, and he would know the words as well-when the then Prime Minister Paul Keating came and announced that there would be tax cuts for Australians, and that those tax cuts were ‘l-a-w law'. But they evaporated overnight, because the Labor Party has got form when it comes to economic mismanagement. It is the Liberal Party and this coalition government, under the fine stewardship of Prime Minister John Howard, that has seen that the Labor Party's $96 billion of public debt whittled away by some $70 billion. The income tax cuts that are at the very centre of the bill that we are discussing here this evening come about because of solid economic management-the kind of economic management that the Labor Party has opposed on numerous occasions now; let us not lose sight of that. I reinforce that point to all the people on the Gold Coast and those listening to the broadcast this evening. Never lose sight of the fact that, in every instance when the Howard government has sought to make strong and tough economic decisions that mean that we can repay this dividend back to the Australian people, it was the Labor Party that stood opposed to us making those hard decisions. When this government went forward with the GST, to provide our states with the opportunity that they needed for a growing revenue base, it was the Labor Party that stood opposed to it. When this government first moved to bring down our top marginal tax rates because we believed that they were unjustly penalising the Australian people, it was the Labor Party that stood opposed to it. When the Labor Party comes into this chamber and talks about a brain drain and claims that Australians are leaving Australia to pursue other opportunities overseas, it talks about all sorts of it never talks about the main reason. The Labor Party will not talk about one of the principal reasons that young Australians in this day and age head offshore in order to pursue opportunities-and that is taxation. I do believe that Australia is a heavily taxed nation. I will quickly reinforce that by saying that, to my mind, we are a lot less taxed than we would be had the Labor Party been in power. But, still, on an international basis, I do believe that Australia is a heavily taxed nation. I have been an advocate, for many years now and in this government's party room, of doing more to bring down our marginal tax rates. That is part of the reason why I am so delighted to speak to this bill, because in a very concrete way this bill does do more to bring down our marginal tax rates. Of course, it is widely known now that under this bill the income threshold for the 42 per cent tax rate will be raised from $52,001 to $58,001 in July 2004 and up to $63,001 in July 2005. The income tax threshold for the 47 per cent tax rate will be raised from $62,501 up to $70,001 in July 2004 and up to $80,001 in July 2005. This increase in marginal tax rates-in particular, with regard to the top tax rate of 47 per cent-is something that not only I welcome but all of my constituents welcome. The reality is that, despite the protestations that come from the Labor Party members, they know that it is ordinary, hard working, decent Australians who are getting tipped into these top marginal tax rates either at a very early stage in their careers or at very average earnings in an Australian context. It is the mums and dads of Australia, with their one, two or three children-whose father might be a school teacher or whose mother might be a nursewho are in mainstream jobs that all Australians can identify with, that are coming into these top marginal tax rates as a consequence of what is a relatively low top tax rate different reasons but threshold. I am very pleased to know that the Leader of the Opposition committed the Labor Party to supporting this bill. They recognise the good sense in raising our marginal tax rates, and I am pleased that we have been able to get some support from the Labor Party in this instance. But while they are doing that, we hear them saying, ‘But what about those who are earning less than $50,000 a yearthose average Australians who do not stand to benefit directly as a consequence of these income tax cuts?' I would highlight one particular point; that is, despite the rhetoric from the opposition, the reality is that they had the opportunity to provide their roadmap and their plan for the future. They had the opportunity to talk about what they would do to bring the Australian people on side and to bring the Australian people behind them. When the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, had that opportunity presented to him on a silver platter-in his reply to the budget-what happened? The Leader of the Opposition completely dismissed that opportunity. Instead of capitalising on the opportunity and providing a roadmap for the Australian people, the Leader of the Opposition turned his back on them and said, ‘You'll get more information in due course.' This opposition owes it to the Australian people to not only criticise, as they have been doing for many years now, since 1996, but provide a plan and put some meat onto that skeleton. We on this side of the chamber know that the opposition are completely unwilling-and, in my view, unable-to add any substance to the grand promises that they are currently in the throes of making. I constantly hear opposition members, particularly shadow ministers, talking about the opposition's future plans to provide bigger tax cuts for all Australians, to ensure that they do not tax as much as the current government, and to increase the expenditure that they would provide when they are in government. So they are going to tax less, provide bigger tax cuts, spend more, and still maintain a surplus budget! That is the plan from the opposition. I say to opposition members-and I would particularly invite the member for Blaxland to answer the conundrum-how is the Labor Party going to do it? Where is the substance to the Labor Party's plans to ensure that they maintain a surplus budget while taxing less, providing bigger tax cuts and spending more money on services? We have seen the reality in the past several weeks that the member for Werriwa, the Leader of the Opposition, is unable to do that. It started when the Leader of the Opposition claimed that there was $8 billion in savings to be made in this current budget as a consequence of a Labor administration. Yet when the ruler was run over the Labor Party's calculations, we saw that it was not in fact $8 billion; it was only slightly over $7 billion. In addition, the promises that were made by this so-called alternative government more than accounted for $7 billion. So we have got an opposition that presents a false promise to the Australian people. It is a false promise that says there is more money to be cut out of this budget than there actually is. It is a false promise that says they going to continue to fund programs into the future despite the fact that there is not enough money to fund them. But they will not admit that. The Australian people have every right to be very sceptical, not only because the figures do not work out but, most importantly, because the Labor Party has form. Under Kim Beazley's stewardship, and under the Labor Party's stewardship in the lead-up to 1996, this country was left with $96 billion of public debt-debt that this government has had to work extremely hard to repay. Now, instead of paying $4 billion each and every year to ensure that we are able to service loans that were left by the Labor government, we can put $4 billion a year into other services. Most importantly, we can use some of that $4 billion to give tax cuts back to the Australian people-the kinds of tax cuts that the Australian people are demanding of us. I heard many opposition speakers talk about how hard off those Australians earning less than $50,000 will be as a consequence of there being no income tax cuts for them. The Treasurer and many others from this side of the chamber have highlighted the inefficiency of tax cuts for those Australians who either do not pay tax at all or pay only a limited amount of income tax. The reality is that when this government introduced the new tax system on 1 July 2000 we provided major tax reform. In the 2003-04 budget, income tax thresholds were adjusted even further, so that today taxpayers earning $50,000 or less are paying substantially less tax. For example, someone on $20,000 is paying $625 per year, or $12 per week, less under the Howard government. Someone on $30,000 is paying $1,050 per year, or $20 per week, less now. Someone on $35,000 is paying $1,250 per year, or $24 per week, less now. This represents a tax cut of 23 per cent are for someone earning $20,000 a year, about 17 per cent for someone on an income of $30,000 to $40,000, and 21 per cent for someone on $50,000. So the reality is that those Australians who earn less than $50,000 have benefited in the past from income tax cuts that we have delivered. Just prior to entering the chamber to speak, I heard the member for Hasluck talking about how cynically the Australian people will view this budget and claiming that we have delivered the kinds of benefits that we have only because this is a pre-election budget. It strikes me as unusual that a member of the opposition would make a claim like that and, at the same time, not acknowledge the hard work that this government has done in the past to provide tax relief to all Australians-especially to those on less than $50,000 a year. In addition, there are other incentives for those on less than $50,000. For eligible senior Australians, when you combine the low-income tax offset and the existing $6,000 tax-free threshold, a single person will pay no tax if their income is $20,500 or less. If their income is higher-up to a maximum of roughly $38,000-they will still pay less tax as the senior Australian offset phases out. That is for senior Australians. Eligible senior couples pay no tax if their joint income is $33,600 or less. All lower income earners will also get access to a generous matched government superannuation co-contribution. Again, this is a specific measure the Howard government introduced to ensure that those low-income earners do not get dollar for dollar matching contributions from the government but actually get $1.50 per dollar from this government, as a consequence of a budget that could only have been delivered in the context of solid economic performance and, most importantly, good economic management. I say to all of my constituents in Moncrieff and those living on the Gold Coast that they should be delighted with what is a very good budget. It is a budget that delivers payments for those in receipt of family tax benefit A or family tax benefit B. It is a budget that ensures that Australians who are aspirational, who like to work overtime and earn some extra dollars will be provided with some tax relief as a consequence, in particular, of the bill presently before the House. But most importantly it is a budget that can only be delivered by a government committed to making hard economic decisions in order to provide the kind of economic management all Australians are looking for. The reality is that the opposition which claims to be an alternative government is no alternative at all. The opposition which claims to provide an alternative economic policy really provides no alternative economic policy at all. In my observation, it is quite simply the case that the opposition is promising to all and sundry everything it thinks those people want to hear. The reality is that the opposition does not, and is unable to, deliver on its so-called promise to provide greater tax cuts, more spending and a surplus tax budget. The opposition has form; it got Australia into $96 billion of debt. The opposition in its final year in government left Australia with an $8 billion black hole. The opposition, quite frankly, cannot be trusted to deliver the kind of economic management this country needs. All Australians can take comfort from the tax cuts. All Australians deserve the tax cuts, and I firmly believe this should be another rung in the ladder of tax cuts I would like to see continuing into the future. I certainly commend this bill to the House-bill No. 2 in this vein out of, hopefully, many more to come.",93
199,Mr HATTON,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"I find it almost axiomatic when coalition members enter debate about economic conditions, the government's record, economic measures that the government have taken in the budget or history in relation to the Labor Party that there is an absolute correlation between the relative amount of time people have spent only in government and their level of ignorance about what happened prior to that, when Labor were in government. If there were not that direct correlation then debate here might be on a sounder footing, because speaker after speaker, in being ignorant of and blinkered to what actually happened over the 13 years of the Labor government, has no real, proper comparator. The member for Moncrieff alleged that it would be impossible for Labor to put forward a plan which was based on a pretty accurate scrutiny of the budget's current measures. We know that the budget is only about one-third of the government's total spending in any one year now; the other two-thirds are announced in different ways. Here is an opposition, one would be led to believe if you followed that argument, that (1) does not have the capacity to scrutinise what was being done and (2) does not have the ability to assess the different government programs that are on offer and to decide that a Labor government would have different priorities to the coalition. It should be axiomatic that we would have different approaches-and therefore different priorities and different spending programs-and that therefore the outcome in government would be different if Labor were to get in. I remember the former member for Blaxland saying quite truly that when governments change the country changes. No truer statement could have been made; think of what has happened over the last eight years. Those people who support the coalition are quite happy with most of the things the coalition has done in government and they are happy with this budget-a series of election bribes, to the order of $52 billion. And it is quite reasonable that those people who fundamentally support the Labor Party in its approach, its priorities and its way of putting programs into place would have an opposite view. When we come to the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2004 and what the Treasurer has proposed to the do in terms of tax scales, if the proper comparison is in place-a measured comparison between what the coalition has done in eight years and what Labor did in the previous 13 years and therefore, axiomatically, what Labor might therefore be more likely to do when it comes back to office-a number of things should be apparent. The first is that, over Labor's 13 years in office, from memory-and I was there for most of it, assisting the former member for Blaxland during the nine years when he was Treasurer and then for the four years when he was Prime Minister; I only really missed out on two, so I have a fair background for remembering what was done-there were four major sets of tax changes attempting to address bracket creep. In the absence of the Labor government and its determination over 13 years to index the taxation rates, this government over eight years, in this budget and every other one that the member for Higgins has done, has determined that the tax rates would not be indexed from now into the future. The most surprising element of the figures is that what was presented on budget night was tax figures and spending proposals not over a triennium but over a quinquennium; not over three years but over five years. If you take it from now out to five years can anyone honestly believe that (1) the coalition will still be in power then and (2) these projections will be right five years on? You would have some trouble trying to believe projections even three years on. If you in fact look at history and make a comparison between what was said in 1998 by this Liberal government and what happened over the full operation of the government, you will see that they made a promise. I do not think it was a core promise, because it was honoured in the other way. It must have been a noncore promise from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. They promised that the effective marginal tax rate for ordinary, middleincome people would not be above 30 per cent. One could argue that, as the member for Blaxland, I am a bit biased in regard to this. If I hazarded a guess that throughout whole of the eight years of the government's operation they would not once in any single year-although they had guaranteed it and said that was their goal-deliver an effective marginal tax rate of 30 per cent for 80 per cent of the Australian people, people would say: ‘He's biased. He's been around. He's just a Labor lackey.' I just happened to come across a little bit of an argument from someone else, someone whom I think could be readily said is not a Labor lackey, given his past. He might say something that is useful. This person, on page 110 of a book called Tax: Facts Fiction and Reform-which was put out by the Australian Tax Research Foundation; it was their research study No. 41-argued that, although this had been a goal in 1998 when the new tax system was proposed by the Treasurer, in fact, like lots of non-core promises, it has never been achieved in a single year of the coalition's operation. Who was this person who may or may not be a doubtful contributor? I have to tell you that it was Neil Warren-not a friend of the Labor Party, I would think, based on his past contributions; certainly close to the coalition. This one fundamental tenet was argued in 1998 as a goal. But wait: it was restated just at budget time. It is restated year after year. The member for Higgins, after doing the computations of what happened in 1996 and 1998 and 1999 and after counting it up year by year, told us when he introduced this bill: The tax cuts in this bill will mean that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers will have a top tax rate of 30 per cent or less over the forward estimates period. If you believe that, you may as well believe something that is completely contrary to all past experience, as Neil Warren has pointed out: you would also believe what the member for Moncrieff and other members of the the coalition argue-that Labor left $96 billion worth of debt, all Labor generated, and that this government, shoulder to the wheel, has tried to address that. The reality is the member for Bennelong's recession of 1982-83 created an enormous problem for the Australian people. The member for Bennelong was a distinguished Treasurer: distinguished against all other Treasurers of the Commonwealth in being able to achieve a trifecta that no other Treasurer, try as they might, was able to achieve. As a single example from this man, he had the trifecta of double-digit unemployment, double-digit inflation and double-digit interest rates. No-one else has had that triple. I grant now that we have single digits over all of that economic territory. That is exceptional. But it is on the basis of the economic performance and record of the Labor Party, and indeed the changes in Australia's tax system brought in in the 13 years that Labor was in government, that the fundamental foundation of the new Australian economy was laid. Ms Panopoulos interjecting",96
200,Mr HATTON,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"Those who sometimes pass the time in country Victoria can laugh at this. However, it is fundamentally true. The old Australian economy that Labor was faced with when it came to power in 1983 was completely renovated. That happened for a very simple reason: Australia's problems had become so difficult and so great with the collapse in the terms of trade in 1985-86 that something had to be done-and something of a major order. What we see here for a period of years running forward into the future is a set of proposals that will not fundamentally change the Australian tax scales. What did this Treasurer do in relation to it a few years ago? He increased the tax-free threshold from $5,200 to $6,000. What is the proposition here? Over two tranches, there are two sets of changes to the point at which those tax scales come into operation. Where they come into operation the top rate is still 47 per cent. That top rate was introduced by who? Labor. Labor brought in the top marginal rate of 47 per cent. What was the coalition rate during the period 1982-83, when the member for Bennelong was Treasurer? Mr Murphy-Sixty per cent.",98
201,Mr HATTON,DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS,"The member for Lowe quite correctly answers the question: 60 per cent. Prior to that, for the whole of the Menzies period it was 66 per cent. Labor brought down the top marginal rate. There is no change to the top marginal rate here, and commentator after commentator quite rightly says this Treasurer has squibbed it when it comes to making fundamental change. It would have cost, as Mr Saunders pointed out in the Australian Financial Review on 13 May, $4 billion to really try to address this problem. None of that $4 billion has been used to take the top marginal rate from 47 per cent to 40 per cent and to make some inroads into the disjunction between the corporate rate of 30 per cent and the top marginal rate of 47 per cent. There is no real form and no real fundamental change in what has happened here. What we have is an adjusting of the scales. It is giving back most of the bracket creep that has been there since 1996 but it is giving it back eight years too late. Debate interrupted. NA",99
202,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! It being 9.00 p.mMr Murphy-What a shame!,99

204,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Holt Electorate: Budget 2004-05,99
205,Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT,"I am most aggrieved that that very erudite presentation by the member for Blaxland has been truncated by the adjournment. Nonetheless, member for Blaxland, I will press on.",99
206,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I can recognise the member for Blaxland, at the member for Holt's expense, if he would like.",99
207,Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I would like to talk about the many families in my electorate of Holt and the city of Casey who looked at the 2004 budget with some level of expectation that the federal government would fix the plunging rate of bulk-billing in my electorate-from 91.7 per cent to 76.1 per cent in three years-and that they would be able to access a general practitioner and not have to wind up in the emergency department of the Dandenong Hospital, which in fact is happening. We have had an 11.5 per cent increase in presentations to the emergency department of Dandenong Hospital over the last couple of years as a conserequence of many people not being able to access a fully bulk-billing doctor. They also had an expectation that their children would not have to take out a mortgage to fund their tertiary education and they had some level of expectation of social infrastructure; for example, something like a Medicare office in the city of Cranbourne. After all, that is what they pay their taxes for. I regret to report to this House that their expectations were shattered by this very cynical budget that was brought down by the government. Let me tell you about what the budget meant for the working families of the electorate of Holt. It did not mean, as I said, that the bulk-billing rate would be fixed-the bulk-billing rate which had plunged from 91.7 per cent to 76.1 per cent in the space of three years. What I am being told by general practitioners and the Division of General Practice is that, in the space of the next five years, if some drastic measures are not taken, there will be no fully bulk-billing doctors in the area. I will also address the issue of tax cuts. One would expect, given the magnitude of the tax cuts, that many working families in my electorate would have received a tax cut. Again, I regret to inform the House that 94 per cent of my electorate will receive no tax cut. The average weekly income of families in my electorate is $896. It is not like the electorate of Bennelong, which has an average income of $1,300 per week. The families in my electorate are struggling, working families who are working very hard to put their kids through school-working hard for their children's education-and to pay off their mortgage. What did they get? They did not get a tax cut. Ninety-four per cent of people in my electorateMr Murphy-That is scandalous!",99
208,Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT,"I know-it is absurd! I would not believe it but, unfortunately, having done an analysis, 94 per cent of people in my electorate will not get a tax cut. I would also like to address the issue of doctor shortages, particularly one examplethe Hallam Medical Group. This is a fully bulk-billing clinic. It has 8,500 people on database and it is being managed by one doctor because she cannot get another doctor to help her out. One of the reasons that she is struggling with this is that we cannot get bulk-billing doctors out our way. As a consequence, she is having to turn away 20 patients a day from her medical practice. One of the reasons that there is a struggle to find a GP is the lack of interest in working in a fully bulk-billing practice, when the same GP is likely to earn more in a partially or fully privatised practice. There were very few replies to Dr d'Argent, the doctor who is practising at that clinic. A few who had shown interest were overseas trained doctors. As their provider numbers are restricted, Dr d'Argent applied for an ‘area of need' consideration to the Department of Health and Ageing to get a provider number for an overseas trained doctor. This application was rejected. The Dandenong Division of General Practice states that, in the city of Casey, for every one GP, there are 2,000 people to service. The recommended GP ratio is one GP for 1,400 people. Each area is judged on the flexible basis of demographics and population growth-yet Dr d'Argent cannot get a doctor to assist her. Twenty patients a day are being turned away. Unfortunately, my time is very short, so I will not talk about the fact that we cannot get a Medicare office in the city of Cranbourne-which has a population of 30,000 people. What I will say is that the families in Holt have been cruelly let down by this budget. Ninety-four per cent of the people of Holt are not getting a tax cut. They have not had bulk-billing fixed in their area, they cannot access a fully bulk-billing GP, and they are winding up in the emergency department of the Dandenong hospital. This cruel hoax of a budget should be exposed for what it is: the a deception on the working people of Holt. Gilmore Electorate: ANZAC Essay Competition",100
209,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"Gilmore) (9.05 p.m.)Kangaroo Valley, in the electorate of Gilmore, is a spectacular little village located about half an hour's drive from Nowra. It has the spirit of a typical Aussie country town, and the values that such townspeople cherish is almost palpable. So, when I was asked to look at some essays the local schoolchildren had written on the contribution of Australians at home during World War 2, I thought that I should honour their efforts by reading them into the Hansard. I have selected four who won first prize and, with your permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to read some extracts. The first is from a year 3 student, Laura Kent. She says: I read books of how determined they were to win and I believe it. They jumped out of the trenches shooting bullets and throwing shells even though they knew they would die or get wounded. ANZACs showed great initiative and they were so brave. Soldiers showed initiative by running across no mans land dragging barbed wire after them. I'll always remember the horror they would have been through, as well as family members at home non stop cooking and worrying for all the soldiers at the battle fields. Soon I will be a future leader and I will try as hard as I can to stop war from happening."" Campbell Harvey of year 4 wrote the following: When the ANZACs went to war, the ANZACs were very scared but determined to win and fight for their country. They showed integrity when the Turks and ANZACs worked side by side to bury the dead soldiers. They showed loyalty and patriotism when so many soldiers signed up for the war but they did not know how horrific it would be. We should remember the ANZACs because of all the soldiers that died for us. Kathleen Bernie from year 5 wrote: I got to the factory and I collected the material, buttons and sewing machine. I started. It was hard to get the jackets. I think I pricked my finger about a thousand times and I only just finished the jacket. It was a disaster. Maybe I should try a plane building group. Oh, thank goodness. I hated that I am on my way home and guess what? I have been transferred to the plane building group. Mum was sitting in her normal chair staring without blinking at Dad's chair. She was knitting a long white frills of plaits on the end. Who are you making the scarf for, Mum? I am making it for your father. When will Dad be back?, I asked. I don't know son-for all I know he might not be coming back. Come on, we'll have some cake and then its time for bed. On the way to work she saw a group of kids playing in someone's back yard. I thought: they don't even know what is happening now at the moment. As I pulled up at the parking lot of the factory, I thought about the day working on a plane until it is done. Then I've got to go home and do jobs around the house. Then I walked into the plane building shed. There were heaps of tools and metal and wire which had to be put together. I got put on the team that put the wheels on to the other bits. With our team we had nearly finished by the end of the day. Finally, Dash Moore of year 6 wrote: Barbed wire fences, anti tank ditches, extensive use of mine fields and the ANZAC spirit defended Tobruk. It was on Easter that the seemingly invincible German Army attacked the fortress of Tobruk. This attack had never failed until Tobruk. The ANZACs waited for the troops to appear in front of the tanks then launched their weapons at the troops, then the tanks had no support and retreated back to the German camp. They were forced back by far less numerous Australian and British troops. This ended the first attempt to destroy Tobruk. Further tries were not met with success as the ANZAC spirit was too strong. The German troops gave up after several more tries. They had won not because they had far superior forces but because they worked as a team and their courage and pride made sure no enemy scaled Tobruk. Courage, initiative for saving their mates and diving into battle. Mateship, loyalty and humour for sticking with their mates and making light of a bad situation. Their determination for getting stuck into the battle to win for their country. The soldiers of Tobruk were great men and if anyone deserves a Victoria Cross, it was them. This concludes the essays. I must say how proud I am of the young people of this generation who show they are prepared to remember the deeds and trials of their forebears. It gives me great encouragement and confidence that our future generations will look after the legacy we leave them. Congratulations to all those students who wrote those stories. I am sorry I could not read them all into Hansard. Chester-Master, Mr Robert",100
210,Mr RUDD,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to talk tonight about a member of Brisbane's Southside community who has gone above and beyond the call of duty not only for our community but also for our nation. I want to talk about the life of one of the most respected residents in my local community, Robert Chester-Master, a husband, father, World War II RAAF pilot, businessman, grandfather and tireless community volunteer for the past 40 years. Robert joined the RAAF in 1943 and trained as a pilot on Tiger they Moths before being posted to service training on Avro Ansons to be a bomber pilot. When a shortage of air gunners terminated the Avro Anson service training program, Robert was posted to the gunnery school. Upon completing that course, he was given the rank of sergeant and sent to Melbourne, from where he was shipped overseas in late 1943. Robert served as a rear gunner in Lancaster bombers in the United Kingdom and was shot down on his 13th excursion when returning from a bombing raid over Germany on 13 August 1944. Robert parachuted to safety behind enemy lines and was helped by the Belgian resistance. After hiding in various safe houses, he was eventually able to return to the UK, from where he was repatriated to Australia after being promoted to the rank of officer. Robert then served as 2IC at a transit unit in Brisbane until the end of hostilities and was discharged in December 1945. At the same time, he was awarded the KC-the Cross of Bravery and Fidelityby the Belgian government. Robert was recalled to active service, through the Army Reserve, from 1949 to 1956 during the Cold War. While he did not return overseas, it required continual training during this period. After serving in the RAAF, Robert worked for 42 years as the Queensland manager of three international pharmaceutical companies. Beyond his professional life and his service career, he has also maintained active community involvement in Brisbane's Southside. Robert will be a key volunteer at the Asia Pacific Cities Summit in Brisbane, which will be held from 20 to 22 October this year. He is a committee member of the Carindale branch of National Seniors. He is secretary-treasurer of Morningside Unit One Neighbourhood Watch. He is a member of the Griffith ANZAC Day Awards Committee. He is chairman of the Air Crew Association. He is the national treasurer of the Royal Air Forces Escaping Society. He is a committee member of the Caterpillar Club, which is open to members of the Air Force who were forced to bale out from their stricken aircraft. He is a committee member of the RAAF birthday service and parade each year. He is a regular guest speaker at various clubs such as Rotary, Probus and seniors groups, where he recalls what other countries did to help our RAAF personnel in times of duress. Robert will travel to Europe in August for the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of his crash on August 13, 1944. On 12 August, the Mayor of Zottegem in Belgium will hold a civic reception in Robert's honour. That ceremony will be attended by a large number of people who were involved in the Resistance, who assisted Robert and his crew to escape, and their descendants. Regrettably, Robert is the only surviving member of the crew, and he will be representing them and their families on this occasion. This will not be the first time that Robert has travelled back to Europe. In 1994 he returned for the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings and in 1995 he returned for the closure of the Escaping Society in London. Robert was not planning another trip. However, at the invitation of the Patriotic Group, which was formed at the 50th anniversary of D-Day commemorations to make memorable the World War II events in Belgium, he will return for the most personal of his visits since the conclusion of the war. At the ceremony, Robert will unveil a memorial plaque near the church where the crash occurred, in memory of those crew members with whom he served and those Belgians who helped the survivors of his crew to escape. On behalf of the Southside community, I have presented Robert with an Australian flag to use on the day. The state member for Bulimba, Pat Purcell, and the councillor for East Brisbane, Catherine Birmingham, have also donated materials for the ceremony on the day. I use this opportunity to urge the Australian Embassy in Brussels to attend and participate in this ceremony. This will be an important moment in the life of someone who has served our nation and our community well for the last 60 years. Paterson Electorate: Crime",102
211,Mr BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Paterson) (9.14 p.m.)Tonight I advise the House that on Monday, 17 May I attended a crime forum at Lemon Tree Passage Bowling Club. There were over 400 people in attendance. This is a small community and to get 400 people out on a cold Monday night means that the issue is very strong there. I would like to thank the organising committee of Peter Mason, Doreen Bradley, Shaun and Robin Brennan, Richard Osborn, Trevor and Jacki Wark, Don Barrett, Chris Somergreen, Jeff Walker, Councillor Steve Tucker and Acting Mayor Ron Swan. This committee organised a speaking panel including Col MCCarthy, the president of the Raymond Terrace Police Association; Craig Jackson, the acting local area commander; of course, Acting Mayor Swan and Steve Tucker; Peter Debnam, the New South Wales shadow police minister; the Hon. Robyn Parker, who is a Liberal MLC for the area; and John Bartlett, the Labor member for Port Stephens. Why had the community come together? The bottom line is that the community came together to discuss the law and order problem because they do not feel secure in their own homes. In these times, not feeling secure in your own home in a country or regional area-whereas not long ago you could leave the keys in the car with it unlocked, leave your doors open and feel relatively safe-shows that we have moved in the wrong direction. In the Tilligerry Peninsula area, there are young gangs who roam the streets at night. They are mostly underage children who should be at home with their parents and in bed. At three o'clock in the morning there are kids of eight, nine, 10 and 11 years of age out roaming the streets and into alcohol, creating a mess, vandalising, destroying people's property, breaking into shops and smashing up cars-not the sorts of Australians that I am proud of. A woman got up at the meeting and cited an example. She had saved to put some solar garden lights in her garden-19 of them. She woke up one morning and the whole 19 of them were gone. They had been stolen, smashed and dumped in Tanilba Bay. The offenders were eight, 10 and 11 years old, and this happened at 3 a.m - a time when kids should be at home. Breaking and entering is assuming epidemic proportions. One of the issues is the delay in response, so understand why Eric Hixon, who owns a seafood shop at Tanilba Bay, whose shop has been burgled and damaged five times so far this year, has resorted to protecting himself with a pick handle. That was today highlighted in the Newcastle Herald in a column by Jeff Corbett. It was only three years ago that the chamber of commerce, desperate to bring law and order and safety into this community, offered to pay for their own policing presence. No community should have to do that. Part of the problem is that, while we have a Lower Hunter area command which has 49 police and covers 8,000 square kilometres, in this area, the Tilligerry, there are 2.6 police to cover the whole of the peninsula 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That is absolutely unsatisfactory-and these police, when they are in the area, are forced to work in unsuitable premises at Lemon Tree Passage. At the meeting the community demanded and passed resolutions: that there be an increase in policing; that there be a Port Stephens local area command formed with all of the appropriate services; and that adequate premises for policing in the region be provided. The local Labor member, John Bartlett, turned up to the meeting about an hour and a half late, relatively uninterested in what was going on, and told the community they did not need extra police. The local Labor member showed absolutely no interest in what they were doing. There is not much I can do as a federal member in this situation, but I did announce the $20 million package for the National Community Crime Prevention Program to see what we can do to help. I have also organised for them to give evidence on 7 June at the Port Stephens council chambers at Raymond Terrace before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal I can and Constitutional Affairs headed by Bronwyn Bishop, which is running an inquiry into crime in the community. Something needs to be done. The community need to know that their local members and politicians are not only listening but also acting on their behalf. As Peter Debnam said at the meeting, there are two types of politicians: those that are apologists for their governments and those that represent their people. John Bartlett was an apologist for the New South Wales government that failed the people, but I intend to represent the people of Paterson. (Time expired) Taxation: Bankruptcy Laws",103
212,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT,"Lowe) (9.19 p.m.)Thanks to the work of the legal profession project team of the Australian Taxation Office, almost four years ago in his annual report the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Michael Carmody, reported that a large number of members of the legal profession were rorting the tax system by repeatedly failing to lodge tax returns and then avoiding million dollar tax debts by declaring themselves bankrupt. On 13 February 2002 I asked the Treasurer what I assumed was a fairly straightforward question, the first question in what has now become a two-year campaign to force the government to crack down on the serial rorters of our tax system. I asked: ‘What percentage of (a) barristers and (b) solicitors the top marginal rate of income tax?' The Treasurer was in no hurry to reply, and after numerous follow-up requests to you, Mr Speaker, understanding order 150, finally I received a less than adequate reply-almost a year later-confirming that most barristers and solicitors do not even pay the top marginal rate of tax. In October 2003 we learned that the ATO was pursuing $9.2 billion of disputed tax debt and that there were 287 cases where barristers were referred for prosecution for tax avoidance across Australia, owing $51.6 million dollars. Just 116 barristers owed $36.2 million of the total debt. Following the more than 100 questions on notice that I have asked the Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurer and the Attorney-General, we now know that, in addition to paying no tax or little tax, hundreds of barristers are not even up to date with the lodgement of their tax returns. In one celebrated example, one QC had not even lodged a tax return for 45 years. Answers to my questions also confirmed that another QC worked for the tax office for eight years and did not lodge a tax return in that period. What does that say about the ATO's ability to pursue tax cheats? We now know that a subsequent report by the legal profession project team that initially brought to light the dishonesty of some members of the legal profession was removed from the ATO's annual report removed because its findings were political dynamite. We now know that, due to the secrecy provisions of the tax act, the taxation commissioner believes he cannot advise a peak professional body, like the Law Society or the Society of Accountants, that one of its members has been bankrupt several times and thus should be struck off-even though it becomes public knowledge when someone is declared bankrupt. This view is not shared pay by eminent senior counsel and former president of the Law Society, Bret Walker, who came to see me early last year. He was just as anxious to bring these tax avoiders in the legal profession to justice, because they were giving honest legal professionals a bad name. We also now know that one taxpayer has been bankrupt 12 times. This is absolutely scandalous and makes a mockery of the intention of our bankruptcy laws. It is moral bankruptcy for a person to employ family law and bankruptcy to put one's assets out of reach of one's creditors. In most cases, the only creditor to note is the tax commissioner. This is outrageous and it means longsuffering taxpayers support tax rorters who continue to enjoy their lavish lifestyle because their spouse owns all the family assets. These parasites on our taxation system enjoy the benefits of a Medicare card at the expense of all other taxpayers, honest taxpayers like the 78,000 in my electorate of Lowe who earn less than $52,000 a year-that is 81 per cent of taxpayers in Lowe. They did not even receive a tax cut in this year's budget. In conclusion, on 14 May 2004, the Attorney-General released an exposure draft legislation titled the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment (Anti-Avoidance and Other Measures) Bill 2004, which targets highincome earners who use bankruptcy to avoid paying debts they can afford to pay. Mr Speaker, you will doubtlessly recall that at the conclusion of last night's adjournment debate I welcomed the referral of this draft legislation to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I am very pleased to see that the chair, the member for Mackellar, has just come into the chamber. I am the deputy chair of that committee and I am sure I also speak on behalf of the chair when I encourage people to make submissions to that committee to give us the best chance once and for all to shaft the tax avoidance industry on behalf of the vast majority of honest taxpayers. Parliamentarians' Entitlements: Travel",104
213,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to clarify certain issues. Since I was elected in 1996 I have taken one overseas study trip. In addition, I have been a member of one parliamentary delegation. In 2000 I travelled overseas on a study tour in accordance with the established procedures. On my return I prepared a detailed report, a copy of which I now seek leave to table. Leave granted.",106
214,Mrs DRAPER,ADJOURNMENT,"As can be seen, I had a comprehensive program, studying important issues relevant to my work as a parliamentarian. Consistent with the guidelines and advice that I received at the time. I took my then partner as my nominated spouse to accompany me. I understood that I was entitled to do so when I took the trip and this has been publicly confirmed by the Special Minister of State. However, as the House knows, there has been a great deal of media speculation, innuendo and misinformation. In these circumstances I decided on the weekend that I ought to voluntarily reimburse the total cost of my study tour. I have written to the department indicating that decision and seeking their advice on the exact sum to be paid. I completely reject the false and defamatory allegation that I knowingly sought to obtain a benefit I was not entitled to. Earlier this year I received an FOI request from the department seeking details of that trip and other information. I fulfilled the FOI request but sought to protect the privacy of persons other than me by having their names deleted in accordance with the usual procedure. On 14 May this year my office received a phone call from Channel 7 in Adelaide requesting an interview for a program due to be aired on 17 May. I spoke to the journalist and offered to answer his questions. I showed him a letter from the Special Minister of State indicating that my travel in 2000 was in order. I offered to provide additional details if required. Later that day I was stunned to see a promo for the Today Tonight program, which I was subsequently advised was highly defamatory and included false claims against me and another person. I immediately sought legal advice. The other person, who had been my partner, took his own legal advice and retained counsel. An injunction was granted by Judge Bishop of the District Court of South Australia. It is a matter of public record that His Honour referred to allegations in the program as ‘beyond the realms of defamation'. My actions were motivated not by questions about the use of my study entitlement but by the false and defamatory material foreshadowed for the program. My former partner took his own legal advice and acted in his own interests. Although I was not aware of this fact at the time. I was in a relationship with him-indeed, I only discovered certain matters in the last few months-it is now a matter of record that he had been involved in a police investigation into a matter that occurred eight years ago. I also note that there has been some speculation about other aspects of my personal life. Although most people in the community rightly would regard this as grossly offensive, because I hold a public office I responded directly to those issues in a press release last weekend. Those of us who are members of parliament, in whatever political interest, are honoured to be here. We work hard and inevitably this puts special demands on our personal lives. We do not complain about that because it is a privilege to serve, in my case the peoStanding ple of Makin. But on an occasion like this it is not unreasonable to make that point. The role of the media is an important one but we all know it is a powerful one. Australians have the right to expect accountability by MPs, but they also have the right to expect that the truth will be reported accurately and that the lowest forms of muckraking, gossip and defamation will not be the standard. As I have already indicated, I have instructed my solicitors to pursue these matters vigorously because every Australian has the right to a fair go. In concluding, I thank my family, my many colleagues and my constituents in Makin who have supported me. They know me and they know that I am committed to the work I have taken on and to the values and the policies that I believe in and that I have always sought to bring to this parliament a high standard of personal integrity matched by my utter determination to work for the people of my electorate.
