1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 9 am and read prayers. NA Approval of Proposal,17
2,Mr ALBANESE,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"I move: That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for works in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 11 August 2009, namely: Parliament Drive one-way road upgrade. This motion is seeking approval of the parliament to upgrade the Parliament Drive oneway road. Parliament Drive was converted to a one-way road in late 2006. This was done to help improve the traffic efficiency of the road following security upgrades in the area. Since that time there have been a number of minor traffic incidents on the road, such as vehicles proceeding the wrong way along the one-way road. If left unaddressed, the current situation could result in a serious traffic accident. A traffic engineering report was commissioned by the Department of Parliamentary Services. This report recommended a number of modifications to significantly reduce the likelihood of traffic accidents occurring. The proposed project will implement these recommendations. The estimated construction cost for the upgrade is $1.4 million and construction works are planned to take place late in 2009. The costs and timings of the works will be confirmed after construction contracts have been received. Under section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the Presiding Officers are responsible for works within the parliamentary precinct and the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government is responsible for other works in the Parliamentary Zone. Accordingly, this motion is moved on behalf of the Speaker and the President in my capacity as Leader of the House, and I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. NA Public Works Committee Reference",17
3,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support and Parliamentary Secretary for Water) (9.03 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Villawood Immigration Detention Facility, Sydney, New South Wales. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship proposes to undertake a major redevelopment of the Villawood Immigration Detention Facility, which is located in Sydney, New South Wales, at an estimated out-turn cost of $205.37 million inclusive of GST. The Department of Finance and Deregulation is to manage the project delivery on behalf of DIAC. The Villawood Immigration Detention Facility needs to be upgraded to replace ageing infrastructure; provide appropriate facilities to meet contemporary community standards; improve the living conditions and amenity for detainees; improve operational efficiency and modernise security; and, importantly, respond to the new directions in detention announced by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in his speech of 29 July 2008. Broadly speaking, the project aims to replace the existing high-security accommodation, provide new essential support facilities and engineering services and refurbish the existing lowand medium-security accommodation. Subject to parliamentary approval and following a detailed design process, construction works are planned to commence in late 2010, with construction to be completed by mid-2014. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. NA (ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTION) BILL 2009 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Swan. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",17
4,Mr SWAN,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill is an important step in delivering on Australia's commitments at the G20 leaders' meeting in London in April 2009. While the global recession had its origins in the financial institutions of the United States and Europe, its impacts have been felt right around the world. The multilateral development banks, such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB), are playing a critical role in supporting recovery in developing economies and therefore the global economy. The ADB is also helping to ensure sustained growth and stability in the Asia Pacific region which will benefit Australian exporters and jobs for many years to come. To ensure the ADB has sufficient capital to support recovery and ongoing sustainable growth in our region, G20 leaders agreed to support a 200 per cent general capital increase. The outcomes of the London Summit played an important role in restoring stability to financial markets and restoring economic confidence. And as we approach the next leaders' summit in Pittsburgh, it is important for G20 members to demonstrate that we are delivering on all of these very important commitments. Supporting this bill will enable Australia to demonstrate its leadership globally, as well as supporting recovery from the global recession in our region. The purpose of this bill is to obtain parliamentary approval for Australia to take up its allocated subscription to the fifth general capital increase at the ADB at a cost of around $US197.6 million over 10 years. Under the general capital increase, Australia is entitled to subscribe to an additional 409,480 shares. Only four per cent of these shares are required to be paid-in. As a result of the low paid-in component, the annual cost of the subscription will account for a very small part of Australia's aid program over the 10-year payment period. Australia's contribution towards the general capital increase was included as a capital measure in the 2009-10 budget and will not impact the underlying cash or fiscal balances. I believe the economic and political significance of the Asia-Pacific region to Australia, and the important developmental role which the Asian Development Bank is playing, both in its immediate response to the global recession and in pursuit towards its long-term Strategy 2020, necessitate Australia's continued support of the bank. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Coulton) adjourned. NA NA AMENDMENT (TRANSITION TO FAIR WORK) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 June, on motion by Ms Gillard: That this bill be now read a second time.",18
5,Mr KEENAN,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"The coalition strongly opposes the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2009, because we believe that every Australian, whether they be an employer or an employee, deserves to be able to go to their workplace and operate in an environment where basic law and order is enforced. Every Australian has that right, and this bill abolishes the body that ensures that law and order is enforced in the building and construction industry. Mr Sullivan-Rubbish!",19
6,Mr KEENAN,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"Already we get heckling from the back bench, who say it is ‘rubbish'. But it is true, and I will run through the reasons why the abolition of the ABCC and its replacement with a toothless tiger will result in exactly that. We hear a lot of spin and rhetoric from this government and very little of substance, but the spin that they are putting out on this particular bill deserves a gold medal. We have heard the minister claim that the abolition of the ABCC and its replacement with a toothless tiger was actually the government standing up to the militant building and construction unions. But of course the exact opposite is true. The new body that has been established within Fair Work Australia to replace the incredibly successful Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner is not an independent body. It is controlled by the minister. It is not a strong cop on the beat. It will become so bogged down in paperwork and bureaucracy that it will not have the time and resources to do its job properly. It is not a simpler model; it is a more complicated model that makes it far more difficult for it to go out and do the job that it is supposed to be doing, which is enforcing law and order in the building and construction industry. It is important that this House acknowledge that the building and construction industry is not like any other sector of the Australian economy. It has for decades been plagued by serial thuggery, lawlessness and unlawful activity. It has been plagued by strikes, assaults, bribes, intimidation, trespass, vandalism, sabotage, threats, coercion, boycotts, blackmail, stalking, collusion, wilful damage-you name it and this industry has had it. These practices have meant high infrastructure costs, delayed projectsstalled for months by strike action-and the development of a culture which can, in many respects, be compared with that of organised crime. Ordinary Australians will not and should not be required to cop this sort of behaviour. People are smart enough to know that the rule of law is more important than the agenda of minority interest groups and militant unions. I wish that the powers of the ABCC-and they are quite extraordinary powers-were not needed. But we know from serial misbehaviour within the sector that the tough cop on the beat needs to have the powers that are required to do its job. Sadly, this bill will abolish those powers and it will abolish the body that has been so successful in enforcing law and order. I want to remind the House why the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner was established. Of course, it took a coalition government to take the tough decisions to return the building and construction industry to law and order. In August of 2001, the Howard government established the Cole royal commission to investigate the culture of lawlessness that had plagued that industry for decades. Commissioner Cole reported in March 2003, and the report catalogued more than 100 different types of unlawful conduct in that sector. This resulted in the creation of the Building Industry Taskforce, a body that secured law and order in the industry until the BCII Act was established, and the ABCC was created in 2005. The ABCC was created as a genuine and strong cop on the beat, and it was given the powers that it needed to actually enforce law and order and to do its job properly. The ABCC is independent, it has been very effective, and it has done the hard yards to try to wrest control of the industry away from a culture of lawlessness and return it to something resembling other sectors in the Australian economy-sectors where people can go to work and expect that they will not be stood over or subjected to thuggery or intimidation, where they can just go to work and behave like they are in a normal workplace, as every other Australian would expect. It has been incredibly successful in returning law and order to the industry and, in doing so, it has also been incredibly important for the overall health of the Australian economy. Independent research says that industry productivity is up by some 10 per cent, there has been an annual economic welfare gain to the whole Australian economy of $5½ billion per year and inflation is lower. is estimated that there has been a downward impact on CPI, to the tune of 1.2 per cent, and higher GDP for the whole Australian economy-up by 1½ per cent-because of the significant success of the ABCC. It has also, very importantly, resulted in significant reduction in the number of days lost to industrial action. For the workers in that industry it has resulted in real wage creases of more than 15 per cent. So it has gone some way, within its short life, towards controlling the culture of lawlessness in the industry and changing the culture of the industry. But I do not think anybody who has been privy to some of the work done at the Westgate Bridge construction site in Victoria could say that the ABCC's work is done or that the culture of the industry has been changed. This industry still requires an incredibly tough cop on the beat to do the job it is being asked to do in what is a very tough industry. I want to go through some examples of lawlessness that were uncovered by the Cole royal commission. These are the sorts of things that have been happening in this industry in the last decade-it is not ancient history-and they are great examples of how the militant unions in the sector have conducted themselves. Cole came up with more than 100 examples of the lawlessness that occurs, and I would like to remind the House of some of the case studies he presented. He talked about a Japanese company called Saizeriya. They wanted to establish new facilities in Victoria. It is generally acknowledged that it is in Victoria and Western Australia that the militant construction unions are at their worse. After some discussion with the state Labor government in Victoria, Saizeriya decided to make a massive investment in food-processing infrastructure. They were going to invest, in the first instance, $40 million. This project would have created 100 It jobs locally and about 500 full-time jobs on an ongoing basis, with experts predicting that the indirect flow-on effects from the establishment of the new facilities would create up to 3,000 additional jobs. Saizeriya's long-term plan was to open a a new facility every five years. They wanted to invest more than $200 million over a 20-year period. But the second they started work on in- their first site, the Victorian Trades Hall Council and the militant unions started their normal campaign of work bans, boycotts, contractor restrictions, strikes-the sorts of behaviour I outlined earlier. They did this in support of union demands that three workers who were not needed on the project but who were members of the union be employed, that arrangements be made for employees from an asphalting company to be dual ticketed, that a barbecue lunch be provided on site at Easter 2001 and that the company agree to provide a DVD to be raffled at the barbecue with the proceeds to be paid to the CFMEU fighting fund to support its opposition to the work of the Cole royal commission. As you can see, the union's demands were ludicrous. But, because those demands were not met, this union went about disrupting the project and ensuring that it could not go ahead in a timely manner. As a result, the first plant, which was due to open in February 2002, was not completed until June 2003. After completion of the first stage, and because this company had found it so difficult, the company decided to pull the plug on any further investment. So the $200 million and the 3,000 jobs that would have come into the Australian economy were pulled because the company found it far too hard to do business in Australia because of the unions and the poor industrial relations climate that existed. They looked at taking their business to New Zealand instead. The royal commission found that: By any standards, the Victorian investment proposed by Saizeriya Australia Pty Ltd was significant. It had great potential benefits for the rian economy. Largely as a result of industrial misconduct on the part of the AMWU and CFMEU members and officials associated with the project, the first stage will, it is expected, completed almost 12 months behind schedule. Not surprisingly, Saizeriya Australia has chosen to review the issue of whether it will proceed to build some or any of the four remaining plants which formed part of the original proposal. Saizeriya Australia's experience starkly calls into tion the effect upon foreign investment requiring building and construction work of any magnitude in Victoria when such work may be subject to unlawful and inappropriate conduct and actions by unions. Anecdotally, if you ask well-placed people in Victoria about Saizeriya, they will tell you that the founder of Saizeriya, a very successful Japanese businessman, had been subjected to a campaign of fear and intimidation by the Japanese yakuza when he was establishing his business in Japan. I understand that one of his stores in Japan was actually burnt down as a result of that. He saw off that challenge and built his business there. But he said he has never found anything as difficult as the culture of the construction industry in Victoria and that what he was subjected to in Victoria was worse than what he was subjected to by the Japanese mafia in Japan. As I said, it is in Victoria and Western Australia that you see these militant construction unions at their worse. The Cole royal commission outlined the case of Dependable Roofing. The situation was that a contractor had engaged Dependable Roofing, which was not on the union's list of approved companies, to perform work. The CFMEU, led by Joe MCDonald, raided the site. They hunted down the employees of Dependable Roofing, who were at the time working on a scissor lift some 6½ metres off the ground. The CFMEU raided the site and hunted down employees of this contractor, Victo- which was not a union approved contractor. This happened in the last decade; it is not ancient history. This union official is still causing trouble and he is still the lead union be official for the CFMEU in Western Australia at the moment. He hunted down the employees. The raiders surrounded the scissor lift and prevented it from being moved. They then turned off the central control unit of the ques- elevated platform and removed the keys, so those workers were stuck 6½ metres in the air and could not get down. After stranding the workers up in the air, the union then claimed it was a safety issue. When Dependable's workers finally were able to get down from the lift, they were so intimidated by the raiders that they were forced to retreat into their site office. During that time one worker was assaulted by Joe MCDonald, and others were surrounded, abused, threatened and told to get off the site. When in the site office, which was a demountable site office, a temporary arrangement, the raiders bashed and kicked the side of the office and eventually lifted that site office from its mounts and pushed it over, with the people trapped inside. This was Joe MCDonald, a serving union official in Western Australia. This is a report from the Cole royal commission. This is an example of the way that these unions behaved, and it is an example of the sort of behaviour and lawlessness that the ABCC was established to deal with. It would be good if we could report to the House that this sort of behaviour was a thing of the past within the building and construction industry, but clearly it is not. We can see that examples at the Westgate Bridge building site in Victoria from just the last couple of months. There have been some appalling examples of behaviour from that site. It has been blockaded and delayed. It has seen intoxicated unionists from both the AMWU and the CFMEU engage in behaviour that could only be called absolutely appalling. Mr Cheeseman-That's not true.",19
7,Mr KEENAN,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,So you are saying that reports of bad behaviour at the Westgate Bridge are not true? Mr Sullivan-Were they in the Australian?,22
8,Mr KEENAN,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"It is interesting, because your minister has commented on those reports. Maybe you should refer back to her speech. It is interesting that members opposite would interject that this is not true. So apparently there has not been any bad behaviour at the Westgate Bridge. This is probably a great example of the sort of denial the Labor Party members are in. If they were not in that denial, how could they support the abolition of this body that has brought law and order back to this industry? Let me just go through the examples of behaviour that apparently have not occurred at the Westgate Bridge site. What has happened is that union officials there have surrounded the manager of the construction company, called him a dog, abused him, banged on windows, kicked the front door off its tracks, impeded people from going to work and abused staff. Even a cursory search on the internet, if members opposite would like to undertake that, will show documentary photo evidence of this happening. This needs to be considered in the context that the company is paying workers on that site, on average, $135,000 a year, which I think by any measure is a reasonable wage. We have also seen balaclava clad, militant from raiders involved in high-speed car chases. There have been allegations of bikies being paid money to attend protests. There have been attacks on the private homes of supervisors. There has been damage to vehicles. There have been bricks thrown through windows, with death threats. Ultimately, police have been called into protect workers who just wanted to go onto that site and do their job. All of this has happened within the last 12 months. Now we find this government is going to abolish the one body that has the powers to control this sort of behaviour. I am happy to go on with examples of bad behaviour. Again I will turn to Western Australia, which is subject to the CFMEU in particular, who have an incredibly blackened record of behaviour within the building and construction industry. The infamous Joe MCDonald, whom I referred to earlier, had his right-of-entry permit withdrawn at state and federal levels some time ago. Despite this, in 2008 the Industrial Relations Commission had to force an undertaking from the secretary of the CFMEU's WA branch that Mr MCDonald would not continue to enter sites unlawfully. This was a result of a complaint from Multiplex. Mr MCDonald had entered their sites on over 30 occasions without a valid permit. In a media interview afterwards, Mr MCDonald said that he would continue to illegally enter building sites, spite the undertakings that had been given to the Industrial Relations Commission. So clearly this is not a union or a union official with much respect for the law. The Cole royal commission found that payments had been made to the CFMEU in Western Australia of over $1½ million for so-called casual tickets, which is basically money paid in return for industrial peace on sites where all workers are not members of the union. The Cole commission found that, of the $1½ million that had been paid, they could only trace less than $500,000 of that money. So $1 million of this money paid to the CFMEU has just disappeared. Mr Sullivan-It's an allegation.",22
9,Mr KEENAN,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"It is interesting that Labor Party members here seem to think that this is all made up. They might want to go back and refer to the Cole royal commission. Apparently they will not believe that members of the CFMEU would behave in this way. It is only that sort of denial that could lead you to support this ludicrous bill that abolishes the body that controls this sort of behaviour. There are significant problems with this legislation that we are opposing here today as the opposition. Despite the rhetoric of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations that it maintains a tough cop on the beat-and this is another great example of the minister's cliches; she says ‘tough cop on the beat' but sadly it does not mean anything-this bill removes the independence of the building inspector and it ties up the watchdog in red tape. It actually has a sunset clause, for the abolition of the powers that the new body has, to do its job properly. Most ludicrously, it contains provisions that switch off the powers that the new inspectorate within Fair Work Australia has to enforce the law. That seems to me to be an extraordidenary thing to contain within Commonwealth legislation. There are laws that are established so an independent body can do its job, and you can apply to have those laws switched off. Why you would need those laws switched off is unclear to me. Of course, what will happen is that this will become part of negotiations and the unions will demand that these powers be switched off for any particular site and therefore they can return to their bad old ways without fear of having a policeman on the beat that has the powers to draw them into line. This bill also reduces penalties for unlawful behaviour within the industry by two-thirds. It narrows the definition of industrial action and it removes provisions that stand against coercion and undue pressure being put within that industry. It is not just the opposition that is appalled at what is happening here. With the exception of the militant unions, which are going to be given carte blanche to return to their bad old ways through this bill, all of the stakeholders within the industry are publicly on the record opposing what is happening here. AMMA have supported some aspects of the bill but their overall impression is: … the effect of the BCII Amendment Bill is to disarm the tough cop and tie up the building industry watch dog in red tape. That is exactly what the opposition says and exactly what is going to happen if this bill passes through parliament. The Master Builders Association said that the government must reconsider the bill and not proceed with its passage and that the bill is potentially disastrous for the building and construction industry. The AI Group, perhaps one of the government's more favoured business groups, have said that cultural change has not been achieved within the industry. They have raised concerns about the proposed switch-off provisions, about the five-year sunset clause and about watering down the penalties by two-thirds, and they are also concerned about the lack of independence of the proposed inspectorate. The Civil Contractors Federation have echoed the concerns of the AI Group, as have the Business Council of Australia. They have said that they want the bill delayed and that they are opposed to having switch-off provisions within the bill, provisions which are, quite frankly, ludicrous. The Air Conditioning and Mechanical Contractors Association oppose the bill. They say that this bill will result in: … a significant diminution of the powers of the “..cop on the beat..” and: … there is likely to be a return to a level of unlawful behaviour on construction sites that prompted the actions that were taken by the ernment in 2002 to curtail such behaviour. These are the bodies that actually represent people who are engaged in this industry on a day-today basis, and they are saying that passage of this bill will result in a return to the bad old days within the building and construction industry. I will go on. Australian Business Industrial say that the government should reconsider its approach to the controversial aspects of the bill. The Electrical and Communications Association believe that the specific legislation for the building and construction industry should remain. The Housing Industry Association said: To enable a long term cultural change, HIA submits the bulk of the current institutional framework embodied in the ABCC needs to continue without some of the significant “watering down” of powers contemplated in the Bill. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry supports the existing system. They say that the ABCC should: … be retained as a stand-alone agency, with its existing capacities and responsibilities, and with its supporting legislation and associated instruments essentially unchanged. Finally, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Western Australia, a body that knows all too well the behaviour of the CFMEU in WA, say: Removal or weakening of such power is expected to encourage union lawlessness. So there we have it. All of the organisations representing people who actually operate within the industry say that the passage of this bill is going to result in a return to lawlessness within the building and construction industry, a return to the practices that I have reminded the House about that were exposed by the Cole royal commission and that led to the establishment of the ABCC. It was established with the powers that it needs to maingov- tain law and order within the industry-and all the resulting good that that has done for the Australian economy as a whole, not just for the building and construction industry. Nobody should be fooled by the minister's spin on this particular issue. This bill fulfils the long and oft-stated goal of the militant construction unions to abolish the ABCC; it is replaced by a toothless tiger that does not have the powers to do the job properly. In a tough industry, the new body is going to be weak and it is not going to have the ability to do what it is supposed to do. The opposition will oppose this legislation at every step of the way, because every Australian employer and every Australian employee deserves to be able to work in a culture that is free of lawlessness, free of thuggery and free of intimidation. They should expect that they will be able to go to work in the building and construction industry and have the same law and order that every Australian worker expects when they get up in the morning and go about their lawful business. We will oppose this bill. It abolishes a very successful body and it fulfils the oftstated wish of the militant construction unions. Nobody should be fooled by the minister's spin on this. It is a bad bill. The opposiFalling tion will oppose it.",23
10,Mr SULLIVAN,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"Longman) (9.35 am)Clearly, I rise in support of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2009-and can I say that I am less than overwhelmed by the contribution of the opposition spokesman, the member for Stirling. In fact, the member for Stirling should perhaps look at what was going on in this country about a century ago, when a chap by the name of Henry Lawson was writing a poem called Second Class Wait Here. The member for Stirling clearly supports a system where workers in the building and construction industry are second class, treated differently to all other workers in Australia. That is what the member for Stirling is on about. He recites a couple of examples from the Cole commission and he raises the spectre of Joe MCDonald, a Western Australian union official, whom his party vilified in the course of the election campaign. The man swore on a construction site-gee whiz! If he is the only person in this country who has sworn on a construction site I would be very surprised. Let's talk about Joe MCDonald, because the member for Stirling, who has now left the chamber, raised the issue of the chap. Let us talk about him and that particular construction site and the reason that he was on that site on that day. It was the Q-Con construction site in Perth. What was he there trying to do? He was there trying to ensure that the workers in his union were given the opportunity to work in safe conditions. He was videotaped verbally abusing an official from the company, a fellow who was obviously a much more worthy person than Joe MCDonald, because he was dressed in a suit and tie. What happened on the building site? Let us just read from the West from 5 July 2007: concrete has prompted workers to walk off the job at a Perth building site where union hard man Joe MCDonald was caught on video abusing a construction manager over safety. Abusing a construction manager over safety on a building site that was unsafe-my goodness, what a dreadful man this Mr MCDonald must be. Big chunks of: Concrete fell 16 floors at the Q-Con construction site on St Georges Terrace … sparking safety concerns. I beg your pardon? Joe MCDonald was on the site sparking safety concerns and Joe MCDonald was right. It is a fortunate thing that workers were not killed on that site. As has been noted on a number of occasions, not least by the former member for Corangamite, Mr Stewart MCArthur, in a speech in this chamber about two years ago on 16 August 2007. I will read the full sentence because he was coming at it from a slightly different angle to me: There is no room for bullying or unsafe practices on a construction site and the high-fatality statistics in the industry are chilling proof of this. That speech was made in support of a system that we are told is the one that is going to improve construction safety. The Australian Safety and Compensation Council produces notified fatalities statistical reports. I have two here with me today: July 2007 to June 2008 and July 2008 to December 2008. It is interesting to look at construction industry fatalities statistics in those two reports. year from July 2007 to June 2008, 36 construction workers lost their lives on building sites. Nobody should have to go to work knowing that there is that level of fatality in the industry. I note that far too many people do die. In the second half of last year there were 18 fatalities on construction sites, and 16 of them were workers on construction sites. But it is also illustrative to see how construction site fatalities have trended since the introduction of the ABCC, which members opposite tell us is going to solve all the problems. In 2004-05 there were 18 fatalities on construction sites; in 2005-06 there were 25. The ABCC came into effect in October 2005 and certainly did not reduce fatalities that year. In 2006-07 there were 28, in 2007-08, as I have said, there were 36. Fatalities have risen under the regime of the ABCC, which those opposite would have us believe was there to prevent just that happening. Members opposite are more than willing to vilify and call criminals those members of unions and their executive who seek to protect lives. A submission to a Senate select committee quite recently from the building industry superannuation fund has an interesting little couple of paragraphs within it: In September 2002 the Fund supplied the ATOAustralian tax officewith approximately 70 employers who had failed to pay contributionsThat is, superannuation contributionsfor the 2001/2002 year. In a follow up conversation with the ATOThe writer was advisedthat half had gone bankrupt … 10 had no record of existence at the ATO and the remainder would be followed up with desk audits over the next few months. No doubt by the time that desk audit was In the over some of those too would have gone out of business. If you are going to go chasing the criminals in the building industry, you had better have a look at some of the building industry companies, not just the unions. The ABCC has concentrated its entire effort on building industry unionists or innocent bystanders. Look at the university academic that they were trying to haul in in Melbourne. This is not the way our country needs to be run. I should make mention of a certain case just so that people understand the situation in which construction industry unions find themselves in their work. Several years ago I met a guy by the name of Gary MCCarthy. Gary MCCarthy was a member of and, I think, a site organiser with the CFMEU. A very close friend of his, a young man by the name of Mark Allen, died in September 1996. He was killed on a demolition site in Perth-this centre, the member for Stirling would have us believe, of unlawful activity by the building industries. He was killed on a site while trying to get workers down from an unsafe area on a demolition site. He was killed, he was opposed and Premier Court at the time thought the situation was wonderful. I will now return to the provisions of the bill that is before us. This bill is informed by a number of things. One of the things it is informed by is the Wilcox review commissioned by our government, not the Cole inquiry commissioned by the former government. Mr Briggs-Is Cole good or bad?",25
11,Mr SULLIVAN,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"I am more than interested to listen to what the architect of Work Choices has to say. If you want to take us on over industrial relations in the community, feel free. Mr Briggs-Tell us how much you got from the CFMEU.",26
12,Mr SULLIVAN,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"I am going to answer that question because the member deserves an answer. The CFMEU did not contribute to my campaign. The CFMEU is a union from the other side of the party that I belong did not contribute to my campaign. But I tell you what: I have more respect for any unionist in any union in this country than I have for any of the people who sit over there, who will oppose the legislation before the House. Murray Wilcox reported on the activities in the industry and made eight key recommendations, and this government is proceeding down that path. The big point of contention is the retention of the coercive powers. Talking about spin, the spin that these powers need to be retained comes from the newspapers, members opposite and companies in the building industry, who, we note, because of their financial behaviour, are not blameless. I am not so sure that this widespread unlawfulness exists, but I am prepared for the level of coercive powers to be retained under the conditions that have been set out, because they are reasonable conditions-for example, the five-year grandfather clause. I would be very surprised if we cannot wipe out any actual or alleged unlawfulness within the building industry in five years. These powers are obnoxious. If they were not obnoxious they would exist in every enforcement regime in the country, and they do not. They are obnoxious powers and they are targeting a particular group of Australian citizens-and quite unfairly, I believe. I think that over the course of the next five years the limited number of occasions on which these powers will be used will prove me right. Each use of these powers will require approval by a presidential member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That means that, for the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate to actually use these powers, it will have to show cause to someone who has some understanding of what all of this means. Unlike the current situation, a person to. It summonsed to appear under these powers will be able to have the assistance of the representation of a lawyer. Good grief! The former government set up a situation where people were denied representation in quite legalistic processes. You would not do it anywhere else. Why would you deny a person appearing before any court of this country the opportunity to be legally represented? People will be provided or reimbursed reasonable expenses, which I think is fine. All examinations will be undertaken by the director of the inspectorate or somebody who has been deputised by him or her to do that. Finally, all examinations will be videotaped and reviewed by the Commonwealth Ombudsman to make sure that the powers are not being abused. It is also important to note that a person who is interviewed under these provisions will not be prevented from telling his wife or anybody else about what is going on. The idea that you can be interviewed and not discuss it is quite ludicrous. I think it is also appropriate to make the point clearly that within this legislation the penalties and offences are exactly the same as the penalties and offences within every other industry in the country. There will be no more special penalties or special offences for the building and construction industry. The Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate has not been included in the office of the Fair Work Ombudsman as had been planned, and I actually support that exclusion. It is a departure from what Wilcox suggested, but I would be very disappointed if coercive powers were part of our mainstream industrial legislation. Whilst they exist I am happy for them to exist to the side. The switch-off power of the coercive powers is interesting in the context that struction projects that do commence post 1 February 2010 are able to operate in an environment where these powers are not hanging over the heads of workers like the sword of Damocles. I wonder why people would think that that is not appropriate. The member for Stirling indicated that he believes that the hotbeds of unlawfulness in the construction unions are in Victoria and Western Australia. That may or may not be the case. I certainly do not see enough evidence to suggest that there are hotbeds of unlawfulness. But that leaves a number of other states-Tasmania, New South Wales, Queensland, Northern Territory, the ACT and South Australia-as not hotbeds of unlawful behaviour. Quite frankly, the existence of these powers is always going to create a tension between employer and employee. If those powers can be switched off in the context of a project, I suspect that will be something to assist in creating a good working relationship between employer and employee and I would not be surprised to see applications coming from the companies undertaking projects as often as they come from the unions or third parties. The interesting thing of course is that the unions would prefer there to actually be a switch-on power rather than a switch-off power. I think they are actually both. The need to have approval of the presidential member of the AAT before the powers can be used is, in effect, a switch-on power. It is a safeguard against ideologues such as those who operate in the ABCC currently, people who are true believers of a nature other than the true believers on my side of the chamber, who are out to do a job. Quite frankly, I everybody in the country recognises that the job they were set to do and the job that they have relished is a union-busting job. They have been unsuccessful and the government has been elected making quite clear statecon- ments in relation to the building industry through the Forward with Fairness documents in April and August of 2007. The people knew what they were getting from this government. The election was about industrial relations. If you people opposite wish to take on this government over industrial relations, then there will be fewer of you after the next election.",27
13,Mr BRIGGS,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"This is my first attempt at addressing the chamber from my new position. I rise to oppose the government's attempts to water down or destroy the very successful ABCC today. This is, as we have just seen from the speech from the member for Longman, a campaign being run by union members for union bosses, not for the interests of actual workers on the ground. Let me just address a couple of points the member for Longman made in particular on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2009, the first being that those of us on this side do not care and nor does the ABCC about worker safety. It is an absolutely outrageous slur on anyone in this place to suggest that anyone would not care about the death of a worker, or the death of anyone for that matter. It is a suggestion that is beyond repute but not beyond those on the other side because that is the way they operate. It is a disgusting slur, it is not unusual, it is a CFMEU tactic, it is a Labor Party tactic; and it is not right. Let us deal with OHS in the building and construction industry. The member for Longman comes from Queensland. As I understand, there has been a Labor government in Queensland all of this century. Who looks think after OHS on work sites? Labor state governments. If you want to make a criticism of governments not caring about deaths in the construction industry, start looking closer to home, Member for Longman; start looking to those in your state government who seem to be more interested in getting kickbacks for services delivered on projects than they are in actually looking after your workers' safety. If you want to start to make accusations about who cares or who does not care about workers and their safety, look closer to home. That is the first issue: state governments have the fundamental responsibility for OHS in this country. An aspect of the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry was the establishment of the Federal Safety Commissioner, which this bill, as I understand, seeks to continue. So the link between safety on work sites, deaths in the construction industry and the ABCC is a deliberate slur in place of an argument. If you want to be critical of the OHS performance in your state, look at Premier Bligh, look at Premier Beattie and have a look at your state Labor governments who have run this country for the best part of the last 10 years. If you are serious about looking at safety, have a look at the record of your state Labor governments. Let us deal with that in the first instance. Let us deal with that slur that they continue over there because they have got no argument on this point. All they have got is a slur. If you want to look at safety, look at performance of your state Labor governments. Any death on a work site is tragic. To suggest that anyone does not care about that is a complete and utter slur and should be withdrawn. Mr Sullivan-I am not sure that is what I said.",28
14,Mr BRIGGS,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"It is absolutely what you said and you allege the ABCC does not care about it. In fact, Commissioner Lloyd has said: The ABCC is committed to do all it can to improve the industry's poor occupational health and safety record and to support those specifically charged with this task … Those charged with this task are the Federal Safety Commissioner established by the former Howard government and the state OHS officials. So much for union officials doing so much for safety if the record is so poor. Let us deal with the history of this industry. Mr Sullivan interjecting",29
15,Mr BRIGGS,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"So where have the OHS officials from the state government been, Member for Longman? Mr Sullivan-They were there.",29
16,Mr BRIGGS,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"Oh, they were there. It really mattered, didn't it? Their record has been outstanding on this, hasn't it? It is a poor link in place of an argument, which you do not have. Mr Sullivan-I have got a great argument.",29
17,Mr BRIGGS,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"The argument run by the other side is that being run by the CFMEU, and they are just placating in this place. But we will deal with that. Let us look at the history of this industry and where the ABCC comes from. It comes out of a royal commission that those on the the other side now seek to slander, as they have since it was established. They did not mind when Commissioner Cole investigated a campaign by the then member for Griffith, but the royal commission held when he investigated the building industry did not have as much value, apparently. Let us look at what that royal commission found. It found an industry which was basically snubbing its nose at the rule of law. It was conducted from August 2001 and was established to inquire and report into the nature, extent and effect of any unlawful or otherwise inappropriate conduct in the building and construction industry. The commission sat for 171 public sitting days, accumulated 16,000 pages of transcripts and heard from 765 witnesses. In addition, 1,900 exhibits, including confidential exhibits, were tendered to commissioners, and some 29 general submissions were presented from interested parties throughout the building and construction industry. The final report from Commissioner Cole was tabled in parliament on 26 and 27 May 2003 by the then Minister for Workplace Relations, the member for Warringah. It outlined the royal commission findings that the industry was characterised by widespread disregard for the law, and catalogued over 100 types of unlawful and inappropriate conduct. The commission also found that existing regulatory bodies had insufficient powers and resources to enforce the law. Let us deal with some of the issues that the royal commission found. The findings provide a very compelling insight into this industry, prior to the beginning of the ABCC. The royal commission found: (a) widespread disregard of, or breach of, the enterprise bargaining provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (C'wth); … … … (d) widespread requirement by head contractors for subcontractors to have union-endorsed enterprise bargaining agreements (EBAs) before being permitted to commence work on major projects in State capital ness districts and major regional centres; (e) widespread requirement for employees of subcontractors to become members of unions in association with their employer obtaining a union-endorsed enterprise bargaining agreement; (f) widespread requirement to employ unionnominated persons in critical positions on building projects; (g) widespread disregard of the terms of enterprise bargaining agreements once entered into; (h) widespread application of, and surrender to, inappropriate industrial pressure; (i) widespread use of occupational health and safety as an industrial tool;This is just what we saw the member for Longman do in defending this case. (j) widespread making of, and receipt of, inappropriate payments;This is very similar to what happens in Queensland at the moment, as I understand(k) unlawful strikes and threats of unlawful strikes; (l) threatening and intimidatory conduct; … … … (n) disregard of contractual obligations; (o) disregard of National and State codes of practice in the building and construction industry; (p) disregard of, or breach of, the strike pay provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (C'wth);They were completely thumbing their noses at the law(q) disregard of, or breach of, the right of entry provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (C'wth);This is a bit similar to what is happening at Woodside in WA at the moment, with 170odd right of entry applications in four central busiweeks-four weeks! (r) disregard of Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) and court orders; (s) disregard by senior union officials of unlawful or inappropriate acts by inferior union officials; (t) reluctance of employers to use legal remedies available to them; No wonder! … … … (w) inflexibility in workplace arrangements; (x) endeavours by unions, particularly the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy ion (CFMEU), to regulate the industry; andlast of all(y) disregard of the rule of lawwhich applies in our country. What was the effect that we found this had on our economy and on general mum and dad punters? We saw an industry whose productivity had been lifted by 10 per cent as the ABCC was introduced, we saw a lower CPI, we saw a higher GDP and we saw an annual economic welfare gain of $5.5 billion per year. But all these results are disregarded by those on the other side purely for their political purposes. Those on the other side stand hand in hand and side by side with the CFMEU officials who are identified in this royal commission report as being the perpetrators of the economic destruction of this industry. The ABCC has actually brought law back to this industry. It has brought back a legal framework which employees, employers and subcontractors can operate under. It has removed the bullying and the intimidation which-for too long-made this industry a laughing stock not only in our country but other countries as well. So let us not have this ‘ABCC are all a bunch of neophyte Liberal-lovers who run around trying to destroy the union movement in Australia'. The ABCC has reintroduced the concept of the rule of law into Australian workplaces in the building industry. This is not a matter of dealing with workers' rights or safety; it is actually a matter of dealing with inappropriate, illegal conduct on building sites. Those on the other side will stand up and talk about how we do not support workers' rights and how we are all out to get unions and so forth. That is completely untrue. Those on the other side seek to denigrate this Un- royal commission and argue it was done for political purposes; but this royal commission found an industry held up by illegal conduct and which was damaging our economy through this behaviour. They seek to defend that behaviour and to reinstate the power and privileged position of certain officials in the CFMEU and other unions like the ETU in Victoria-I notice the member for Deakin is not speaking on this bill, which surprises me a great deal. They seek to take us back to the bad old days. In its short time, the ABCC has achieved quite significant benefits to the Australian economy. It was established due to a recommendation of the royal commission. In 2003 the first steps to implement the recommendation were begun by the member for Warringah, followed by the member for Menzies, successive workplace relations ministers. Following the 2004 election, in October 2005, the commission was established, led by Commissioner John Lloyd, who has done an outstanding job. It is a credit to his work ethic. Members can shake their heads and denigrate a public servant if they wish-they are good at it-but he has done an outstanding job of reintroducing the law into this industry. What we have seen from the KPMGEcontech research-which those on the other side will disagree with-is industry productivity up by 10 per cent, an annual economic welfare gain of $5.5 billion, a lower CPI, a GDP higher by 1.5 per cent and a significant reduction in the days lost through industrial disputes and illegal behaviour on worksites. That is what we are talking about here: illegal behaviour on worksites. No-one has anything to fear if they actually follow the law; that is the point. If they follow the law and respect the rule of law in our country, which I thought those on the other side stood for, they have nothing to fear. What those on the other side want to return to is the privileged position that a certain union had. What does it mean? Increased membership means increased financing. Increased financing means increased donations. It is a revolving slush fund, and that what they want to go back to. This is not about safety or workers' rights-not at all. This is about union power; make no mistake. The arguments mounted by those on the other side will quote workers' rights and OH&S concerns. They will ignore the facts that the OH&S is looked after by their state Labor mates, that there is still a Federal Safety Commissioner and that safety is the concern of all of us. Deaths on work sites should not be used as political pawns, but all too often we will hear speeches from those on the other side peppered through with fatality statistics, suggesting that what we did in government and what we seek to do today is to continue unsafe practices, which is completely untrue and a slur. So we had a royal commission and we had the recommendations implemented. We have seen the results of the recommendations: an improvement in this industry, for the workers as well as the employers. The member for Longman made the point that in this industry building employers from time to time do not follow the law either. If that is the case, they will be prosecuted. Anybody in this industry, or any industry for that matter, who does not follow the law should be prosecuted by the relevant authorities. That is common sense. But what we saw in this industry-the reason we had a specific piece of legislation and a royal commission into this industry-was that there was a specific circumstance in this industry and a specific behaviour with a disregard for the law. So there was specific legislation built. The legislation has worked, the ABCC has worked and we have seen the improvements, so why change? Let us look at what has happened in recent times. The Labor government was elected in November 2007 on promises including the abolition of the ABCC and the establishment of a specific inspectorate division within Fair is Work Australia from 1 February 2010, until that time maintaining the full powers and operations of the ABCC and a strong cop on the beat at all times-because that sounded like they were being tough-ensuring new arrangements are simple and retaining the principle of the current framework. What we see in this bill is those promises largely implemented following the review by Justice Wilcox. The other thing this bill does is to introduce this concept of switch-on and switch-off with the coercive powers, which basically is switching off-the removal of the coercive powers. The powers in the current law are there to compel witnesses to give evidence that is needed and to provide protection to those who want to give evidence to the ABCC without fear of payback or retribution. What we found with the ABCC-let us remember what we went through earlier on-is that this industry was full of intimidatory practices where people were snubbing their noses at the rule of law. So we needed specific provisions, and that is one of the reasons this has worked. The existing powers are capable of being used against everyone in the sector: employees, employers and subcontractors-you name it. The proposed restrictions on investigation powers are cumbersome, but they are there because this is the out, you seethis is the deal. I referred today in an article on a website to Ross Fitzgerald, not a well known supporter of our side of politics. There was a Ross Fitzgerald article earlier this week in the Australian, where he talked about the performance of the Deputy Prime Minister, the woman most likely to succeed when the current Prime Minister runs out of time. He refers to her performance on the Q&A program against the Leader of the Opposition last week, and he is not kind in his analysis of her performance. He says: She is all style and very little substance. Long rhetoric, but short on delivery. All foam, no It is quite a cutting analysis of her performance, and you see that in this bill. What you see is the talk that there has been this great brawl with the CFMEU and the bullyboy unionists-‘I'm standing up to them and we're keeping this tough cop on the beat'but then you actually see the detail, which shows that that is simply not true. There are the little opt-out powers which remove all the beneficial aspects of the ABCC. You will see the removal of Mr Lloyd at some point-you can guarantee that. We saw the reaction from those opposite when I mentioned his name, and there are head nods now; that pretty much confirms that that is what will occur, because this is what happens. If you have someone who those on the other side do not like, who might actually be doing his job properly, you will see a personal campaign of vilification against him. You saw that with the Cole royal commission; you will now see it with Mr Lloyd. This is the behaviour of those on the other side, who seek to implement their real agenda. They cloak it under a language which pretends that they are tough on illegal or inappropriate behaviour, but in truth they are not. In truth what they are doing is reducing the role of the ABCC, because that is what the unions want. And who benefits from that in the end? The Labor Party. The Labor Party benefits from it in the end. It is all froth and no beer. This is what this bill is: all froth and no beer. It is implementing the true desires of those on the other side: the removal of the institution which has reintroduced the rule of law into this industry, an industry which needed a specific royal commission into it, which found over 100 instances of illegal or inappropriate behaviour. It is an industry which has been for many years subject to inappropriate and illegal beon haviour and which will go back to the worse beer. of the excesses of those who seek to implement their own agenda for their own benefit into the future. We have seen the benefits of the ABCC from the Econtech research and we will see the outcome of the removal of these powers. This is being done for politics. This is not being done for the benefit of the Australian consumers. This is not being done for good policy reasons. This is being done for political reasons. It is a political deal-they have to reward their mates when they are in government. But, instead of being honest about that, what this bill seeks to do is to claim they are standing up when indeed they are not. This is the undercutting of the powers of the ABCC. The removal of these powers is the very essence of the reason that the ABCC has been successful, because remember that the major finding of the royal commission was that this is an industry guided by illegal behaviour and inappropriate conduct. This is a very Labor bill from a Deputy Prime Minister who is all froth and no beer.",29
18,Mr NEUMANN,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"I am happy to speak in support of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2009. The Rudd Labor government has no tolerance for unlawful and illegal behaviour, whether it is in the building industry or in any other industry in any sector of this country. Unlawful industrial action will not be tolerated by the Rudd Labor government. We will honour our commitment, and this legislation honours that commitment, which we made prior to the last federal election to ensure not only that we have a tough cop on the beat in the building and construction industry but also that we bring a degree of fairness and justice and equity into that industry. The truth of the matter is that the Howard government, in its time in office, engaged in the persecution of workers not just in the building industry but elsewhere. Work Choices is clearly the best example of the Howard government's lack of commitment to the terms and conditions, pay and salary and the lifestyles of Australian workers. It a bit rich for one of the architects of Work Choices, the member for Mayo, to actually give us lectures about the rights of workers. The truth is that the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry was itself a political act set up by the Howard government to ensure that the salary and conditions of those hard working men and women in the building and construction industry would find themselves subject to a different rule of law than any other worker in any other industry. I have a fundamental belief that, whether you live in Palm Beach, Perth, the Torres Strait or Tasmania, there should be one law for all. The member for Mayo should have a really good look at the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act. I note he did not quote in his speech from any sections of that act. I am going to say this for the purpose of those who might be listening in the gallery and for the Australian public. Let us have a look at the draconian provisions in that act. Section 52 says that the ABC Commissioner has the power by written notice given to people to obtain information in a manner and form specified in the notice to produce documents. That power means that a person who has received that notice has to reveal all their telephone and email records, whether of a business or a personal nature; report not only on their own activities but on those of their fellow workers; reveal their membership of any organisation such as a union; and report on any discussions in a private union meeting or other meetings of workers. The provisions can apply not only to a person suspected of breaching a law but to workers in the building industry not in any way suspected of wrongdoing. Also, it applies to innocent bystanders and to the families of workers in the building and construction industry, including children of any age of workers in that indusis try, journalists and academics. The truth is that that sort of legislation is draconian and unfair on people. Section 53, which I note the member for Mayo did not even refer to, says certain excuses are not available in relation to section 52 requirements. Section 53(1) says: (1) A person is not excused from giving information, producing a document, or answering a question, under section 52 on the ground that to do so: (a) would contravene any other law; or (b) might intend to incriminate the person or otherwise expose the person to a penalty or other liability … That is remarkable. Section 52(7) overrides the secrecy provisions in other laws. In other words, it has the potential to override national security laws relating to, for example, ASIO. The sections ensure that the ABCC has coercive powers which override the protection of journalists' sources, privacy law and even cabinet confidentiality, according to Professor George Williams. There are no safeguards. Warrants are not there. The review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act is not there. Democratic rights like the right to freedom of speech and the right to silence are stripped away. In fact, it makes a mockery of its aspirations to respect the rule of law in section 3 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act. So let us not get sanctimonious about this. This is an Orwellian piece of legislation produced by the Howard government after their commissioner of choice put down a report and Howard followed it. He opportunistically used legislation and the fact that they had a majority in the Senate to do certain things. The ABCC was given extraordinary powers in an industrial context which were not even given to the police to investigate major crimes. They go far beyond the powers of the police. The ABCC regime is very different from any other regime. It acts in a discriminatory manner. For example, you can say that ASIC, the ATO or even the Child Support Agency has investigative powers, but they do not investigate those powers and take on, say, butchers or those living in Toowoomba or those who may be Catholics. The ABCC has very discriminatory powers and the law itself is a criminal investigatory model put forward in a non-criminal industrial context. That is the situation. Those opposite should not get too pious about what their position is and how wonderful and virtuous the ABCC legislation is. I can think of nothing more Orwellian in terms of its nomenclature, apart from Work Choices, than the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act. John Lloyd, the ABC Commissioner, has shown his true colours with what he has done. We have seen many prosecutions initiated and there is a degree of unbalance in the nature of the activities going on. I have had friends who have been attacked and subject to prosecution. Just yesterday I had lunch with a good friend of mine, the secretary of the plumbers union in Queensland, Bradley O'Carroll, who himself was pursued. There is a lack of even-handedness about the ABCC's activities. Fortunately, Justice Spender, the case against Brad O'Carroll, said it should never have been brought in the first place. That is just typical of what I would consider to be the unfounded coercion that the ABCC practises in relation to workers, many of whom are law-abiding Australians who go about their business providing for their families from the salary entitlements that they earn working in the building and construction industry. If there are acts of illegality and criminal behaviour in the building and construction industry then they should be subject to the full force of the law by the police and the courts. That is why we have the Australian Federal Police and the police forces of the states and territories of this country. The member for Mayo talked a lot about following the Cole royal commission report, but the Deputy Prime Minister herself decided to look into this and appointed the Hon. Justice Murray Wilcox to provide a report and to consult stakeholders on the report, on matters relating to the creation of what we believe to be a fairer system-that is, putting the whole issue of the building and construction industry into the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate. Murray Wilcox came back to the government with recommendations after extensive consultation with stakeholders in the industry. Many people-employers and employees, ACCI, and the Business Council of Australia-were involved in responding to the Wilcox inquiry. We have acted on our election commitment, a commitment upon which we were elected by the Australian public. We have listened to what the Hon. Justice Murray Wilcox has had to say and we have followed his recommendations. I agree with what the Deputy Prime Minister has had to say about the vast majority of participants working in the building and construction industry: they are law abiding men and women and wonderful citithroughout zens of this country. The Wilcox recommendations go a long way towards bringing forward important safeguards to avoid the arbitrary, if not capricious, misuse of the powers given to the ABCC by the Howard government in this piece of legislation. The provisions in this legislation before the House today prescribe, very carefully, prudently and appropriately, clear safeguards and oversight in all the cumstances. I applaud the campaign of so many workers and their unions who have focused on this particular issue and aspect of our industrial life in this country. I have many friends in Queensland-in the BLF and the CFMEU, the Electrical and Plumbing Union and other unions-and many of them are good, hard working, decent Australians who have been subject to the threat of these terrible laws hanging over them for far too long. We hope and expect that the coalition would respect the mandate given to us by the Australian people when we pass this legislation-not just through the House but, we hope, through the Senate-in the circumstances. The legislation before the House goes a long way to alleviating the problems with the current legislation-legislation which so persecutes Australian workers in the building and construction industry. I have learnt in many years in politics that you cannot get everything you want and I have argued my position for a long time in the various forums of our party in relation to this. I am happy speak on this bill and to support what I believe will be a very significant improvement in the lives, in the workplace and elsewhere, of men and women in the building and construction industry, not just in my home state of Queensland but in the whole of Australia. The elements of this particular piece of legislation are very, very important. We are abolishing the ABCC and creating a new and separate regulatory independent ombudsman called the Fair Work Ombudsman to administer the regulatory framework for the building and construction industry. The Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate will go a long way to bringing fairness, justice and equity into the workplaces and the building and construction industry in this country. Abolishing the ABC Commissioner and the deputy commissioners is important. I would cir- have preferred that they had not been appointed in the first place, but I am happy that we will appoint other people in all the circumstances. The changing of the definition of ‘building work' to remove its coverage for off site work is important to limit the scope of the legislation. The establishment of an advisory board to make recommendations to the director of a new inspectorate is important because the advisory board will make recommendations about policies to guide the performance of the director's functions and the exercise of the director's powers. The advisory board will consist not just of the director but a Fair Work Ombudsman and a representative from the building industry employees' unions, as well as a building industry employer representative and other representatives. Another important reform is the creation of an office, the independent assessor, who on application from stakeholders-and that can be employers or employees, and unions as well-can make a determination that an examination notice power will not apply to a to particular project. The switch-off powers are important because these coercive powers should not apply to every single project in the circumstances and the independent assessor, if satisfied, can make a determination to switch off the powers. It would be my hope that that would happen on many, many occasions. While we retain the coercive powers there are significant amendments to implement the Wilcox recommendations, including regarding external oversight. The use of each of these powers is dependent on a presidential member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal being satisfied that a case has been made out for their use. Importantly, if a person is summoned they could be represented by a lawyer of their choosing and their rights not to disclose information on the grounds of legal professional privilege and public interest immunity will be recognised. That is an important safeguard in terms of civil liberties. Also their reasonable expenses could be reimbursed. All examinations are to be undertaken by senior officials, and all examinations will be videotaped and the Commonwealth Ombudsman will monitor those and review all examinations and report back to parliament on the exercise of this power. Before this examination notice can be issued, an AAT presidential member must be satisfied on reasonable grounds of a number of things. One is that you cannot get this information by any other way. We think it is important that there should be a sunset clause for the coercive powers to end at the end of five years from 1 February 2010. There will be a review prior to that sunset clause date being reached, but in all the circumstances I believe firmly that we will see an end to coercive powers in this country. The criteria which the independent assessor has regard to in terms of the public interest will be specified in regulations, which I think is important, and they will be objectively ascertainable and geographically neutral. A very important reform which we are initiating is the ministerial direction which is being given to the ABCC. Before exercising that power, the ABCC must provide a nominated person who is a presidential member of the AAT with a report describing the person against whom the power is to be exercised and the purpose of the exercise of that power, the urgency, the likely effect on the person and whether the purpose can be achieved in any other way. In other words, you have got to show that this is absolutely necessary in all the circumstances. An objection can be taken to an appropriate court or tribunal. It very clear oversight administratively and judicially. What did the ABCC say about all this and the Wilcox report? The true colours of John Lloyd and co were revealed in its response to the Wilcox recommendations. If we needed some degree of objectivity and evidence based decision making coming out, we did not see that from the ABCC in its response to the Deputy Prime Minister following publication of the Wilcox report. Guess what: the ABCC says that many of the Wilcox recommendations are unnecessary or too expensive in the circumstances-for example, the video recording of every examination. The judicial and administrative reviewable oversights are unjustified, according to the ABCC. The ABCC opposes limiting the definition of ‘building work' in the guidelines. It thinks that the exercise that it has undertaken in relation to the interrogation powers of a compulsory nature is justified in the circumstances, despite the many cases it has had thrown out. The true colours of John Lloyd and his cohorts have been clearly shown. The legislation before the House is extremely important. It is about improving the living standards and the working conditions of men and women in the building industry. It is about bringing back a degree of fairness and justice. I can say as a Queenslander that we have not had anything like the unlawful behaviour we have seen from time to time in places like Victoria and Western Australia. My knowledge as a practising lawyer who worked in industrial law from time to time and my knowledge of the men and women who represent workers in their industries in Queensland demonstrate to me that this legislation goes a long way-not quite as far as I would hope but a long way-towards bringing back justice for building and construction industry employees in this country. I would hope that those opposite would is take the opportunity to listen to the voice of the Australian people, to help us eradicate draconian powers given to the ABCC so that the compulsory interrogation powers can be prescribed and so that we can see a modern society in Australia where building workers and their families and children are treated decently, with humanity and with a degree of justice that we as Australians believe is important across all the workplaces of this country. I warmly commend the bill to the House.",33
19,Mr ROBERT,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"I rise to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2009. Like all Labor titles for bills, it seeks to create something which it is not. Perhaps the bill should have been called the building construction revolution, the BCR, or perhaps the construction revolution and productivity, though that acronym would not quite work. Either way, this bill will not seek to improve anything. At its worse, it will take industrial tions on construction and building sites back to the 1960s and 1970s, and at its best this bill will emasculate an organisation, the ABCC, whose work has been so vital in bringing harmony and order back to Australian construction sites. If power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, we have seen the ABCC's function rein in the worse excesses of the Australian union movement. Its removal will see corruption return to sites. The other question that must be asked is: if you have done nothing wrong, if you obey the law, what do you have to fear? If you drive within the speed limit on the correct side of the road, you have nothing to fear from the law enforcement agencies. If people on construction sites-workers, unions, delegates and employers-obey the law, they have nothing to fear from commissions like the ABCC. Yet the furore I hear from the other side would seem to indicate there is something to fear. That in itself shows that something is wrong. The coalition supports the work and the operation of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and will vote against any move in this place to water down the operation of that body. Keep in mind that the ABCC, its powers and functions came out of the Cole royal commission that was established because there was a culture of lawlessness, intimidation and unsavoury practices within the building and construction sector. It is almost as though I am speaking about an outlaw motorcycle gang with respect to lawlessness, intimidation and unsavoury practices, but I am not. I am speaking about Australian work sites and about a commission that seeks to give law back to them, which this Labor government wants to undo. The ABCC was established to improve practices within the construction and building sector and has achieved remarkable rerelasults. If something is so successful then surely you would want to roll it back-that is the common sense thing to do, isn't it-and go back to the practices of the past that caused so much pain! Interestingly, the Labor government always said that they would not touch the ABCC until 2010. Yet, on 25 June this year, the Deputy Prime Minister tried to sneakily issue a ministerial directive to neuter the ABCC from August this year. She sneakily tried to slide it in under the radar to take away its powers. It is good to see the Deputy Prime Minister keeping her word on what the Labor government intend to do. But then, again, I look across the table at the minister for the environment, who said, ‘When we get in, we'll just change it all, won't we?' My goodness, haven't those prophetic words come true? We should spend some time and look at what has occurred within Australian building and construction sites since the introduction of the ABCC. Let us deal with facts. Let us not look at the hyperbole of what Labor puts out; let's look at the cold, hard, brutal facts the broad spectrum of daylight and at what this Labor government is looking at rolling back. Let me read from the KPMG report, commissioned by the Master Builders of Australia, dated 6 May this year. I am reading from the executive summary: Both the 2007 and 2008 reports showed that, following the establishment of the Taskforce in 2002 and its successor the ABCC in 2005, and in conjunction with industrial relations reforms extending to 2006, the construction industry has achieved higher productivity than would otherwise have been expected. And further, ‘This 2009 update brings the economic analysis conducted in the previous reports up to date.' The report continues: - ABS data shows that, by 2008, construction industry labour productivity outperformed predictions based on its relative historical performance to 2002 by 10.2 per cent. Of course we have to roll this back-this is dreadful! It goes on: - The Productivity Commission found that multifactor productivity in the construction industry was no higher in 2000/01 than 20 years earlier … Well done, Hawke and Keating governments! That is a great result-productivity no higher, it did nothingbut rose by 13.6 per cent in the four years to 2005/06. Clearly, the ABCC has failed! The report goes on: - The Allen Consulting Group, in a report to the Australian Constructors Association, found a gain in non-residential construction industry multifactor productivity of 12.2 cent in the five years to 2007. The Cole royal commission found that, from 1980 to 2000, there was no change in productivity-there was nothing but lawlessness. Yet, in the five years to 2007, productivity rose by 12 per cent. In any language that is an outstanding success of the role of in the ABCC and associated legislation. It is unable to dispute the facts, which is why the Labor speakers have not dealt with the facts. They have just rolled over about working families and children and how it is so unfair. The KPMG report continues: - Using Rawlinson's data to 2008, the cost penalty for completing the same tasks in the same regions for non-residential construction compared with residential construction has shrunk. This implies a relative productivity gain for non-residential construction conservatively estimated at 6.2 per cent. And further: - Other studies conducted in this area support the findings of KPMG Econtech's analysis. These studies submit that industry reform has lifted construction productivity by approximately 10 per cent. Whatever study you look at, wherever you go, there is a 10, 12, 13 or 14 per cent productivity improvement because of legislation the Howard government put in and, importantly, because of the role of the ABCC in countering and fighting lawlessness on building sites driven by lawless unions. The report continues: … the Consumer Price Index is an estimated 1.2 per cent lower than what it would otherwise be under the Baseline Scenario … due to industry reforms, consumers are better off by $5.5 billion on an annual basis, in 2007/08 terms. Surely such commendable results-industry productivity up by 10 per cent; an annual economic welfare gain of at least $5½ billion per annum; CPI lower by 1.2 per cent; GDP increased by 1.5 per cent; a significant reper duction in days lost through industrial activity to the lowest since records have been kept-say one thing: let's keep doing what we are doing; it is working and, if it's not broken, don't fix it. But here we are today trying to fix that which is not broken. With the overwhelming evidence pointing towards the success and the economic gains to the whole nation, when the CPI reduces, when the GDP increases, every Australian benefits. So why are we here looking at these reforms? The answer is quite simple: on 24 November 2007, Labor came to power. And on Monday, 26 November 2007, on the Gold Coast, where my seat of Fadden is located, the big burly union boys were out on the construction sites saying: ‘Union ticket, or no entry; Labor has won.' That is why we are here. Since the November 2007 election, strike activity has increased by about 700 per cent-the unions believe they are back in town. In the last four weeks, one Rio Tinto mine site has had over 170 union right of entry demands-it is a non-union site and the unions want to be back in town. If that is not harassment, what is it? I note with interest that the Attorney General has produced a discussion paper on the new terrorism laws and their extension to psychological terrorism. How dangerously close is the CFMEU getting to psychological terrorism by making 170 demands in four weeks for union right of entry? This is all about unions exacting their toll for the tens of millions of dollars they put into Labor's coffers for Labor to win government. There can be no other reason why we are going there-no reason at all. Productivity is up by 10 per cent, the economic gain is $5.5 billion, the CPI is down 1.2 per cent and the GDP is up by 1½ per cent. This is all because of what the ABCC and associated legislation has achieved-and they want to roll it back! It defies imagination. It beggars belief. If you did this as a university assignment you would fail because it makes no sense. You could not mount a substantive argument as to why you would seek to roll back the ABCC after such phenomenal success. But here we are today debating a Labor bill that wants to do exactly that. So it is worthwhile looking at where we have come from. In August 2001 the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry was established to inquire into and report on the nature, extent and effect of any unlawful or otherwise inappropriate conduct in the building and construction industry. That royal commission sat for 171 days16,000 pages of transcript, 765 witnesses, 1,900 exhibits and 29 general submissions from interested parties. Its final report, tabled on 26 and 27 March 2003, is staggering. Here is what the Cole royal commission found about construction and building sites and the unions that run them. It said in its summary of findings that, amongst other things, there was: (e) widespread requirement for employees of subcontractors to become members of unionsdemanding it(f) widespread requirement to employ unionnominated persons in critical positions on building projects; (i) widespread use of occupational health and safety as an industrial tool; (j) widespread making of, and receipt of, inappropriate payments; That is called corruption. It is exactly what is going on with Queensland Labor at present-the inappropriate receipt of payments. The royal commission also found that there were: (k) unlawful strikes and threats of unlawful strikes; (l) threatening and intimidatory conduct; (n) disregard of contractual obligations; (o) disregard of National and State codes of practice in the building and construction industry; (r) disregard of Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) and court orders; (s) disregard by senior union officials of unlawful or inappropriate acts by inferior union officials; (w) inflexibility in workplace arrangements; (x) endeavours by unions, particularly the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy ion (CFMEU), to regulate the industry; and (y) disregard of the rule of law. These are the findings of the Cole royal commission. Because of that the ABCC was put in place. And because of that and other legislation, massive productivity improvements and great economic gains have been realised throughout the economy-and this is what Labor wants to roll back. It makes perfect sense, does it not-it all adds up? It is absolute and utter nonsense. Labor is proposing in this bill to wind back the powers of the ABCC; to narrow the scope of the application of the act; to introduce a whole range of bureaucracy-as if we do not have enough; and to turn a tough cop on the beat into a neutered, toothless tiger. The ABCC will be abolished under this bill and replaced by an inspectorate within Fair Work Australia. This inspectorate will be required to enforce the provisions of the new law if it is passed. An advisory board will be established to make recommendations to the inspectorate about policies and a range of priorities. The scope of circumstances to which the bill applies has been narrowed by removing application to off-site work, and penalties have been reduced. The ability to compel witnesses to provide information to the building inspectorate remains; however, there are a whole range of requirements for such compulsion. The reason why witnesses were compelled to provide testimony to the ABCC was the lawlessness and intimidation on work sitesif you gave testimony to the ABCC, that would be it; it would be all over. You would not get work anymore. You would be harassed and intimidated. Hence, the coercive powers of the ABCC were put in place. You were compelled to give testimony-so you had no choice. Watering that down and removing it will simply take us back to the bad Un- old days. These requirements are nothing more than bureaucracy. They are designed to entrench and bog down the inspectorate and stop it from acting quickly to investigate any breaches. There is a switch-on and switch-off interrogation power, I guess like a light bulb. The bill creates the ability for said powers to be switched on or switched off. The position of independent assessor, special building industry powers, may, on application from stakeholders, make a determination that coercive interrogation powers will not apply. There have been 170 requests for right of entry in the last four weeks on one Rio Tinto site. Do you reckon the CFMEU is going to request that the powers be switched off? Do you think they will be good corporate citizens and say: ‘No, you keep them on. We have nothing to fear from the law. We obey the law, so we have nothing to fear. You keep them on'? Do you reckon that is going to happen, after 170 demands for work access in four weeks? It is absolutely and utterly outrageous. It is a neutered provision that will replace the ABCC. It is completely watered down. It is a payback to a union movement that helped the Labor government win. No other explanation can possibly make any sense. The economic good for the entire nation that has been achieved because of the ABCC and associated industrial legislation is beyond dispute. This is beyond reason. There is no other way to explain it. To water down the ABCC will simply take us back to a union controlled workplace. It will reduce productivity. It will increase inflationary pressure. It will reduce GDP. It will reduce output. It will affect the economy. Those are the outcomes from the legislation that Labor is putting in place. This legislation simply and utterly cannot be supported.",38
20,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"People who think there is no difference between the political parties ought to pay more attention to parliamentary debates. In particular they ought to pay more attention to this one on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2009, because it makes absolutely clear what a stark difference there is between the parties. The member for Fadden just described the CFMEU as akin to terrorists. He gives the game away. He and the other Liberal Party members simply cannot help themselves. The Liberal Party is still the party of Work Choices. The purpose of this bill is to implement the key recommendations of the Wilcox report on the transition to Fair Work Australia for the building and construction industry through amendments to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005. Some of the key amendments of the bill include the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the establishment of a new and separate regulator independent of the Fair Work Ombudsman to administer the amended regulatory framework for the building and construction industry. The bill abolishes the offices of the ABC Commissioner and the deputy commissioners. These will be replaced with a director. The definition of ‘building work' is amended to remove its coverage of off-site work, thereby focusing the scope of the inspectorate's operations on work on building sites. The bill also removes the existing building industry specific laws that provide higher penalties for building industry participants for breaches of industrial law and broader circumstances under which industrial action attracts penalties in relation to the building industry. An area of ongoing controversy has been the question of what are referred to as the coercive powers. The bill creates an office, the independent assessor, which, on application from stakeholders, may make a determination that the examination notice powers will not apply to a particular project-that is, that the coercive powers will be switched off for a particular project. In the event that a project where coercive powers have been switched off experiences industrial unlawfulness, the independent assessor may rescind or revoke the original decision, switching the powers back on based on the same criteria that were used when switching them off. The director may request that the independent assessor review the decision at any time based on changes in circumstances on a particular project. While the coercive powers have been retained, there are significant amendments to implement the Wilcox recommendations regarding external oversight, including that each use of the powers is dependent upon a presidential member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal being satisfied a case has been made for their use, that persons summonsed to interview may be represented by a lawyer of their choice and that their rights to refuse to disclose information on the grounds of legal professional privilege and public interest immunity will be recognised. I welcome these safeguards and the intention to sunset the coercive powers in five years time. I think it is important that House revisit the original, spurious premise for the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 and its regulator, the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner-that is, that we revisit the Cole royal commission, which was established in 2001. From the outset, the Howard government ensured, in setting the commission's terms of reference, that specific matters, like alleged union misconduct in the industry, received greater scrutiny than other matters. At the time, the establishment of the royal commission was not prompted by any particular issue or dispute in the building and construction industry. In fact, in research papers provided to the commission, the Australian construction industry ranked second or better in 16 of the 23 comparative international studies of the industry consulted by the researchers. On productivity specifically, Australia ranked second in five of the seven reports. On completion times, Australia ranked second in all studies. Finally, on cost per square metre, Australia was consistently rated as second lowest in all studies. This clearly demonstrated that the industry was internationally competitive, rather than one that required radical reform. A report by the Employment Advocate in May 2001 made allegations of union corruption, fraud and other illegality and construction industry. According to lawyers who closely observed the commission, none of the allegations contained in the Employment Advocate's report were borne out by evidence, and few of them were even aired in commission hearings. The bias of the commission was also apparent. Ninety per cent of hearing time was devoted to anti-union topics. Six hundred and sixty-three employers or their representatives gave evidence, but only 36 workers. Around three per cent of hearing time was spent dealing with allegations about the wrongdoing of employers. While the royal commission made numerous findings against employee organisations and individuals, very few were made against employers. The restrictive industrial action provisions that would later form an integral part of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act were based on contentious findings of the commission and on a small number of incidents of unprotected action within the context of the industry as a whole. It is difficult not to conclude that the establishment of the royal commission was essentially a political act that was more about Liberal Party ideology than sound economic policy. It was little more than a political exercise, using dubious findings to drive a strategy to undermine union influence in the construction and building industry and provide a smokescreen to justify the introduction of harsh anti-union measures. In recommending the establishment of an industry specific regime, the royal commission characterised the building and construction industry as singular due to its lawlessness, yet it did not make this judgment based on any comparison with other industries. As George Williams and Nicola MCGarrity indicated in their article entitled ‘The investigatory powers of the Australian building and construction commission' for the Australian in the building Journal of Labour Law: It is therefore unclear on what basis the Royal Commission could describe the building and construction industry as ‘singular'. Any differences between industries are likely to be a matter of degree. For example, there is nothing about the lawlessness identified by the royal commission, including breaches of the proper standards of occupational health and safety, application of inappropriate industrial pressure and threatening and intimidatory conduct, that is unique to the building and construction industry. The royal commission found that the existing non-industry specific bodies had inadequate powers to enforce Commonwealth industrial law. If this was true, then there was a problem that needed to be rectified for all industries and not simply in the field of building and construction. As Stewart argued in 2003: If these amendments are worth introducing, why aren't they worth introducing more generally? In the selectivity of its jurisdiction, the ABCC differed from other bodies possessing investigatory powers. The ACCC, for example, has jurisdiction over all persons and ganisations, regardless of the industry in which they work or operate, that contravene the Trade Practices Act. By contrast, we had created a body like the ABCC, whose jurisdiction was limited to a single industry, thereby establishing different sets of rules and rights for different workers and employers. It is worthwhile for the House to note that the CFMEU early this year received formal confirmation that the $66 million Cole royal commission resulted in only two prosecutions-one company prosecuted over strike pay and one union official prosecuted for giving false evidence. No union official or construction worker was prosecuted, let alone convicted, for corruption or criminality arising from the terms of reference for the royal commission. In recommending these construction industry laws, the commission also had a complete disregard for Australia's international obligations under ILO conventions to which Australia is a party. In fact, in November 2005 the ILO Committee on Freedom of Association found the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act breached ILO conventions 87 and 98 on freedom of association and collective bargaining. It is tant for the Australian government to fulfil its international obligations regarding our domestic industrial relations arrangements and to act as a leader by demonstrating a genuine substantive commitment to the principles of the ILO. As I have mentioned in the parliament before, the economic case for the Howard government's legislation was refuted by a paper co-authored by Griffith University Professor David Peetz called ‘Constructing figures: the mythology of productivity in the Australian building and construction industry', which pointed out fundamental flaws with the Econtech reports that were used to support the role of the Australian Building and Conor- struction Commissioner. In fact, in that report in reference to the fact that the construction industry is one of the most dangerous industries in the economy, the authors suggest: It may be that there may be greater economic benefits in focusing on effective occupational health and safety regimes in the industry. It is almost certainly the case that there would be greater social and ethical benefits in doing so. This is an important point because, since the introduction of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act, safety in the industry has deteriorated, with deaths having increased from 19 in 2004-05 to 40 in 200708. The lack of action to reduce workplace deaths and improve health and safety on construction sites was a damning indictment of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act and of the ABCC. There can be no case for allowing a deterioration in safety standards in the industry. The focus should be on lifting the standard of employer duty of care to ensure that workers' health and safety is protected. The ABCC failed to adequately deal with employers who broke the law or cut corners on safety. As has been noted in Creighton and Stewart's Labour imporLaw in reference to the 1969 O'Shea case: … excessive and insensitive use of enforcement procedures-especially procedures that do not accord adequate respect to the right of workers and unions to take industrial action to protect and promote their legitimate social and economic interests-may well be counter-productive both in terms of those who seek to use them and in terms of protecting the integrity of the system of which they are a part. The House should contrast the attitude of the Howard government on this issue to that of the Hawke and Keating governments. In pursuing industrial relations reform, the Hawke and Keating governments were successful in significantly increasing productivity the building industry. This was achieved by promoting a cooperative, non-discriminatory approach in workplace relations. The BCII Act and the ABCC are relics of an adversarial system. I do not think they have any place in a modern economy. Labour law should be balanced, promoting the interests of both employers and employees. We are at a time in our global economy where uniformity and flexibility are both necessary for our labour relations system. I refer to comments by Professor Andrew Stewart. In a submission to the Productivity Commission, he said: ‘The adoption of a national approach includes having laws which avoid unnecessary burdens or restrictions; are not unduly prescriptive; are accessible, transparent and accountable; are integrated and consistent with other laws including international standards.' What we should be striving for is a seamless national workplace relations system that is flexible and productive and that will respond effectively to the challenges as we emerge from the global financial crisis. These debates about industrial relations demonstrate the absolute bedrock of difference between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. The Liberal Party's belief in free markets, in market fundamentalism, is such that they believe in individual bargaining between employers and employees. The Labor Party, by contrast, believe that this is inhertroduction ently unfair. We believe that the inherent bargaining strength of employers needs to be leavened and some balance achieved, essentially in three ways. Firstly, we believe that there needs to be a right for employees to organise themselves and bargain collectively through trade unions. Secondly, we believe in the existence of an independent umpire who can resolve disputes. Thirdly, we believe that there needs to be certain minimum standards to protect those workers who have levels in the least bargaining power. This difference between the two parties was true 100 years ago and it remains true now. We saw it previously in the debate on the Fair Work Bill and we are seeing it here. The opposition have forever been on the lookout for opportunities to do away with the rights of trade unions, with the independent umpire and with the legislated minimum standards. These are precisely the matters which drove Work Choices, which was a key factor in costing the coalition the election in 2007. Many of those opposite know perfectly well that this is what cost them the election in 2007, so they are now torn and conflicted. The fact is that there are many of those opposite whose mood remains defiant. Deep down in their hearts they still believe in Work Choices, and one of the odd things about their view of the world is that it has led to more regulation rather than less. In the case of Work Choices we saw a massive bill of over 1,000 pages designed to restrict employees, trade unions and indeed employers with yards of red tape. You would think that their view of the world would lead to less regulation but, in fact, it led to more. The final point I want to make about the history in relation to this issue is that, since the time of the Keating government, Labor's modern view of the needs of the workforce and needs in workplaces has been that of enterprise bargaining. I believe that the inof enterprise bargaining has been a great success. It led to productivity improvements far in excess of those which occurred during the period of Work Choices, and I believe that that is the right way to go for industrial relations in this country-that we look to a cooperative model of industrial relations and we look to a model focused around bargaining at the enterprise level. I commend the bill to the House.",42
21,Mr ABBOTT,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"Warringah) (11.09 am)Let me begin my contribution to this debate by reminding members that workplace reform was one of the greatest achievements of the Howard government. Workplace relations reform in part contributed to the golden age of posterity which this country enjoyed from the middle 1990s until quite recently. In particular, workplace relations reform helped to achieve the marvellous outcomes of more than two million new jobs, a 20 per cent increase in real wages and-this is very important-a reduction in industrial disputation to the lowest level since records were first kept back in 1913. Let me be very clear about this. Industrial disputation helps no-one. Industrial disputation has to be at the very least a last resort. Strikes cost jobs, strikes hurt workers, strikes mean that a whole lot of people are out of pocket and inconvenienced, and no-one ought to argue that strikes are anything other than a blight on our economy and on the prospects of the decent working people of this country. Members opposite in the course of this debate have alluded to the former government's Work Choices industrial legislation. Work Choices did not cost the former government the election; it was the temporary abolition of the no disadvantage test which, more than anything else, cost the former government the election-and Work Choices was far more than just that. We are here today to talk about the government's building and construction legislation in the form of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2009. When I became the workplace relations minister back in 2001, it was hard not to notice that the majority of strikes took place in the commercial construction sector, particularly in two states, Victoria and Western Australia. In those two states the rule of law had become the law of the jungle. In 2001 I established the Cole royal commission to inquire into the commercial construction industry, particularly in those two states. The finding of the Cole royal commission that this industry was marked by coercion, collusion and intimidation was substantially confirmed by the subsequent inquiry conducted by Justice Wilcox, commissioned by the current government. The result of the royal commission was the establishment of an interim task force to police and enforce the rule of law in the commercial construction sector and that eventually became the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. As Justice Wilcox found in his recent inquiry, there are still problems in the commercial construction sector but, thanks to the work of the royal commission, the interim task force and the ABCC, there has been an improvement bordering on a transformation. Labour productivity in the commercial construction sector is up by 20 per cent. The cost differential between commercial and housing construction has dropped from 15 per cent to an almost negligible two per cent. Industrial disputation in the commercial construction sector has dropped from the highest in the country to almost negligible levels. The difference between the industrial environments in which the EastLink project was constructed in Melbourne and in which the CityLink project was constructed just a little while earlier demonstrates the impact that the whole Cole royal commission process has had. As a result of all this there has been a boost to national economic output estimated, given the size of the sector, at more than $5 billion a year. It is appropriate in the course of this debate to put on record my, and I hope the parliament's, gratitude to some of the key figures in this whole process: not only Justice Terry Cole, who was subjected to large and violent demonstrations when he was conducting his hearings, but also Nigel Hadgkiss, the former senior policeman who was the head of interim task force, and later John Lloyd, a former distinguished public servant and then Australian Industrial Relations Commission deputy president who took on the job of heading up the ABCC. These are fine Australians and their work has done great things for a very important industry and for the decent, honest people trying to earn living within it. The essence of the success of the Office the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner has been a significant staff of investigators, many of whom have experience of real policing, and, most importantly, the power to compel witnesses. This is particularly important for employers. Given the climate of intimidation which long existed in this sector, it was almost impossible under the previous arrangements to get hard evidence of breaches of the law. The people who knew about the breaches of the law simply would not appear. The workers were frightened of physical intimidation and the businesses were frightened of commercial retribution. This is why these coercive powers, the powers to compel witnesses, are so important. Once these powers were in place the companies-that had previously been terrified of commercial payback should they tell the law enforcement authorities of what they knew-could not ignore the laws that said that they had to give evidence. The real problem with the government's legislation is that it essentially makes these coercive powers impossible to exercise. This is the great payback to the union movement. The coercive powers that meant that the dark secrets in this sector had to come out are ing essentially taken away, or at least made almost impossible to exercise, as a result of the legislation before the House. The Rudd government pre election promised a tough cop on the beat. It said that there would always be the rule of law in this sector but, as has so often happened, that pre-election promise has turned out to be just more spin from a Prime Minister who has proven himself to be an absolute master in the arts of political deception. What this bill shows is that the tough cop is on the high road to becoming a toothless tiger. I know that there are many decent mema bers sitting opposite us in this House. Minister Martin Ferguson, who is at the table, is of of course a person of integrity, principle and long experience in the union movement. Decent members of the union movement know what was going on in this sector. They have no truck with the kind of people who enforce right of entry at the point of a crowbar, as we saw happen just a few years ago in Melbourne. Yet they have been dragged into this legislation by their leader's need to appease a union movement which has been so important to his campaigning success. The problem with this bill is that it puts decent workers, decent unionists and decent businesses at more risk than they have been. It removes the protections that have been there for them at least since the establishment of the ABCC back in 2006. My problem with this legislation is not that the government have capitulated to the shop assistants union or that they have capitulated to the Australian Workers Union. They have not even capitulated to the forestry division of the CFMEU. But they have capitulated to the construction division of the CFMEU, the most militant, the most lawless and the most violent union in this country. In essence, this is Kevin Reynolds's bill. That is what this bill is. It is payback for Kevin beReynolds. It is payback for the support that the militant unions have given to the government. This is thoroughly bad legislation. It will be opposed by the coalition both here and in another place because it makes the decent workers and the honest businesses of the construction sector of this country much less safe than they deserve to be.",46
22,Mr DREYFUS,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"The Liberal Party are still the party of Work Choices. This is the only conclusion that the Australian people can draw from the Liberal Party's opposition to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2009. The Liberal Party have demonstrated their continuing commitment to Work Choices by their speeches in this House and indeed by their disallowance in the Senate of the government's direction to the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. The Independent senators and the Greens recognised the mandate that this government received at the last election to abolish Work Choices. That is why they supported the Fair Work Bill when it passed through this parliament on 20 March this year. The government has an equally strong mandate for this bill because the Labor Party took a firm and clear commitment to the Australian people, which was to abolish the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner and to transfer its responsibilities specialist fair work inspectorate from 1 February 2010, and that is what this bill does. The bill of course contains a set of provisions which will put in place a procedurally fair and appropriate form of regulation for the Australian building and construction industry, one which fits within the framework of the Fair Work Act. It has been extraordinary to listen to the speeches that have been made in this House for-I think it is fair to say-the hysterical tone which has been adopted by those opposite in respect of this industry. The aspect of the bill that I want to speak to particularly is the preservation, for the time being, of coercive powers. As the minister explained in her second reading speech, the reason why coercive powers have been retained in the framework of legislation that is here being put forward is that former Justice Wilcox in his report, which was a very considered report following a process of a discussion paper, wide consultation throughout the Australian community and written submissions from all interested parties, concluded that there was still a need for coercive powers in a limited form to be retained in the framework of regulation that is going to go forward for the building and construction industry. Justice Wilcox commented that the continuation of coercive powers is not, as has been suggested by a number of people commenting, entirely outside the framework of the Australian legal system-far from it. Coercive powers are to be found in a range of different acts of this parliament. One could point to coercive powers that are given, for example, to the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission or indeed the coercive power that is exercised every day by courts in this country, which is the sending of a subpoena to witnesses. The particular coerto a cive powers that are in question here are ones which, Mr Wilcox expressed the opinion, were needed for some further time. What this bill recognises, by two provisions, is that the government and the Labor Party envisage that a time will come when coercive powers will be no longer needed in the Australian building and construction industry. The way in which this bill recognises that end result, if you like, is by first of all imposing a sunset provision which sunsets the coercive powers at the end of five years from 1 February 2010. The second way in which this bill recognises that coercive powers may fade away and be no longer part of the industrial relations scene and no longer applicable to the building and construction industry is that the powers will be able to be switched off for particular projects. It is recognised in this bill that starting 1 February 2010, which is when the new regime will apply and when this legislation is passed through this parliament, while projects that have been commenced before 1 February 2010 will continue to be covered by coercive powers, it will be possible for particular projects to have the powers switched off. That is something that an independent assessor will look at. I would expect that over time it will become commonplace for these coercive powers to be recognised as not necessary for particular projects. I would expect that, in entire regions of Australia, quite quickly we will get to a position where it is simply a matter of course that the coercive powers will be able to be switched off and that there will be no special regime applying for those projects or in those areas because it will be accepted that they are not needed. In both of those respects, this bill recognises that coercive powers are not going to be with us forever. It recognises the unusual nature of these coercive powers and reflects appropriately the reluctance that this parliament should always have to impose this kind of regime on any part of the Australian economy, any particular industry or any group of Australians. They are extraordinary powers. They need to be recognised as extraordinary powers and it should be recognised that they should only be introduced in circumstances where they are absolutely required. This is something that Justice Wilcox has given very long and earnest consideration to. The government, in legislating in the way that it has in this bill, is accepting that long and earnest consideration given to the subject by Mr Wilcox. It should also be pointed out that there is an extensive set of safeguards that are to accompany the coercive powers which are to continue to be employed in the Australian on building and construction industry. They include: - use of the powers is dependent on a presidential member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal being satisfied a case has been made for their use,The next point is perhaps the most important of all of these safeguards in the exercise of these coercive powers: - persons required to attend an interview may be represented by a lawyer of their choice and their right to claim legal privilege and public interest immunity will be recognised, - persons required to attend an interview will be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses, - all interviews are to be videotaped and undertaken by the director or their deputy, - the Commonwealth Ombudsman will monitor and review all interviews and provide reports to the parliament on the exercise of this power, andas I have mentioned- the powers will be subject to a five-year sunset clause. In all of those respects there is a recognition of the extraordinary nature of these coercive powers, there is a recognition that the time in which these powers are going to continue to be employed is going to be a limited one, and there is a recognition that because of the extraordinary nature of these powers it is entirely appropriate that they be accompanied by safeguards which will deliver procedural fairness and, in a very real sense, the rule of law in this area. Having dealt with one of the more contentious areas of the bill, I again want to deal with another step that has been taken by those opposite which reflects just how clearly they are the party of Work Choices. It is something which was dealt with by the minister in her second reading speech: what is to occur in the interim before this legislathose tion takes effect. In her speech introducing this legislation, the Deputy Prime Minister said that she was going to make a direction under the existing legislation to the Office the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. The Deputy Prime Minister did just that and made such a direction, which went to the manner in which the existing powers of the Building and Construction Commissioner were to be exercised. The response of those opposite and the step taken by the Liberal Party in the Senate on 25 June to an entirely appropriate direction given by the minister as foreshadowed in her second reading speech was to move, regrettably successfully, for disallowance of that direction. That disallowance confirms that the Liberal Party is still the party of Work Choices. As I said, that direction was made under the existing act. It relates to the manner of the exercise of powers until the ABCC is abolished with effect from 1 February next year. The direction is entirely consistent the Wilcox recommendations on the coercive powers. The direction does not affect the investigative, compliance or prosecution powers of the ABCC and it does not take away any of the coercive powers that are presently vested in the ABCC. The direction does introduce a measure of procedural fairness and decency in the exercise of those coercive powers, and it is that measure of procedural fairness and decency which those opposite reject. They do not want fairness and decency in the industrial relations system of this country. They wish for a return to Work Choices; they make that clear every time they speak on this subject, they made that clear in the Senate by disallowing this ministerial direction and they continue to make it clear by their opposition to this bill. It is worth pausing for a moment to look at what was rejected in this direction by opposite. Again, to give it context, this is a direction to the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner about how in the interim before the commission is abolished of on 1 February next year he is to go about exercising the coercive powers. The first of those was a very simple direction to permit a legal representative-no more than that-to sit and speak with someone who is being made the subject of these coercive powers, to permit a legal representative to speak on behalf of that person and-shock, horror!-to be given the time and privacy to consult and advise that person. Those opposite do not believe in legal representation, they believe that workers should be deprived of legal representation, and that is the effect of what they have done in disallowing this direction. Because it is absolutely representative of the attitudes of those opposite I want to mention the other four elements of this very simple direction, which in no way cut across the continued use of these coercive powers but which do set appropriate conditions for the with use of those powers. The next alarming direction that the Deputy Prime Minister gave to the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner was to comply with the Commonwealth's obligation to act as a model litigant, and apparently that, too, is seen as some vast lessening of power and as interference with the regime of industrial relations that applies to the building industry. The third requirement was to give those who are affected by the coercive powers a reasonable opportunity to raise an objection in an appropriate court or tribunal. Again, reflective of the fact that those opposite do not believe in the rule of law or any opportunity to test the lawfulness of the conduct of a Commonwealth official, that, too, has been rejected by them. The final direction which has been rejected by those opposite was to introduce, as a means of ensuring that there is procedural fairness in the use of these coercive powers hereafter, the procedure where it would be necessary for the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner to provide to a presidential member of the AAT a report describing how he proposed to use the coercive powers against particular persons, describing what was sought to be achieved by the use of the coercive powers, the likely effect on the person of the use of the coercive powers and the time within which this was all going to be done, and the requirement specified-this was far too much fairness and appropriate procedure for those opposite-that the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner was to ‘consider any advice received' from the nominated presidential member of the AAT before proceeding further to exercise those coercive powers. Again we have it clearly stated, by the speeches in this House on this bill and the rejection and disallowance of the minister's direction in the Senate, that the Liberal Party is the party of Work Choices and wishes to reinstate Work Choices in every sense and continue with the harsh regime of industrial relations that was introduced in 2005. It is a party which does not believe in checks and balances or procedural fairness. It is a party which does not believe that workers should have rights. I would call on those opposite to respect the decision made by the Australian people in November 2007 to replace the Howard government with a government committed to the repeal of Work Choices and the replacement of the Australian Building and Construction Commission with a new body, because-be in no doubt-the same clarity of commitment to repeal Work Choices was shown in the clarity of the commitment that the Australian Labor Party took to the people at the last election, which was to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. We have honoured that first commitment to repeal Work Choices and replace it with a fairer industrial relations system, which is what we see in the Fair Work Act that has now come into force. Refusal to pass this bill will prevent the government from honouring the second major commitment made in the industrial relations area, which was to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Refusal to pass this bill condemns the opposition as what they are: the party of Work Choices.",48
23,Mr RANDALL,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"I am here today to speak on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2009. Sadly, this is a bill that completely waters down the strong regulatory regime put in place by the previous government over the thuggish building and construction unions. The building and construction industry is led by one of the most militant unions in this country. We have all seen them on TV, and the Cole royal commission, which I will go into shortly, provided some home truths about the blatant disregard for the law held by the unions, particularly the CFMEU. Here the government wants to amend the law to water down the powers and independence of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, or ABCC, the construction industry watchdog or ‘tough cop'. Before I go any further and while the member is still in the chamber, I would just like to point out that he does need to actually get it right. The commitment from the Labor Party in opposition was that they would not get rid of the ABCC. In fact, the minister quite categorically said that she would not do this and would allow there to be the ‘cop on the beat'. You need to tell the truth in this place and not mislead, because that is just not true. The ABCC was established by the former coalition government following the recommendations made by the independent royal commission, which found that lawlessness, intimidation and corruption were rife in the building and construction sector. The coalition government wanted to ensure that there was a strong cop on the beat to stop this unlawful behaviour, improve working conditions, protect the rule of law and dramatically increase productivity. That this: the dramatic increase in productivity. While Labor promised-I again reiterate: they promised-to retain the ‘tough cop' attitude, maintain the full powers of the ABCC, as I remind the member, until February next year and carry through existing principles to the specialist inspectorate divirelations sion of Fair Work Australia, it is once again all spin and no substance. The minister sneakily issued a directive on 17 June limiting the powers of the ABCC from August. This was not the deal that was subsequently disallowed in the Senate. From next year, the watchdog will be moved to the specialist inspectorate at Fair Work Australia. This legislation provides the minister with greater powers, restricts the independence of the inspectorate compared to the ABCC as it is now, reduces the penalties for unlawful behaviour and really makes coercive powers optional. The watered-down version pays only lip service to the strong principles the ABCC was founded on-not surprising from a minister who, as a lawyer at Slater and Gordon, was once employed to represent the interests of the militant unions that the ABCC has now clamped down on. Under this legislation, penalties for not obeyproductivity ing the law are drastically reduced and previously unlawful action is now acceptable. The bill allows for construction laws to be switched on or off for particular building sites. If people were already following the law, there would be no need to vary the laws at a whim, would there? Is this really Minister Gillard taking a tough stance against militant construction unions? It is not. In fact, it is just laughable. This is really Labor thanking its mates the unions for helping it win the last election and funding it with in excess of $30 million in that campaign, so this is payback time: ‘We'll help you because you got us $30 million to run the last election and now, because you've given us the dough, is the key to we're going to help you.' The coalition cannot support the watering down of this watchdog. We cannot afford a return to the dark old days of workplace unrest, strikes, bullyboy tactics, coercion and organisations looking after their mates. Labor's plans could set Australian workplace back decades and certainly will hurt our economy. We must make sure that unlawful activity, intimidation and threats do not return to the building and construction industry-or, if they do, that there is a strong enough body to take them on. The Master Builders Association chief, Wilhelm Harnisch, said: The specific building and construction industry reformshe was referring to the ABCChave assisted the building and construction industry to increase productivity, bring industrial harmony and to provide benefits to employers and employees. Labor is hell-bent on reversing this position and taking Australia back in time, as I have said. Before the 2007 election, Minister Gillard indicated that the existing laws had ‘balanced the rights of employers and unions' and that Labor did not want to jeopardise this or cause industrial unrest. That is what she said before the election, and what is she doing now? The abolition of the ABCC and the watering down of its powers will not only encourage industrial unrest but also destroy productivity. The coalition supports the retention of the ABCC, as you can see from all the speakers on our side today. The outcomes it has produced for the industry and the economyand this, I might add, is supported by Econtech research-speak for themselves. These are some of the figures produced by Econtech: a10 per cent increase in industrial productivity; massive reductions in industrial disputes by 91.9 per cent to record lows; and increases in average weekly earnings for workers in the construction sector between 2004 and 2007 of 25½ per cent, compared to 15.7 per cent for all other industries. It has improved the levels of health and safety, and I want you to remember this about the safety aspect when I come to it shortly. There was a 7.3 per cent productivity gain in commercial building relative to residential building since 2004. Not only has the ABCC been effective in maintaining a degree of harmony but it is overwhelmingly cost effective. In fact, it costs the taxpayers a relatively meagre $32 million per year but returns $5.5 billion in terms of economic gain-in other words, $167 generated for each dollar spent by this administration. But the bottom line is that we have a more workable and effective body to watch and manage the industry, and that is why the unions hate the ABCC. Unions lost their control, their tight grip on power, and they were suddenly accountable and held responsible for all the things that these people had gotten away with for years-the unconscionable conduct. Under the previous Labor government, the average number of working days lost to strikes per year was 22.6 per thousand employees-I repeat, 22.6 working days per thousand employees. In September 2007, by way of comparison, this was down from 22.6 working days to a negligible 1.2 working days per thousand employees. What a vast improvement! But, as we know, with 70 per cent of the Labor Party's front bench being ex-union officials and with union spending in excess of $30 million in Labor's campaign, it is clear why the unions are getting an absolute armchair ride on this bill. By neutering the ABCC, Labor is simply reinforcing the long standing belief that they are more interested in looking after their mates than in maintaining law and order and protecting local jobs. There is nothing more important than creating and sustaining jobs. In fact, 2.2 million jobs were created under the coalition's watch, with around 60 per cent of them being full-time positions, unlike the casualisation that is going on now. Labor inherited an unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent. In 1996, Labor had left us with a rate of 8.1 per cent. So that is the difference. We inherited 8.1 per cent in 1996. They hit Lotto: they had 4.3 per cent when they assumed government. Real wages increased under the coalition by 21.5 per cent, compared to them actually decreasing by 1.8 per cent under the 13 years of the previous Labor government. In fact, you will recall former Prime Minister Bob Hawke bragging about the accord and driving down wages. Unemployment in my electorate got down to 4.1 per cent, compared to 8.4 per cent in December 2004, when I became the member for Canning. Canning, particularly the younger population of Canning, is susceptible to higher levels of unemployment, and that is where government energy should be focused, not on handing back power to the union thugs. Paul Kelly wrote in the Australian a while ago: … standing immovable is Labor's support for greater trade union power, more costly restriction on employers, a greater role for the revamped commission, an effective end to individual statutory contacts, a revival of arbitration, and a sharp weakening of direct employer and non-union employee bargaining. And this is what businesses are up against. As an aside, I would like to mention that I recently spoke at a local Gosnells Small Business and Tourism Association breakfast. A number of those business owners raised their grave concerns to me about the government's Fair Work changes. It is a bit Orwellian, isn't it-fair work changes? Small business is the lifeblood of the Australian economy, and, while I am pleased that Canning has a raft of small businesses, unfortunately many of these businesses' trading conditions have never been tougher. Yet in these tough economic times the government is trying to make it even harder for them these archaic workplace reforms. As we said previously, the ABCC was established under the independent royal commission by Mr Justice Cole, and he found extensive evidence of disgraceful lawlessness, intimidation and thuggery in the construction sector. Before I go on, the member for Wills, as they do on that side, called Cole royal commission biased. What a disgrace. Not only do they besmirch Mr Cole himself but here is a 22-volume report, well researched and the benchmark of industrial harmony going forward in this country, which those on the other side-and the member for Wills said it the other day-said it was a biased report. It is a disgrace that they would try and drag his reputation through the mud. Commissioner Cole's report was tabled in 2003. The report found that the industry was rife with lawlessness. In fact, there were more than 100 types of unlawful behaviour, which included the following: favouritism for union members, widespread industrial pressure and taking and making inappropriate and questionable payments. I remind the House that I recently raised concerns about the issue of the Australian Workers Union but was swiftly interrupted by the member for Bruce. The issue I raised in the House here, can I inform the House, has now been taken up by the Australian Electoral Commission, and they are investigating an unusual slush fund in and around the Alcoa worksites in my electorate. I will be looking forward to the AEC's report on their investigations of these so-called site allowance moneys and where they went. I continue: the commission found unlawful strikes, the rorting of employers, threatening and intimidating conduct, disregard for laws and regulations at all levels, actions by unions-particularly the CFMEU-to regulate the industry, and unions pressuring govwith ernment departments. Does the government really want to return to this sort of behaviour? I am sure there are a lot of responsible members of integrity on the other side who really do not want to return to those days of lawlessness. Labor seems intent on taking the construction sector back to the past, where thuggery and militant construction the unions prevailed over the rule of law. Being a Western Australian, I am all too familiar with the antics of the CFMEU's selfproclaimed heavyweights in the likes of Joe MCDonald and Kevin Reynolds. The type of behaviour uncovered by the Cole royal commission was seen in eight minutes of footage from an ABCC worksite, which he had entered illegally, where he was hurling obscenities and threatening bosses and workers who would not join the union. In the earlier Forward with Fairness legislation, I spoke about union bosses claiming bogus safety issues to get themselves on a worksite and then wreaking havoc on that site. After his re-election in Western Australia, Kevin Reynolds, in his Che Guevara T-shirt and wearing bib and brace overalls, claimed that he had a mandate for militancy and it seems the Deputy Prime Minister could be giving him the green light by dismantling the ABCC. Mr Martin Ferguson interjecting",51
24,Mr RANDALL,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"He's a cute little bloke, isn'the! Both Joe and Kevin worked on the Canning Vale polling booth at one of my elections. And by the way, Joe MCDonald wouldn't pay a bet he had with me; he still owes me $20. In May 2007, Joe MCDonald made his position about the ABCC pretty clear: I live for the day when (the ABCC staff) are working at Hungry Jack's or Fast Eddy's or Kentucky Fried Chicken. That is what's waiting for them. They're all ex-policemen and they can go and do whatever ex-coppers do. I'd suggest that John Lloyd and his mates will be unemployed before I will be. I wonder if he got a wink and a nod from the minister to be able to say that. Kevin Reynolds likened the ABCC to the Gestapo, and Dean Mighell said the creation of the ABCC was a stunt by the coalition government. They will all be jumping with joy now when this legislation goes through the House-if it does. In April of this year, the ABCC reported intimidation and cost blowouts increasing. Shouldn't this be all the more reason for its retention? In Western Australia, the Director of the Master Builders Association made the point that if $2 billion in state government infrastructure projects were blown out by just 5 per cent because of union antics, this would waste $100 million of taxpayers' money. I do not think our state can afford to waste this sort of money when we are all screaming for more infrastructure and essential services like policemen, teachers and nurses. An April editorial in the Australian hit the nail on the head, when it said: Julia Gillard says the ABCC will be replaced in January with a new unit to watch the industry. Good, but not good enough. The ABCC and the powers it possesses should stay. I know those on the other side like watching. With regard to the coercive powers in the legislation, basically the government wants to be able to compel at convenience. Coercive interrogation powers are able to be switched off on the order of the independent assessor. So we know that one site could have powers initiated on them and then, at a whim, they could be switched off again. It is one site on and one site off. It will be very all interesting to see how this ever stacks up in law. While the government gives the appearance that they are not completely caving into the unions by retaining the so-called coercive interrogation powers, it is really nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to hide the fact that the powers are so bogged down in red tape that they will rarely be used. It is important to remember that these powers exist for a reason. Powers available under the current laws to compel witnesses to give evidence are needed to provide protection to those people who want to give evidence to the ABCC without the fear of payback or retribution by the union for having done soand it was very clearly pointed out by the member for Warringah in his speech why coercive powers are needed. In fact, the ABCC Commissioner, Mr Lloyd, recently said that he had no reservations about his power to use coercive powers because people preferred that in order to give testimony rather than feel the wrath of the union should they be seen to be cooperating. So of course they would love to give evidence. When it was voluntary before and there was a show of hands and they could be identified, we knew that they were penalised for doing so. Existing powers are capable of being used against everyone in the sector-employees and employers. Even Justice Wilcox, who was asked by Minister Gillard to report on the powers of the ABCC, recognised that the investigative powers are integral to ensuring that law and order is maintained in the construction sector. These powers would not be necessary if the sector had the same culture and history as normal, everyday workplaces. The truth is that construction is a special case. Labor has no real intentions of creating a tough cop overseer or being tough on the construction unions. The Deputy Prime Minister said: A future Rudd Labor Government will not tolerate intimidation or violence by any party in the building and construction industry. The practices of the past are not part of Labor's future dustrial relations. Labor promised it would maintain the existing ABCC arrangements until February 2010, but we should not be surprised that this government says one thing and does another. It is racking up quite a long list of backflips on commitments. While the minister talks tough, the reality is that the unions have already won this debate as the proposed act reduces the penalties for unlawful action and gives a green light for a return to the bad old days. Claims that the ABCC has affected occupational health and safety levels are also misguided. ABCC Commissioner John Lloyd has stated: The ABCC is committed to do all it can to improve the industry's poor occupational health and safety record and to support those specifically charged with this task … As the member for Mayo said in his contribution to this House, it is the state governments who actually administer this, and where were the state Labor governments when occupational health and safety was an issue? The truth is that the independent building industry police are in real danger of losing their powers, losing their independence and being nothing more than a token body with no ability to stop a return to lawlessness and intimidation on the building sites of Australia.",55
25,Mrs GASH,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2009 is all about neutering an agency that was making a difference in addressing a dysfunctional industrial culture that has been synonymous with the construction industry in Australia. It is a bill representing the pay off to the building unions for their generous support in getting the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, across the line. The for inAustralian Building and Construction Commission represents an effective response to the decades of banditry that the building industry was forced to endure. The Master Builders Association says this: The building industry has enjoyed unprecedented industrial harmony and improvements in productivity following the five years that the ABCC has been in existence. These benefits are measured at $5.5 billion per annum and are particularly important in the current economic circumstances to help the government's strategy to lift the Australian economy out of recession. The dilution of the powers that were vested in the ABCC will place a greater reliance on the assumption that these maverick unions will continue to play fairly. That is a big call, and you need only look at the history of the building unions in Australia to gather a sense of foreboding that that is not going to happen. The Master Builders Association has reported significant improvements in efficiencies since the advent of the ABCC: The Econtech Construction Industry Productivity 2009 report card shows that there have been significant improvements across a range of productivity measures including a 6.2 per cent productivity gain in commercial building relative to residential building since 2004. There has also been a 9.4 per cent addition to labour productivity in the construction industry due to the ABCC and other associated reforms, and a 10.2 per cent outperformance in the construction industry labour productivity compared to predictions based on historical performance to 2002. Those statistics cannot be denied, yet this government is prepared to sacrifice the gains made on the back of political expediency. And of course there have been attempts to discredit the Econtech research. For instance, the Mitchell report and another report said that gaps in costs between domestic and commercial building costs were due to factors other than restrictive work practices; the second says there was no gap in the first place. These attempts to attack the ABCC and the hard facts that it has improved sector productivity are nothing more than union propaganda hiding behind a veil of easily discredited academic research. Econtech compares costs of the same tasks in the same states over time, and does not attempt to cherry-pick the figures to suit union or minority interest group needs. Richard Bunting, a partner at Blake Dawson, suggested that the ABCC legislation was not a result of any new or recent industrial misbehaviour. He said successive federal and state governments, both coalition and ALP, have found it necessary to deal with the very poor industrial relations in the building and construction industry, including an industrial culture which from time to time has involved considerable lawlessness. He went on: It is well known that there was considerable dustrial misbehaviour involving officials and some of the members of the Builders Labourers Federation in the 1970s and early 1980s. The BLF was deregistered as a consequence in 1974 and only registered again in 1976 after giving specific undertakings to abide by decisions of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and to participate fully in the prevention and settlement of disputes through conciliation and arbitration. In 1981, the Victorian and Commonwealth governments announced a royal commission into the Builders Labourers Federation. The royal commissioner was Mr John Winneke QC. His subsequent 1982 report into activities of the Australian Building Employees and Builders Labourers Federation recommended prosecution of various persons. In March 1983, following the election of the federal Labor government, further BLF deregistration proceedings were adjourned. The federal government subsequently withdrew as an applicant in the deregistration proceedings after the BLF gave certain undertakings about its industrial behaviour. However, in 1986 the Labor government deregistered the BLF for five years and similar action was taken by the New South Wales and Victorian governments around the same time. The further development of industry unions in the late 1980s and early 1990s ultimately resulted in the principal industrial coverage for building industry employees being assumed by the CFMEU and to a lesser extent by the AWU. In the early 1990s a New South Wales government royal commission into the state's building and construction industry, the Gyles royal commission, recommended the establishment of a task force in New South Wales to examine and investigate illegal activities in the industry. The task force commenced operation in 1991 and continued until mid1996. The Gyles royal commission's 1992 infinal report summarised the commissioner's views as follows: The public and confidential submissions received, with very few exceptions, identify and complain about various aspects of union militancy. The complaints were from so many disparate sources and are so consistent that they amount to a powerful body of evidence in themselves to establish the proposition that the conduct of the members and officials of the former BWIU (NSW Branch) severely affect productivity and efficiency of the industry in this State, both because of the persistent disruption of projects and businesses and because of the restrictive work practices instituted and defended whilst work is actually proceeding. The evidence reveals nothing less than industrial anarchy in which any pretence of the rule of law or the application of principle has been abandoned. Mr Gyles recommended the deregistration of the BWIU. Ultimately, the application to pursue deregistration of the union was withdrawn and the union gave various undertakings, including to operate within the law and to comply with the NSW code of practice. There were some similar developments and attempts at imposing more orderly industrial relations for the building and construction industry in other states. For example, in Western Australia a building industry task force operated between 1993 and 2001. At Commonwealth level, Mr Terence Cole QC was appointed by the federal government in August 2001 as a royal commissioner to inquire into certain matters relating to the building and construction industry throughout Australia. The Cole royal commission cost the Australian taxpayer over $60 million. Yet here we have a move to start the reversal process taking us back to the bad old days. I did see newspaper reports recently reporting that the Rudd government was talking tough, but really, is that just show? I think it is. Their intent was clearly expressed in the course of the 2007 campaign where they vowed to ‘roll back' tough new laws that were prickling the unions. The public cannot be misled by the show of fabricated dissent between the unions and the Rudd government. After all, Mr Rudd promised the unions. It beggars belief that he would dishonour such a significant promise made to his paymasters. What I anticipate is the continued dilution of this agency, whatever form it takes, to the point of eventual redundancy. I am just not buying the line that this government is going to seriously oppose the will of the unions, and neither should any freethinking individual. The Australian on 6 July quoted the Prime Minister as saying: This government will not tolerate violence, threats of violence, or intimidation in any part of the industry. Yet this is just what is beginning to happen in my electorate of Gilmore. When you take into account previous tough talk on grocery prices, petrol prices and reining in the banks, you have got to take this latest resolution with a very large grain of salt. I am betting a secret deal has already been stitched up and all we are witnessing is a very well-rehearsed public show of false indignation. After 2010, all bets will be off and the watchdog will be as effective as Labor's much-vaunted petrol commissioner. Despite the wide acknowledgement that there is still a lot to be done, this bill is, candidly, premature if the health of the industry is the prime objective. Justice Murray Wilcox, in his report Transition to Fair Work Australia for the building and construction industry, said that the ABCC should remain in place for at least another five years. He was quoted as saying that there was still work to be done to restore industrial sanity in the sector. Yet the government dismisses the recommendation of its own appointee and starts the process of dilution. It is inevitable that under the hand of this government the ABCC copy will certainly remain, if only as a symbol of toughness. What appears to be happening is a concoction of semantics in the bill that creates the impression of toughness but in fact will be hampered by red tape sufficient to frustrate the process, again adding to the costs of anyone with a genuine concern. It is a clayton's bill that sets out to appease the public without actually doing anything. Mr Deputy Speaker, just listen to this: penalties for not obeying the law are diluted; previous unlawful action is now acceptable; and provisions are made for switching off the laws, when it suits, for specific building sites. On 18 September last year, in an interview at the National Press Club, the minister, Julia Gillard, was asked a question by Nick Butterly from the West Australian. He asked: You've said that the ABCC will remain in place until 2010. But can you just guarantee the powers of the ABCC will not be watered down before then, either by a carbon in staffing or by other methods? And also, what do you make of this push within Caucus to defame the ABCC before 2010? What did the minister-and I notice the minister sitting opposite me at the table-say in reply? I can guarantee we'll deliver on our election commitment, which is that the ABCC will stay until 31 January 2010, with all of its powers and all of its budget. I can confirm we'll deliver on our election commitment that on 1 February 2010 it will be replaced by a specialist inspectorate within Fair Work Australia. The implications are clear: in six months time it is all over, replaced with a toothless tiger. I am of the view that, until such time as it is clear that the culture of lawlessness that dominated the industry for decades is firmly behind us, the ABCC must remain in place and intact. The worth of the ABCC has been well demonstrated in the performance figures of the construction sector since its inception. Emerging as we are from the effects of the global financial crisis, why do we need to compromise opportunities for recovery which, the government has signalled, will take several years? The government has not demonstrated a clear case that would justify this bill, other than a promise made to the unions. As I said earlier, the dilution of the commission is premature and unwarranted on the evidence. That is why powers available under the current laws to compel witnesses to give evidence are needed to provide protection to those people who want to give evidence to the ABCC without fear of payback and retribution. Existing powers are capable of being used against everyone in the sector, both employees and employers. Existing investigation powers are not unique; they are akin to that other powers widely available to other Commonwealth agencies and under other budget, cuts Commonwealth laws. The proposed restrictions on investigation powers are cumbersome and will prevent them from being used effectively due to the vast amounts of red tape that must be cut through before they can be used. Even Justice Wilcox, who was asked by Julia Gillard to report on the powers of the ABCC, recognised that the investigative powers are integral to ensuring that law and order is maintained in the construction sector. Special investigation powers unique to the building and construction sector would not be necessary if the sector had the same culture and history of normal, everyday workplaces. On a local level, the advent of the Fair Work legislation has seen a move back to the bad old days. Right of entry powers are being used, and not with good intent, and those businesses affected are fearful, again, of retribution by those representing the unions. Until this culture changes, and it may take a generation, the need for such legislation remains, and that is why I am opposing this bill.",56
26,Ms GILLARD,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion) (12.12 pm)-in reply-I rise to sum up this debate on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2009. This bill is about three things: it is about delivering on the Rudd Labor government's election commitments-our promise to the Australian people; it is about ensuring that there is always a strong cop on the beat in the building and construction industry; and, of course, it is about delivering workplace relations laws in the national interest that get the balance right. I am well aware that there is opposition to these laws. They are opposed by trade unions, and they are opposed by many employers. The government has approached this task to get the balance right in the national interest. During the course of this debate, we have heard a number of offensive and erroneous remarks from the opposition about the impact of this bill, and I will go through those misrepresentations one at a time. But I say more generally to the Liberal Party: at some point, they need to ask themselves why the Australian people do not trust them on workplace relations-because the Australian people do not. The Australian people repudiated them on workplace relations at the 2007 election. The Australian people do not believe that the Liberal Party can be trusted with workplace relations. And they do not believe that because the Liberal Party did not tell them the truth about Work Choices in the run-up to the 2004 election. The Liberal Party did not tell them the truth about Work Choices when it was hurting working Australians, and the Liberal Party is not telling them the truth now about their intentions to reintroduce Work Choices. So there needs to be a fundamental rethink by the Liberal Party; they are not trusted and they are not respected on workplace relations. And when you listen to the contributions to this debate, it reinforces the fact that the Liberal Party should not be trusted or respected on workplace relations because their arguments in this debate have been all about misrepresentation, all about offensive remarks about members of the government; there has been, as usual, no substance to their debate. So I would say to Liberal Party: at some point they should come clean with the Australian people and say, ‘We are the party of Work Choices and if ever re-elected we will reintroduce it,' and then, at that point, we can have a decent and honest debate. In the meantime the Rudd Labor government will do what we were elected to do, what we promised the Australian people. I know members of the Liberal Party think promises to the Australian people are not worth much. That is why, when in government, each and every time it came to breaching a promise, they did so. The party of noncore promises is the Liberal Party. But we in the Rudd Labor government believe that promises to the Australian people are important. At the 2007 election we gave the Australian people the following promises. We said that we would always keep a strong cop on the beat for the building and construction industry-and this bill delivers on that promise. We said that we would replace the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner with a Fair Work Australia inspectorate from February 2010-and this bill delivers on that promise. We said that we would consult widely with stakeholders about the required changes for the regulation of the industry-and we have delivered on that promise. We promised that we would enact strong, fair and balanced laws for the industry-and these are those laws. Apart from the fact that people do not trust the Liberal Party on workplace relations, it needs to be recognised that the laws before this parliament are the product of an extensive consultation process convened by a respected former judge who was asked by the government to provide advice on this area of law. This bill delivers changes consistent with the advice of the Hon. Murray Wilcox. I thank him for those efforts and I thank him for that advice. In introducing these laws I made it clear in my second reading speech and I make it clear today that the Rudd government has no tolerance for the pockets of the industry where people think they are above the law, where employers flout their obligations to staff, where people think that threats and violence somehow have a place in our society. They do not. Anybody who breaches the law should feel the full force of the law. That is the position of the Rudd Labor government and this bill delivers on that commitment. This bill contains tough provisions. It will create a building inspectorate that will be charged with enforcing the building industry's compliance with the law. Many silly words have been used by Liberal Party members to describe this body, but its charge will be to ensure lawful conduct in the building industry. It will have powers at its disposal to do so, including safeguards recommended by the Hon. Murray Wilcoxcoercive powers where necessary. This bill delivers these powers and delivers that kind of compliance. This bill enacts, as recommended by the Hon. Murray Wilcox, the equalisation of penalties for building industry workers and workers generally under the Fair Work Act. Members opposite, during their contributions, have criticised that. Interestingly, same time as they are saying the ABCC is doing a good job, they have criticised that recommendation of the Hon. Murray Wilcox and that provision in this legislation. What members opposite clearly do not know-or they are unconcerned about the degree of inconsistency-is that on many occasions when the ABCC litigates for penalties, it litigates for the penalties that are in the Fair Work Act and that were in its predecessor the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Indeed, in more than half of the court cases in which the ABCC has successfully obtained penalties, they were penalties prescribed by this act. So if you say the ABCC is doing a good job then you must say it has done a good job when it has successfully litigated those cases under the kinds of penalty provisions in this act. Members opposite cannot have it both ways and say that that is somehow inappropriate-given that it was recommended by an independent judge and is part of the way the ABCC has gone about its work in successful prosecutions. Beyond that criticism, there have also been criticisms of the new safeguards that are being put in place on these coercive powers-the compulsory examination powers-under this bill. We have heard claims from the opposition that they are too onerous, that they are red tape, that they will stop a quick response. All of these claims fall away when you hold them up to the light of day and actually have a think about the facts, as opposed to the spin and rhetoric that comes from the Liberal Party. I would draw the House's attention to the fact that, according to the ABCC's last annual report, less than nine per cent of its investigations included the use of compulsory examination powers-these powers tend to be used when investigations are well underway. So any nonsense and spin from the Liberal Party that somehow these safeguards prevent ABCC at the inspectors from doing their work and will create hurdles in all investigations clearly falls away. These coercive powers have been used in nine per cent of investigations when the investigations are in a deep state-and often the ABCC has said publicly that these powers are used as a last resort, not as a firstinstance response. Let us hear about the safeguards. It is just not clear to me what the Liberal Party thinks is unreasonable about these safeguards. Does the Liberal Party-and I stress the use of the word ‘liberal', given its meaning in political philosophy-really say it is inappropriate for someone to be represented by a lawyer of their choice? Is that the Liberal Party's philosophy today? The Liberal Party would say that it is the party of individual rights. If look at its political pedigree over the ages, one of the things the Liberal Party would say about itself and its history is that it has been the party of individual rights. What is exceptional, what is objectionable, about the right to be represented by a lawyer of your choice and the associated right to client legal privilege? What could be objectionable about that? The next safeguard is the payment of reasonable costs incurred. If you are asked on a compulsory basis to go and do something, is it so unreasonable, so absurd, so ridiculous, so objectionable, that the reasonable costs that you incur in getting there are metwhen you have been compelled to do so? The oversight of the Commonwealth Ombudsman-is that objectionable? Is it objectionable that, when we have action under a coercive power, there is an independent statutory person who can look at that? Is scrutiny a bad thing in the Liberal Party today? Do they not like things being scrutinised? Is that objectionable? Then there is the fact that one needs to go to a presidential member of the AAT-once again a coercive power. This is a statutory body. The AAT does a lot of things. I would have thought that oversight by independent office holders of government decisions and the decisions of statutory bodies would be viewed as reasonable in the modern age. What is objectionable about that from the Liberal Party point of view? It is very hard to see. Then the Liberal Party talk about the five year sunset provision. But of course they fail to say that the sunset provision was recommended by His Honour Murray Wilcox, as were all of the things that I have just listed and talked about, and that I have specifically said-and this was recommended by His Honour Murray Wilcox-that a review will you occur prior to the sunset on all matters relating to compliance in the building and construction industry, and such a review will be inclusive of the views of all stakeholders. It is hard to see what is wrong with that, with enacting what His Honour said should be enacted and with having a review which will listen to all views, as I laid out in my second reading speech and as I have said on a number of occasions publicly since. Then the opposition have criticised the government's decision to have an independent assessor with the power to switch off the compulsory examination powers on peaceful projects. In this regard, I think perhaps members of the Liberal Party ought to get out more and they ought to talk to employers and people within the industry. Mr Keenan-You should get out and talk to some people in the industry and see what they say to you.",59
27,Ms GILLARD,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"I have done it myself on many, many occasions. When I have those discussions with people in the industry, they point to projects where workplace relations have been peaceful, have been a model, where projects have been delivered on time, on budget and, on some occasions, before time. In my own state of Victoria, for example, the EastLink project, an enormous piece of civil construction, was delivered ahead of time with exemplary workplace relationshardworking decent Australians going to work every day, working hard to make a living, not causing any industrial disruption or trouble and then going home. Mr Keenan interjecting",62
28,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"Order! You may disagree with what the minister is saying, but the minister has the call.",62
29,Ms GILLARD,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"Another great Liberal value, the right to free speech, is not honoured in the modern age as much as it used to be, just like the right to a lawyer! The Liberal Party is staggering around in opposition, having lost its way. For projects like that, an application could be made to switch off the coercive powers. That would be assessed by an independent assessor. Should there be a subsequent problem with industrial unrest, then it can be switched back on. But this is a recognition that there are parts of this industry that are peaceful, that are characterised by good employers and hard working people, and we believe that in the legislative framework we should recognise that. Of course, this is also an industry where there are parts of it with significant industrial troubles and disruption. I have publicly talked about those. For those parts, there should be absolutely vigorous, hard-edged compliance and no tolerance at all for unlawfulness. This bill delivers that as well. I conclude by saying that the Wilcox review found, and I absolutely believe, that there are problems in parts of the building and construction sector that cannot be ignored. As a government, we have no tolerance for conduct which breaks the law, whether it is unlawful industrial action or underpayment of employees. Each and every breach of the law is wrong and each and every breach of the law should be acted upon. This bill ensures that we have got the balance right for all participants in the Australian building and construction industry. It ensures, and it is the government's intention, that the use of coercive powers is focused where they are needed the most. This is a bill that gets the balance right and honours each and every one of the government's pre-election commitments. I commend it to the House.

34,Ms NEAL,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I rise today to speak in support of the Higher Education Support Amendment (2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. The bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 and gives effect to the changes announced by the Rudd Labor government in the 2009-10 budget. I am pleased indeed to be able to talk about this government's enhanced support and funding for Australia's universities. I addressed members earlier this year about the Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle, which reached its milestone 20th anniversary this year. I have had a long and friendly association with the Ourimbah based campus and its Pro-ViceChancellor, Professor Stephen Crump. I know that this university has established a record of excellence in education and many local students can access that excellence. The Ourimbah campus has forged partnerships with the wider community, government agencies and local businesses that bring great benefit to the Central Coast. It is a multisector campus, being co-located with the New South Wales Hunter Institute of TAFE and the Central Coast Community College. Together these three institutions do a wonderful job in targeting areas of skill shortage in the economy of the Central Coast. I am well aware that all Australian universities need the fullest support of the Commonwealth government to continue providing the highest quality teaching, learning and research to students from the widest range of social backgrounds. The pressures are most particularly of concern to regional campuses, such as this one on the Central Coast. So I am heartened indeed to be speaking today on this bill, which gives certainty and sustainability to higher education funding. There are measures contained in this bill that are of particular benefit to regional universities. The reforms in the bill are an important part of the Rudd Labor government's agenda to reform higher education in Australia. The measures proposed here will help ensure the financial sustainability of our universities. They will recognise and give greater reward to the essential research initiatives at our universities. They will also provide quality by rewarding excellence and encourage the participation of students from all socio-economic groups in higher education. The bill is a positive and innovative response to many of the recommendations of the Bradley review of Australian higher education. It provides certainty for students in universities, provides funds for growth and improved quality, and seeks to arrest more than a decade of declining public investment in higher education. The bill is the first step towards increasing the proportion of Australians aged 25 to 34 years who possess higher education qualifications to 40 per cent by the year 2025. To allow universities time to adjust to the new arrangements current funding levels will be maintained for the years 2010 and 2011. From 2012 funding for universities will be simplified by rolling a number of existing programs into the Commonwealth Grant Scheme. Under the new arrangements universities will be funded on the basis of student demand, and to facilitate this the bill removes from the act the maximum grant amount from the Commonwealth Grant Scheme for 2012. This will mean that there will be no overall limit on the number of students that table A education providersthat is, the major public universities-will be able to enrol from 2012. In addition the current cap on overenrolment for Commonwealth supported university places will be raised from five to 10 per cent for the years 2010 and 2011. All programs under the revised act will gain significant funding from increased indexation provisions to be introduced in 2012. This will include grants for teaching, learning and research as well as for the OS-HELP maximum loan amount and the FEE-HELP borrowing limit. The bill will increase the maximum annual student contribution amount for nursing and teaching students. This measure will increase the funding available to universities. It will mean a slight crease in contributions for those students of around $1,000 per year, but this increase will be more than offset by savings eligible students will reap from the extension of HECSHELP benefit, valued at up to $7,500, to cover teaching and nursing courses. On top of this, from 1 January 2010 students who receive an OS-HELP loan will no longer incur a 20 per cent loan fee. This will assist students who wish to undertake part of their studies at an overseas university. One reform measure that I am particularly encouraged by is the move to increase participation in higher education by students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The Rudd Labor government has committed to a goal where by 2020 some 20 per cent of undergraduate enrolments will be from students from a low socio-economic, or SES, background. Some $108 million over four years will be invested to link universities with low SES schools and vocational education and training providers so they can offer scholarships, mentoring projects, curriculum and teaching support, and practical programs run by SES schools. Some $325 million will be invested over four years in financial incentives to universities to help them enrol more low SES students. This funding will allow universities to provide intensive and ongoing support mechanisms to assist low SES students who do enrol to complete their courses. These measures will increase access to and continued participation in higher education by these disadvantaged students. They will be of particular assistance to Indigenous students across Australia. One of the major thrusts of the bill before us today is a commitment to ensuring quality of teaching and research outcomes in the higher education sector across the nation. Under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme increased indexation arrangements and new performance funding will be introduced. This inwill give higher education providers real incentives to ensure that students receive the best possible learning opportunities. Additional funding of $94.6 million will be provided in 2011 to table A higher education providers, based on increased indexation of teaching and learning grants. Funding will be determined by rigorous performance targets set within each university. Work will begin with each university in 2010 to establish these performance targets and indicators, and from 2012 performance funding will be paid if targets are met. The assessment of performance will be managed by a new and independent bodythe Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency. A new structural adjustment fund worth $400 million over four years will also be available to universities to help them develop and implement long-term strategic missions. This fund will support broader strategic and capital projects and will be of particular importance to regional universities such as the Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle. Strengthening the research base of our universities is a priority of these new arrangements. I am very pleased that the bill will provide $512 million over four years for a new Sustainable Research Excellence in Universities initiative. This program will help plug the current gap in funding for the indirect costs of research in our universities. Together with the Research Infrastructure Block Grants scheme this new initiative will increase support for the indirect costs of research to 50c per dollar of direct competitive grant funding by 2014. Another measure, the Joint Research Engagement initiative, will refocus the existing Institutional Grants Scheme, allowing closer collaboration between universities and industry. Another practical and welcome measure is the plan to increase funding to Australian Postgraduate Awards. The government has committed to doubling the number of such awards by 2012. On top of this, the Australian Postgraduate Award stipend will be increased by more than 10 per cent in value to $22,500 in 2010. That is very welcome income support for many postgraduate students. These more generous arrangements will enhance Australia's research capacity. The Higher Education Support Amendment (2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009 transfers and consolidates funding streams from a number of existing programs into the Commonwealth Grants Scheme. This will simplify the funding arrangements and allow an increase in Commonwealth contribution amounts for those clusters of funding. The new funding arrangements in this bill come on top of additional investments of $2.1 billion from the Education Investment Fund for education and research infrastructure and $1.1 billion for the Super Science initiative. I am very proud to be part of a government which is giving this sort of support to education and our universities. I commend the bill to the House.",65
35,Ms MARINO,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"The Higher Education Support Amendment (2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009 is the legislative instrument that delivers some of the measures included in the government's response to the Bradley review. The review, as we know, received hundreds of submissions and was released in December 2008. Instead of acting on the recommendations, however, the minister announced a further review into the Bradley review. It is interesting to note that during this period the government also announced its second cash handout-much of the funds that may otherwise have been directed into higher education. There are no funds in this process for improving teachers' facilities or support for teachers and only limited funds for teaching and learning outcomes. One issue of relevance to my electorate, which I note in schedule 1 of this bill, is the abolishment of Commonwealth scholarships-the very scholarships that have helped thousands of students, many from my electorate, achieve their tertiary goals. Fewer students will now qualify for the government's replacement scholarships-a direct and deliberate attack on regional, rural and remote students and their families. Under the revised rules students will have to qualify for youth allowance payments before they can qualify for other scholarships or assistance. The government is deliberately and knowingly limiting the support criteria for students from regional areas, ignoring their equity of opportunity to access tertiary study and, more seriously, deliberately and knowingly ignoring the fact that, for every student who has to relocate to study, he or she and their families have major additional costs compared to students who can live at home while they study. The government's own figures show that far fewer students will qualify for assistance, because they will not qualify for youth allowance or Abstudy or be able to meet the 30-hour a week work criteria over 18 months in a two-year period to qualify for the independent rate of youth allowance. As well, the scholarship amount itself will be reduced. So the government is not only excluding regional students; it is also short-changing eligible youth allowance or Abstudy recipients. I understand these new scholarships will be included in a future bill. I have received countless emails and phone calls from people in my electorate. One of those emails is from Roberta Meiklejohn, who writes: … Nola-I hope you speak up loud and strongly about this terrible situation and get it out to the public domain via radio and television. The proposed changes to the Youth Allowance and the Commonwealth Scholarships are acts of criminality and discrimination. These changes will reduce rural students to peasant status. The Commonwealth scholarships are vitally important for rural students having to live away from home. Without this extra money they would not be able to afford the high cost of living. I have two sons who are now studying at UWA and receive Youth Allowance and the Commonwealth Accommodation Scholarship. We live in the country and are not able to financially support our children away from home. My sons would not have the opportunity to study Law and Engineering without the financial support from the Government. The Youth Allowance is not enough to cover the high cost of rent, food, clothing, books, computers, Internet connection fees, electricity, phone and travel costs. If they were able to live at home then many of these costs are covered by the family home including not having to purchase computers for the boys to use away. They have no choice but to move to the city for their study. And we are not financially viable enough to pay for their cost of education and living while away from home. I am a teacher and my husband works in his own small business. The extra financial support from the CAS is necessary to keep my sons fed and a roof over their heads. This still means however that each holiday they find whatever jobs they can to supplement their income to help with the cost of books, which for both of them is extremely expensive. It seems to me that the Rudd Government only wants education for certain populations which does not include rural students. His education revolution excludes these students because of the high cost of living way from home. So while I have academically able children they would be forced to live lives unfulfilled because of the cost of study away from home. Rural students will be reduced to peasants. Is this what the Rudd Government sees in their so-called “education revolution”? If so then the peasants will be forced to bring back the guillotine. Yes I am very angry about these changes to the Youth Allowance and the Commonwealth Scholarships because I have a daughter in Year 12 who is also hoping to go to UWA. Under the proposed changes she is beginning to think that this will be impossible for her. Is this fair Mr Rudd?? She cannot work 18 months for 30 hours each and every week to qualify for Youth Allowance because there are not the jobs for all these students in the country. She cannot take two years off from her studies because she will lose her position at the university. The education revolution should be changed so that when every rural student chooses to go on with further education then they immediately telequalify for Youth Allowance and the Commonwealth Scholarships. Rural students should have the same opportunities as students who live in the cities. Students who live in the city and are at home do not have to take time off from their studies. My son who is studying engineering found it extremely difficult to recommence higher maths and science studies after a 12 month break. The students who he was studying with who had not taken the gap year did not find the same difficulties as the Year 12 course was still fresh in their minds. Changes should happen for the better Mr Rudd. Not to make things even more difficult or in this case impossible. For God's sake, someone please make the Government see some sense. That is why I am speaking on these issues. These are Roberta's own words-and she is not a lone voice in regional Australia. All members representing regional areas have been receiving these same emails, but it is only coalition members who are speaking up on behalf of these students and families. There is absolutely no doubt the proposed changes will directly and negatively affect the higher education opportunities of students from my electorate of Forrest, which is a rural and regional area of Western Australia. In some instances, these changes will actually deny students their university and career opportunities. Where is the detailed analysis on the number of current gap year students in my electorate who will be disadvantaged because of the proposed changes? I have not seen it. How many students in my electorate who would have previously qualified for youth allowance will now not meet the eligibility criteria? Where is the analysis on where and how many jobs will be available to students who will need to work for 30 hours a week for 18 months in small regional towns and rural communities-of course, assuming they can get the transport to find the jobs? Where is the acknowledgement of the students' needs to travel to find such work if it is available? There is no equity of opportunity to higher education for regional students in the proposed changes, or the acknowledgement that every student from my electorate who has to relocate to study faces substantially higher costs to access their education than a student who lives at home and does not have to travel. Students from my electorate live at least two to four hours drive from metropolitan universities and have no choice but to relocate to Perth. There are a multitude of additional costs, as you heard from Roberta's statement, associated with relocationtransport, food and communication with home, and they are just a few. Students in the south-west of Western Australia are unable to study their chosen or required courses. To be able to afford to attend university at all, many students need to be able to meet the independence criteria. That is how it is. This is frequently the only way a regional student can access university study. Statistics show that a disproportionate number of regional students defer compared to metropolitan students. The Victorian government's Education and Training Committee recently inquired into geographical differences in the rate in which Victorian students participate in higher education. The executive summary noted: From 2010 only those young people who have worked for a minimum of 30 hours per week for 18 months will be eligible for Youth Allowance under the criteria for independence. The Committee firmly believes that this change will have a disastrous effect on young people in rural and regional areas. This is the Victorian government report-a Labor Victorian government. It further noted: The Committee was concerned to find that many young Victorians who wished to commence a university course defer their studies for financial reasons. There was widespread concern that a significant proportion of students who defer do not subsequently return to study. I have no doubt that these findings would be replicated in my regional and rural electorate, and around Australia. The current workforce participation criteria allows regional students to take one year off study-the gap year-to allow them to earn the designated amount needed to qualify for youth allowance the following year. There are three main issues that will arise from the tightening of the independent criteria. The current 2009 gap year students who began working at the conclusion of year 12 under the current youth allowance criteria will not qualify for youth allowance in 2010. To change the criteria part way through their qualifying period seriously and unfairly disadvantages students who were unable to plan for these changes. How many current gap year students will be affected and how many in my electorate? How many will now not be able to attend university at all because of the changes? At any time, it is very difficult for students to find work in regional towns and small communities, and my electorate has 12 towns or localities with fewer than 1,000 residents. Where in these communities will young people find 30 hours of employment for 18 months of a two-year period, particularly those with no skills and immediately out of high school? Agriculture and tourism are major industries in the south-west that provide employment in seasonal or peak periods, but certainly not 30 hours of work a week consistently for 18 months. According to the ABS Labour Force Survey data, teenage full-time unemployment has risen from 7.5 per cent in November 2007 to 10.6 per cent in June this year. With rising unemployment, it is just unreasonable to expect and assume that all young people will be able to find virtually full-time employment, especially in small towns and communities in the south-west. It just displays a lack of understanding by this government of what goes on in regional communities across Australia. Even in normal circumstances, finding 30 hours work every week for 18 months will prove to be a major barrier for regional students. Also, there are many employers who are unwilling to provide a job for an employee they know will only be there for 18 months. How many students will lose their motivation to study at university or TAFE following a two-year gap? Students who wish to complete a Bachelor of Medicine at the University of Western Australia are already faced with a six-year degree. To be forced to take an additional two years away from study to satisfy the proposed criteria would push back completion of the degree to at least 25 years of age. We know that in my electorate we currently have a shortage of GPs, and this will not help that. The changes certainly will not encourage young people to pursue this course of study or facilitate a potential return to the region to take care of that GP shortage. Commonwealth scholarships were available to all students and were granted to the most disadvantaged students. Under the proposed criteria, the Commonwealth scholarships have been axed and the relocation and start-up scholarships introduced. However, both scholarships are only available to youth allowance recipients. If a student does not qualify for youth allowance, they are not eligible for the relocation and start-up scholarships. Therefore, there is no other form of financial assistance available to regional students except for competitive university scholarships. The relocation scholarships are valued at $10,000 less over the period than the previous Commonwealth accommodation scholarship. A Perth based university-and I will not quote its name-states that it has noted the proposed change in the youth allowance and the way that it will force students who are constrained financially to undertake a greater time period earning prior to entering the tertiary system. As such they expressed concerns over the new requirements. In their experience, a significant number of students who defer for a year do not take up their place in the following year. This is particularly the case for students who undertake an ‘informal' rather than a ‘formal' year off. ‘Formal' gap year students tend to undertake specific activities, including community aid type projects, where they know the placement is only temporary and they tend to still see themselves as university students. In contrast, ‘informal' gap students tend to engage in casual work. They often become accustomed to the luxury of money and new possessions and have greater difficulty in relinquishing these, describing themselves as being part of the workforce. Both sets of students, of course, get out of the practice and habits of study, which is also detrimental to their return but is part of life. The changes foreshadowed will in effect force those in financial need to work both more intensively and for a longer period, and this is only going to exacerbate trends in deferment, to the detriment of participation in tertiary education. ‘Regional and remote students', said the university, ‘who are usually faced with the additional financial burden of living away from home with all of the additional expenses this requires, are particularly vulnerable in this regard'. What a great word for rural and regional students, I would add: vulnerable. The university went on to say that these students could thus be considered to be the most at risk. The university is particularly vulnerable in this regard and thus could be considered to be the most at risk. This university is particularly proud of the number of low SES students that it is currently catering for and would note that a large number are from regional and remote communities. As such, it is particularly concerned about any change that has the potential to reduce participation from these cohorts, particularly in light of the federal tiatives aimed in the opposite direction. Information provided to me indicates that it costs from $15,000 to $20,000, and even more in certain circumstances, for a student to relocate and study at university in Perth. Families who have more than one child attending university have even higher costs, which are not taken into account in the proposed changes to youth allowance. One of the most distressing comments that I have received in this process comes from parents who are now saying to me that as a result of these changes they will be forced to choose which one of their children will be able to attend university. Every student should have equity of opportunity to gain a higher education. The proposed changes create an additional barrier for regional students, their parents and some of their siblings, who are already working several jobs and going without in other areas of their lives to support the children's education. The changes to youth allowance are a disincentive for families thinking of moving to my south-west electorate and an incentive for families to move from regional areas to the city to support their children's educational opportunities. Unfortunately for regional and rural Australians, the Rudd government's education revolution is typical of their continuous Shane Warne style of delivery-nothing but spin.",67
36,Ms BURKE,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I rise to support the Higher Education Support Amendment (2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. Education is a central priority of the Rudd government's reform agenda. This government is passionate about providing quality education outcomes for all Australians, right across the education spectrum. We are heavily investing in all aspects of education in Australia to ensure a productive, bright future for our nation. The Labor Party has a long history of championing higher inieducation and in opposition we made substantial commitments to reforming the sector. This bill signifies a pivotal first step in lutionising higher education in Australia, allowing us to work towards a world-class university system. It sets us on a path that will transform both the quality and accessibility of Australia's universities and provides the basis for increased public funding of higher education through the implementation of significant structural change and important policy initiatives. The task of reforming the higher education system in Australia is difficult and complex as a result of the 11 years of neglect by the Howard government. I would like to quote a speech by Professor Edward Byrne, who has just been made the new ViceChancellor at Monash University. He recently addressed a function, and his speech is rather relevant today, so I am going to quote liberally from it. He said: Jonathan Swift has a lot to answer for. In Gulliver's Travelsand I do recommend it if you have not read Gulliver's Travels. It is a book you should try and get into. Jonathan Swift: … describes to his readers ‘a visit to the Grand Academy of Lagado,' where Gulliver encounters an academic “with sooty Hands and Face, his Hair and Beard long, ragged and singed in several Places,” who at the time of the visit, “had been Eight Years upon a project for extracting SunBeams out of Cucumbers,” and, “did not doubt in Eight Years more he should be able to supply the Governors Gardens with Sun-shine at a reasonable Rate.” Swift's satire, which reflected both on his contempt for the Royal Academy of Dublin and his disbelief that humans were rational creatures, is an image of academic life that we are all familiar with: the disengaged professor in an ivory tower. It has remained a popular stereotype up to today, even if we would hope that academics' standards of personal hygiene have improved somewhat. Tragically, I think that was the view under the Howard government of what universities were: ivory towers full of people beavering revo- away on useless projects, not centres of learning. So we had 11 years of this view that somehow universities were not places of quality education, were not places where everyone should strive to go but were irrelevancies. Unfortunately, we now have to try to make up for those 11 years of neglect. During the Howard years, Australia slipped radically behind the rest of the world when it came to public investment in higher education. Rather than adopt the global approach of investing more money in tertiary education, the Howard government saw fit to oversee a decline in public investment as a proportion of GDP. As a result, Australian universities have endured more than a decade of underfunding. This shameful record of public neglect is compounded by additional issues that plagued the Howard government's approach to higher education: the increased micromanagement of the sector, the erosion of opportunity and the reliance of universities on student fees for revenue. As I said, Professor Edward Byrne has just taken up the vice-chancellor's position at Monash University. At this time, I would like to put on the record my appreciation of Professor Richard Larkins, who retired from Monash University just a short time ago. Richard arrived at the university at a very difficult stage in the university's history. It was going through quite some challenges and was facing the neglect of the Howard government-the downturn in revenue. In the very short time that Professor Larkins was in charge as vice-chancellor, he turned the university around and put it back on the education map. I would like to put on the record my appreciation for the great thing he did for that terrific university. There are enormous challenges that have been left for the Rudd government, but we are committed to reforming this sector. We stand ready to deliver on the significant promises we have made for higher education. We understand the need for a substantial increase to public funding and a program for long-term reform. We will continue to work with the higher education sector to rebuild our universities and the way we go about delivering tertiary education in Australia. Again, I think this idea has been captured neatly in Professor Byrne's speech: The internationalisation and ‘mass-ification' of higher education have put universities firmly on the agenda of policy makers and business, who recognise the place that world-class higher education institutions have in providing the skilled workers, critical thinkers and cutting-edge researchers that collectively underpin successful knowledge-intensive societies. Thus for universities to continue to be effective their mission to advance the human condition in today's world, they need to be attuned to the needs of the communities that they serve. This means recognizing the vital contribution universities can play as agents for societal progress-by providing graduates that are leaders in business and the community, by generating new ideas and solutions to the pressing problems of the 21st tury. In Australia, it should be noted, universities also make a direct contribution to the economy as our third-largest export industry, and in the case of Victoria, the largest. This bill responds in part to the Bradley review, which assessed that reach, quality and performance of our higher education system will be key factors in our future economic and social growth. It is a bill that reflects the key principles of the government in relation to higher education-namely, the belief in the importance of quality university education to the community and the individual; broadening access to higher education, especially to groups traditionally underrepresented; and basing access on merit and not the ability to pay. This bill encompasses measures announced in the 2009-10 budget, amounting to a $5.7 billion allocation to higher education, innovation and research over four years. It gives effect to budget measures that implement reforms and increased funding to student places, revised indexation arrangements, industrial performance targets, indirect costs of research and a new quality and regulatory agenda. An important component of this bill is that it seeks to increase access to university for all Australians, particularly people from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Not only does this adopt a key aspect of the Bradley review; it also adheres to a fundamental principle of the ALP in providing a helping hand to those who are less fortunate. We have committed to a dramatic improvement in the participation rate of Australians in in higher education right across the spectrum. This bill introduces new initiatives which will support our higher education attainment ambition that, by 2025, 40 per cent of all 25to 34-year-olds will hold a qualification at bachelor level or above. Additionally, the government is committed to ensuring that, by cen- 2020, 20 per cent of university enrolments at undergraduate level will consist of people from low socio-economic backgrounds. Providing support to increase the participation of students from such backgrounds will have a significant benefit for families from low socio-economic groups. It will result in flowon effects of higher education aspiration and attainment, both for students and their families, including improved future employment, economic and social outcomes. This bill specifically targets the issue through a number of measures to ensure the government achieves our higher education attainment ambition. Through this bill, we have adopted the Bradley review's recommendation to introduce an uncapped student demand driven system for the funding of universities. Previously, the government has funded universities through agreements on a set or capped number of places. Overenrolments have resulted in penalties, with universities resorting to uncapped overseas and domestic full-feepaying students to meet demand and provide revenue. This has resulted in academically capable students being squeezed out of university places for purely financial reasons. During the term of the last government I placed on the record the story of Claire, one individual from my electorate. She was the youngest of nine in her family and a firstgeneration university student. She got, in the Victorian system, a TER of 91.5. She had won the Monash law prize. To get into Monash law, she needed 91.7-she was 0.2 off. She could not get in and did not get a place in the law system. Had her family been able to buy her a place into the system she could have got in on a result of seven points lower. I always thought that was the archetypical example of how bad the previous system was. The new system we are proposing will remove caps on student places and will provide an additional 50,000 student places by 2013. To ensure the quality of higher education in Australia is maintained while participation is expanded, the government will create the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency which will be tasked with protecting the overall quality of the sector. This bill also introduces a new performance funding grant which will provide universities with a genuine incentive to ensure that they are providing the best possible learning opportunities for students. It will require tutions to meet certain requirements in helping underrepresented students achieve their study aspirations. Having some funding at risk will be incentive for universities to implement strategies to lift their performance. The introduction of uncapped student demand driven funding is the first step to a higher education system with students as the central focus. Additional funding of $436.9 million will be targeted at supporting increased participation from students from low socio-economic backgrounds. This funding will essentially reward universities that attract more financially disadvantaged students and provide them with necessary support once they are enrolled. Three hundred and twenty-five million dollars will be provided to universities as a financial incentive to expand their enrolment of low SES students and to fund the intensive support needed to improve their completion and retention rates. Studies have found that promoting higher education to students in the early years of secondary schooling results in greater aspiration for tertiary study. In recognition of this, $108 million will be allocated over four years to link universities to schools with low socio-economic backgrounds in an effort to increase the aspirations of students to higher education. These reforms will bring immense benefits to many of my constituents in Chisholm. Chisholm is home to Monash University, the Melbourne campus of Deakin University and the Box Hill Institute of TAFE, so higher education is a big factor within my electorate. Monash University is, as I have said, one of Australia's leading higher education institutions and also has one of the largest enrolments of students on the one campus, at Clayton-it is a village unto itself. There is some irony in the fact that Monash University is located in the area of instiChisholm, where many people do it tough compared to many other parts of my electorate. I dare say many who come from the Clayton area do not actually attend the university-lots of people who live in Clayton go to the university but those who have been born and bred in the suburbs have not had a great opportunity to get there. These reforms will open up opportunities for such people to access the immense educational opportunities that institutions such as Monash University provide. Many people from suburbs in my electorate-such as Clayton, Ashwood and Chadstone-which are generally home to households from lower socio-economic backgrounds will be able to access quality university education as a result of these reforms. Having grown up in Ashwood and been one of a first generation of university educated individuals and one of five siblings who all had the pleasure of going to Monash University, I know the great benefits that this can bring. My parents did not have the opportunity when they were at school to get a university education but it was probably one of the greatest joys of our lives to watch our mother graduate with her university degree many years later. I think that is one of the things we forget: it is not just about people their younger years; it is opening up across the board. For people who go into university as mature-age students, as my mother did, to get a degree is a terrific thing. Ensuring that people, no matter where they come from, have access to education is something that we should all be striving for. Many capable individuals from such suburbs have in the past missed out on the opportunity to study at university for purely financial reasons. This is a real tragedy and a damning reflection of the policies and attitude adopted by the former government. Through the reforms outlined in this bill we are seeking to address this very issue and ensure that, as we move forward, access to higher education is focused on merit and not on the ability to pay. As I have said, I also have the Melbourne campus of Deakin University in my electorate, in the seat of Burwood. It is a very large campus. Deakin University is also striving to ensure that it is accessible to all. I am sure the next speaker will also be talking about the merits of Deakin University. Deakin has made itself very accessible through its online component, ensuring that, again, people who we would not traditionally visualise as students but who are in the workforce and want to upgrade or progress have access to higher education. We need to think about higher education as for all and not just for 18-yearolds. I think that sometimes in this debate we limit ourselves on who and what universities can provide benefits to. These reforms highlight the Rudd government's commitment to higher education and build on several local funding commitments already made to TAFEs and universities in Chisholm. The government understands that a high-quality higher education sector requires first-class research and teaching infrastructure. That is why we have invested $5 billion for higher education and research infrastructure through the Education in Investment Fund. Monash University was successful in round 1 of the program, receiving $86.9 million to construct the New Horizons centre-a vital component of the university's vision to develop the Clayton Innovation Precinct as the most significant technology innovation hub in the southern hemisphere. Not only is the university a higher education institution; it is also the largest employer in my electorate. It does not just see its boundaries. It looks at what it can do for employment in the sector for an area that has suffered job losses through the closure of car component plants. So we need to invest in these great institutions not only for education but for the employment opportunities they bring. A new biology laboratory will also be constructed at the university, following a further $8 million in funding announced in the 2009-10 budget. Both Monash and Deakin universities shared in $8 million in recognition of their excellence and improvement as part of the 2009 Learning and Teaching Performance Fund. This is reflective of the quality of learning and teaching at Chisholm's two universities and shows both institutions are improving the quality of their teaching, which directly benefits students. The Education Investment Fund also delivered for the Chadstone campus of the Gippsland Institute of TAFE, which received $16.2 million under round 2 of this program. The Gippsland Institute of TAFE-which sounds bizarre when it is in the middle of metropolitan Melbourne-is a lovely little TAFE which is there with the old SEC linesmen school. It is a vital part of the infrafor structure of our state-indeed of many states-that people still know how to put up poles to string electric wires between. My father did part of his apprenticeship training way back when at that TAFE and he reckons that it has not changed since he went there. So they are very appreciative of the funding, which might bring it into the 21st century eventually. This is a great initiative of this government. This funding will enable the TAFE to build new facilities that will provide up-to-date training resources and infrastructure and will help train workers to build the $42 billion National Broadband Network. Chisholm is also home to the Box Hill Institute of TAFE, which has received unprecedented federal support for a number of innovative projects. This includes $2.7 million for the construction of a green skills hub which will support the provision of training courses in the sustainability sector. Additionally, $2.3 million has been provided for the TAFE to undertake a wireless internet rollout and equip its new Aveda Institute. These projects reflect the Rudd government's commitment to funding world-class higher education infrastructure which will enable students and researchers to operate in a world-class higher education system. The TAFE sector was completely ignored by the Howard government. They were totally denuded of any support and any recognition. It is a vital part of the higher education sector in our society. It is a vital part of education and jobs. Box Hill TAFE is a world renowned institution and it wants to stay a TAFE. It does not want to become a university; it wants to stay as an institution that excels in skills training. I really want to commend them for the great work they do. The bill before the House today outlines reforms that build on Labor's established commitment to higher education. It is a significant step forward in our reform agenda higher education. Importantly, it reverses the shocking neglect and underfunding of Australia's universities displayed by the Howard government. This is a bill that strives to improve the quality of higher education providers, whilst making university study accessible to a greater number of Australians. These reforms set us on the right track to achieving our higher education attainment ambition of increasing the proportion of 25to 34-year-old Australians with bachelor-level qualifications to 40 percent by 2025. It also includes provisions that will help us achieve our goal of ensuring that by 2020 20 per cent of people enrolled in higher education will be from low socio-economic backgrounds. The introduction of this legislation will transform the way higher education is offered in this country. It will ensure a greater number of Australians can achieve excellence in their tertiary studies. I commend the bill to the House.",71
37,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"O'Connor) (1.28 pm)This is of course primarily legislation relating to appropriations. There is some fairly interesting information available in the explanatory memorandum that is worthy of comment, because it points out to us that, in relation to the Higher Education Support Act 2003, the Higher Education Support Amendment (2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009: - increases the overall appropriation under section 30-5 by $416,349,000 for the period 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011; - increases the overall appropriation under section 41-45 by $398,567,000 for the period 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012 and appropriates funding for 2013 to a limit of $2,067,383,000; and - decreases the overall appropriation under section 46-40 by $355,772,000 … So, in terms of the initial appropriations, there is a net outlay of about $460 millionalthough it reads a lot better than that at first glance. That brings me to the first issue I wish to raise on this higher education issue, and that is the consistent information provided in this House by the Minister for Education, the Deputy Prime Minister. This is what I often refer to as a process of measuring excellence by expenditure, and yet the record is not good. One might remember that the government promised, as a major policy issue, to provide a computer to every secondary student, I think-it might have been primary as well. That was costed and put in the budget, but everybody forgot the additional costs involved in installation, maintaining the software and other aspects that we know are associated with any form of computer hardware. In fact, the states said that those costs were twice the amount proposed in the purchase of the computers. The minister seems to have shrugged that off. Some states have done deals, which of course will represent an additional cost to the budget. The latest information I heard with respect to New South Wales was that they refused to participate. That is not surprising, considering the disastrous set of circumstances of economic management that apply at the state level in New South Wales. So the reality is that a major budget measure failed the test of administration. Since then, we have had the BER-the Building the Education Revolution. These are all fancy terms, but everywhere we turn we see the funding allocated there being wasted. It is interesting, because an issue got up in the media. I do not think that the particular local member, the member for Paterson, had an involvement in this matter. In the absence of the Minister for Education-she was in Israel-the Leader of the House, Mr Albanese, was acting on her behalf, and he chose to make a smart-alec comment in this place and virtually belittle a school principal, who had complained publicly in some area that they had a quote to provide infrastructure. It was, in fact, two classrooms with two associated storerooms, and they were to be delivered by way of a transportable building. She claimed that that was going to cost $150,000. The minister got up in this place during question time, and this is recorded in the Hansard, and said that was ridiculous. Firstly, the quote was only $120,000, and then he listed all the things that were missing. A price was eventually arrived at, which he attributed to the New South Wales Department of Education and Training-the agent appointed by the Rudd government to deliver the BER in New South Wales, and that was $350,000. I thought that this was worthy of some investigation, so I rang up the builder-who got a mention in the minister's answer-and said, ‘Tell me about this.' It is a wellrecognised firm. It has one part of its business here in Canberra; that is where I started. I eventually got on to the national managing director, and he said, ‘Hang on a minute; we'll get the quote out.' The quote was not for $120,000. That was added to the quote, as an option that could be considered-one of which happened to be delivery of the building and its location on site. That was for $18,000. The minister said that there was no carpet. Carpet is not always provided in the structure of a building. Things like that are done by external trades. The minister also mentioned that there was no connection of electricity and sewerage. Of course, there was no sewerage, because the classrooms had no toilets or basins. And he called the building a ‘tent', because it happened to be transportable. Just about every classroom building being delivered around Australia under the Building the Education Revolution is a transportable. In fact, on this company's website is a photograph of exactly the same type of building, which was provided to another school. It is actually a large one, terms of visual effect it is the same. We come to the fact that a building was delivered, with carpet and with some air conditioning-which the minister said was not quoted-at about $150,000, which is just what the school principal had said. Then I had a look, as somebody with a long experience in building construction in my previous life, at other items that were identified that somehow took this $150,000 up to $350,000. One was furniture. I went to the IKEA website and costed some desks and chairs-that were, I think, of better quality than one would find in a typical school-and I added them into the price. I looked at the cost of electricity connection, which I think would have been an extra anyway, and I took account of the fact that the power was already in the school, so there would be only some short extension of wires. I looked at the fact that there was no stormwater drainage and allowed for a couple of little soak wells. After considerable other efforts-for instance, the costing for furniture at IKEA for two classrooms of 30 students was about $10,000-I added it all in and I got to $178,000. So who was going to cop the other $150,000? Who was getting it? I can tell you what: the students in that particular school were not going to get it. That is just a simple example. In my inquiries I found that things were happening, such as the New South Wales government giving extended contracts without tender. People who probably had a contract for five or six school structures for the year just got the extra 50 that were paid for by the BERno quotes, no tenders and no capacity to deliver. So what has happened? The steel framework for the building is being manufactured in Victoria, put on a truck and carted up to Queensland, where they put the top on it, and then it is carted back to somewhere in but in New South Wales, while a New South Wales manufacturer is being pilloried by a member of this parliament from New South Wales whose wife just happens to be the Deputy Premier-and that is okay. New South Wales manufacturing is getting nothing out of these buildings because the government will not let anybody else in on the tender, and those that have the work do not have the capacity to deliver. Where do you get anything out of that for the economy or, more particularly, for the interests of the taxpayer? I will not go on and explain how school principal after school principal and P&C after P&C have complained. Because the bloke in Victoria had the courage to stand up against his own department, he eventually retained the perfectly viable gymnasium he had, which was pictured in the paper with a lovely polished jarrah floor, and got a couple of classrooms that he needed. Tell me about it! That is the measure. But in this place we are told: ‘We've got control measures for that. Yeah, I know we allocated $70,000 or $80,000 to a school that is up for demolition, but the money won't get there. We'll put it into the school next door.' Who says the school next door needs it? It is a mess and it is typical of the administration of these budgets by the Deputy Prime Minister. Not one of these expenditure measures is being well administered, and it cannot be said that every dollar is delivering an outcome. The government say they have $14 billion or whatever it is for this project. Surely the kids of Australia who are going to pay off the debt should at least be getting value for each dollar that is put into facilities around their schools! We had that disgraceful ad in the last election in which the Prime Minister was driving past a public school in a car. Now we need an ad where kids file into fancy new school buildings and they are each given an account to take home to remind themselves of what they are going to pay when they go to work to pay off the debt-when they will be getting 50c in the dollar. But that is not the end of it. The minister told us yesterday there has been a decline in the number of rural students going to university, and she seems to think that is a reason to reduce those numbers further. That was the excuse she gave to the parliament in question time yesterday. The students cannot afford to leave home to go to university, and the ICPA, the Isolated Children's Parents Association, has been knocking on doors in this place for years pointing out that, where kids live an unacceptable or untravellable distance from any form of primary, secondary or tertiary education, there needs to be some financial assistance. The fact that some farmer has a header in his shed that is worth a quarter of a million dollars does not make him rich when there is nothing growing in the paddock, but the government add up all his assets and say: ‘You're rich. Your child does not qualify.' Of course, the richer a person of the same financial means living in the city gets, the closer they move to a university. Where is the equity? It is not a question of means testing or of who is rich and who is poor. The fact of life is that, if you raise a family outside a 50kilometre radius of a tertiary institution-a university or, for that matter, a TAFE-you have to have an extra $10,000 a year to accommodate that child. I do agree it is a bit of a mess. People started to look at the youth allowance, which had a rent subsidy component, as a means of getting some financial assistance, so they could attend university. The first thing they had to do, which I do not think contributed to their education, was take a gap year, virtually divorce their family and go out and earn some money independently. Under the arrangements as they were, it was a sum of money-$18,000 became $19,000. They had to earn that amount of money within an 18month period to prove their independence and qualify. They also had to spend it. If they had more than $2,000 of it left, they did not qualify. It was a process, and many kids took that opportunity. Maybe some had wealthy parents, but 70 per cent or 80 per cent certainly did not. A group of them have been working to that plan for the last 12 months, and now this minister stands up and says: ‘Tough. I'm changing the rules on you.' The minister tells us that she has done some generous things and actually improved the thresholds as they relate to the means test. Then she throws in the curly one: to qualify, you must work 30 hours a week every week to prove your independence. You have just left year 12 and you are looking for a job. You are in a country town where things have been tough with drought and a lot of other things. Those jobs are just not there. So how do you qualify? She says: ‘Come round and I'll show you the table whereby you can qualify.' But if you cannot get a job at 30 hours a week for 18 months you do not qualify. When this first came up I published on my website a form that could be downloaded as a petition. People could not just hit the button and protest; they had to download it, put it on a piece of paper as the rules of this House require, go around and ask people to sign it and then post it to my office in Albany, which is not a metropolitan centre. In the first week we got 6,800 signatures, which have been tabled in this place. I have with me another 1,200. Back in my office yet to be presented to this House there are sufficient to take that number to 13,000. These are not people who took the easy option and just pressed a button on the computer and sent someone an email; they had to have a genuine desire to do this. If that is not sage to the minister that there is something wrong with her proposal then I do not know what is. The minister cannot sneer in this place at those people and say: ‘You're not telling yourselves the truth. I've had the forums, I've had the people there and I've had them explain. Teach me things about this system that they don't know.' Maybe the minister believes the Youth Allowance system is inappropriate, which I would not dispute. Fortunately a number of universities are now letting these kids extend for another year, but that is two years out of the education system, which means they are getting closer to wanting to get married, have children and take a responsible place in society. Before she kills off the kids who have just been retrospectively dealt with, why can't the minister say: ‘We'll grandfather this thing. This is all going to happen in another year or so. Here are the new rules'? Rather than this prostituted arrangement based on Youth Allowance, there should be a proper policy for tertiary education students who live beyond a reasonable distance from a centre of learning. That is what is needed, and you can call it what you like. It should be compensation for the fact that those young people are disadvantaged by distance. It is not because they are rich, poor or anything else. It is a straight-out equality of access issue. It can measured, it can be done and there are all sorts of mixes you could have. It could be a dollar for every dollar they earn so that they make a contribution, as they can these days with night-time jobs and so on. But that should have been on the table as a transition measure and kids should not have been left in the circumstances they have been. I thank the House. (Time expired)",76
38,Mr CHEESEMAN,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (2009 Budget a mesMeasures) Bill 2009. I am pleased to speak on these budget measures and yet another education bill. It seems to me that at the halfway mark of the first term of the Rudd government the area that this government will be remembered for is education. Isn't it a great thing that this government has delivered so much for young people in education? I have lost count of the number of education bills that I have spoken on since the last election. Many of these bills have included sweeping reforms, including upgrades to every single primary school and many secondary schools in Australia, trade schools measures, student income support reforms, VET reforms and student union funding reforms. That is a fantastic list of achievements we have been able to deliver, and now we are turning our attention to the higher education sector. The Rudd government is rebuilding Australia's education system and, I believe, putting in place an education system for the future. This is another bill of sweeping change. I will list just a few of the changes introduced in this bill. This bill will introduce a demand driven system of Commonwealth supported prices from 2012, with transitional arrangements in 2010 and 2011. It will introduce increased indexation for higher education. It will introduce a new performance funding grant element under the Commonbe wealth Grant Scheme. It will increase the maximum annual student contribution amount for education and for nursing. It will remove the loan fee on OS-HELP loans. It will add new items to other grant provisions of the structural adjustment fund. The bill will introduce measures to increase the participation of students from low socio-economic backgrounds, which I think is a very important aspect of this bill. Funding for the Commonwealth Scholarships Program will reflect replacement of certain scholarships by new scholarships. From 2010 it will redirect the grants for the Workplace Reform Program into the CGS based grant. This bill also ends the Learning and Teaching Performance Fund and the Workplace Productivity Program. It will provide appropriate funding for the continuing Commonwealth Scholarships Program and other research programs. These are about a dozen very important provisions that will be made into law by the passage of this legislation. They are indeed some very sweeping reforms. Firstly, I would like to make some overarching remarks about where we are heading with these reforms and then I will concentrate on a couple of those aspects. In this bill, the muddled tangle of ideology and smallmindedness of the previous coalition government will be untangled and swept away. In its place, we are putting new foundations that will consolidate our higher education sector and accelerate the race to make Australia's higher education system world-class. I think that is extremely important because, without doubt, our universities today operate in an international higher education marketplace. Our foundations have to be strong and the key elements have to be constantly improved. The new foundations of the Rudd government, first of all, are about encouraging participation in higher education. The new foundations that the Rudd government are putting in place are about world-class, first class, ground-breaking research, not average research. The new foundations are about encouraging really good scholarship. The new foundations of higher education are about a system of cooperative working arrangements between the government and universities rather than the punitive approach of the previous government. The new foundations are about fostering cooperation on industrial relations between university management and their staff. The new higher education foundations are about creating a highperforming and rewarding system. As I said, this is a wide-ranging bill and it is not possible to go through all of the detail on all of the aspects, so I will just focus on a couple of aspects that I find particularly important. Firstly, the amendments to the act, which support an increase in the participation of students from low socio-economic backgrounds is a very important part of the Labor Party's agenda. We are the Labor Party and the custodians of a fair go. Access to higher education is central to opportunity and prosperity for individuals, their families and their communities. This is particularly so in a modern world where a much larger proportion of jobs require a higher degree or specialist technical expertise. The second reason for supporting maximising participation in higher education is not so much about individual opportunity; it is about opportunities for our nation. So much great talent is wasted because of the lack of opportunity. Still today a great deal of talent is wasted in Australia because people do not have the support to reach their full potential and having a go at university is critical to that. The analogy I would like to use, as a lover and long-time follower of Aussie rules, is that of the old VFL, which was before the AFL. If you go back to the days of the early eighties-when I was a young boy-there were virtually no Indigenous boys playing in the VFL, and then the AFL was started. It was not because there was no Indigenous talent out there but because they were not getting the support, help and recognition that they deserved to be able to play AFL at the highest level. It was not because there was no Indigenous talent; it was because of the lack of support. So much Indigenous football talent was being completely wasted because the system did not recognise and encourage it. Today, the system has changed and the difference it has made is remarkable. Indigenous boys have made the system so much better. They are many of our great talents of the game. They are excitement machines in that particular code. The talent was always there but now the system is in place to identify it, support it, encourage it and give them a go. I think that is a very important story for us to tell. Australia had missed out and was the poorer for it. This part of the bill, which recognises and assists people from lower socio-economic areas into higher education, is in my view a no-brainer and it ought be encouraged. I would also like to say a few things about the controversial part of this bill that has been raised and this is also linked to the issue of lower socio-economic areas. That is, of course, the issue of performance funding and publishing performance results in ‘league tables', as they have been dubbed in the media. Performance funding focuses universities firmly on meeting our shared objectives for Australia's higher education system. It is important that universities know that there are incentives available if they do perform well and meet certain performance measures. Having some funding at risk will be a real incentive for universities to come up with effective strategies to continue to lift their performance. Under the Rudd government's reform, a university's share of the performance funding pool will be based on the size of its student population. Universities will receive performance funding if they meet targets rather than funding allocated on the basis of comparative performance. This is a system, I believe, that takes much better account of the issues of socio-economic disadvantage and those communities. This is critical if we are to achieve our goal of ensuring that, by 2020, 20 per cent of the people enrolled in higher education are from groups that are underrepresented in the system as we currently know it. Universities will have the opportunity to negotiate targets that are challenging but appropriate for their circumstances against indicators of learning and teaching performance and the performance in relation to the outcomes of the low-SES students. It is a very sensible system. It is a much better system than the old model used by the coalition, which just rewarded the rich institutions. The government is committed to making sure that the robust and suitable performance measures are put in place. Under this bill, individual targets will be negotiated in 2010 and there will be conditional funding paid in 2011 to providers who meet those agreed targets. Of course, a critical issue is who will decide whether or not institutions meet those targets. To make sure this is objective and done by people with the best available knowledge",80

41,Mr RUDD,VIETNAM SERVICEMEN," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I will make a statement regarding the location of the remains of the last two members of the Australian Defence Force missing from the Vietnam conflict, Flying Officer Michael Herbert and Pilot Officer Robert Carver. On 3 November 1970, Flying Officer Herbert and Pilot Officer Carver disappeared following a bombing mission in Vietnam. They were returning to base when their No. 2 Squadron (RAAF) Canberra bomber was lost without trace approximately 65 miles south-west of Da Nang. Thirty-nine years later, thanks to the dedicated and selfless work of many Australians, their remains have now been recovered. Finally, they will come home and be laid to rest with honour and with dignity. This will bring an end to a very long period of uncertainty for the family, friends and flict. loved ones of these two men, who lost their lives in the service of their country. I would like to thank all those people who have worked to locate their remains. In particular, I would like to thank the Royal Australian Air Force, the Australian Army History Unit, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and Jim Burke and Operation Aussies Home, whose commitment to bringing home our missing in Vietnam has been unwavering. I would also like to put on record the Australian government's gratitude to the Vietnamese government and many local Vietnamese people, whose assistance and support during the search and recovery of our missing airmen has been exceptional. Flying Officer Herbert and Pilot Officer Carver's return follows the recovery in recent times of the remains of four other soldiers who were lost in Vietnam: Private David Fisher, Lance Corporal Richard Parker, Private Peter Gillson and Lance Corporal John Gillespie. Flying Officer Herbert and Pilot Officer Carver lost their lives in the service of their country. Many years have passed since that day in November 1970 when they went missing. But the passage of time does not diminish our great respect for their bravery and their dedication, and their sacrifice will not be forgotten. It is now 37 years since Australia's 10year involvement in the Vietnam War ended, and it is 22 years since the streets of Sydney were filled with the national reunion and welcome home parade for our Vietnam veterans. With the return of these two men, we will be bringing home the last two missing Australian personnel from Vietnam. At this significant time we honour the service of all 60,000 Australians who served in the Vietnam War and remember the sacrifice of the 500 troops who lost their lives in that conOn behalf of the government and the House, I would like to offer my sincere condolences to the families of Flying Officer Herbert and Pilot Officer Carver. With their homecoming later this month, there will no doubt be much sadness, yet sadness mingled with some measure of comfort for those who have waited so long for their return to Australia's shores.",83
42,Mr TURNBULL,VIETNAM SERVICEMEN," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: On behalf of the opposition, we join the Prime Minister in offering our condolences to the families of those two airmen whose remains have now, at long last, been returned to Australia. We call it ‘missing in action', but this term-this euphemism-never captures the distress and agony suffered over many years-often decades-by families of Australian servicemen lost in war. Of the 60,000 Australians who died in the First World War, more than one-third were recorded as missing. Almost half the Australians who died at Gallipoli have no known grave. As the Australian War Memorial records: Many bereaved families were haunted for a generation by the memories of sons, brothers, and husbands who had disappeared without trace. A fortnight ago, mercifully, the anguish for families of the last two missing veterans of the Vietnam War ended when a search team found the remains of Flying Officer Michael Herbert and Pilot Officer Robert Carver. On 3 November 1970, the Canberra bomber of these two young Australian airmen went missing over the Vietnamese province of Quang Nam near the Laos border. Pilot Officer Carver was 24. He was from Toowoomba and he had served for only eight weeks in Vietnam. Flying Officer Herbert, also 24, was from Glenelg. He had qualified as a pilot at the age of 16 and had only two months to go to finish his tour. For the parents of those two men lost, those years of not knowing the fate of their sons were deeply traumatic. Mr Sydney Carver had his son's name placed on the Toowoomba war memorial and looked at that inscription hoping that one day he would know of his son's fate. Mrs Joan Herbert continued to dream that her son, Michael, had survived. Over the subsequent decade she wrote more than 600 letters to Vietnamese and other political leaders inquiring about his fate. They could not rest until the truth was known, and finally the mystery and the torment is over. We join the Prime Minister in praising all those who have worked so tirelessly to locate and identify the last two missing diggers from Vietnam; notably the RAAF investigation team, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the Army History Unit. We should also acknowledge, as the Prime Minister did, the support provided by the government of Vietnam and by former members of our opponents-of our enemy, the North Vietnamese Army-former Vietcong soldiers and, of course local villagers. It is remarkable and poignant that after so many fathers years we can bring these airmen home. NA Vietnam Servicemen Reference",83

44,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the recent comments of the climate change minister, Senator Wong: We've always said there will be details we want to continue to work through … Will the Prime Minister explain to the House the timetable for the completion of the design of the government's flawed emissions trading scheme? Why won't the government make the common-sense decision to defer the final design until after the Copenhagen conference in December?",84
45,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I have listened very careful not only to his comments in the House today on this matter but to his comments over some time on this matter as well. It may be that the honourable member has forgotten the fact that in this place-or, in fact, in his public commentary on climate change-only one year ago he said the following: … “our first-hand experience in implementing … an emissions trading system” would be of considerable assistance in our international discussions and negotiations aimed at achieving an effective global … agreement. That is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say last year-in other words, that it would be an important stepping stone towards an international agreement. That was the statement last year. The statement as of today is that in fact the Australian action on this should postdate an international agreement at Copenhagen. When we are dealing with something as serious as climate change, I believe consistency is important. The honourable member also goes to another point, which is the basis for their engagement with possible changes to the legislation over time. Can I simply say to the honourable member that a precondition for that is for those opposite to have a policy, and can I say that here we are, 20 months into the history of this government, 12 years after those opposite were confronted with the same reality, and as ofMr Hockey-Twelve years?",85
46,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"‘Twelve years?' the member for North Sydney interjects incredulously. For 12 years those opposite were in power and did not act on an emissions trading scheme. Twenty months into the history of this government, we are therefore 13½ to 14 years on and, as of this day in August 2009, there is no policy from the Liberal Party and the National Party on an emissions trading scheme. Therefore, as we approach the debate-and we have encountered it today in the Senate-those opposite have in fact not had a basis to put forward amendments because they cannot agree on policy. I would say to the honourable member that it is a very disappointing day indeed for Australia when the Liberal Party and the National Party cannot even become united enough to have a single united voice on climate change, let alone a voice which could act in support of this nation's long-term interests on climate change by voting for the legislation in the Senate. Today they have chosen to do the reverse and, as a consequence, put Australia's future on climate change in grave jeopardy. NA",85

48,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the actions taken by the government following the plane crash near Kokoda?,85
49,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. Yesterday I informed the House that there had been no survivors from Airlines PNG flight CG4684, which crashed in heavy weather and rugged terrain near Kokoda on Tuesday. The nation's shock at this grim news continues to reverberate today. A plane crash is always a tragedy. A plane crash which affects so many people, including so many of our young people embarking on what has become a national pilgrimage, is an even deeper tragedy. The task for the government and for our partners in Papua New Guinea has shifted from the intensive search efforts that took place yesterday, and today the focus is on the process of bringing loved ones back home. I spoke around noon today to Australia's High Commissioner in Papua New Guinea, Chris Moraitis, who briefed me on the efforts going on right now, and I bring them to the attention of the House. There are now seven Australian officials at the crash site, some 1½ kilometres from the village of Isurava on the Kokoda Track. The deputy high commissioner, John Feakes, our consul-general, David Poulter, and the ADF doctor, Lieutenant Commander Simon Winder, arrived at the site yesterday. These officials hiked into the site; they had no alternative. They got there late yesterday after a trek of three to four hours and camped there overnight. They were joined this morning by three AFP officers and one Defence officer. These Australians are assisting the recovery operation is now underway, an operation that is made more difficult by the rugged terrain and changeable weather conditions of the Owen Stanley Range. Four more AFP officers will arrive at this site this afternoon. The high commissioner has told me they will be winched in from a Black Hawk helicopter, weather permitting. To assist in moving other personnel to the site, a helipad is being cleared by a team from the PNG police, assisted by local villagers. A large number of officials are now involved in the Australian effort in PNG dealing with this tragedy. Some 48 staff of the Australian High Commission are currently working on the crisis. The AFP has deployed 18 additional staff from Australia, and the ADF has deployed around 50 personnel. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has deployed four staff. Centrelink has deployed two counsellors. Emergency Management Australia has deployed an officer as well. The following Australian government assets have been deployed in support of this effort and are available to assist the recovery efforts that go on from day to day: the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Dornier 328 search and rescue plane which helped to locate the crash site yesterday; the ADF Caribou aircraft which carried a PNG Defence Force search and rescue contingent and high commission staff to Kokoda village yesterday afternoon; an RAAF C130, equipped with retrieval equipment, is in Port Moresby; and an RAAF C17 aircraft arrived in Papua New Guinea yesterday with ADF, AFP, air transport investigators and two Black Hawk helicopters on board. The Sea King helicopter aboard HMAS Success has now departed Port Moresby since the Black Hawk helicopters have arrived. In all that is going on we are working closely with our partners in Papua New Guinea. I spoke again yesterday afternoon that with the Prime Minister, Sir Michael Somare, and we agreed to continue the close cooperation between the Australian and PNG governments during the recovery phase. He passed on his condolences to the families of the Australians who have been lost in this tragedy. We also pass on our condolences to the families and friends of those citizens from PNG and Japan who lost their lives on that flight. The deep emotion felt in this chamber yesterday-on both sides of the House, government and opposition-was palpable. That emotion is now felt right across the country as we are all touched by what has indeed been a national tragedy. Uppermost in our thoughts, still, are the families and friends of the nine Australians who have lost their lives. For them the days that lie ahead will be very hard indeed, and I am sure all Australians, particularly those who come from the communities from which they come, will be extending every possible and practical means of comfort and support to them at this most difficult time.",85

51,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I the Prime Minister: given that the government's refusal to negotiate or adjust its flawed emissions trading scheme has led to its defeat in the parliament today, will the Prime Minister now instruct its climate change minister to stop holding the nation's renewable energy sector to ransom and accept the coalition's position-to immediately separate the renewable energy legislation from the emissions trading legislation so the renewable energy legislation can be passed into law immediately?",87
52,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question, and I go back, in part, to an answer I delivered to his first question, which is that if those opposite were serious in a negotiation with the government on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme then they would have had a policy from which to negotiate. And here we are, at this point of the process, where the government's legislation and its plan have been before the nation for such a long period of time, and those opposite have not had a united policy position and, therefore, are in no position to negotiate with the government on any matter of substance.

54,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. Can I start by associating myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Our thoughts and prayers and our hearts go out to the families, who, of course, in the last 24 hours, have suffered a terrible shock and a terrible loss. But in very many respects now the most difficult period is ahead. As the Prime Minister indicated, we have now moved from a search and rescue operation to a recovery, identification and return of loved ones to Australia operation or process. And this presents very difficult moments for the families concerned and difficult moments for Australia's officials. Australian consular officials in Canberra have been in constant contact with the families. All of the families were contacted again this morning, and that close and regular contact will continue. In the meantime, of course, there is now a meticulous, complicated and complex process which will occur so far as recovery and identification is concerned before one can think of the return of loved ones to Australia. In addition to the legal requirements of Papua New Guinea, there are, of course, international protocols which need to be met. There are also Australian requirements and Japanese requirements. This process always takes much more time than the families would want-much more time than the families would want-and we understand that and should appreciate that from this moment. But this complicated and complex process is required, to meet international standards, so as to ensure that in the end there is no doubt about these circumstances when loved ones are returned to Australia. So our officials continue to be in very close contact with the families. This morning, explaining the detail of this process to the families commenced. Some of the families have indicated that they may wish to travel to Papua New Guinea at some appropriate moment, and we will, of course, provide all of the necessary facilitation for that and provide every assistance on the ground in Papua New Guinea if they choose to do so. But we will continue to be, through our officers in Canberra and in Papua New Guinea, in close and regular contact with the families, as we do everything that we can to make this very difficult time for them as smooth as humanly possible, as they now are forced to wait some time before their loved ones are returned to them. Emissions Trading Scheme",87
55,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister concerned that under his flawed emissions trading scheme the price of Australian food will increase by about five per cent even before agriculture is included, while food imported from countries like China and Brazil will face no cost increases?",88
56,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. In terms of the projected impact on food and other prices of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, these matters were canvassed extensively in the government's white paper. We have said throughout this, as those opposite have said from time to time in the occasional outburst of candour, that when you introduce a carbon pollution reduction scheme or any other form of emissions trading scheme it will have an effect on the price of carbon and that will flow through into general prices in the economy. That was elementary to the position taken by the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, when he spoke in this place on an emissions trading scheme prior to the last will election. That is the first point. The second point goes to how you therefore deal with the impacts which then flow to pensioners, carers, seniors and other lowincome households, and to middle-income households as well. I would draw the honourable members' attention to the provisions which have been put forward by the government. Firstly, in the case of pensioners, seniors, carers and veterans, they will receive additional support above indexation to fully meet the expected overall cost of living flowing from the scheme. Furthermore, other low-income households will receive additional support above indexation to fully meet the expected overall increase in the cost of living flowing from the scheme. Furthermore, as for middle-income households, they will receive additional support above indexation to help meet the expected overall increase in the cost of living flowing from the scheme. Also, for middle-income earners receiving family tax benefit part A, the government will provide assistance to meet at least half of these costs. We were clear about these matters at the time when the government put forward its policy. If you are having an emissions trading scheme, you are bringing about as a result of that a higher price of carbon and that therefore flows through to the general economy. The responsible course of action then, both for households and for industry, is to create the adjustment mechanisms for them to soften the blow. I would ask those opposite to reflect on this further, given that they do not have a policy on emissions trading. When the Frontier Economics document was released only a couple of days ago, those opposite were asked whether this constituted their policy. They said no, it did not. But I would ask those opposite to tell us where their household compensation scheme is. I may have missed it in terms of the contents of that document. Or are those opposite in fact arguing that if their model which they put forward, but which they do not own, is implemented, it would have no consequences in terms of the price of carbon? I would have thought that if you looked at the proposition being put forward by those opposite, it flows through to the price of carbon and therefore to the price of food and to the price across the general economy as well. So here is the critical question: where is the alternative compensation scheme for households being put forward by those opposite? I cannot find it. Climate Change Mrs D'ATH (2.25 pm)-My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on recent developments in Australia's efforts to tackle climate change?",88
57,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Today, Australia had an opportunity to embrace the future on climate change and instead we find ourselves, courtesy of the Liberal and National parties, dangerously anchored in the past. The Australian parliament had an opportunity to embrace the future on climate change today and instead the Senate, instructed by the Liberal and National parties, chose to anchor us again in the past. Instead of the next generation of Australians being able to look back on this day in August 2009 as a turning point for the future, they will look back on this day instead as the time when the Liberal and National parties put their own internal disunity ahead of what is necessary for the nation and the next generation of Australians. As we listen to those opposite in recent times, we still hear debates reverberating about whether in fact the science underpinning climate change is valid. I find it remarkable in 2009 that those opposite, replete though they are with climate change sceptics, could still be engaging in such a debate. It is now more than 30 years since the first ever world climate conference called on governments to guard against potential climate change hazards. It has been 20 years since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was formed to produce its first report. It was 17 years ago, in 1992, that the international community acknowledged the importance of tackling climate change when it met at the Rio Earth Summit and created the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In the period in which those opposite were in government, it was in the year 2000 that the previous government released a public consultation paper encouraging early greenhouse abatement action. That was in the year 2000-nine years ago. In 2003",89
58,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,89
59,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite interject that they did it. Where is the emissions trading scheme that they claim to have done? In 2003, the previous government released a review of the operation of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. Nothing was done. In 2007, former Prime Minister Howard's group on emissions trading released the Shergold report, which recommended an emissions trading scheme for the future and, as we went into the last election, what did those opposite promise to introduce if they were to win? They promised an emissions trading scheme. They then said, through the then Minister for the Environment and Water Resources but now Leader of the Opposition: … to encourage the development of low-emission technologies and a more efficient use of energy. The best approach is through emissions trading; letting the market set the price so that the least cost abatement can be achieved. He went on to say: … if you throw out a target and you cannot tell business what it's going to cost, what it's going mean, they'll throw up their arms in dismay. So we have set up a scheme, an emissions trading scheme. That is the scheme against which they voted in the Senate earlier today. The other argument advanced by those opposite is that we need to wait for Copenhagen and see what the rest of the world has done. Could I remind those opposite what they had to say on these matters when they were in government? Again, these are the words of the now Leader of the Opposition. He said only last year: … the Howard government's policy last yearreferring to 2007was that we would establish an emissions trading system not later than 2012. It was not conditional on international action … That was the statement made by the now Leader of the Opposition only last year. He said further: … John Howard decided and the Cabinet decided last year that we would move on an emissions trading scheme come what may. Again, this is the emissions trading scheme which they have voted against in the Senate today. In terms of whether this action should be conditional upon international action, the Howard government's own report, the Shergold report, said the following. I quote what their own report said, and they know it too well. The Shergold report said: … waiting until a truly global consensus response emerges before imposing an emissions cap will place costs on Australia by increasing business uncertainty and delaying or losing investment. Already there is evidence that investment in key emissions intensive industries and energy infrastructure is being deferred. So, after 12 years, the Liberal Party undertook a promise finally at the last election, armed with the Shergold report, that they would act. What we have seen ever since the to election is one rolling litany of excuses for inaction, for one reason alone: they cannot unite themselves to bless themselves, let alone to vote together on any position on climate change. I contrast that shoddy performance on climate change with the posture that we adopted since the last election and the commitments we took to the Australian people. We said to the Australian people prior to the last election that we as our first act in government would ratify the Kyoto protocol. We, the government of Australia, as our first act ratified the Kyoto protocol. It took them years and years and years to procrastinate and to avoid such a basic course of action, and we took it as our first action in government. We also set a target to cut Australia's greenhouse emissions by 60 per cent on 2000 levels by 2050; to ensure that 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply, the equivalent of all household electricity used, would be generated by renewable energy by 2020; that we would establish a national clean coal initiative; that we would establish an Australian solar institute, a geothermal initiative and introduce greenhouse rebates for solar power and solar hot water; and to provide lowinterest loans for families to undertake water and energy efficiency improvements at home. We also undertook to introduce a national emissions trading scheme. ",89

61,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the period since the last election, 18 or 20 months since then, we have been giving effect to each and every one of these commitments. In the last 18 months or so since the election we have acted methodically and comprehensively across this agenda. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme green paper was released way back in June 2008. The Garnaut climate change review was released in September 2008. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme white paper was released in December 2008. The draft Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation was released in March 2009. The renewable energy target legislation was introduced into the parliament, with 20 per cent of electricity from renewable sources by 2020. We have held numerous industry consultations. There have been numerous Senate inquiries order. I respectfully request that you draw the Prime Minister's attention to the Deputy Prime Minister's exhortation that questions not last longer than four minutes. He started his sixth minute",91
62,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,91
63,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The truth is that this is a very difficult story for those opposite to listen to, because it is 12 years of excuses for inaction and it is now 18 months of further excuses for inaction. What is going on here is very simple. It is not about policy; it is about the internal politics of the coalition. Everyone knows that. Everyone watching this debate knows that that is the truth. As of May 2009, the government had managed to build a wide coalition in support of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. On the side of business we had positive statements of support from both the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group. We also had broad community support from the Climate Institute, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the World Wildlife Fund and others. These are the product of hard work by hard working ministers on a very difficult and contentious piece of legislation-difficult and contentious in any jurisdiction seeking to legislate in this manner across the world. But one force has held us back from achieving progress on climate change, and that is the old guard of the Liberal Party, now in control of the Liberal Party. Today after so many reports, reviews, consultations and even their election commitment and the aspiration of the overwhelming majority of the Australian people, the Liberal Party have once again chosen to turn their back on the future. Again let us put into absolutely clear and stark context the remarks made on this subject within the last year by the now Leader of the Opposition. He said that the emissions trading scheme is the central mechanism to decarbonise our economy. He said that the biggest element in the fight against climate change has to be an emissions trading scheme. He said that our first hand experience in implementing an emissions trading scheme would be of considerable assistance for our international negotiations to achieve an effective global agreement. From all these statements of high courage, what has suddenly changed? What has changed between these statements of high principle from the now Leader of the Opposition last year to the absolute collapse in the authority of his leadership this year? It is to do with the fact that there is no authoritative leadership at all within the Liberal Party today, and the nation is suffering as a consequence. Today the Liberal Party of Australia is beholden to the climate change sceptics. Today they are absolutely demonstrating themselves as being prisoners of the past, prisoners of their own internal party disunity. The Liberal Party, prisoners of the past on climate change, prisoners of their own party disunity on climate change, are therefore placing the nation's future at risk. Rather than marking this day as one when the nation actually grasped its future, those opposite have chosen instead to consign Australia to the past. I would appeal to all those who lie within the ranks opposite, as women and men of conscience, to actually overcome the rancid nature of their disunity and to act for the time in the national interest on climate change. Emissions Trading Scheme",91
64,Mr COULTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is quite brief. It is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister advise the House how much more per hour it will cost small businesses in my electorate to run their airconditioners under his government's flawed emissions trading scheme?,92
65,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Underpinning the position of the question just asked by the honourable member is this: the assumption that the position put out by Frontier Economics does not involve any adjustment to the carbon price. That is in fact the fallacy which is being advanced by those opposite. Will the Leader of the Opposition tell us whether in fact this policy which is not a policy will impact on the carbon price? The government has been upfront about the fact that the introduction of a carbon pollution reduction scheme will have an effect on prices in the economy, and that is why the government has detailed at some considerable length what it would provide by way of assistance for households in transition-and I answered that in response to an earlier question. When it comes to a range of industry sectors, including those which are emissions-intensive trade-exposed and the coal industry, they are also outlined in the government's policy. When it comes to the climate change adjustment fund, the honourable member would also be familiar with the fact that that fund has also been established, particularly to assist with adjustment costs for regions and for small businesses and the business community in adjusting to changes to the carbon price. I say to those opposite, as they now embark on their latest campaign of fear on this-because we know that there are two disciplines which those opposite are good at: first fear and smear-that this will advance",92

69,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why is it so important that business gets the certainty it needs from the implementation of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and what has the reaction been to other proposals?,92
70,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for her question. It is the case that from day one of the Rudd government we announced our intention to introduce a capand-trade scheme. It is the case that we have had a green paper, that we have had a white paper and that we have had extensive modelling. It is the case that there is legislation that has been before the parliament for some time. And through all of that discussion with the Australian people, and most particularly with the business community, there has been one theme. What the country needs, what the business community requires, is certainty. They require certainty because they require certainty for investment. Investment, of course, goes to the very core of job creation in a low-pollution economy. What the government is doing is putting in place a scheme which will set this country up for the future. condemned. And what we get from those opposite is just a completely negative approach. What we have seen in here today is how divided and how delusional they are-completely divided, completely delusional and completely incapable of constructing an alternative policy which goes to the very core of future prosperity in this country and where our children and our grandchildren will get jobs. You would think, when there is such a big issue of such national importance, that those opposite could rise above their division and come to the table and do something constructive. But they have not done that. They have got the hide to come into this House and pretend that they have a policy when they do not. Just today in the House two of the questions have been from the National Party, who are absolutely opposed to any scheme at all. We have seen both sides of the argument already. Business want to move forward with confidence while those opposite want to leave them in the past. They want to chain business to the past by their refusal to discuss and put forward a positive alternative. That is the problem we have, because there can be no certainty when those opposite do not have any alternative amendments-and they do not. And, of course, there can be no certainty when there are no targets. It was made very clear when their shadow minister, Mr Danny Price, who does not sit in this House but who appeared with the Leader of the Opposition, said that there would be moving targets and that there could be fewer permits if things changed in the electricity industry. Of course, what that means is that, if things were to change in the electricity industry, the rest of the business community, the rest of the economy, would pay the price. This scheme that the government has put forward is in the national interest. Those opposite are voting against certainty, confidence and jobs-and for that they should be NA",92

81,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change. What is the impact of the Senate's failure to support action on climate change earlier today?",94
82,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. The government has an unequivocal mandate to take action on climate change. It is critical for our environment, it is critical for our society, it is critical for our economy and it is critical for future generations. Underpinning the government's commitment is respect for the overwhelming scientific evidence. The government, along is with the other 191 countries that have ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, respects the science. In Yesterday I updated the House on the available scientific evidence. Importantly, in that evidence it is overwhelming that human induced emissions are responsible for the observed warming. Without action, temperatures could rise by up to five or six degrees by the end of the century, which would obviously have extremely serious consequences. For that reason it is vital to pass the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation so that we can begin to reduce emissions. But today in the Senate the opposition failed the Australian people, failed Australian business and failed the environment. They failed to stand up in the national interest and they failed to support the most significant economic and environmental reform ever undertaken in this country. They failed to support action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our economy. As a result, investment opportunities in renewable and clean energy will be lost. It is absolutely clear why those opposite do not support action on climate change. It is because they cannot agree on a policy. There is a foundational issue at the heart of the coalition's disunity, and that is the climate science. Many amongst the opposition do not respect the science. The coalition contributions to the Senate debate have been extremely instructive on this issue. Senators from the opposition, including the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Minchin, and Senators Bernardi, Bushby, Joyce and others have proudly touted their refusal to respect the climate science. Senator Minchin had this to say: … this whole extraordinary scheme … is based on the as yet unproven assertion that anthropogenic emissions of CO2 are the main driver of global warming. He has denied the climate science. What an extraordinary contribution! While the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Liberal Party in this chamber, is on the record accepting the climate science, the leader of the Liberals in the Senate refuses to respect it. And it is not only Senator Minchin who has made some extraordinary contributions in the last couple of days. None other than the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, yesterday on breakfast television said this: … climate change is real … whether it's made by human beings or not, that's open to dispute … Yet another one!",94

The determination of this government to make this reform should not be underestimated-and make it we will! Emissions Trading Scheme",95
85,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the answer of his Minister for Resources and Energy just a moment ago, where he confirmed, as has Senator Wong, that the government is in the midst of negotiating major changes to the design of its emissions trading scheme. How can the Prime Minister justify demanding the parliament immediately approve an emissions trading scheme which is plainly and admittedly incomplete and under construction?",95
86,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a sad thing to watch a leader's credibility disappearing through the carpet. A leader's credibility disappearing through the carpet on something as important to the nation as climate change, and with profound consequences for the Senate, is a tragedy for us all, because it goes to whether or not we are going to have certainty for business and certainty for the economy for the future. What I say to the Leader of the Opposition, as he lifts the volume in order to camouflage the absence of substance in his contribution to this debate, because his leadership authority has collapsed on climate change and across the board, is as follows: if those opposite were serious about having a policy position to advance in the Senate debate on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, why did they not move an amendment? Where is the policy? If those opposite are serious about change to the legislation, where is the policy; where are the amendments? Neither of them exist, because this is one huge political fig leaf to cover up one core political fact-it is to paper over the terminal divisions within the Liberal Party. That is what it is all about. The fact that they cannot summon up a common position to take decisive action on climate change-20 months into this government's life and through multiple reports in the public domain about our course of action for the future-demonstrates one thing and one thing alone: a collapsed leadership. What we have seen today, as I said in my earlier remarks, is the return of the Liberal Party old guard on climate change. We see a victory for Wilson Tuckey and all the voices of the past on climate change and we see the Liberal Party abandoning what this nation needs for the future on climate change. We will get on with the business of reforming for the future, as the Liberals languish in the debates of the past. Emissions Trading Scheme",95
87,Ms GEORGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Will the minister update the House on the extent to which the science and international accounting rules currently allow agriculture to participate in emissions trading? What policy responses have been proposed?",96
88,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Throsby for the question and acknowledge her interest in the issue. There was a rally today, I know, from a group called the Climate Sceptics, a group calling itself the world's first political party to be upfront about its doubts on anthropogenic global warming. I presume the member for O'Connor attended. He seems to have gone strangely quiet. The concept that a price on carbon is something brand new in one sense is wrong. There has always been a price on carbon. The problem has been that people have been willing to forward that bill to the next generation. What we had today was an attempt from the government to change the way we deal with that in the future, while we have an opposition, with people like the member for O'Connor, willing to remain in the neglect of the past. The member for Higgins, on radio, has referred to the report that has been thrown about but not adopted by the opposition and said: Technically speaking, if you build in particular assumptions you can get any outcome you want. In the same way that he used to question modelling that he was provided with, he said: I would take the same caution in relation to Frontier Economics. One of the assumptions that is in that report is that you can easily include agricultural offsets at the moment. There are real challenges in the science of doing that at the moment, and Australia is in quite a different position to the United States on this, for a number of reasons. First of all, the fact that the United States have not ratified Kyoto means that they are not bothered by the concept that their agricultural offsets will not be internationally tradeable. We want to have a system where offsets are internationally tradeable. Mr Truss-The US are trading them.",96
89,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I presume the Leader of the Nationals is referring to the Chicago Climate Exchange. Come in, spinner. We will get to that at the end. The nature of our landscape is that it has very different types of soils to what we find in the United States. Concepts that have been put out during this debate as being incredibly simple, as wonderful solutions that you can just immediately apply-such as biochar across the continent, such as looking at the size of our landscape and saying, ‘That's an immediate sequestration opportunity'-are far more complex in a nation which has the amount of desert that we have. It is far more complex with the limitations on the science matching carbon sequestration in many of those soils. That is why the government are investing the way we are in the Climate Change Research Program, in making sure that we can improve the quality of that science. That is also why we are working to improve the international accounting mechanisms, which currently mean that, if we were to include our agricultural offsets in international trading, we would be including natural causes with man-made causes, which would mean we would be paying penalties following the Victorian bushfires for the loss of carbon from the soil. That is what it means under the current rules, and yet that is what the other side are saying you can do so simply already. While we do not agree on everything, that is why David Crombie, the head of the NFF, in his op-ed in the Land today, said, ‘It's to trade what can't be measured.' There are massive limitations at the moment. The government are pursuing them and putting money on the table to improve research. It is now happening around the nation, in the electorates of many of the people around here, where we are now working at improving the number of options for farmers and improving the measurement processes that are there. But there are those who want to say it is simple and those who want to say, ‘Just look at the model of the Chicago Climate Exchange; that shows how easily you can do it.' That is what the Leader of the Nationals just interjected. That is what the Leader of the Opposition himself said on 26 May. He said: … the Coalition proposes the establishment of a Government-authorised voluntary carbon market from 1 January, 2010 based on the Chicago Climate Exchange. We hear fear campaigns around some of the modelling thrown around in this debate. When they want to raise fear levels, the modelling of the price per tonne of carbon goes all the way up. It goes well beyond $10, $20 or $25. I have heard figures of $45 and $50 per tonne thrown around. On the Chicago Climate Exchange today, the value of soil carbon-which is what they say will provide this great line of income for farmers-is trading at 40c a tonne. The voluntary market-which they are proposing should be put in and saying would provide a simple solution and an automatic line of credit for farmers-is, on the current science and with the limitations on international trading, delivering something in the order of 40c a tonne. There is a reason why their proposals sound too good to be true, and it is simply that they are. Emissions Trading Scheme",96
90,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Clihard mate Change. Given that the Minister for Resources and Energy has now conceded that the legislation is flawed in expecting Australian coal producers to pay for emissions not only in Australia but also in Japan, will the minister now disclose to the parliament the government's own planned changes to its emissions trading scheme?",97
91,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow minister for the question, and I think I can immediately refute his interpretation of the earlier answer by my colleague the Minister for Resources and Energy. The government has had a very clear position in relation to the coal industry from the outset in the development of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. There is a wide variation across the industry in methane emissions, fugitive emissions, on a mine-by-mine basis for geological reasons. To take the sort of proposition that is suggested in the Frontier Economics report that somehow you can have some best practice baselineMr Robb- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance.

93,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To take, as is suggested in the Frontier Economics report-which, of course, is not coalition policy, we understand, but which has been vigorously advocated by the shadow minister and the Leader of the Opposition-the approach that there is some best practice baseline in the coal industry by which assistance can be allocated to coal mines in relation to their fugitive emissions is thoroughly erroneous. The government for that reason has taken the approach of targeting the assistance specifically at those mines which will incur under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme the most substantive carbon liability. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. The minister is valiantly making an answer that bears no relation to the question he was asked.",97

107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If he refers to the quesput tion to the minister for energy and then asks about whether there are plans for government changes, that broadens the question beyond the specificity in the final point.  and the chair if I read the preamble to the question which was not a preamble of rhetoric but actually a specific reference: It reads: ‘The energy minister has now conceded that the legislation is flawed in expecting Australian coal producers to pay for emissions not only in Australia but also in Japan.' The point is that we are seeking an answer about the emissions to be paid for in Japan, not an answer about $750 million of assistance to the coal industry.",98
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not think that really assisted. When there are expressions used such as ‘flawed' perhaps we should have a discussion about whether the argument that is in these questions could be ruled out because it is the argument that then opens the possibility of answers-for example, when you talk about the energy minister's admission of flawed legislation.",98
109,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The simple fact remains that if there is a concern on the opposition's part about the treatment of the coal industry under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, a policy position could have been discussed and adopted in the coalition party room. It could have been put forward in the form of an amendment. The amendment could have been discussed in the context of the Senate considerations or at an earlier stage. But the fact is that they are disunited. They cannot agree on a single policy issue and today they have stood up in the Senate and voted against a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which is the only mechanism by which we are going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this country, and they will be held to account for it.

111,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bonner for her question. I know she has a strong interest in this issue. The fact is evidence based policy is important to the Rudd government, including when it comes to a comprehensive environmental and climate change agenda. I think it is worthwhile pointing out that there is a new approach afoot in the democracies of developing and developed countries which says that we will have a greater emphasis on rigorous public policymaking informed by available and credible evidence. It is a similar approach to that we have seen from the Obama administration in their environment and climate change agenda-guided by evidence, guided by the science. The government are committed to driving reforms based on evidence in tackling genuine priorities in our environment-for example, through targets identified under the Caring for our Country program. Under Caring for our Country we published a business plan last year and called for projects that would address clear evidence based targets. This year my colleague Minister Burke and I have approved over $400 million worth of projects to address these targets. We are driving reforms as well through the National Strategy on Energy Efficiency, which I detailed yesterday to the Built Environment Meets Parliament conference, laying out this government's energy efficiency agenda.",99

113,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very pleased to hear the shadow minister commending me for that speech. Thank you, Shadow Minister; I am glad you were listening. It includes better energy efficiency standards for new homes and commercial buildings, sweeping reforms to minimum standards ratings and assessments for energy efficiency and buildings in the future, mandatory disclosure of energy use for commercial office buildings and national legislation for appliance energy efficiency standards and labels. This is an that evidence based agenda. For example, energy efficiency appliances alone are projected to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by some 19.5 million tonnes per year in 2020, the equivalent of taking almost five million cars off the road permanently. Energy efficiency is a key plank in the government's approach to tackling climate change based on the evidence and centred around a price on carbon under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It is important to note that this is evidence based because it is guided by the science-report after report peer reviewed by other scientists, and a consensus of the world's leading climate scientists, who have all urged the world to take action on climate change. There is another approach which is in evidence in the opposition and it has come to the fore today in the parliament as the opposition has voted down the government's CPRS. That approach is to discount and reinterpret evidence through an extreme ideological prism. The logical endpoint of that approach is to deny climate change, to delay taking any responsibilities for the challenges that we face. It is the approach of the climate change sceptics. This approach has seen the rejuvenation of some careers of prominent backbenchers and I am thinking of the member for O'Connor whose public pronouncements on this matter have been so evident. He is happy for us to know that his party is voting down climate change legislation in this House. These are the sceptics, the member for O'Connor and others, who are now dominating the Leader of the Opposition-a Leader of the Opposition who has gone from being the environment minister in the former government who wanted the world to know that he would have ratified Kyoto to the leader of a party who, on the very day of the vote on a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, cannot deliver a coherent position. These are the numerous coalition sceptics, too many to name, too many to mention, who we saw yesterday, the day before the CPRS vote would be voted on in the Senate, coming to a presentation on how to stick your heads back in the sand. This is an extraordinary approach when a matter of such importance is before the Australian parliament. Despite years of research and reports we have a coalition that can only present a report that is not their policy and who today have failed the people of Australia. Earlier today I was down at the National Library of Australia with the member for Curtin. We were admiring some relics of the past. Meanwhile, in the Senate, in this parliament, the relics of today were voting against the climate change legislation that we need in this country to satisfactorily address this most important of issues. We are voting for the national interest; they voted for their self-interest. In the face of the huge challenge that is represented by dangerous climate change, the Australian people deserve so much better. Climate Change",99
114,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change. I refer the minister to the Minister for Resources and Energy's previous answer: … there will continue to be engagement with respect to the final framework of both the CPRS and the renewable energy legislation. Minister, when can the parliament expect to see the final framework?",100
115,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government, of course, is extremely concerned to ensure that the coal industry has appropriate treatment in relation to the CPRS. We have been consulting, as my colleague the Minister for Resources and Energy said, with the coal industry for some period of time. We are satisfied that the assistance that I referred to in my earlier answer appropriately addresses the assistance that is necessary for the coal mines with the highest methane intensity. Dialogue will continue with the coal industry, as it always does in relation to key policy matters. National Security",100
116,Mr BIDGOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Attorney-General. Will the Attorney General outline the government's proposed reforms to counterterrorism legislation and resources being made available in the context of current national security challenges?,100
117,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yesterday the government released a discussion paper which sets out proposed reforms to Australia's national security and counterterrorism laws. The government's intentions, as has been stated, are to give our national security agencies the tools they need to protect the safety and security of Australians, while at the same time ensuring that these laws do not undermine the fundamental rights and freedoms that all citizens enjoy. While these laws were necessarily introduced in an expeditious way in response to immediate crises, it is clear that, regrettably, there is an ongoing need for our national security regime. While we properly equip and tool our national security agencies for the task that they need to do, it is also important to ensure that our laws have the support of the general community as being appropriate, reasonable and balanced. Therefore, I can assure the House that the measures that we have introduced are not motivated by politics. Indeed, I can assure members that a great bulk of the work that has been picked up is in fact work of two committees of the previous parliament, where those opposite had the majority. I will take the opportunity in answering the second part of the honourable member's question, concerning our challenges, to address some of the assertions that have been made by the opposition in relation to resourcing of our national security agencies. This year's budget increased resources to our border protection and national security agencies by $1.3 billion over six years, including $685 million specifically for law enforcement and counterterrorism measures. Within my portfolio alone, some $3.4 billion this financial year has been committed to funding our national security and border protection agencies. This represents an increase of $186 million this year-as I say, for my portfolio alone. It is no secret, however, that the government has insisted that all agencies other than our defence forces achieve efficiencies, without cutting back on front-line capabilities. In that context, I note that the shadow Attorney-General has referred to some efficiencies that have been achieved, for instance, within the budget of the Australian Federal Police. In the context of the Australian Federal Police's budget itself being in the order of just over $1.3 billion, he has referred to efficiencies of $3.2 million and $1.4 million. However, he has failed to mention that these relate to corporate allocations for staff leave liabilities and corporate expenditure in the areas of human resources and finance, not front-line capabilities. The shadow Attorney-General has also pointed to efficiencies totalling some $8.2 million in the economic and special operations portfolio. I am informed that these relate to terminating a program of $4.3 million with respect to intellectual property. I am informed that changes in the calculation of costs associated with the AFP's staff leave liabilities total $1.5 million in savings, and there are anticipated savings of $2.4 million due to the expected conclusion of the oil for food inquiry. I am not going to divert the attention of the House as to how that inquiry came about. By listing and responding to what has been identified by the shadow Attorney-General, it is quite clear that there has been no cutting of funding but indeed a substantial increase in funding to enable our agencies to undertake their front-line capabilities. I also assure members that the Prime Minister himself frequently asks those agencies whether they have the resources that they need to respond to the events that our nation needs them to confront and to properly undertake their duties. Those agencies have always been provided with the resources they need. They have performed and continue to perform an outstanding job. I certainly look forward to the opposition's constructive engagement with these important issues of national security. Hospitals",101
118,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his promise to the Australian people that he would fix public hospitals by mid2009 or take them over. Prime Minister, isn't the government's decision to consult for a further six months, having first announced a plan two years ago and having consulted for 16 months and received a report with 123 recommendations, only about creating more photo opportunities and political advantage for the government?",102
119,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is committed to fundamental health and hospital reform. We were elected with a mandate to establish the Health and Hospital Reform Commission. That, led ably by Dr Christine Bennett, reported in the middle of the year. The honourable member is right to reflect on the fact it has contained within it wideranging recommendations, 123 in all, which go across the totality of the health and hospital system. I referred to these, in part, in response to a question from the honourable member for Lyne yesterday in relation to the future of the Port Macquarie Base Hospital. These go to what we do for the future of preventative care, primary care, acute hospital beds, subacute care, aged care, dental care and mental health as well. The reasons that we have had to do this are twofold. Firstly, challenges are faced right across all OECD economies at the moment coming from population change, the ageing of the population and increasing costs of medical treatments. These are matters on which the previous government, I am sure, were comprehensively advised in their period in office, which brings me to the second reason: what we saw in 12 years was a big, fat zero in terms of health and hospital reform on the part of those oppositeabsolutely zip. Instead, it was the old, old game of playing the blame game with the states. Furthermore, on top of that, not only did they embark upon no program of reform; they instead ripped out $1 billion from the public hospital system of Australia. They ignored the systemic challenges to health systems right across the world. Secondly, they did not even engage in one fundamental reform to the health system themselves despite 12 years in office, with public revenue awash off the back of the mining boom. Thirdly, instead, they ripped $1 billion out of the states. That is the system we have inherited. The honourable member's question also goes to the extent to which we now consult the community to road-test the commission's recommendations with key representatives of the health and hospital system across the country. We believe this is the right approach because the recommendations are far-reaching and, in many respects, quite radical. We would much rather hear from those working at the coalface. That is why the health minister and I have most recently been at Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, which I think those opposite would agree has been the subject of some controversy in recent times; the Flinders Medical Centre, which is a major public hospital in Adelaide; most recently at Townsville General Hospital; and, again, at Cairns Base Hospital, which has also been struggling with the huge increase in population of Far North Queensland, the particular complexities which arise from a very large Indigenous community on the cape and the impact on accident and emergency. So we make no apologies for the fact that we will be road-testing these recommendations around the country. We have also said that we would then present proposals to the Commonwealth and states for their consideration. The health minister addressed the process relating to that in her answer to a question on health and hospitals only a day or two ago. I would say this to the honourable member: whether it is health and hospitals reform, whether it is climate change reform, whether it is building the education revolution or whether it is navigating Australia through the global economic recession, this is a government which is on about the task of preparing Australia for the future. Those opposite, for 12 years, languished in the past. Today, what we have seen on such a fundamental issue as climate change is the Liberal and National parties hauling up the white flag and saying, ‘It is all too hard,' and pretending this is a serious debate about policy on their side of the House when the reality and the truth is that it is all about the internal politics of Liberal Party. What we have had today is the most appalling collapse in the authority of the Liberal leadership I have seen in this place since I have been a member. The nation wants leadership for the future, not excuses for inertia. Families",102
120,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. How is the government supporting Australian families, and are there any alternatives to this responsible approach?",103
121,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lyons for his question and for the work that he does for the families in his electorate. The Rudd government are of course committed to doing everything we can to help families and particularly to make sure that we direct that help to those who are in the most need. We have recently announced major new initiatives to support families. For the first time, this country will have a national paid parental leave scheme, a new family support program and a national child protection framework. We have also, in the last two budgets, done some very difficult things to make sure that we are targeting our family payment system to those most in need to make sure that it is sustainable for the future. We on this side of the House know that we have to be, especially in these difficult economic times, responsible for making sure that that assistance is targeted. It does seem that this is not a view shared by those opposite. We know that they have been running around the country scaring the public about debt and deficit, but what they have not told us is that, if they were in government, the level of the deficit would be even higher. I am very pleased to see the member for Warringah back in the House. It is very nice the to have him back. He has been out and about touting his book around the country. Mr Abbott interjecting",103
122,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This one is from the library. It is definitely from the library. Mr Abbott interjecting,103
123,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Warringah should contain his enthusiasm.,103

129,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is very nice to see you back, Tony. I know you have been off in the Brisbane Polo Club, no less, selling the book.",103
130,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will resume her seat.,104
131,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order refers to standing order 104. I did not hear anything in the question-that dorothy dixer-that referred to books or failed attempts to run a bit of humour. I ask that they come back to the question.",104
132,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In allowing the question I allowed the part that said, ‘are there any alternatives'.",104
133,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I reassure the member for O'Connor that it is from the library. It is great to have the member for Warringah back. We know that this book not only reveals a little bit about their family policy, it does seem to be the member for Warringah's latest effort-I am sure there will be moreat his tilt for the leadership. This book has in it just another clue about how profligate this opposition would be if they ever got into government. He reveals in this book that he, the member for Warringah and the opposition shadow minister for families, wants to abolish the means test for family tax benefit A for children under five. He is nodding! I am glad to see he still agrees with the policy that he put in his book. This would mean an extra cost to the budget bottom line-I will just let the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance know-of $1.8 billion a year. So over the forward estimates that means around an extra $7 billion to the budget bottom line. The question really is of order. Under standing order 98C a minister can only be questioned on matters for which she or he is responsible or is officially connected with. I am sure the minister will be glad to hear she is not responsible for the member of Warringah's opinions, but she is not entitled to comment on them either.",104
134,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. As I alluded to earlier, that relates to what can be in the question, and I indicated that as it referred to alternatives the response is going to that aspect of the question.",104
135,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The real question is: is this Liberal Party policy? Does the current Leader of the Opposition support this policy? Does he support the government's approach, which is to make sure that family tax benefit is targeted to make sure it is sustainable for the future, or is he having to fall into line with his rival? Mr Abbott interjecting",104
136,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said, the member for Warringah should contain his enthusiasm and not deny the member for Macarthur the call. Schools",104
137,Mr FARMER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, and I refer the minister to her answer yesterday in relation to the National partnership agreement for low SES school communities in which she blamed everyone from Verity Firth to the opposition and even the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the fact that schools in Macquarie Fields and Claymore are missing out on support. Given that she is the minister responsible for the $1.5 billion in expenditure, why will she not take responsibility for her own failure to stop the needy communities from missing out?",104
138,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. I reassure him that I, and this side of the House, take responsibility for lifting the educational standards of every child and I, and this side of the House, take responsibility for combating educational disadvantage. And why do we need to do that? Because under more than a decade of the Howard government no-one ever sat at a desk and thought about what they could do about educational disadvantage. The proof of that is that, on the day we were elected and sworn in as a front bench and as Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, if any of us had called on that day for a list of the thousand most disadvantaged schools in this country it could not have been produced. The Howard government did not care enough to even ask the question. In view of that of order. Under standing order 104, the minister was asked about taking responsibility, not the blame game.",104
139,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the point of order, again there was a long preamble. The Deputy Prime Minister has the call.",105
140,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Faced with this track record of neglect, we stepped up to the plate to take responsibility for making a difference. And how are we making that difference? A new national partnership for disadvantaged schools is part of it. As the member who asked the question would have known if he had listened to my answer yesterday which he sought to misrepresent in this place, the list published about New South Wales is a list for consultation using ABS data-that is true-because what was available was ABS data. What we are doing with our transparency reforms, which are opposed by the Liberals in New South Wales-maybe you should speak to the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales about that-is to build the information we actually need to make sure that educational resources and efforts can be brought to bear, particularly in those schools that need them the most, where students are not getting an education that will serve them well for the rest of their lives and where the kids come from school bearing the disadvantages of a poor background. We are building that. But we were not going to stand by and see another generation of Australian children failed during their education in the way the Howard government failed. We were not going to stand by and say, ‘Those kids, who only get one chance at school, can wait for us to build the transparency measures.' We were going to act immediately, and that is why we are acting on the ABS data available to us. Apart from the partnership for disadvantaged schools, we are already moving so that there will be better teachers in disadvantaged schools, better rewarded for being there-that reform is coming to New South Wales; literacy and numeracy money expended where it is needed the most to make a difference to children getting the building blocks of education; a national curriculum of quality right around the country; and early childhood reforms that make sure kids, particularly kids from disadvantaged backgrounds, come to school ready to learn. This is allied with our reforms in vocational education and training and in universities to make a difference for all but most particularly for the most disadvantaged. In the face of that, all we hear from the Liberal Party is whinging and moaning, and the only thing their shadow minister has ever done is put one speech from outside this parliament on his website this year-one speech as shadow minister for education published this year. If you want to be in the education debate, what you have to do is think about ideas that will make a difference, publish them and stand by them. That is what we are doing; that is called ‘taking responsibility'. What you are doing is laziness and arrogance, and it shows. No-one is interested in a repeat of the failed Howard years. We are there making a difference with our education revolution, and caring about educational disadvantage in this country is revolutionary. Workplace Relations",105
141,Ms OWENS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on reactions to the commencement of the new Fair Work Act on 1 July?",106
142,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Parramatta for her question, and I know that she cares about fairness and decency at work. On 1 July the government's Fair Work Act came into operation. This is, of course, the act that will make sure Work Choices is buried in a coffin, and the government wants to nail the lid of that coffin shut forever. The Fair Work Act ensures-I quote here one of its objects-that we have a ‘guaranteed safety net' that: … can no longer be undermined by the making of statutory individual employment agreements of any kind. I am asked about reactions to this. Of course, there have been a variety of reactions, but immediately following the promulgation and coming into effect of the Fair Work Act I would have to say the battlelines on fairness and decency at work were well and truly drawn. That is because this book I am holding was published by the member for Warringah-obviously not in the chamber now. But he is a man of uncommon frankness.",106
143,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,106
144,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have to say to my colleague that I actually paid for this copy, because the copy was out of the library-Jenny was using the copy in the library. So I have contributed to the sales of this book. But what we see in this book and what we have seen from the member for Warringah is some honesty, finally, on the position of the Liberal Party about Work Choices. We know the present leader of the Liberal Party is cowering. He does not want to face the Work Choices debate, so he says Work Choices is dead. We know that the first alternative leader of the Liberal Party, the member for O'Connor, is making a run for the spot, because there is no-one else so uniquely qualified to lead a party of dinosaurs. He is unbeatable in that comparative advantage. If you want to lead dinosaurs then the member for O'Connor is definitely your man. The second alternative for the position of Leader of the Opposition, the member for Goldstein, is pretty much prepared to fight the Work Choices battle, and he is on the record as saying: Above all, WorkChoices is critical to a strong economy. So, if he stepped up to the plate, the cowering would be over and the Work Choices battle would be on. But you would have to say that the man with the most honesty and gumption when it comes to this debate is the third alternative Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah. When he was giving his round of publicity interviews trying to sell this book, he was asked by Kerry O'Brien on The 7.30 Report: So you do want to revisit WorkChoices? The member for Warringah said: Well, if we are going to have productive workplaces, we can never ring down the curtain on workplace reform. He then went on to say: But things, I suspect, will be a little different by the time the next polling day comes around … I think people will be readier for reform from us … than they were at the last election. Then he has added to the 7.30 Report comments today in this House, where he said that he claimed as an important part of productivity ‘the ability to offer people a statutory non-union individual contract'-his words, not mine.  der: while the standing orders are silent on the matter, I would ask you to rule on whether it is appropriate for a secondary book launch to occur in question time.",106
145,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am pretty sure that the Manager of Opposition Business understands that that was not a point of order and is in fact an abuse of points of order.,107
146,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I well and truly understand the sensitivity of the member for Sturt about anything that promotes the member for Warringah, who is obviously after his job as Manager of Opposition Business. I have a position in that debate: the member for Warringah would be a lot better at the job. There is no doubt about that. But moving past the member for Sturt's sensitivity, obviously with these quotes from Tony Abbott we are well and truly seeing a return of the Work Choices debate. What I would ask the member for Warringah is: can he really say Australian people that Australian workplace agreements that strip away pay and conditions for working people are more appropriate during a global recession? Can he really say that during a global recession what Australians want is Australian workplace agreements that would enable their entitlement to redundancy to be stripped away, which would enable them to be dismissed for no reason at all? I thank the member for Warringah for his honesty, I thank him for the title of his book-Battlelines-because he is absolutely right. When it comes to the debate for fairness and decency at work the battleliharder nes are drawn: this side of the House standing for decency and that side of the House standing, as always, for Work Choices, no matter who leads them and no matter how many of them the Liberal Party goes through. Youth Allowance",107
147,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education-a real, serious question! Can the minister assist my constituents of Gilmore by explaining where the jobs in rural and regional Australia exist that will provide 30 hours per week for 18 months so that young people in my electorate qualify for youth allowance and realise their dreams of higher education?",107
148,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I do not know whether she should have insulted the member for Macarthur's question, but there we have it. Can I say to the member for Gilmore that the force of our youth allowance reforms is that students will be under less pressure to find work in a gap year-less pressure because more of them will qualify through the parental income test. I absolutely acknowledge that the current system, set up by the to the Howard government, which saw regional and rural participation rates in higher education go down, is constructed so that young people who want to qualify for youth allowance basically receive the message that the only way they can do that is to take a gap year and work. That situation has come about because the parental income test is so low, people do not qualify on family income, so they take the gap year, find a job and qualify that way. As the member for Gilmore rightly pointed out, the problem with a system that is geared like that is, obviously, that there are parts of our economy where it is much for young people to find work, and many regional towns are like that. Ms Julie Bishop interjecting Ms Marino interjecting",107
149,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the member for Forrest have had a good go. They will sit there in silence.,107
150,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The other great vice of that system, as statistics show, is that if young people take a gap year many of them actually do not then go on to do the university course. So what are we trying to do? We are trying through these reforms, through the changes to the parental income test, to enable people in the member for Gilmore's constituency who have family incomes in the low to middle range to qualify upfront for youth allowance. That means you could do year 12 this year and go to uni next year, having qualified-no gap year, no need to worry about getting work. More people will be qualifying that way because of the changes in parental income support. The member for Gilmore would be entitled to ask me: how many people will benefit from these changes? I can tell her: around 100,000 students will benefit from these changes-68,000 more will qualify, will get money for the first time, and 35,000 will get more money. Then her constituents who would have to move away from home will, as youth allowance recipients, automatically get the benefit of the student start-up scholarship and, if they need to move away from home, get the relocation scholarship. For them, what is that worth in the first year? The relocation scholarship and the student start-up scholarship is worth $6,254, which will enable them to make that transition into the first year of university, plus they will the youth allowance. That means more people qualifying, getting more money without having to do what the member for Gilmore is worried about and that is look for work in regional towns where it may not be available. Given our concerns, she should be out spruiking these reforms as better reforms for her constituency, because they are. Climate Change",108
151,Mr DANBY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. How is the government showing leadership in its unprecedented investment in public transport as we move to a low-carbon economy? How has this investment been received and why is a whole-of-government response, including the CPRS, important in providing leadership in climate change?",108
152,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. He certainly understands that the great challenge of climate change requires a whole-ofgovernment response. That is why this government is determined to deliver on just that. That is why we have delivered the largest ever investment in public transport. That is why we have put to the Senate today the legislation supporting the CPRS. But those opposite have today showed their zero unity by the fact that they could not move any amendments whatsoever and that they have no policy when it comes to climate change. They just do not understand the challenge that is before us. That is because, regardless of the Leader of the Opposition's position on a personal level on climate change, he has had to walk away from that because the dynamic that is leading the opposition is the dynamic of their internal divisions. This is a political coalition that simply cannot move forward. We have seen more discipline in a riot than we see from those opposite when it get comes to climate change and these issues. The fact is that the member for O'Connor has had an enormous victory today. The dinosaurs in the opposition are leading the debate on climate change. Today we have seen the future of the Liberal Party and the answer is Wilson Tuckey. That is what we have seen with the actions of the opposition in the Senate-the dinosaurs completely taking over. Behind the Leader of the Opposition we see the triceratops-the three potential leaders. We have Andrew Robb over there, Robbosaurus rex, the climate sceptic, prepared to oppose, or at least be honest about his position.  of order.",108

155,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The shadow minister, the great sceptic, said, ‘We should be putting more into proving up the science.' That was his position. Then we have the member for North Sydney, who campaigns in his electorate in favour of action on climate change but does the opposite here. Then we have over there the great sceptic, ‘People Skills', the member for Warringah, ‘Monkosaurus', who has said: The point I made about an emissions trading scheme is that I don't like it one little bit. And that was when he was advocating they should vote for it when it comes back. That was the case for voting for it when it comes back. If you had said at the beginning of this term that Unclesaurus at the back there-as he has been described by the shadow Treasurer-would be leading the debate on climate change, people simply would not have believed you. But the fact is that their disunity is having an impact on Australia. That is the great tragedy. It is holding us back from the future. The Turnbull camp are at war with the Costello camp, the Hockey camp are battling it out with the Abbott camp, the Robb camp cannot work out if it is still in the Turnbull camp and, of course, the Bishop camp has been reduced to a single tent without a pole in a very, very far corner.

179,Mr DUTTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Dickson) (4.00 pm)Today in question time we saw another opportunity for the Prime Minister to recommit to his election promise and he failed to do it. It has been six weeks now since the deadline has come and gone, the deadline that the Prime Minister set himself back in the election campaign, to fix public hospitals by mid-2009 or he would seek to take financial control of those hospitals. Every Australian heard this Prime Minister say at the last election that he would end the blame game, that on health the buck would stop with him and that he had a solution to fix public hospitals or, if he could not have the hospitals fixed under the control of the state Labor governments, he would seek to take them over. Over the last 18 months since this government has been elected nothing has happened under this government to improve our health system. In fact, at every turn, decisions that Kevin Rudd has taken have made worse the outcomes across hospitals and the health system around the country. This is a government which has, by way of decisions on private health insurance, those relating to IVF and those relating to GP super clinics, only added pressure to, not taken pressure away from, public hospitals-and for that it should be condemned. This is a government which promised so much but has delivered so little. It is certainly the case that this government led people to believe that it had a plan. It was the Prime Minister who as far back as about two years ago promised, by way of a health speech to a health summit in New South Wales, that he had a plan at that time, two years ago, to fix hospitals. That is how far back this Prime Minister had the Australian people believing that, if elected into government, he was going to carry out this plan as promised. It certainly has been an appalling record when you look at some of the examples that I want to outline as part of this debate today. The time frame was not set by the opposition; it was set by the government. The Prime Minister made that promise knowing how difficult the task would be, how difficult trying to undo the health system trashing that had taken place by state Labor governments over the last 10 years would be, but nonetheless he made that commitment. Since that time, by driving people out of private health insurance, by making sure that he was pouring more Commonwealth taxpayers' money into the black hole that is the state Labor governments, he has condemned us to failure in the next 10 years that we have seen over the last 10 years. But this was a promise that we knew from day one was going to be broken. We knew this promise to fix public hospitals was at risk when that wording was removed from the Prime Minister's website only a few months ago. It was replaced with ‘improve', which gave way to ‘assess'. So the signals were there, but Australians chose to believe that the Prime Minister would be true to his word-as of course they should. They gave this Prime Minister the benefit of the doubt. They did not believe that Kevin Rudd was just another Labor premier; they believed that he was going to end the blame game, that he was going to change the system and deliver health outcomes which would be of benefit to this nation's hospitals and to all of the doctors and nurses-who are so passionate about the health system and who crave changes, just like Australian patients. They were hoping that Kevin Rudd was not just going to break into more state premier speak. But, of course, the opposite has been shown to be the case. Let us assess just what this government has done. The government and ministers can spin all the stories they like about the supposed wonderful things that they have done in health, but the truth is that, rather than hospitals, the Prime Minister has made them worse. And the truth in health is there for all to see in the streets of towns not very far from where we are today. Let me take the Australian people to the streets of Cootamundra, where hundreds of people are protesting this afternoon about the state of health under Kevin Rudd and his state Labor mates. They are protesting about the bleak future of their local hospital. Two weeks ago the Greater Southern Area Health Service in New South Wales told doctors at Cootamundra that their funding would be slashed this financial year-slashed by more than $600,000 from the budget of last year. Cootamundra has a skilled medical staff. It is a town that has two obstetricians, two general surgeons and other qualified staff. But the disastrous decision by Labor could rob this community of that expertise. Under Rudd Labor, those doctors have been told that they will have to slash the number of medical procedures that they carry out this financial year by more than half. If this decision holds, three of these doctors have indicated they will have to leave the town so that they can practise somewhere where they can keep their skills current. The people of Cootamundra believe that this is simply the thin edge of the wedge and that, with surgery cuts, admissions will fall and, if admissions fall, the hospital may well close. That is how this Rudd government has gone about fixing public hospitals over the last 18 months. It is ironic that earlier this year the health minister was actually in Cootamundra to open a primary health centre. It was, she said, a blueprint for cooperation between community, private investors and input from government. You can almost hear the sound of the sincerity. One wonders how the people of Cootamundra consider the input from this government this afternoon. Cootamundra is fix not alone. Apparently a secret government report is calling for emergency surgery at Mount Druitt Hospital in Western Sydney also to be scrapped. The situation at Blacktown Hospital in Sydney's west is so bad that even a state Labor MP is saying that lives will be lost. I also wonder whether the young teenager from Dubbo thinks that Mr Rudd has fixed health. She badly injured her thumb recently-it was virtually torn off. She was rushed to Dubbo Base Hospital where doctors decided she had to be flown to Sydney where specialist surgeons could save the thumb. Unfortunately for this girl, it did not happen. It did not happen because it took New South Wales Health 10 hours to get her from Dubbo to Sydney. She could have driven there in half the time. One needs to remember that this is the same hospital that earlier this year could not pay its basic bills: it could not pay for bandages, it could not pay for batteries for vital equipment and it certainly could not pay for food for patients. And that is how Kevin Rudd has fixed health over the last 18 months. Then there is Townsville, and I turn to my colleague the member for Herbert. The Prime Minister has been in Far North Queensland in the last week. Hopefully, he heard the message about the failures of his Labor colleagues in Queensland, and I hope that he heard it loud and clear. Queensland Health does not believe that Australia's largest regional hospital in Townsville has the need or the expertise to operate vital life-saving equipment. Mr Turnour interjecting",111
180,Mr DUTTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Whilst this government carries on with silly, petty political interjeccost tions, people in Townsville-people around the country-are dying in public hospitals. So why don't you refrain from interjecting and start to concern yourself with people who are dying in public hospitals. The member for Leichhardt is an absolute joke in his local community because people know that the Cairns Base Hospital, which they expected to be fixed, has actually got worse since he was elected. He is a disgrace and he represents the failure of Labor members across the country to fix hospitals.",113
181,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The member will withdraw. Mr Dutton-What should I withdraw, Madam Deputy Speaker?",113
182,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You will withdraw the unparliamentary remarks in respect of the member for Leichhardt, please, so we can continue. Mr Dutton-Madam Deputy Speaker, I would be happy to oblige, but I am not aware of anything that I said that was unparliamentary. If you point me to it, I would be happy to withdraw it.",113
183,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You referred to him as ‘a disgrace'. I think you will find that, in the context, that is unparliamentary.",113
184,Mr DUTTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw. If incompetent or impotent is more applicable, then I apply that. So we have swine flu intensive care wards in North Queensland. A flu victim was recently flown to Sydney for intensive care treatment because there was not space at the Townsville hospital. We know that a week before that, at great cost, two rescue helicopters were needed to ferry another flu victim 700 kilometres around North Queensland-from Atherton to Cairns to Townsville and finally to Mackay-before he could be admitted into an intensive care ward. This tens of thousands of dollars. There were no spare beds in the two major hospitals in Northern Australia-and that is how Kevin Rudd has fixed health. The litany of woe goes on state by state-and this is how Labor manages health. The Australian people should understand that this Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of this Labor government, will deliver nothing different to that which state Labor has delivered in health over the last 10 years. The bigger problem in health at the moment, I say to the Australian people, is not the money that is going in; it is the way in which the money is being spent and managed. Under this Labor government we have seen over the last 18 months only worse outcomes, not better. Twenty months into the life of this government, the situation has got worse and it shows the potential to deteriorate further. It is this Prime Minister who less than two years ago made the promise that he had a plan to fix hospitals and who less than 18 months ago promised to fix the hospitals or take them over. This Prime Minister, on the back of the recent inquiry which sat for 16 months with 10 of the top medical practitioners and contributors in health around this country and which provided to the government 123 recommendations-he had made the same commitment 18 months or two years before that that he had a plan to fix hospitals-says that not only is he walking away from that key election promise but also now needs another six months to consult around the country, to visit 25 hospitals so that he can get photo opportunities and so that people can believe he is doing something, implementing a plan, when nothing has been adopted. All of those recommendations are sitting there and this government has not adopted one. So we are well and truly looking at another 12 to 18 months before this government can introduce the radical reform that it promised at the time of the last election. A couple of weeks ago the Minister for Health and Ageing suggested that the government would not be able to implement the changes that it thought it could or that it thought were needed in health because of the way that it had spent the money in the cash splashes. This really goes to the core of the difficulty that this government has got. I pect that the government would seek to take over hospitals if it had its way. What I suspect, though, is that because it has spent the money over the last 18 months, because it has plunged this nation into enormous debt, because this country is going to be saddled with millions and millions of dollars of est repayments over the next 10, 20 or 30 years, it has lost its capacity to implement properly the change in health that it promised. I think the Australian public now understand what we have been talking about over the course of the last 18 months. It is why we spoke about caution when this government went into a spending spree. We spoke about caution because we knew there were serious asks of the Australian people and of the taxpayers of this country coming up-and health was one such area. We need to get health right in this country, but we cannot do it if we continue down the same failed Labor path of the last 10 years. We cannot just have Commonwealth taxpayers' money being tipped into Nathan Rees's government or into Anna Bligh's government, because we know that, regardless of the money that has been tipped in the last 12 months which the health minister will speak about in a moment, outcomes in our public hospitals have not improved. If the health minister comes to the dispatch box today and suggests to the Australian people that somehow the government have improved hospitals over the course of the last 18 months then people should hold the government in the contempt that they deserve to be held. The government will not improve public hospitals or, indeed, the health system until they make the substantial change that they have promised for two years. The Australian people know-common sense tells themthat we cannot continue to operate with the management practices that we have got in public hospitals and in health sectors around susthe country. We need to introduce that reform so that the money that we are spending, the extra investment that we will make in future years, will enable better health outcomes for Australian patients. We do not want to see young families with sick children waiting for eight or 10 hours in interemergency departments around the country. We do not want to see older Australians dying on waiting lists. In some cases people are on waiting lists for up to 10 years because there are bad practices that continue to suck up all of the money that is being poured into health by the Commonwealth and state governments. By its every action over the last 18 months, this government has made outcomes in health worse than they were when this government took office in 2007. This government has driven people out of the private system and onto waiting lists in the public system. This government has made bad outcomes even worse in relation to our emergency departments around the country. That is what this government should be remembered for, and certainly the Australian on people are right to draw the conclusion that the Prime Minister is not serious about health. He is now talking about putting this off until the next election. He wants to turn this into a political advantage. We know that more than 4½ thousand people die every year because of inefficiencies in our health system, and this Prime Minister, for political advantage, wants to put off any decisions. He should be condemned- (Time expired)",113
185,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am always pleased when the member for Dickson gets an MPI and gives us an opportunity to talk about health. I think everybody across the country and probably everybody in the parliament agrees that our health system is at a tipping point and that there are problems that need to be fixed. Of course, I take issue with responsibility for the problems and with the causal links that the member for Dickson has made with some of the problems, but we agree that there are a range of problems in the system. But after getting over my initial enthusiasm and excitement that the member for Dickson has an MPI on a topic which is very important for the community, I am frustrated that the member has spent 15 minutes listing every single problem and not one single solution-and he mostly does not even stay to hear the debate. Last time he went out to conduct an interview on alcopops. He wanted to hide the fact that he had to execute a very humiliating backflip. I suppose it is no surprise that today, the very day the alcopops matter is finally passed by the Senate, the member did not raise that in his 15-minute speech about health. Let us get serious about this. We do not pretend it is easy; we do not pretend that the health system can be fixed immediately. We have invested in a range of measures, and we can spend all our time going through the range of investments we have made. But I challenge the member for Dickson to go out to Queanbeyan, in the electorate of the member for Eden-Monaro, where the GP superclinic is now contracted and underway, to ask people whether they want the GP superclinic and whether they think it is a bad idea. I challenge him to speak to the member for Herbert. He has used with glee the example of the Townsville Hospital, which is getting $250 million courtesy of the Rudd Labor governmentMr Dutton-Not one of them is open; not one has opened.",115
186,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If you would listen, you would know that I am now talking about the Townsville Hospital-and, last time. I checked, it was open. There is $250 million going there. I would like the member for Dickson to ask the member for Herbert to come and say whether he would like us to pull that money out. To add to the frustration of having a 15-minute list of problems with not a single solution being put on the table by the Liberal Party, it takes a bit of cheek for the member for Dickson to have this mostly confected outrage about consulting with the community when we have committed to a GP superclinic in his electorate. We consulted in his electorate, but the member could not be bothered to come along to the consultation. The construction work has begun, but he could not be bothered to come to the opening. Obviously he is too embarrassed to turn up in his electorate. He holds the seat with a slender margin and he may not even run in that electorate in the future, so I think it is a bit rich for him to come here and criticise us. Let us get this absolutely straight. When the previous government were in power, we criticised them for blaming every problem in the health system on the state governments. Now that they are in opposition, every problem in the public hospitals is instantly our fault. Let us not be so simplistic about this. There are a range of problems in the health system. We can invest money, we can change programs and we can improve accountability-and I will in due course give you a list of some of the things that have improved. The member has the gall to stand here and say that every decision we have made has made public hospitals worse. Let us look at a few of the decisions. How does it make public hospitals worse to invest 50 per cent more money in the delivery of services through our public hospital systems? How does it make public hospitals worse to deliver 41,000 extra elective surgery procedures which would not have been provided if the Commonwealth did not give that money? How does it make public hospitals worse in the electorate of the member for Forde when our $700 million investment in emergency departments is putting $44 million into the emergency department there? How does it make public hospitals worse to continue to invest in elective surgery equipment and new theatres? How does it make matters worse at Calvary Hospital when there is a new elective surgery theatre and more people are now having their elective surgery done? The member for Dickson is living in some sort of fairyland. He thinks we can wave a wand and everything will be fixed on day one. The truth is that the public understand how complex this debate is. Even when we go to hospitals that are having challengeshospitals that are having difficulty handling swine flu cases, or hospitals like Royal North Shore Hospital, which has historically had in problems-the clinicians, the nurses, the psychiatrists and the GPs who service the local area come to us time and time again and say: ‘We want to be part of this process. These are the things that we think are good in the Health Reform Commission recommendations and these are the things we think should be different. Thank you, Prime Minister, for coming and talking to us about this.' I think it is just nonsense to pretend that these difficult problems do not merit consultation with the community, consultation with the clinicians, consultation with the nurses and consultation with the specialists who are delivering these services. I do not think people will take the member for Dickson seriously when he just stands up and lists the problems. In a particular instance, he has fundamentally misled the parliament. He said there is a protest in Cootamundra about the Rudd Labor government for a decision made by an area health service run by the New South Wales government. Mr Dutton-Blame game!",115
187,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Dickson cannot pretend, with his trite interjections about ‘blame game', that he is not standing up and absolutely misleading the House, confecting and confusing two different issues. We want to work to fix those problems. If the member bothered to visit the primary care centre that was opened in CootamundraMr Dutton-Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I took offence to the words of the minister, and I ask that you ask her to withdraw them.",116
188,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"For the assistance of the House, even though they are not actually unparliamentary, I am going to ask the minister to withdraw them, because we have such little time.",116
189,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw and say that he tells a fundamental mistruth. The protest in Cootamundra has absolutely nothing to do with the Rudd government. It does not do him any credit-someone who has got some brains but does not like to use them-to stand up in here and constantly criticise but not actually come forward with any ideas. I am proud of the work that our government is doing. It does not surprise me that the members that we see in the House are those who have benefited already in their electorates from the sorts of investments we are making. Sure, we would like them to be delivered more quickly. Sure, we would like every patient to be able to have access immediately. But, if we look at the trajectory of what is happening with our population, health expenditure and the extra two million presentations in our emergency departments compared to a decade ago, of course it is going to take time to fix some of these things. But I do not hear the member for Page saying that she does not want the cancer services in Lismore or the breast care nurseMs Saffin-Or the GP superclinic.",117
190,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"or the GP superclinic, because these things will improve the situation in her electorate. The member for Parkes is here, a member who has had significant problems in his local hospital in Dubbo-and we are not apologists for the states; we want those problems to be fixed-and he is lobbying me for a GP superclinic. So do not come in here as the shadow health spokesperson and say that nothing we are doing is delivering. I am sorry that you happened to be here for that, Member for Parkes-we take seriously the request that has been made; it is a very good proposal from Gunnedah-but, if your shadow health spokesperson says that everything we are doing is terrible, at the same time as all the members on the backbench are saying, ‘Can we please have one of these in our electorate; they're so terrible that we really want one,' no-one is going to believe him. I think that is the fundamental problem for the member for Dickson: nobody believes his position on anything anymore. The alcopops debate has really been the peak of that. He was vehemently arguing against it week after week after week-‘We're never going to support it; we won't do it'-then had to that execute that humiliating backdown and make an announcement that they would support it. He cannot bring himself to come in here now and say that it is a good idea. He absolutely defends the strength of the seat of Dickson and how much he loves the area, and then the second that it gets to be a hard fight for him locally he starts to indicate that he is looking around to run in another seat. This is the person who, according to media reports, was reduced to tears when he thought that the Labor candidate had beaten him in the election. But there is no doubt that he has never shed a tear for Medicare. He has never shed a tear for anybody who cannot get access to public hospital services when they want them. He has never put his mind at all to what an alternative policy might look like. We see this with the CPRS. We see this with education. This is an opposition that is so obsessed with its internal leadership problems that it cannot put forward any sort of policy proposal. I think that is absolutely pathetic. What I would like to do in the remaining time available is to talk about some of the communities that are benefiting from our investmentsMr Dutton-What about your election promise?",117
191,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"which were also election promises. I see that the member for Makin is here. A GP superclinic has been announced and signed on to in his electorate, something that he is very pleased is going to be delivered. Mr Dutton-How many patients has it seen?

196,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Dickson will desist from interjecting.,118
197,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He is just wrong but he cannot help himself. What I really want to put to the member today-and maybe some of the other members in the debate might address some of these issues-is that we have to make choices now about how our health system will be sustainable and how we will fund some of the important reforms that the community rightly wants and expects. What we have seen the member opposite do-as he did with alcopops-is oppose any measure that has a health impact if it also has a etary impact. He opposed the private health insurance measure, a fair measure to make sure that those on the highest incomes get the least support and those on the lowest incomes get the most support. But they knocked that off, and that is $2 billion that will not be available in the health budget to spend on other worthy reforms. Then there are the safety net reforms, where we are saying we are not going to continue to line the pockets of specialists who are making outrageous sums of money-$2 million, $3 million, $4 million a year-from Medicare and the safety net. Now it looks like the Liberal Party might not keep the shadow Treasurer's promise to pass all budget measures except the private health insurance measures. They have gone wobbly on that. That is another $450 million. Just those two items are worth $2½ billion. I would like the Liberal Party to tell me what they are going to cut if they are going to oppose these sensible savings measures. I want the Liberal Party to stand up and say what they want to cut. Do you want us not to proceed with our regional cancer centres across the country? Do you want us not to proceed with the funding of Avastin for bowel cancer? Do you want us not to consider the next life-saving drug that comes out to be put on the PBS for young children? Do you want us not to invest in these important things? Perhaps the member does not want us to invest in the vaccine for swine flu. If you keep opposing savings that are sensible and targeted and require people who have more resources to contribute more, then we will not have the money to pay for these important extra investments. I think everyone on this side of the House wants our investments to be targeted and wants to see the health system delivering more for people, and it cannot be done if we do not make sure we have the money to do it. budgWe do not have the Liberal Party with any policies. We do not have them with any answers about the difficult choices they could make. We do have the member for Dickson on the record as saying that the one thing he wants to make sure we do not do is repeat in the next decade the mistakes his government made in the last decade. We are absolutely sure we are not going to do that, but to not do that we need to make sure we are investing more, we are requiring more accountability and we are targeting our spending to those who need it most. We do not make any apologies for investing in communities like Western Sydney, for investing in Westmead. I see the member for Parramatta is here. Westmead has another $4.1 million going into its medical assessment unit. We can see something similar for every member of the House. What have you ever done? Debate interrupted. NA",118
198,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Vietnam War",119
199,Mr BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Paterson) (4.30 pm)Vietnam Veterans Remembrance Day is 18 August, and services will be held around Australia throughout next week. With this in mind, I rise today to talk about a subject of national importance and one that is embedded deep within the Australian psyche. I am, of course, referring to the six Australian vice personnel who were missing in action following the cessation of Australia's involvement in Vietnam in 1973. Those men were Private Peter Gillson, Lance Corporal Richard Parker, Lance Corporal John Gillespie, Private David Fisher, Flying Officer Michael Herbert and Pilot Officer Robert Carver. I will be talking about this issue at greater length during a Vietnam Veterans Remembrance Day speech in my electorate of Paterson next week. Today, I will focus on the discovery and identification of Flying Officer Herbert and Pilot Officer Carver. The Vietnam War conjures up a variety of images in the minds of those who have read about it, lived through it or fought in it, yet exactly what defines the Vietnam War for most Australians is often drawn from a mosaic of images seen in films that attempt to depict or glorify America's role in the conflict. The Australian experience in the Vietnam War differs from that portrayed in American period films-indeed, the experiences of those soldiers in Vietnam, both Australian and American, differed immensely depending on where they fought and when the fighting occurred. The Vietnam War remains remarkably fresh in the minds of many Australians, and this memory is not just limited to army history buffs or those who served in Vietnam. Perhaps this is because, as former Chief of Army Lieutenant General Peter Leahy said: The Army today has much to learn from the Vietnam years. It resembles much more closely the type of operations we have been conducting since 1998 than do the operations of the Divisions and Corps of the two World Wars. … Counter revolutionary warfare, counter insurgency warfare, low intensity conflict: the names may change but the method of fighting them does not. Although the lessons learnt from the Vietnam serWar will certainly be played over in the minds of military strategists today, the sad and everlasting impression of the war has recently re-entered the hearts of all Australians with the discovery of the last two missing airmen from the war. On 30 July this year, after extensive research, forensic investigation and many expeditions into rugged terrain, Flying Officer Michael Herbert and Pilot Officer Robert Carver were identified. Flying Officer Herbert was 24 years old when his Canberra bomber was lost. From Glenelg, in South Australia, he joined No. 2 Squadron in February 1970 and was the pilot of the ‘Magpie 91'. Flying Officer Herbert was a veteran of 198 operational sorties over Vietnam. Pilot Officer Carver was also 24 years old. He was the navigator on the ‘Magpie 91' and had conducted 33 sorties in Vietnam. Pilot Officer Carver, from Toowoomba, in Queensland, joined No. 2 Squadron in September 1970. Since the discovery of their aircraft in April, research teams have been working hard to identify the two airmen and close a long-open chapter in Australia's military tory. I would like to pass on my sincere appreciation to the RAAF investigation team, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the Army History Unit for their tireless work in discovering the aircraft's location and identifying the lost men. I would also like to acknowledge the support afforded to them by former members of the North Vietnamese Army, former Viet Cong soldiers and local Vietnamese villagers. The finding of these two airmen gives us the opportunity to reflect on how we treated our troops after the cessation of Australia's involvement in Vietnam in 1973. Although Flying Officer Herbert and Pilot Officer Carver were killed in action almost 40 years ago, their rediscovery marks an appropriate time for all of us to remind ourselves of the importance of supporting our diggers before, during and after their tours of duty. I began today by asking what defines the Vietnam War for Australians. For most, I believe it is defined by those not familiar with the Australian war experience in Vietnam. I believe that the discovery of Flying Officer Herbert's and Pilot Officer Carver's remains will go some way in redefining the Australian experience in the Vietnam War. The discovery of our last two diggers, who have been lost in the Vietnamese jungle for almost 40 years, is testament to the Australian spirit and the untouchable quality of mateship. Yet, as important as this discovery is for the nation's conscience, the news of the discovery and identification of Flying Officer Herbert and Pilot Officer Carver will touch no heart more than those of the families of these missing airmen. It brings closure to a long and painful chapter in their lives. Telstra",119
200,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,ADJOURNMENT,"Today I would like to mention a matter which has caused concern to many in my hiscommunity, particularly low-income older citizens. I refer specifically to the move by Telstra to charge people to pay their bill in person-or charge people for the privilege of giving Telstra money. Just think about that: a charge for paying for a service for which you are already paying quite handsomely now. I said this has caused great concern. That may be putting it a little lightly, as some of my constituents have expressed great anger and astonishment at such a move, hence the visits to my office, phone calls, letters and emails-and I would not be surprised, of course, if my colleagues in this House were receiving them as well. In a move to appease some of the venom which followed the announcement, Telstra will not charge pensioners and others on benefit cards. But even some of those who will receive this concession are still telling us that they think it is unfair to force this on their friends and family who may not fall into that category. My region has one of the lowest average incomes in the country",120
201,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,ADJOURNMENT,"and, as my colleague the Chief Government Whip mentions, this is a tax on poverty. While some may be exempt because of concessions, many will be just over the threshold but still have to cope with this cost if they do not have the option to pay electronically and/or over the internet. The $2.20 charge may not seem much, but it is more the principle that you will be charged for paying your bill in the way that you may have done for decades-in short, an objection to Telstra trying to herd customers online by charging $2.20 for over-the-counter payments. Now Telstra tell us that they are seeking to encourage people to move to newer, more efficient ways to pay one's bills, but this is under the guise of offsetting what Telstra say are ‘payment options which incur higher administration costs'. I put it to Telstra: why not give people a discount for going down this track, as I understand some other utilities in other states do? Some may defend the move by telling us that the major telco competitors like Optus, Vodafone and 3 also charge the same or similar amount for paying a ‘paper bill'. But that does not make it right. it. For my home state of Tasmania, Telstra is by far the predominant provider of communications services, so even if this were offered by a competitor many would have little option to change. Quite surprisingly to me the move has been defended, in part, by consumer group Choice, which says it is a way of migrating people to the new ways of payment. They do note that it must come with scope for people to change. Alas for some in my electorate they are happy with their lot in life and do not want to move to these new ways from something that works fine for them and has for many years. Telstra say the changes are aimed at recouping massive losses in administration costs. But perhaps for a few of us we think that this might be something Telstra could just manage, when they are forecast to announce today a profit of some $4 billion. On top of this, they have in recent years paid their top executives what many would consider obscene salaries and bonuses such as $9 million to recently departed Sol Trujillo for his final year in the job. In addition, TelWhen stra are not sparing those who already choose to use an electronic form of payment either-lifting the rate for those who use a credit card to pay their bills. Surcharges for those using credit cards will rise to one or two per cent of the total bill. Choice spokesman Christopher Zinnwhom I must say I admire very much for his attack on bank fees-speaks about the move as being part of a broader technological and environmental change among major companies. But why not provide encouragement to change, rather than penalising people for paying something essential like their phone bill. A telephone is today an essential part of life for most people, particularly poorer people. The people who will be most hurt by this charge are those who indeed can least afford Perth: Airport Noise",120
202,Mrs MOYLAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Pearce) (4.39 pm)Anyone familiar with the eastern hills communities in the electorate of Pearce will be well aware of the overwhelming sense of serenity these areas provide. For many people, the choice to live in the hills has been very deliberate, driven by the peace and tranquillity offered. But this lifestyle choice has been shattered for many by a bureaucratic decision made with little care or consideration for those who are affected. In fact, the process, or the lack of it, demonstrates an arrogance that has reached an art form. Many people would hasten to say that aircraft noise-which the decision was aboutis simply a fact of life, and they are right. But for members of the affected communities, aircraft noise has become an intrusive, ever-present and deeply disturbing aspect of their daily lives. Because of the sheer quantity of planes flying overhead, this is not a simple ‘not in my backyard' argument. One constituent wrote and said: you are talking about aircraft on a flight path 600 to 800 metres from your residence at 1:30 am, 2:30 am and 3:30 am, I would defy anyone to tell you that this is acceptable. I would suggest to you that some form of compromise must be possible; it cannot be fair just to us to endure both the outgoing aircraft and incoming aircraft as well. At meetings of the Perth Airport Noise Management Consultative Committee during the previous year, the committee was advised of a review of flight paths but were not advised that changes had been implemented. Many of us became aware of the significant changes when affected residents began contacting our offices early this year. From these earlier meetings of PANMCC it was reasonable for members to conclude that any changes were unlikely to have a significant impact on any one group of people or any one area. The noise assessment process is conducted internally by Airservices Australia and it is done without clear and understandable public information. The changes have occurred without an adequate public consultation process. An approach by me to the federal minister, the Hon. Anthony Albanese MP, for an urgent briefing into the actions of Airservices Australia took over a month to be responded to, despite repeated calls to his office. Eventually, my request was passed on to Airservices Australia and a meeting was arranged in Perth. Information was sought by me and my colleagues the member for Swan and the member for Canning with regard to the concentration of air traffic over parts of our electorates. A request for the CASA safety report, which gave rise to the necessity for the change, has subsequently been denied to us by Airservices Australia. It is quite clear to all members of the noise management committee that a major overhaul of the consultation process is urgently needed. Changes to flight paths have a dramatic effect on land use and on the quality of life for residents, and it is extremely arrogant of the minister and of Airservices Australia management to ignore repeated calls for an adequate public consultation process to be expect implemented. I would urge the minister to take control of his department and order a further review, where the requirements of safety are considered in tandem with a more even distribution of aircraft noise over the whole of the metropolitan area. Consultations should be open for discussion about curfews, noise abatement measures and compensation available to affected residents, as has happened in other major capital cities in Australia. I will continue to vigorously advocate for my communities' demands to be heard and for a decent public consultation process that is open and accountable. I have made a submission to the master plan to expand Perth Airport, objecting to further expansion until a satisfactory public consultation process is agreed to along with the establishment of a clear pathway for government subsidised insulation and compensation claims for affected homeowners. Open and public consultation is the cornerstone of our democratic system of government, and I think what has happened has been very, very shabby treatment indeed of the constituents of Pearce and other areas in the Perth metropolitan area. I ask again for the minister to take note of the concerns of residents in the Perth metropolitan area and to ensure that there is a proper public consultation process in the spirit of arriving at a more even distribution of aircraft noise over the metropolitan area of Perth. Member for Oxley",121
203,Mr RIPOLL,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to take this opportunity to correct the record in terms of a number articles, mostly in the Australian newspaper. Its campaign of smear and slander in the past month has been based on nothing more than unrelated matters creatively weaved together by collaborators Milne, Parnell, Bita, Fraser and others into some sort of high-order conspiracy. Their claims, innuendo and allegations that there must exist a connection between a range of events-in particular the purchase of two blocks of residential land in Bowen by my wife and her two business partners, the state government and/or any Chinese mining company or interests-are completely absurd, false and silly. Claims that something must be wrong because they have limited development experience fail to take into account the partnership group having paid a specialist consultant to carry out development application and subsequent work in lieu of locality and experience. The claim that somehow the timing of the purchase must be the result of some inside knowledge is equally absurd and false. Anyone who has purchased land at any time as an investment will understand the lengthy process of consideration and the risk taken by those involved. The spurious claim that the partnership pushed through a DA with the local council is completely false. No such thing took place and the process, time and expense were as for any other application. The private dealings of my family, all carried out properly under Australian law and declared in the Register of Members' Interests, do not in any way equate to some misconduct or high-order conspiracy, as creatively purported by the Australian newspaper and these so-called journalists. The claim that one or both of my wife's business partners operate a financial planning firm is false or fact. and incorrect-not that there would be anything wrong if they did or if anyone else did. It is just another part of the entertainment conspiracy created in their own minds. My wife and others formed a company called Group Four Solutions Pty Ltd, but unfortunately it was dissolved almost immediately after its creation because of the changed circumstances of one of its partners and did not trade at all. The repeated claim that a developer in my electorate has named a street after me is completely false. All the streets in that area were named exclusively by the Ipswich City Council and contain the names of every elected member in the region-hardly special treatment. The unrelated-to-anything story written by Andrew Fraser discussing the corrupt days of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen which begins with the detail of the land purchased by my wife and her partners is a deceptive and unprofessional attempt to lead readers into believing that somehow the two situations are similar in nature, and it is reprehensible. Nothing could be further from reality and I completely reject any inference, link or other notion bearing any resemblance to the corrupt regime of the Bjelke years. This is akin to writing about murderers and rapists and then including someone's name in the story in an attempt to link the two by association. I find this technique, repeatedly used many times by Glenn Milne, Sean Parnell, Natasha Bita and Andrew Fraser, as completely reprehensible and the lowest form of gutter journalism. It reflects everything that is wrong with the media and the low regard the community has for it. The even lower act of then getting their mates in radio not only to repeat these falsehoods but also to invite Glenn Milne on 4BC Drive to talk about himself and promote their creative conspiracy by attacking my family is particularly out of proportion to any standards of decency On all of the other claims of a similar nature, which I do not have time to deal with tonight, I categorically reject any of the spurious allegations, inferences, innuendo and smear as completely baseless and false. It is just fanciful journalism, more designed around entertainment and providing cover for a fractured Liberal Party than anything based in reality. Perhaps the many hardliving years in Canberra have softened the collective brain cells of these esteemed mudslingers and creative conspirators. Let me now turn to some interesting facts that may balance the ledger on the other side of politics, as it seems that all the attention from our friends in the media have been onesided-and the Liberals have taken the opportunity to put in the boot with glee. Cronyism is rife within the Queensland Liberal National Party. Since being re-elected with an LNP majority in March 2008, Campbell Newman has appointed five Liberal Party hacks to Brisbane City Council board positions. These are Gary Spence, Greg Bowden, Carol Cashman, Gary Hardgrave and Rick Jefferies. The appointments of Greg Bowden, Carol Cashman, Gary Spence and Rick Jefferies were not announced publicly. Gary Spence, former Liberal Party state president and current LNP vice-president, was re-appointed to the board of Brisbane CityWorks and additionally appointed to the City Design Advisory Board after Campbell Newman's recent re-election. Since 2006, Mr Spence has made personal donations of $100,000 to Campbell Newman's campaign fund, Forward Brisbane Leadership. Greg Bowden is a former advisor to the Lord Mayor and is currently the financial controller of Forward Brisbane Leadership. Mr Bowden has now been appointed to two boards, the City Business Advisory Board and Brisbane Transport Advisory Board. Again, these appointments were not announced publicly, and Mr Bowden now receives $18,500 per annum per board appointment, totalling $37,000 per year. Rounding out the board roles for mates is former member for Moreton Gary Hardgrave and former councillors Carol Cashman and Rick Jefferies. If only Malcolm Turnbull could flick a few jobs to his mates down here in Canberra his leadership would be far more secure. I leave this information for the media to digest. Calare Electorate: Health Services",122
204,Mr JOHN COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"Calare) (4.49 pm)Kevin Rudd made health a federal issue at the last election. While health services are going from bad to worse under his watch, the Prime Minister is reviewing the latest review. In Cudal about three weeks ago the accident and emergency services were totally taken away. Two five-day-a-week full-time nurse positions have gone and pathology services have been cut back. Cudal needs accident and emergency services particularly when you consider the rescue helicopter covering that area only operates during the day and has no winch, but I shall come to that later. Aged-care beds are also desperately needed in Cudal. There are no aged-care beds, with loved ones making big journeys to other centres to see family members cared for, which is difficult because there is no public transport in most regional areas. Cudal is the same town that was promised a new hospital eight years ago that was never delivered. People were also promised the new hospital would include 24-hour emergency care, GP services and a 10-bed facility for elderly residents. They were not delivered. In Bathurst, which is also in the Greater Western Area Health Service, the local Western Advocate newspaper this week reported the case of a young mother who was told, because there was no obstetrician available, her caesarean would need to be rescheduled. Apparently the hospital's permanent anaesthetist and obstetric staff were not available at the time. The paper also highlights the fact that Wattle Flat has no ambulance service. Let us remember this area is also serviced by the same Orange based rescue helicopter which only operates during the day. The Orange helicopter services a far greater area than the Wollongong ones does. It has to go further west than Cobar and it actually has more calls on its time than the one in Wollongong, which is only 12 minutes from Sydney. Wollongong also has a large 24-hour service with a winch. In Nyngan, where a new multipurpose health service has recently been opened, there is provision for only one doctor to attend the hospital. If that doctor is on leave, there is no medical service. In Cobar, a town of 6,000 people, women cannot give birth to their children locally. It is a town of 6,000 people, 460 kilometres from one major hospital and over 300 kilometres from the other. The maternity section of the hospital has been closed for some time. The continuation of the community being able to say, ‘I was born and bred in Cobar,' is no more. Mothers now have no choice but to travel 300 kilometres to Dubbo to have their child, if they make it, which some do not. Many do notluckily the Nevertire publican is married to a very good RN who has had to feature in that service. Bourke is lucky. They have a part-time maternity unit, which is fine if your baby decides to come along when the unit is open. If not, it is a 370-kilometre trek to Dubbo. Just this week, a public meeting in White Cliffs has told Greater Western Area Health Service they will not stand by and let their services be diminished, which is the intention of GWAHS. This is a community who want to embrace programs for women's health, mental health, child and adolescent health, obesity and diabetes prevention. It is not just a lack of available professionals fecting rural health; it is the bottom line the obsession of the New South Wales government with a slash-and-burn mentality to health economics. The Orange based helicopter rescue covers a vast area of central and western New South Wales. From what I have just said, you will realise how necessary it is-with the state government taking away services from all these regional towns-to have a 24-hour service conducted by the Orange rescue service instead of the eight to six service which it currently has during daylight. Any logically thinking government interested in saving lives would make Orange the biggest and best in the state with a winch and 24-hour service, but not Labor New South Wales. Labor, federally, is sitting on its hands as the Prime Minister will not make good on his commitment in August and November of 2007 prior to the election when he committed that the buck would stop with him on health. Emissions Trading Scheme",124
205,Mr TURNOUR,ADJOURNMENT,"Leichhardt) (4.54 pm)Today the coalition voted against the national interest. They voted against the global interest. They voted against the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. They voted against a government plan and legislation to ensure that Australia, in the future, will reduce its carbon pollution. They voted against a plan that would enable Australia to go to the Copenhagen negotiations later this year and provide leadership in the global community. They did that not because they were considering the national interest but because they are so caught up in their own political interests. The reality is that the government took to the last election a commitment to introduce an emissions trading scheme. The government took to the last election a comaf- mitment to increase the mandatory renewand able energy target. We have an election mandate for these policies. The opposition is standing in the way of the wishes of the Australian people. The Australian people want the Australian government to take action on climate change. They want the opposition to get out of the way and they want us to be able to implement our policies. But, sadly, the opposition are in disarray. On Monday this week, we saw the opposition bring down yet another report, the Frontier report, but it is not opposition policy; it is something they want to discuss as well as building on their so-called principle-about six weeks earlier-in terms of what they might do about climate change. The government, as I said, took to the election a commitment to introduce an emissions trading scheme and they took to the election a commitment to introduce a mandatory renewable energy target. We took those and we got elected. Since then and prior to the election we had the Garnaut report. We have had a green paper, we have had a white paper, we have had draft legislation, and now we have got legislation that has been passed in the House and has now been voted down in the Senate. The opposition has had 18 months in opposition to consider this issue and has not been able to come up with a policy. It had 10 years prior to that to take action. The so called Leader of the Opposition-and I say ‘so-called' leader of the opposition because there is not much leadership on this issue coming from the opposition-has been shown up to be a hypocrite on this issue because, in the lead-up to the last election, he leaked very clearly that he thought the government at the time-the Howard government-should have signed the Kyoto protocol and that he supported an emissions trading scheme. But today in parliament he had the National Party running question time and he had the sceptics in the other chamber voting down our legislation. It is an indication of the lack of leadership that he has and the lack of control he has got over his party that he is on the record as supporting an emissions trading scheme and on the record as saying he wants to see action on climate change, but, over there in the other place, we have got the sceptics out and about effectively voting down our legislation. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate is effectively a clear sceptic. Senator Minchin today in the debate said that CO2 is not by any stretch of the imagination a pollutant and that this whole extraordinary scheme is based on the, as yet, unproven assertion that anthropogenic emissions of CO2 are main driver of global warming. We have got the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate basically a sceptic and we have got the Leader of the Opposition out of control and unable to control his troops in relation to this issue. Sadly, members like me that come down from Cairns, who represent a vibrant and very important tourism industry in this country, are looking for leadership from this government and are strong in our support for an emissions trading scheme for the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme because we recognise that the real jobs in the tourism industry are under threat if we do not take action on climate change. On the day that the Leader of the Opposition was releasing the Frontier report-not a policy but a report-we have got another report highlighting the real risk to the Great Barrier Reef and tourism jobs from climate change if we do not take action. The Oxford Economics report commissioned by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation estimated the reef's value at $17.9 billion in the Cairns region with permanent coral bleaching expected to devastate visitor numbers. We have got reports like this that show that the real risks, if we do not take action, are to jobs in the tourism industry and risks to our environment. The opposition is to get out of the way, support our legislation and allow us to go to Copenhagen with a strong policy position and able to provide strong leadership in the global community.
