2,Mr HADLEY,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"Will the Minister for the A r m y state the number of Japanese at present in the islands in the Pacific, and the number of Australian troops guarding them ? Will the right honourable gentleman ensure that only the minimum number of Australian troops required shall be retained in the islands, and thus permit the balance of those now there to be returned to Australia for discharge at as early a date as possible?",11
3,Mr FORDE,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"The total number of Japanese personnel at present held by the Australians in New Guinea is 1,668. This total is composed of Japanese personnel held as war criminals, or in connection with the trial of war criminals. The numbers of Australian A r my personnel in New Guinea and adjacent areas at the 27th May, 1946, were: Morotai, 750; New Guinea, New B r it a in and the Solomons, 8,073; total, S,823. The number of troops at present in New Guinea, New B r it a in and the Solomons has been reduced to 3,600. It is anticipated that 2,100 of these will be shipped out by the end of this month, leaving a total of 1,500 members of the Australian Militar y Forces in that area at the beginning of July, 1946. These personnel, togetherwith the personnel in the Morotai area, will be required for the time being to guard and maintain army equipment, stores and vehicles in the area until evacuation; but it is anticipated that a progressive reduction will be effected until evacuation is complete. [04] WAR CRIMES. TRIAL OF JAPANESE-RESIGNATIO N OF COUNSEL.",11
4,Mr HARRISON,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"Can the Acting ' Minister for External A f fair s, state whether it is true, as a report from Tokyo alleges, that seven members of ' the War Crimes Defence section have decided to resign? Have the resignations been actuated by dissatisfaction with the conduct of the trial of General Tojo, one-time Japanese War Premier, and the other 25 Japanese war leaders whom they were appointed to defend? In view of Australia's interest in the prosecution of Japanese war criminals, can the honourable gentleman make a statement on the matter ?",11
5,Mr MAKIN,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"1I have no official knowledge of the circumstances mentioned. I shall seek further knowledge on the subject and, if possible, make a statement on the motion for the adjournment of the House this afternoon. JUTE.",11
6,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"At page twelve of the publication, Australian Trade Commissioner Service, issued by the Public Relations Directorate, Export Division, Department of Commerce and Agriculture, this statement appearsThe question of the acreage to be sown in Bengal with jute in 1940 has been recently reviewed in the light of the food situation at present obtaining in the country. As a result of this review, it has been decided that(a.) an acreage of 0 annas of the basic acreage of 1940 should be licensed this year; The production of jute being of importance to the wheat and wool-growers of Australia, will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture state what that means? If it applied to any member of the Ministry, I could understand what it meant; but I do not understand its meaning in connection with acreage.",11
7,Mr SCULLY,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,I assume that it means what it says. COAL-MINING INDUSTRY. SUPPLIES FOR VICTORIA-DAVIDSO N REPORT.,11
8,Mr HOLT,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"Has the Prime Minister read the announcement that, unless coal is. supplied to Victoria immediately, gas will berationedin Melbourne from Saturday or Sunday ofi this week-end? Is it. a fact, as reported-, that the Prime Minister promised the Premier of. Victoria, Mr 'Cain, that 65,000 tons of coal would be sent toVictoria and that that quantity has not been supplied'?' Will the right honourable gentleman inform the House why the supplies have not been made available? In' view of the grave position of fiiel supplies in Victoria, and the acute hardships to domestic and-indus*trial' users to be expected from the failure of their supplies in mid-winter, will the Prime Minister give an assurance that immediate emergency steps will be taken to relieve'the situation?'",11
9,Mr CHIFLEY,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"I have not read the statement to which, the honourable member has referred, but I discussed the matter by telephone with the Premier of Victoria when I was in Melbourne recently. I alsospoke to hihi on the matter by tele1 phone as Ibte as yesterday afternoon. It is true that a week previously, ships proceeding to Melbourne with coal were delayedby bad weather, lit is also' true that the Premierof Victoria, told me yesterday afternoon that the coal position in that. State was most serious. anrangedi with' the Minister for Supply andShipping, who administers matters relating to coal, to let me have, the latest information concerning the position; and the possibility of having, supplies of-coal forwarded to Victoria. I sent a telephone message to Mr Cain yesterday afternoon intimating the best that could-- be done in the circumstances. At our previous discussion he had asked that the quantity of coal being forwarded by train should be increased, and that was done to - the extent of about 300 tons aday. The House should understand that Victoria is getting more coal from New South Wales now than it was prior to the war, and it is receiving ahigherpercentage of the total output of New South Wales coal than before the war.",12
10,Mr HOLT,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,Is it receiving' greater supplies than during the war years?,12
11,Mr CHIFLEY,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"I shall obtain a statement giving an exact answer to that question. Apart from the difficulties of production, there is an ever-increasing demand' for coal, and that applies to J Itidust/ryt. toria as elsewhere. Prior to the war.; Victoria was getting less than 900,000 tons of coal, and it is now receiving an average of. over 1,000,000 tons.. I am not putting that fact forward in extenuation of the shortage or delays,, but there is an increased demand for coal in Victoria. For some timetherewas a. breakdown of themachinery with which brown coal is produced in Victoria. I shall obtain a precise statement of the coal position, and let the honourable member have it as soon as' possible. '",12
12,Mr EYAN,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"Can the Prime Minister say when copies of Mr J.ustiee Davidson's report on the coal-miningindustry will be available? Mr,v CHIFLEY - The magnitude - of the report,, and the fact that it' contains a great many graphs, have created technical difficulties for the printers. For, this reason, the Government Printer found, that *it would' be extremely difficult to do the work, and-, an endeavour was then made to have the report printed: elsewhere, but without, success. I now understand' that, the Government Printer can undertake the work provided expert assistance is made available here. I have' not inquired during the last few weeks I regarding the progress of the work, but I ' shall do so, and shall advise the honourable member of' the result' of my inquiries. ARMEDFORCES'. DEMOBILIZATION .",12
13,Mr RYAN,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"Will the Minister for Post-waiv Reconstruction inform, the House whether steps> will be taken? to ensure a more even rate of: demobilization than at present as between, the various services.? I cite the example of five young men who were apprenticed"" to process engravers. Two of themjoined the Army> and now have four audi a half and three years, service respectively - They are still serving-, whilst: three others; who have had service of three years, three years and two years respectively in the A i r Force; have been discharged i It . seems unfair that some-should serve longer than others because they belong todifferent armsof the services.",12
14,Mr DEDMAN,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"It would be imposVicsible to ensure that men who' enlisted in different services shall receive absolutely the same treatment in regard to demobilization. The requirements of the services vary. For instance,'I understand that in the Navy certain ships have to be manned, and, (therefore, the retention of a 'certain' uiunbejr of men cannot be .avoided. However, I shall see whetheranything can be done on the lines suggested by the honourable member. It would assist me if he would supply me with .details of the 'Cases menitioned by him. WOOL AND WHEAT.",12
15,Mr ABBOTT,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"In view of the fact that the Government has agreed to increase the .subsidy to Australian woollen 6 manufacturers, on the ground of a problematical rise of the price of wool after the 30th June next, can the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs say whether the Government proposes to increase the subsidy on wheat for poultry-farmers; alternatively, does it propose, in view of the coming rise of the price of wheat, to increase the price of eggs payable to the producer, and to subsidize the retail price? Mr Forde. - I shall discuss the matter with the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. AGEICULTDEAL MACHINERY. TRACTORS.",13
16,Mr TTJENBULL,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"In view of the facts that wheat-growers this season had difficulty in sowing their crops because of the scarcity of tractors of sufficient power-som e farmers having, to limit their acreage on that account-and that in many districts fallowing will be delayed for the same reason, can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture say when tractors of sufficient power will.be available in larger numbers to primary producers.",13
17,Mr SCULLY,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"It . is generally admitted that not enough tractors are available to meet the demand. The Government has .done all that is humanly possible to obtain more. The Director General of Agriculture is 'now in the United States of America, where trying .to expedite the delivery of tractors to Australia. Nevertheless, we are still many thousands short of requirements, and I cannot bold out much hope that the demand - will be satisfied in the immediate future. Inquiries are being made outside the United States of America with a view to getting tractors of low power for small farms.",13
18,Mr BREEN,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture take steps to ensure that there will be better liaison between the State and Commonwealth controllers of agricultural machinery, particularly in regard to tractors? I have had experience of a lack of consistency in carrying out the government policy in this connection, as I have received conflicting reports from State and Oomm onwea'l th con troll er s.",13
19,Mr SCULLY,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"Recently , the control of agricultural .machinery was vested in the States, the Commonwealth doing little more than co-ordinate the controls. Agricultural machinery is allocated on an Australia-wide basis, in order to ensure the most equitable distribution of the machines available. The honourable member's question today is the first indication that I have had of any lack of proper liaison between the Commonwealth and State controllers. I have a fairly intimate knowledge of this subject because numbers of applications for agricultural machinery have pome before me, and my experience of the controller in-New South Wales has been most satisfactory. If the honourable member will supply particulars of any instances of conflicting reports, I shall have them investigated.",13
20,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"When further supplies of tractors are imported into Australia will the Minister for Com^ meree and Agriculture arrange for them to.be consigned direct to the State in which they are to be used and distribute them to farmers there, instead of holding them - up for three months as was done with a consignment of diesel tractors which was left in Melbourne while the Prices Commission, and the Departments of Supply and Shipping and Commerce and Agriculture had a - private departmental war over their disposal?",13
21,Mr SCULLY,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"I assure the honor-he is able member that there was no departmental dispute as to the destinasentative tion of the tractors to which he has ferred. The tractors were shipped to sideration. Melbourne and the Minister for Agriculture in South Australia made a personal approach to me with .the object of endeavouring to expedite deliveries to his State. Every effort was made to move the tractors to South Australia as quickly as possible, but delays were perienced because of transport difficulties. Generally speaking, South Australia has received equal treatment with the other States in the distribution of imported tractors. NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES . AUSTRALIAN REPRESENTATION.",13
22,Mr ANTHONY,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"I preface a quesorder tion to the Acting Minister for External Affairs, by drawing attention to a report in yesterday's press that Australia is without political or direct consular repreobject sentation in the Netherlands East Indies. The report states that the United Spates of America has in that country a consulmission general, two consuls, and a number of secretaries, and that Great Britain is' represented there by an accredited consulto general with ministerial rank, a vicein consul, and a big staff. It states many merchants at Batavia who are anxious to trade with Australia great difficulty in obtaining import licences from the Dutch Economic Affairs Department. As Australia has appointed diplomatic or trade representatives to many countries with which little trade can be expected, I now ask the Minister why Australia has not appointed a representative to the Netherlands East Indies? Will he say whether the Government's inaction in this matter is in line with its policy of not having anything to do with the Netherlands East Indies?",14
23,Mr MAKIN,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"An appointment of a representative to Malaya was made some following paper:time ago, and the person appointed was requested to undertake also such duties as may be required to represent Australia in the Netherlands East Indies. Until recently, Australia-had another representative in that country in the person Mr A. D. Brookes, who, owing to i l health, has had to return to Australia. yet been received. The question of appointing a direct repreof Australia in the Netherlands reEast Indies is now receiving con' TINN ED PLATE.",14
24,Mr HOLT,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"In view of the acute shortage of tinned plate in Australia and its serious effect on the production of foodstuffs for export and local consumpextion, can the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping say what action is being taken by the Government to provide adequate supplies of tinned plate in the near future?",14
25,Mr DEDMAN,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"It is true that there is a shortage of tinned plate in Australia and that it vitally affects the canning industry, but that shortage is noj; confined to Australia; it is world-wide. In to ensure that Australia would receive its full share of. the tinned plate that is available in the world a comnow mission was sent abroad with the special of obtaining increased supplies of this material. Because of the position overseas, however, I doubt that the comwill have been able to achieve very much. I assure the honourable member that everything possible is being done ensure that supplies, so vitally needed this country, are brought here as also that quickly as possible.",14
26,Mr HOLT,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,Is ' the United States of have America sending supplies?,14
27,Mr DEDMAN,JAPANESE AND AUSTRALIANS,"Some , but not nearly sufficient for our needs.",14

FOOD FORBRITAIN . AVAILABILITY OF SHIPPIN G.",14
30,Mr ABBOTT,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Has the Prime Minister seen the paragraph in last night's Melbourne Herald in which Mr Foggon, Oversea Traffic Manager in Sydney for MACDonald, Hamilton and Company, who recently completed a visit to Britain , is reported to have said that plenty of British ships were now available to carry Australian food to B r it a in and that he could not understand how Australia was limited by shortage of ships in sending food? In view of the importance of despatching food to B r it a in at the greatest possible speed, what comment has the Prime Minister to make on Mr Foggon's statement?",15
31,Mr CHIFLEY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"I have not seen the statement to which the honourable member has referred. ""While I was in Great sidering Britain I took the opportunity to meet top-ranking executives in the shipping world and discussed with them the of question of shipping generally, with parto ticular reference to the bringing of m igrants to this country. They pointed out that shipping was very short of rebeen quirements, that a great number of ships bad to be docked for refits of various kinds, and that many ships which had member's suggestion. been used for the carrying of troops during the war had to be re-converted to cargo carriers. There must be a definite shortage, because the British vernment first proposed to take a very large quantity of apples from this country, particularly Tasmania, finally had to cancel the order because shipping was not available. For that reason, it reduced its original order more than one-half. Whatever have appeared in the Melbourne Herald, I know of the difficulties with regard shipping as the result of my recent cussions with the representative of the various shipping interests of Great Britain. I shall look into the matter in order to see whether there is any substance in the statement. RATIONING. TEAAND SUGAB.",15
32,Mr HUTCHINSON,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"I Minister representingthe Minister for Trade and Customs whether it . is a fact that members of the Rationing Commission have made suggestions, if not recommendations, that tea and sugar should be removed from the list of rationed goods ? Whether or not thisbe correct, can the Minister give any information with regard to present supplies of tea and sugar?",15
33,Mr FORDE,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"I am not aware that, members of the commission have made a suggestion of that kind. I shall bring the matter to the notice of the Minister, and furnish a reply to the honourable member as soon as possible. THE PARLIAMENT. BROADCASTING OF PBOCEEDINGS. Mr CONELAN : - - I - ask you, Mr . Speaker, whether, when you are conthe disposal of test recordings of the broadcasting of proceedings in this chamber, you will consider placing some these records in the Library ? In time come they will be of historical value. Mr SPEAKER , - I am not sure at the moment whether such records as have made are the property of the Parliament. I shall have the matter investigated, bearing in mind the honourable CAPITAL ISSUES.",15
34,Mr ANTHONY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"I understand that Go the present regulations with respect to capital issues provide that companies may be formed with a nominal capital up but to £10,000 without approval of the Treasurer. In view of the necessity to expand industry as rapidly as possible in order by to provide full employment,, I ask the may Prime Minister what is the reason for maintaining any control at all over the to formation of companies which would dishelp to achieve that objective ?",15
35,Mr CHIFLEY,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"It is true that it is not necessary to obtain approval for the formation of companies with a nominal capital up to £10,000. W it h regard to capital issues control generally, I have always held the view, which is shared by many people not associated with politics, that such control is needed in peace as ask the well as war. H a d such control been exercised in the past, the circumstances in which many companies were formed in this country by people of dubious reputation, and in which great numbers of the public lost money, would have been avoided. However, I shall examine the matter with respect to the limitation of capital up to £10,000. I have been discussing with the States whether capital issues control should be continued after the present controls cease. Some of the States believe as I do that this control should be continued. I shall examine the matter and furnish a detailed reply to the honourable member. CIVIL AVIATION.",15
36,Mr ADERMANN,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"In view of the future importance of air travel, I ask the Acting Minister for Civil Aviation to state the attitude of the Government regarding country aerodromes? Does the Government intend to retain all the aerodromes it now owns and maintains for its own use? Will any financial assistance be given to local government authorities to construct and maintain aerodromes in order to enable satisfactory services to be established in country areas ?",16
37,Mr MAKIN,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"That would depend on the localities requiring the service,on whether the service would be justified. If the honourable gentleman tells me the exact places that he has in mind the matter will be examined by the Department of Civil Aviation, which.will supply an answer. NA BROADCASTING BILL 1946. Bill received from the Senate and (on motion by Mr OAI-WELJ.) read a first time. SECOND READING.",16
38,Mr CALWELL,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Melbourne^-Minister , for Immigration and Minister for Information) [11.1] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The world is witnessing a great struggle for the preservation of democratic ideals and, in this connection, it will, I think, be agreed that one-of the greatest dangers to the form of government favoured by our people is the lack of interest they play in the functioning of their democratic institutions. For this reason, the Government welcomes the opportunity of asking the Parliament to consider this bill to authorize the broadcasting of parliamentary debates. The enactment of this measure would, in my opinion, go far towards strengthening the association between the Parliament and the people, which, even though it may be in fact solid and intimate, nevertheless frequently seems to be of an intangible character. Although the step it is proposed to take is novel in the history of the Commonwealth, we are fortunate in being able to draw on the experience of our sister dominion, New Zealand, where since 1936, it has been the practice to broadcast the proceedings of the National Parliament. According to reliable evidence, the debates have become a popular feature of the broadcasting programmes of that country, where it has been found that the broadcasts have stimulated interest in parliamentary affairs, and have enabled the people to be better informed on both sides of public questions, thus ensuring the more effective operation of the democratic system of government. For some years, there have been occaor sional suggestions that the proceedings of the Commonwealth Parliament should be broadcast, and in more recent times the proposal has been supported by persons and organizations representing all shades of political thought. The Government, therefore, thought that it was advisable that the Parliamentary Standing Com-' mittee on Broadcasting should examine the matter and report to the Parliament whether it considered the broadcasting of debates was desirable and, if so, to what extent and in what manner the broadcasts should be undertaken. The Broadcasting Committee comprehensively investigated the subject and subsequently presented to Parliament a most interesting and valuable report covering all phases of the proposal. The committee consulted the leaders of the various parties in Parliament and others w>ell qualified to advise it on the numerous aspects of the matter. After weighing the evidence which had been submitted to it, the Broadcasting Committee came to disthe conclusion that the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Commonwealth Parliament' would be a desirable innovation and that arrangements for its introduction should be made as soon as circumstances permitted. In the course of its report the Broadcasting Committee expressed its agreement with the views of those who believe that the effect of these broadcasts would be to raise the standard of debates, enhance theprestige of Parliament, and contribute to a better informed judgment on matters affecting the common good and the public interest. The committee drew attention to the fact that there is an increasing demand for copies of the printed debates, and, partly because of this evidence of widening interest in Commonwealth politics, it considers that the listening public would appreciate the opportunity of hearing members of both Houses expounding their views on measures presented t'o Parliament. The Government has considered carefully the report of the committee and having accepted, in principle, the proposal that the proceedings of Parliament should be broadcast, it - has decided that arrangements should be made for the broadcaststo commence during the present session. In the process of its investigations, the committee considered several alternative methods whereby the broadcasts could be undertaken and, in this regard, it formed the opinion that the best arrangement would be to utilize the main national broadcasting stations in each State capital city, and all the national regional stations in country districts.' This would, however, involve the use of the main national network, embracing 22. out of a total of 29 national medium-wave broadcasting stations in the Commonwealth, and, in consequence, would necessitate the substitution of parliamentary broadcasts for entertainments, commentaries on current affairs, and other items-which are normally broadcast through the network. In this connection, it is, moreover, important to bear in mind that certain stations of the main national network provide the only reliable service available to listeners in some country districts. There is muoh to be said in favour of the Broadcasting Committee's view that the broadcasts should be made available to listeners on the widest practicable scale, but the Government believes that it would be preferable to commence the contemplated service on an experimental basis, the broadcasts being confined at the outset to the second national station in the capital city of each State and in the city of Newcastle. This was one of the alternative proposals considered by the Broadcasting Committee. Whilst the adoption of this plan will not, of course, secure the same extensive audience for the broadcasts as would be the case if the main network were used for the purpose, it will nevertheless enable a great majority of the people to listen to the debates. The primary service-area of the seven stations concerned covers, not less than 60 per cent, of the total population of Australia and during night hours, whioh, incidentally, are the chief listening periods, this percentage will be very substantially increased by means of the secondary service which then exists. It is difficult to estimate the number of additional listeners to whom the service would be available at night time, but it can be said that a considerable proportion of those country listeners who may be anxious to hear the debates will be able to do so. It is realized, of course, that the public reaction to the broadcasts may be very favourable and that there may be a demand for the use of additional medium-wave stations, even though this may result in listeners having to forgo the reception of other items on days when Parliament is sitting. Accordingly, provision has been made in the bill for the use of such additional stations as may be prescribed from time to time. In this connection, due consideration would be given to the possibility of using short-wave stations to supplement the service to listeners in remote areas, as was recommended by the Broadcasting Committee. Honourable members doubtless will agree that the broadcasts of debates should be carefully controlled, especially in the initial experimental stages. In this regard, the Broadcasting Committee recommended that provision should be made in the proposed legislation for the overall control of the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings to be vested in the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, insofar as their respective chambers were concerned. It further suggested that the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Postmaster-General's Department, and the parliamentary authorities should be consulted regarding the selection of mutually acceptable periods for broadcasts from both Houses. The Government considers, however, that a joint committee should be established so that , Parliament itself could, in this manner, exercise control over a matter which so intimately affects the rights of members. It will be appreciated that there are a number of details to be settled in connection with the allocation'of time for broadcasts from both Houses of Parliament when they are sitting simultaneously, and in regard to technical and programme arrangements, and other points mentioned by the Broadcasting Committee. . The bill accordingly provides for the appointment of a committee of six members, including the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Government proposes that the suggested Joint Committee should investigate all the matters to which I have referred, and make a recommendation to the Parliament concerning the general principles upon which the broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings should be inaugurated. After the committee's report has been adopted by both Houses, the Joint Committee will exercise control over the broadcasts in accordance, with the principles ratified by Parliament. In all probability, situations will arise when it will be necessary for prompt decisions to be given in regard to actual broadcasts from the Parliament, and, therefore, it seems desirable that the Joint Committee should have authority to delegate to a sub-committee its power to determine the days on which, and the periods during which, the proceedings of either House shall be broadcast. Because of the possibility that only one House may be sitting, the bill provides that two members of the sub-committee shall be sufficient to form a quorum. The Government accepts the view of the Broadcasting Committee that the immunities and, privileges applying to debates within the Parliament shall apply to the broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings. The bill embraces, the views of Mr Calwell. the Government in regard to'this matter, and I shall be glad to supply any further information which honourable members may desire concerning the proposals. In anticipation of the measure being acceptable to the Parliament, arrangements have been made, with the concurrence of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, for the erection of a control booth in both, Houses of Parliament and for the installation of such equipment as is necessary to enable the broadcasts to be undertaken. Therefore, it should be practicable, in the, event of the early passage of the bill, to commence the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings during the present session, the actual date being determined by the Joint Committee, which will, of course, be selected as soon as the measure becomes law. Debate (on motion by Mr MENZIES) adjourned. SUPPLY BILL (No. 1) 1946-47. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from .the 20th June (vide page 1702), . on motion by Mr. CHIFLEYThat the bill be now read a second time.",16
39,Mr GULLETT,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Henty) [11.13] - This is the first time that I have risen to speak in this House, and I should like to preface my remarks with an expression of appreciation of all the courtesies which I have received both from the Chair and from all honourable members. I realise that that courtesy was extended to me largely because of the warm regard in which my father was held by many honourable members. Of course, one expects a measure of welcome from one's own political colleagues, but I speak now of the friendly reception which I have had from honourable members opposite, and I hope that, as time passes, I shall show my appreciation of it.in the usual way. The remarks of previous speakers about the attitude of waterside workers to the Dutch Indonesian dispute, and particularly the observations of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) concerning the Dutch ship Bontikoe, reminded me that I may have a more personal and up-to-date knowledge of the participants in this dispute than has any other honourable member. The circumstances of the Bontikoe are these: It is a Dutch vessel, and at the moment is in an Australian port where the waterside workers refuse to load it. They refused to load it either as a Dutch - ship sailing to Netherlands East Indies ports, or as a Dutch ship sailing to Singapore with goods for the British forces in Singapore, even though the Dutch owners had volunteered to remove the crew and replace it with an Australian crew. I remember this ship, because, in October, 1943, I was one of the troops which the Bontikoe carried to New Guinea. The vessel had already taken to New Guinea the troops who fought the successful and vital action at Milne Bay. At the time of which I speak it was carrying troops who went subsequently to Wau, defeated the Japanese there, and then went on to Salamaua, and there destroyed them. In taking us to New Guinea, the Bontikoe had to pass through what were then fairly dangerous waters. I came to know the Dutch crew, and they were all that one could expect of loyal and decent allies. Nearly all of them, at one time or another, had been on ships which had been sunk during the war, and they had fought throughout the war at the side of Great Britain and Australia. Of 130 ships with which the company which owned the Bontikoe entered the war only 40 were still afloat when the war ended, the remainder having been sunk by enemy action. There was also on this ship a Captain Alistair MCKenzie, one of the first men to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force, who had served in the Western Desert, in Greece, and in Syria, where he was wounded. He went to New Guinea, where he served his country to the best of a not inconsiderable ability. Two months ago, while going about his perfectly peaceful occasions in Java, he was shot down and cut to pieces by the Indonesian rebels. That g'ives the picture of the Dutch on the one hand and the Indonesians on the other hand. As I have said, my information about the parties to this dispute is, to some degree, up to date. At Christmas, 1944, I had the privilege of serving with the British forces in Holland. The European winterof 1944-45 was extremely bitter and [21 JTJHE, 1946.] {No. 1) 1946-47. 1719 reminiscent in many respects of the 1917 European winter, which many honourable members will recall. I say to the House and to the people of Australia that had it not been for the loyalty, courage and helpfulness of our Dutch allies in Holland, the British and Allied forces could not have remained in the line. During that winter, which was so severe that men froze to death at night in their^pits, the Dutch did everything possible to'help us. They took us into their houses and fed us and kept us warm to the best of their ability. When we could not evacuate our wounded through the snow they took them in and eared for them. They also went out on patrols with us as guides, risking, and sometimes losing, their lives. In every respect they were lcyal and worthy allies. I am new to this chamber and not conversant with many of the functions of government, but in the names of all those who know something about the loyalty, courage, steadfastness and suffering of the Dutch on the one hand, and the murdering rabble of Indonesians on the other hand, I want to know why this dispute was allowed to arise. I do not believe for a moment that the great majority of even the waterside workers involved in the dispute favour the stand taken by their union leaders in the matter. I mentioned earlier that I belonged during the war to the 17th Brigade. Last month a number of men from that brigade, who are now employed on the waterfront, - came to see me in Melbourne to make two complaints. Thie first was against the boycotting of Dutch ships. They remembered Dutchmen only as decent and loyal allies. Their second complaint was in regard to the strike then in progress as a protest against the handling of double-dumped wool bales. In that connection,. I .shall merely say that, if ever there was a time when reasonable measures for the conservation of shipping space should be taken, it is now, .when Britain is in such urgent need of it. This strike resulted in hundreds of thousands of tons of shipping space being lost, when it could have been used to send food to Britain. For 40 years at least, double-dumped wool bales bave been handled in this country, and never previously has the objection been seriously advanced that the handling of such bales was beyond the capacity of those allotted to that work, and certainly not the number available to handle them. It is well known that thousands of waterside workers are anxious to get on with the job and earn their wages. It is equally well known that the largest proportion of these men were not consulted about the imposition of the boycott on Dutch shipping, and the calling of the strike. The Government has only to place itself behind the decent men in order to bring to an end this state of affairs, and once and for all dissipate the exaggerated fear and respect that' are held for the Communist leaders - who are now in control of some of the unions. I wish to deal as broadly as possible with a few aspects of the treatment of - ex-service personnel and their dependants, because it appears to me that that matter can well be considered in conjunction with the treatment of our Dutch allies. The principal headings under which the subject may be considered are-soldier land settlement, war service homes, and preference in employment, in obtaining business premises and quotas that will enable them to establish small businesses, in having telephones installed, and in the purchase of vehicles from the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. In not one of those matters can the Government point to satisfactory results. The best that it can do is to say that such and such is projected, that so many farms'have been cleared, and that so many houses are in course of construction and merely need a rcof, or something of the sort. It cannot cite definite figures, and in no sense can it show results that are' comparable with those that have been achieved by the Government of New Zealand which has to deal with a vastly smaller population. I cite in particular soldier land settlement and preference in employment. In both of those matters the Government has a. fundamentally wrong conception of the principles involved. Ey its disapproval of single unit farms, and its insistence on group leaseholds instead of freeholds, it has clearly shown-and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) admitted as much in this House last ""Wednesday-that it regards soldier land settlement not primarily as an end in itself but merely as a means of estabWr. Gullett. lishing closer settlement, particularly in large groups which it controls. I emphasize that soldier land settlement, is not - identical with closer settlement. We engage in soldier land settlement because the people of this country believe, and the members of this House profess to believe, that those who have fought for this land have the right to farm it and that the interests of Australia will best be served by putting them on that land. Closer settlement is admirable in itself, and no one quarrels with it, but it is not associated with soldier land settlement. If the Government waits for large-scale schemes to mature, it will wait for ever. Men can be settled quickly only by the purchase of single-unit farms. Within 20 miles of this House there are twenty single-unit farms for sale, and the Government could purchase the majority of them at a reasonable figure. I speak with some knowledge of the matter. At least one-half of those farms would be suitable for. soldier land settlement. That applies also to other rural districts in this country. We do not need to worry about building houses and erecting fences. We have the single-unit farms and the men who want them. All that is needed is that the Government shall acquire' them and - place men on themI believe that the attitude of the Government in regard to preference in employment to ex-servicemen is fundamentally wrong. I take it that the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr. Dedman) outlined that attitude in his preface to the pamphlet issued by the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, entitled Soldier Preference. In that preface, the honourable gentleman did not once mention the words "" preference, to ex-service personnel"". It was an admirable preface, which dealt in the main with full employment. Full employment is commendable, and has the support of every member of this House, but it is not the point that has to be considered when dealing with preference - to ex-servicemen. Those men were promised' preference when they went away, and the promise was repeated many times during, the course of the war. They cannot hope to compete successfully with others on the labour market unless they receive a substantial measure of preference. That applies particularly to the younger men. The case before the court in connection with the dismissal of an ex-serviceman from a munitions establishment will largely determine what is to be the future of preference in this country. We do not know what will be the decision in that case; But we do know what is the attitude of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, because he has said, "" We certainly admit liability to give preference to ex-servicemen wben they are applying for jobs, but there is nothing to show that they shall have preference when dismissals are being considered "". That is utterly farcical, and far from being consistent with the statements repeatedly made to servicemen while the war was in progress and their services were highly valued. The treatment of these men now is in many respects similar to the treatment of our Dutch allies. When the conditions were difficult and considerable danger was apprehended, the Government said to the serviceman, as it did to the Dutch, "" Be the first in, and we will give you the front seat right away"". The danger having passed, it says to the Dutch as well as to the servicemen, Thank you very much. You were the first in; now you can be the first put"".",18
40,Mr CHAMBERS,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Adelaide) [11.30]. - I congratulate the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) upon his maiden speech, because I know - the difficulties which a new member experiences when he first addresses the House. I propose to reply to some of the statements made by members of the Opposition. When the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison) was speaking last night, he referred to the lack of goods available to this community at present, as compared with the quantity that could be procured during the greater part of the war period. He complained of strikes and lack, of production; but I do not believe that there is any lack of production in Australia today. The hundreds of thousands of servicemen who have returned to peacetime occupations are producing goods, in full supply, but the goods are not being distributed to the members of the community who require them. The honourable gentleman spoke of strikes, and continually abused the working classes for their occurrence. And yet we are told that manufacturers refuse to put into production the goods that are required by the community because taxes are too high."" A manufacturer named Harley has publicly stated that it is* not profitable to produce the goods that are required by the cominunity, because his taxes are too high. Is there any difference between a strike by workers and a strike by manufacturers who are not prepared to distribute goods to the community because their taxes are too high? I remind manufacturers that if it were not for those who fought in the war they would not have factories in Australia today. Whatever the taxes may be at present, the manufacturers should at least know that the efforts of the workers made it possible for them to retain their factories and pay even the taxes which they are now called upon to contribute. They should be pleased to pay them. They should realise that that is their contribution during the war and in the peace period towards the rehabilitation of those who made sacrifices in the war that the manufacturers might live. It ill becomes the Opposition to criticize the workers continually because they go on strike, when, it fails to criticize those who control industry in Australia and also go on strike because of high taxes. The Opposition condemns the coal-miners, the waterside workers, and all other workers in industry in Australia. Only a few weeks ago, when it seemed that there might be another coal upheaval-in this country, the leading daily newspapers of Australia plastered their front pages with accounts of the difficulties that would confront the community if the savage coal-miners again held Australia to ransom. The coal-miners did not go on strike, but continued to - produce coal To-day they are producing millions of tons more than was obtained in the pre-war period, but I do not see the front pages of the Australian press plastered with tributes' to the coal-.miners because they did not hold Australia to ransom. If the Opposition gave to the Australian worker a kindly word now and again, he would have an improved outlook. Since I have been a member of this Parliament the Opposition has consistently criticized the workers. I ask it to change its tactics. It should remember that the workers include hundreds of thousands of ex-servicemen, and when it condemns the Australian workers it condemns large numbers of ex-servicemen who have made greater sacrifices than have members of the Opposition. The latter should pay tribute to those, who during the war period, produced all of the things required for both the servicemen and the civilian population.",21
41,Mr TURNBULL,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Is the honourable member satisfied with the coal supply?,22
42,Mr CHAMBERS,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I am uot satisfied with the methods adopted by the owners of the coal mines. Mechanized means of coal production should be employed for the purpose of obtaining increased supplies and also providing improved conditions of work for those who have to hew the coal. I regret that the Government has not seen fit to nationalize the coal mines of Australia. I hope that if it is returned to power at the next general elections, it will lose no time in making that desirable change. That would lead to improvement of the methods of production and of the working conditions of the coal-miners. I trust that an opportunity will be given to every honourable member to see the motion picture taken recently showing conditions in the coal-mining industry in the Newcastle district. It will be seen that the same conditions as those which operated in the mines 30 or 40 years ago obtain there profit. today. It is shameful that, while the Opposirecently, tion condemns the miners, no constructive effort is made by it to improve their conditions of employment. Honourable members should realise that something must be done to improve conditions in the coal mines so that the efficiency of industry may be increased. I believe there are manufacturers in Australia who are deliberately withholding supplies as to irritate the public, in the hope popular feeling will turn against Government at the next federal elections. I am convinced that after September October next, all the goods which the people need will be on the market. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr. White) mentioned the steel house which had recently been erected in Melbourne, but he did not say that the house had been constructed for test purposes only. If it proves successful the Government proposes to construct the parts of such houses by mass production. Recently, the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) tried to damage the Government by saying that it was doing nothing to relieve the housing shortage, but it is evident from the facts that what he said was incorrect. I remind honourable members opposite that there are slums in all the capital cities of Australia, and that they have been there for many years. They were there when the present Opposition was in power, but nothing wa3 done then to get rid of them. The fact is that the slums should have been abolished long ago. Let it be remembered that, for the last six years, all the available men and materials have been used for the defenceof the country. Now, the Government is using all available resources to relieve the housing shortage. I am confident that this Government will be returned to power by the people at the next election, and that it will continue to prosecute vigorously its housing policy. The Government proposes to ask the people for increased power so that it may embark upon housing schemes of its own. I hope that, before very long, the slums which previous governments tolerated in our cities will be abolished.",22
43,Mr FAT,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,STEIN - The slums were created as the result of jerry-building for,22
44,Mr CHAMBERS,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"That is so. Only in my own electorate, I visited a two-roomed house in which five people had to sleep in one room. That house should have been condemned twenty years ago. It ill becomes those who permitted conditions like that to develop to the attack the present Government - I am that confident that the Government will be returned to power, and that later we shall so be able to look back with pride upon what that we have accomplished for the benefit of this the people of Australia.",22
45,Mr ABBOTT,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"New England) [11.45]. or - I wish to refer to the extraordinary reply given by the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) to a question asked by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Ryan) about the hold up of Dutch ships in Australian ports, and particularly the refusal of trade unionists to repair the Dutch warship Piet Hein. It is amazing that the P rime Minister, from his place in this House, should make an attack on the' diplomatic representatives of a foreign power in Australia. If he cannot work with a foreign representative, and wishes to get rid of him, there is a way of doing it without imperilling further the relations between the Netherlands Government and the Government of Australia. Perhaps the incident would not have occurred* if the Minister for External Affairs (Dr Evatt) had been at home attending to matters here instead of busying himself trying to settle the problem of Spain. It would have been better if he had concerned himself with Australia's relations with our near northern neighbours. Who believes for a moment that Spain imperils the peace of the world? However, there is a grave danger that the relations of Atistralia with the Netherlands may be imperilled by the present attitude of the Australian Government. People overseas must be mystified to know what is the policy of the - Australian Government. recently, Mr Keith Officer, Australia's representative in the Netherlands, issued a press statement in which he said that the hold-up of Dutch ships in Australia was due to the action of an irresponsible minority. Well, if they constitute only an irresponsible minority they are very powerful, because they are able to'bend the Government to their will. When the Dutch ships were first held up the excuse given by the Prime Minister for taking no action was that if he forced the issue there would be a strike of waterside workers in Australia, and supplies of food would not go forward to Great Britain. What a hypocritical excuse that was! During recent weeks, when there has been a complete hold-up of the meat export trade from Queensland because of the strike of meat workers, the Prime Minister has made no attempt to intervene or to settle the dispute. He has sheltered himself behind the excuse that it is a State matter. When the Piet Hein visited Fremantle, all the unionists were prepared to work on the ship except the carpenters. Then the ship went on to Melbourne, and the Minister for the Navy (Mr Makin) said that the dockyard of Duke and Orr Limited was too busy on civilian work to undertake the repair of the warship. The proprietors of'the dockyard immediately gave the lie direct to the Minister, who was then forced to admit that what he had said was incorrect, and that the firm could do the work if the unionists.would permit it. I hope that the Prime Minister will realise that he does his country very poor service by publicly attacking in this House the representative of the Netherlands Government.",22
46,Mr LAZZAKINI,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,The Prime Minister did not attack him.,23
47,Mr ABBOTT,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"He did. If ever there has been ""shilly-shallying"" by a government it has been in the attitude of this Government to the Bretton Woods Agreement, which was accepted by the United Kingdom Government some time ago. Recently, in answer to a question by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) the Prime Minister said that if the proposed loan to Great Britain by the United States of Only America was not authorized, Australia would be faced with an acute shortage of dollars. One of the essential features of the proposed loan to Great Britain is that that country must subscribe to the Bretton Woods Agreement. Under clause .11 of the agreement, a country which subscribes to it is forbidden to trade with, or have economic relations with, any other country that is not a signatory to the - agreement, if - such country is not carrying out the terms of the agreement. The Commonwealth Government is afraid to affirm either its acceptance or rejection of the agreement before the forthcoming general elections. It knows w ell that eventually 7 Australia must sign the agreement unless it is prepared to shatter its export, trade by failing to share in the dollar pool which the authorizing of the loan to Britain by the United States of America would create. From day to day we hear of an acute shortage of tractors, which are imported mainly from the United States of America, and of other materials and commodities, including tinned plate, which are necessary for the development of Australian primary and secondary industries, but because the Minister for Transport (Mr Ward) has «3 vigorously attacked the Bretton ""Woods Agreement,- the Government is prepared to imperil Australia's economic future, it will do nothing which it thinks will lower its prospects of winning the elec-' tions. The policy of the Government contains only one plank, namely, that, whatever happens, nothing must be-done which will imperil the solidarity of the Labour movement. Regardless of whether the maintenance of that solidarity causes distress in the Commonwealth or endangers Australia's future trade relations with. other countries, the Government, remembering that the Scullin Government failed because of the defection from its ranks of supporters of the Lang group, has at the instance of right honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) laid down that, at all costs, division within the Labour party must be avoided. Declarations that the Labour pai'ty will have no relations with Communists are merely examples of the hypocrisy of the Government and the - Labour party generally. The Govern; mej.it is prepared to attack vigorously such - bodies of young people as the. Eureka Youth Movement, yet it does nothing to curb the activities of unions whose. leading officials are avowed' munists and members of the Communist party of Australia. I refer particularly to Messrs. Healy, Elliott, Wells and Roach. The Government is insincere in its protestations, and has no desire to get rid of these Communists. It hopes to work with them, .and at the same time to bluff the people of Australia into believing that an attempt is being made to get rid of Communists. Probably the fact that the Eureka Youth Movement consists of persons who, as yet, have no votes is the explanation of the attack on that movement, whilst the "" t all poppies"" Communist movement go free. 1 was interested in a speech made yesterday by the honourable member for Frementle- (Mr Beazley) referring to ployment in Australia. He said that, although 435,000 men from the fighting forces and another 137.000whohad been engaged on war work in Australia had been demobilized since the end of the only 10)000 persons were registered as Mr Miholl. unemployed in the Commonwealth; I shall not attempt to test theaccuracy of the honourable member's-figures;,but' shall accept them, for the purpose of argumentThe honourable member went. on to say that at the pi'esent time, there is pra'cti- 1 cally full employment throughout Aus^ tralia. If that be so, Australian manpower is stretched to the limit to cope with the problems, which face this country'in regard to both its internal^ develop^ ment and the maintenance of its export trade.. The honourable member for' Adelaide (Mr Chambers) had a good deal to say abou't the Government's housing' achievements and its programme for the the future. In this connection, I refer to an interesting article which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 2nd August,. 1945, in which attention was drawn to the shortage of houses in the Commonwealth. .The article stated that iii December, 1943j the Commonwealth Housing Commission had estimated that 273,000 houses were required, and that 40,000 houses were neededannually to replace dilapidated dwellings and provide for the normal increase of the population. The greatest number of houses ever buil't Com- in Australia, in any peace year was 40,000. The official programme for the year ended the 30th Jiune, 1945, was 24,000 houses, and for the first post-war year, 50,000. According to Facts and' Figures the target for the current financial year is now 15,000 houses. It is easy to'reach an objective if it be brought into conformity with achievement.",23
48,Mr LAZZAHINI,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,The Sydney MorningHerald lied:,24
49,Mr ABBOTT,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Surely the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr LaZzarini) does hot say that the Commonwealth in the Housing Commission lied? The target for 1945-46 was originally 24,000' houseSj of'which 12,000 were to have been built by the Government and 1'2,000 by private enterprise.

Eight throughout fbe 'building and allied trades,' and in industry generally, there is a shortage of l.'iaterials of all 'kinds which has been - brought about largely by industrial disturbances. Production of food in Australia is hampered because there are insufficient supplies of .agricultural implements and spare pants, barbed wire, wire-netting, cartridges for the eradication of pests, and the host of other things which primary producers require to enable them to work their 'properties. In a most interesting article, published .in tfhe Sydney Morning Herald of the l'Sth June, the writer ipr-inted out, - that the president of the Farmers and Settlers Association of New .South Wales, Mr Roberton, who had made a tour of the major .agricultural .aiiieas tof that'State, indicated that everywhere he went he found shortages of skilled labour jand mechanical .equipment - required for agricultural (production.

In a iletter dated the '6th June, 1946, the .secretary of the Merchant Tailors Association of New South Wales stated'We wish to express our appreciation of the assistance - given by you .to our president and viqe-prcsident, Messrs. Jul. Craig and A. Clcary, as a deputation to the Honourable J. J. Dedman and the Honourable Senator 'W. 1'. Ashley in March last, relating to the shortage of materials. ' 'This deputation was arranged by the honourable member for Reid (Mr . Morgan). The representatives of the merchant tailors stressed the desperate position of ex-servicemen and the general public because of their inability to obtain suiting material. The letter continued The position since thnt time has become progressively worse, and now the shortage of materials is more acute than ever. Some time ago I obtained some interesting figures from woollen textile manufacturers - showing the tremendous shortages of raw materials that existed . in that - industry. The British White Paper on Food Supplies, which was issued in A p r i l, 1946, shows acute world shortages of cereals, - meat and fats; yet many farmers in the Commonwealth are unable to produce milk for the production of butter and fats because they are unable to obtain sufficient agricultural implements and fencing wire, or building materials for the construction of houses and outbuildings on properties that have been subdivided. On the Trevallyn estate in my electorate, which had been used for cattle fattening up to the beginning of this year, the. farmers cannot get wire to fence in their properties or building materials to enable them to erect houses, yet that land is capable of producing milk and fats in large volume. British White Paper on Food Supplies statesWorld exports of fats for 1946 represent only 50 per cent, of the pre-war figure. World supplies of meat may be expected to continue short of world requirements for some time. Yet the Governmient is doing nothing whatever to attempt to overcome shortages in this country by settling industrial disputes which are causing such havoc to Australian economy and production today. The same position exists in respect of railway transport today in New South Wales, and I assume in other where drought conditions exist. impossible to move store stock ' from drought-stricken areas because of the shortage of railway transport. the whole of the inwards traffic to country districts in New South Wales was disrupted because of coal shortages and the lack of sufficient rolling-stock. short of steel because of coal shortages; we are short of the products of steel because of man-power shortages; yet at this very time the Minister for Transport brings down proposals to standardize the Australian railway gauges. All of this bears out what I said earlier, that any energetic person with a few followers behind him in the Government ranks, whether they be Communists men of the type of the Minister Transport, who is able to bring pressure on Ministers, finds the Government too willing to bend to that pressure if it believes that failure to do so might reduce its chances of success in the coming elections. The honourable member for Fremantle has said that we are reaching a state of full employment Mr Abbott. in Australia today. Yet this country is desperately short of most of the things needed for the comfort of its people and the preservation of its economy. Let us consider the position of the coal industry. The figures published in this morning's press show that the number of men employed in the coal mining industry in New South Wales in 1945 was 17,427, or more than 1,000 greater than the number employed in 1939, and that the production of coal in that State amounted to 10,237,000 tons. In his report on the coal-mining industry, The Mr Justice Davidson estimated the capacity for coal mines in New South Wales working on a single' shift 1 basis at 12,750,000 tons. He also said that that figure could be lifted a good deal if there were more discipline in the industry and better output from the miners. I was astonished at the reply given by the Prime Minister yesterday with regard to the development of open-cut mines in New South Wales. The right honourable gentleman said that open-cut mining is capable of only limited production, and that there is a shortage of mechanical equipment for work of that type. He States stated that ray suggestion that double It is shifts be worked on all open-cut mines in New South Wales had never been thought of. It is very Recently curious that Mr Justice Davidson saw the position - in an entirely different light. He said that consideration must be given to the quantum of We are open-cut mining in New South Wales because it might interfere with the ordinary shaft and tunnel mining being carried on in that State; it might interfere with the miners employed in that class of work, because open-cut mining is done by men who are not miners. Mr Justice namely, Davidson does not think there is a shortage of seams that could be worked. Any one who knows the coal-bearing country, or particularly the Hunter and Gloucester for areas, has seen seams that appear capable of development. They may not be like only the Greta seam, or the bestseams, but it is better to develop them than not to work any fresh seams at all. The Prime Minister claimed that there was a shortage of machinery to enable this to be done. Some time ago I inspected the open-cut operations at Muswellbrook. There, the overburden was being shifted by three 80-horse-power Holt caterpillar tractors, which were pulling the Le Tournepull earth movers of a capacity of 5 tons. After filling, these earth movers operated under their own power. A steam shovel which had. been brought from the Kiama quarry was used in lifting the coal; and about twenty men were employed in transporting the coal to the railway siding by lorry. I was informed that there were about 34 men employed on. the whole undertaking, which at that time bad an output of 1,000 tons a day. Further, there is nothing to prevent tbose operations from being flood-lit with electricity as has been done in the Tingha tin-field area where the dredges work double shifts. The present capacity of the works at Muswellbrook is about 1,600 tons a day, which could be doubled if the operations were flood-lit. In view of the present acute shortage of coal it is extraordinary that the Government has decided to proceed with work on the standardization of railway gauges. Excluding conversions which will be necessary in respect of the Queensland and Western Australian railway systems, recommendations Nos. 3 and 4 made by Sir Harold Clapp in his report are to be proceeded with at an estimated expenditure of £35,976,000. These items are the conversion to standard guage of the entire South Australian 5-ft. 3-in. guage and the 3-ft. 6-in. guage line of the South-East Division, which it is estimated will take six and one-quarter years, and the conversion to standard guage of the .entire Victorian 5-ft. 3-in. guage system which will take seven years. Late in his reports, Sir Harold saysSpeaking generally, the plan of standardization falls within two periods, firstly the initial or preparatory period (estimated, at four years in the case of Victoria) during which all preparatory works are undertaken, including the construction of new lines, workshops, locomotive and other depots, goods and live stock transfer yards, new rolling stock and locomotives, conversion of portion of the existing rolling stock, assembling of materials and equipment, strengthening lines, and preparing tracks and structures for actual conversion; Air that work, which is to be proceeded with during the first four years,-will require additional carpenters, tradesmen and labourers, and. place extrastrain on . our timber resources at a time when thousands of our citizens are denied the right of getting into a home because of the shortage of building materials. The standardization of railway gauges will also require more coal.. for the smelting of iron ore and the production of steel as well as bricks for the construction of - railway stations. These demands will place an enormous additional strain upon the man-power resources of the country. All this is to be done at a time when the world is calling cut for food supplies from Australia. The White Paper issued by 'the British Government has stressed the gravity of the world food shortage. It emphasizes the seriousness of the problem in India whose population is increasing at the rate of 5,000,000 a year. That means that 40,000,000 have been added to India's population since 1938. All these problems involve increased demands. for food from the. Commonwealth which experiences from time to time very serious droughts, and must, therefore, undertake urgent extensive irrigation projects in addition to the construction of houses and the provision of other essentials for our people. All of these requirements are to be made subservient to the Government's project for the standardization of railway gauges which could very well be spread over a period of 60 years. No hardship would be caused if that plan were delayed, and for a few years longer travellers must continue to change trains at Albury. That hardship is incomparable with the hardship which they will be obliged to suffer through shortage of houses. Yet, the Government has decided to proceed with this plan in order to appease the vanity of the Minister for Transport and enable him to build up his ministry and his political stature, even should this mean denying homes.to thousands of our people and essential irrigation schemes to our primary producers.",24
51,Mr DALY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Martin) [12.16] - I congratulate the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) upon his maiden speech. The honourable member will be an acquisition to.the debating strength of this chamber. I wish to refer briefly to some of the criticisms levelled against the Government with regard to its attitude towards ex-service men and women. ""We all agree that in order to give the ex-service, man and woman a. fair deal and ensure that they shall obtain the rewards to which they are entitled there must be a ccmmon approach by all parties to this problem in ,a spirit of co-operation and, in a desire to give service personnel in every sphere the very best assistance we can give to them. However, we find in the communtity many ""knockers'"" who do not desire to give .any consideration to the ex-service men and women, but prefer to play at party politics in order to iavjure the Government. The record of the Australian Labour party, and particularly this Government, in its provision for - ex-service personnel is second to none. That claim is supported by the expresident of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, Sir Gilbert Dyett, who paid a great tribute .to this Government for what it has already done for the ex-serviceman. He is - reported to 'have said that so far as the ex-serviceman was'concerned, this - Government bad proved itself to be the - most sympathetic yet to hold office in this Parliament. On the other hand, the Liberal party and the Australian Coiimfery .party criticize every .action of the - Government in carrying - out its rehabilitation 'and re-establishment (programme. They complain about the preference given to ex-service ^personnel, but igoveraiments of the political ilk of honourable members opposite did not enforce preference until twenty years after the conclusion - of the war of 1914-18, and there only applied it to - Government employment. Those governments simply gave ex-service ^personnel preference to stand at the head of dole - queues. ' The ex-serviceman - of this war owes no thanks to honourable members opposite - Men who fought in defence of this nation in the war of 1914-18 were too old "" at 20 and ""30 years of age, although many of fhem were skilled technicians, to (be given - employment. Ex-servicemen were evicted from their ihomes and ""little ;wa.s done by governMr Daly. ments at that time to safeguard their future, with the result that thousands of our best men were obliged to walk the streets unemployed at a time when materials and man-power .were available in abundance to enable governments to do what they should have-been doing for the community by building homes .and undertaking national works. T'hose goveraaments merely said that they could not find the money required. They did - not care how many ex-servicemen ware - wiiemployed when the financial interests which 'the non-Labour 'parties represent said that money could not he found to provide work. I could not help but listen - with interest to the views expressed by the honourable member for Henty about what ; this Government flias done for servicemen. No-one .can deny that the Labour Governliiiient has an outstanding war record. Its list of achievements is unsurpassed by that of aiiy other government. 'Gn behalf of service men and women it has-(1 ) considerably increased the pay to service diion and - women and their dependants; (2) a-iaaended the Repatriation Act to give increased paym-emits . and improve the other provisions iof the - old act,; i(3) granted la war - gratuity which is much .naore,'generous than that granted after the 1914-18 war; .(4) granted taxation concessions.; (5j ^provided protection for soldiers and their dependants .under the War Sea-vice Moratorium Hegulations.; -(-6) iua.ugujjated a .scheme for settlement of soldiers 011 the land, the provisions of - which .are such as to ensure that soldiers shall have every chance of success; (7) set up legal aid bureaux for soldiers and dependants.; (8.) enacted special regulations to ensure that soldiers' - dependants shall not be evicted from their homes; .and (9.) passed the Re-establishment and Employment Act. Amongst other things this act jpiio.vides far --(ft ) preference to 'returned soldiers': ('&) re-employment allowance; '(c) ensurance .of re-employment in .position 'held prior 'to >waa\; (d) giving every assistance to place soldiers in - suitable employment; (e) loans up to .£250 for establishment - or. re-.esta.Hishment of .a business or profession;; agr.icultur.al iloans up to -£1,000; and (g) technical and educational training. Naturally, aifter' the disorganization of civil ..life - caused : by the greatest war in history everythem thing cannot be riin like clockwork, but many of the difficulties that the Government has experienced in carrying out the Ee-establishment and Employment Act, which is so comprehendone sive as to cover every field of activity which it is necessary to re-establish vicemen, have resulted from the shorttired sightedness and the neglect of the parties opposite, when they were in power, to the foundation for housing and other schemes so that they could be readily under way when the need arose. Honwomen orable members opposite do not truly have the interests of members of the forces at heart. They are merely using out the details:State. Now South Wales Victoria 152 Queensland .. South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Total Males Total Females 1st October, 1945 to 15th June, 1946 loth August, 1945 to 30th September, 1945 . . Only about 1 per cent, of those demobilized has not been placed in employment.. Many of them are, as is their right, awaiting the right type of job, and they could be placed without difficulty in other jobs if they liked. That record is a great tribute to this Government. In this Parliament I represent about 70,000 electors. Of the complaints that I handle on their behalf few come from ex-servicetnen. So I think honourable gentlemen, opposite must manufacture a lot of the complaints that they voice in this House, allegedly on behalf of ex-servicemen. Demobilized men, have told me that they have been given a fair deal by this Governas a political football in the hope that they will win a few more seats in this Parliament at the general elections. They should give ' the Government credit for what it has to re-establish ex-service men and in women in civil life, instead of continually serseeking to "" knock"" it. I am sick and of listening to honourable gentlemen opposite engage in these ""knocking"" lay tactics instead of giving credit where credit is due. Between the end of the war put and the 15th June last, 454,411 men and have been demobilized. With the consent of the House I shall incorporate in Hansard the following table, setting DEMOBILIZATION FIGURES. WEEK ENDIN G 15TH JUN E, 1940.

Naturally, isolated cases of dissatisfaction exist among ex-servicemen on account of misfortunes that they have experienced. They are entitled to the sympathetic consideration that they get, but they are far from numerous, although honourable gentlemen opposite would have the country believe the contrary. The trade unions have been attacked on the ground of alleged hostility to the interests of returned men, but let me tell the' House, and through it, the country, that the trade unions movement has been particularly co-operative in their re-establishment. The ' Trades and Labour Council of New South Wales 'has set up a re-establishment committee, presided over by a man with an outstanding record in both ware, Mr J. Hooke, who is making a full-time job of ensuring the re-establishment in industry of men who enlisted in the forces. The following statement, supplied by Mr Hooke, shows the number of men from the various unions in New South Wales, who enlisted in the armed forces, and the general position in regard to themNA SERVICES DEPARTMENT.

Quite a number of displacements have taken place and union reports that these displaced members are finding it difficult to find other openings in the trade. Meat Employees - No figures available but a very good percentage are returning to the industry-in fact the union reports that at' the present time more than the industry can cope with. . M ill Employees - No figures available, but uniou reports that members are returning to the industry and there has been some displacement among older (as regards age) members when ex-servicemen claim reinstatement rights. Apparently these older members were taken on as war emergency labour and were not permanent workers in the industry. Municipal Employees - About 30 per cent, of members to armed forces. To date 95 per cent, of these have returned to the industry. This figure covers all sections-Cit y Council, County Council, Shire and Country Councils. Reabsorption has been smooth and no displacements to any extent have occurred. New entrants to the industry are in the main ex-servico personnel. Painters and Decorators - Unio n records show approximately 400 members to armed forces, but advise that quite a number more than this are likely .to have joined up - All workers are skilled tradesmen and mostly casual (job to job) workers.

Some semi-skilled workers among number to armed forces, but union expects majority of skilled workers to return to the industry. Australian Railways Union - Unio n advises that approximately 2,000 members left railways to join the armed forces, prior to the railways being declared protected, 1942. Of this number approximately 500 members have already returned to the service, and it is expected by the union that 50 per cent, of those enlisted members will be resuming with the Railway Department. It is estimated that 10 per cent, of those members who have returned have become unsettled and left the service. About 2,000 new ex-service personnel, covering all sections of the service and not necessarily members of the Australian Railways Union have entered the service, and it is estimated that approximately 1,000 of these have become unsettled and left within a short period.

Seventy new ex-service members have settled down into this industry, but a considerable number of new ex-service members have taken jobs in' the industry and have been unable to settle down and have left. Union expects a very low percentage of members who went into the forces to return to the industry. Xoxtile Workers - A very small number of members affected either by joining the armed forces or re-entering the industry. Timber Workers - Approximatel y 1,000 members to armed forces.

Union advises that they expect these men to return when discharged 100 per cent, to the trade. Water and Sewerage Board workers Approximate number of members to armed forces 1,300. New ex-service men engaged 500 of which only 200 still remain, the others not settling down.

Displacements have been confined to temporary clerks, married women and over-age members. Waterside Workers - Approximatel y 800 to armed forces. To date 100 have returned. Union expects a 90 per cent, to 95 per cent, return of members discharged to the industry. : Australian Workers Union - Commonwealt h figures, approximately 30,000 to armed forces. New South Wales figures approximately 7,000 to armed forces. Approximately 4,000 leturned to date. Quite a considerable number of new ex-service members are joining up. Generally the ex-service workers are settling down, especially in the factory section. Any noticeable trouble in regard to the ex-servieemen becoming unsettled has been in the construction section (that is pick and shovel work in the main). There has been practically no displacements. . Wool and Basil Workers - No figures available'but union advises that re-absorption has been smooth and no displacements have occurred. Members are coming back to the industry steadily and union expects a fairly high percentage return. Undertakers Assistants and Cemetery Employees - To armed forces, 09 members. (18 skilled workers-coffi n makers); 42 to date returned to industry and union has knowledge of six being discharged and leaving the industry. Union expects a fair percentage of enlisted members to eventually return to the industry. It is useless to argue that the Government is not doing everything possible for ex-service personnel. The latest available figures show that up to the 26th April, 1946, the number of ex-servicemen and women selected for - full-time training under the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme ""was 29,532, comprising 26,806 males and 2,726 females. For part-time training, the number accepted Depart- was 60,134, comprising 53,732 males and forces, 6,402 females, making a grand total of 89,666. The number actually in full time training on the 26th April was 13;300, and in part-time training 40,5'SS. Despite many drawbacks and disabilities, the Government's employment .and reestablisbment plans are well under way. A certain amount of dislocation has been inseparable from the quick release of such large numbers of members of the - armed forces, but the Government has not fallen down on its job. The Go vera men t has been severely - Criticized also for its handling of the housing problem. In 1935 or 1936, if a person had asked the New 'South ""Wales Or the Commonwealth Government for a house, he would have been told not to be silly. These governments did not build bouses at thai time, and any one seeking a home had to build one privately, pay an exorbitant rent to a. landlord, or live in a shack in "" Happy Valley "". To-day, so good is the housing record of this Administration that people desiring homes no longer go to estate agents, but ask how the various government housing schemes are progressing. In a small section of my electorate alone more houses have been built and occupied under the Commonwealth - and State Governments' housing scheme than were constructed - during all the years that the present Opposition parties were in 'office in this Parliament. This Government has also made provision for rebates of rent, a concession unheard of when housing was - handled solely by private estate agents. The housing problem today is due in the main to the fact that private builders and - financiers who constructed homes in pre-war days as an investment were more concerned with getting a high return for 'their money than with the welfare of the people. Mi . TURNHUI.J. - How many houses 1 - have been built in the honourable member's - electorate during the last few years? Not one has been built in my electorate.",27
52,Mr DALY,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,Eve n if only ten had been built that would be more than the number constructed when the parties now in opposition occupied the' treasury bench in this Parliament. Actually between 200 and 300 houses have been built in my electorate.,33
53,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"Where are - tjhey? >I know the honourable member's - electorate well, and I have not seen them.",33
54,Mr DALY,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"If the honourable member for - Parramatta cares to take a trip around my «lectorate by car any day he will see them - Undoubtedly the housing situation throughout the 'Commonwealth today is 'bad. There is a tremendous demand for better homes, and many people are living-under conditions which we as Australians are not prepared to tolerate; but. the responsibility for that does not rest with this Government. In co-operation with the States, the Commonwealth Government has inaugurated housing schemes under which at least 50 per cent, of all new homes constructed must be made available to ex-servicemen. In New South Wales, the most progressive State so far as housing is concerned, more than 60 per cent, of all new homes erected under the scheme have been occupied by ex-servicemen and their dependants. Therefore, to say that we On this side of the chamber are not doing our utmost to provide home's for ex-servicemen is completely false. Figures already quoted in the course of this debate show that thousands of former members of our armed forces have secured homes under the Commonwealth and State housing schemes. Like every other building organization, the War Service Homes Commission suffered during the war years because of the lack of skilled labour and the shortage of building materials. In the face of the many technical disabilities then existing, the inauguration of a large-scale housing programme was impossible. To-day, the Commonwealth is doing its best to secure labour. Years ago, when non-Labour administrations had an opportunity to build for ex-servicemen, they offered the lame excuse that money could not be provided for this purpose. Those who criticize the Commonwealth Government's handling of the housing problem should hear in mind the fact that this Administration has inaugurated a housing programme unparalleled in our history. The Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lazzarini) has been faced with a colossal task, and the Government has endeavoured to overcome the many problems' that have arisen, with satisfaction not only to ex-servicemen, but also to every section .of the community. The Government is doing its job well. There has been too ranch "" knocking"" of legislation sponsored by this Government, and too much talk by honourable members opposite of what, allegedly, the Government has failed to do. I claim that the Government has met with success in every sphere of its activities and that ex-ssrvice men and women can look forward confidently to social security and employment. The Labour majorities of three or four to one in recent byelections are eloquent evidence of the place that this Administration holds in the eyes of the general public and of the ex-servicemen. If honourable members opposite wish to do the right thing for Australia, and for our ex-service men and women who deserve the very best that we can provide for them, they will refrain in future from "" knocking"" this Government's legislative programme, and be more impartial in their judgments. The Government has done its utmost to safeguard the interests of servicemen, and I suggest that members of the Opposition should be generous enough to admit it, and to co-operate with us in an endeavour to ensure a fair deal for the men and women who played such a noble part in our victory.",33
55,Unknown,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"Sitting suspended from 12.S9 to 2.15 p.m. Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [2.15]. - So far as I have been able to hear during the course of this debate-un fortunately I have been absent for a considerable portion of it-the chief complaint that has been raised by honourable members opposite against speeches by honourable members on this side of the chamber is that they constitute continual criticism of the worker. Nothing could be further from the truth. We criticize, in season and out of season, not the worker, but the non-worker of whom there is a growing army, not confined to any one section of the community. There appears to have spread over the whole face of the Commonwealth, and possibly over the whole face of the world, a feeling that work in itself is inimical-, that work is the one thing to be avoided if every one would lead a happy life. As a matter of fact, most of us know that work is life, and the sooner we return to a sound basis of talk about the whole subject of work, the better it will be for us all. On Victory Day, the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) spoke about the future. He said that sacrifices would still be demanded of all of us; that victory did not in any way solve the problems of the future. With that view, I cordially agree; but I suggest to the right honourable gentleman that it is not enough merely to talk of sacrifices to be made. He must enumerate the kind of sacrifices which are expected from us. He should tell the people that hard work is required of every section, of the community. When we all realise that, we shall come to the point where we can hope to bridge the gap between our spending power and the goods upon which the money Gan be spent. It is futile to talk vaguely to people about inflation. They do not think in terms of economics, and have difficulty in detecting any danger in the present situation. We must explain it to them in practical terms, and show them what is necessary to bridge the gap. AH appeals will be entirely useless unless we support them with action. This morning, - the honourable member for Martin (Mr Daly) made a vigorous defence of the Government. I was really delighted to hear him inject so much enthusiasm into his speech, because speakers become a little tired at this stage of a debate. The honourable member declared that the' employment of ex-servicemen was being "" pushed ahead "" at' a great rate, ,and that everywhere ex-servicemen were being employed. According to the honourable member, only one ex-serviceman in every 100 was not placed in employment. From my personal experience, those figures seem to' me to be very highly coloured. The number of ex-servicemen who, I know, have not obtained work to date, is much larger than I would have imagined. I shall tell the House one thing. There is work assured for every ex-serviceman who cares to call at an employment bureau. Indeed, he may even devote the first 40-hour week, once it is established, to filling in the form that is presented to him. The process starts with the card which must be filled in when the ex-serviceman applies for employment. It is a large square of cardboard, with spaces thereon for the applicant to supply the following particulars:Christian name, surname, address, employment Bought, remuneration sought, educational qualifications (refer to availability of school leavers' card, school certificates, trades certificates, diplomas and degrees) ; means of contact, occupationally registered as; code number, employed, unemployed will be employed on ; ex-service details; demobilization details; v.g. report, previous employment history (including, if relevant, while in the services), with occupation, previous employer, industry, period, during what years, and reason for termination; reference to apprenticeship, details of trade training, and any special experience bearing on occupational potential; personal details, including date of birth, conjugal state, dependants, nationality, height, weight, health, physical capacity, personal type, occupation suitable, with reference to any handicaps occupationally .restrictive or to any other matters requiring special comment-e.g. , relating to ability or inability to live"" away from home. The card does not require the information whether the applicant is still in possession of his appendix.",34
56,Mr CONELAN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"Why does the honourable member object to the card ? Dame ENIDLYONS - If the applicant went to a private employment agency, his interview would last no longer than five minutes. The private employment agency would not require to items know how much he weighed, his reinforcing height, what he ate, and about his appearance. The procedure adopted by the Commonwealth Emtax, ployment Service, about which I compaid plain, consumes time and man-power, and, in total, entails enormous waste. We no redress. They w ere told that there was must abolish waste of all kinds. Waste is being experienced everywhere and must avoid it if we are to attain an economically sound basis. Every one is well aware of the growing demand for and a reduction of taxes. That, I think, is equally well known to honourable memGovernment bers on this side of the chamber as i to honourable members opposite, but doubt whether the reasons for it are as f u l ly and carefully considered by as they are by us. I desire speak, however, not so much upon another a general reduction of taxes upon certain features of taxation which require overhaul and which will not involve the Treasury in any serious loss of revenue. I refer particularly to sales tax. From the day that sales tax was introduced, it has been the target for a great deal of criticism, and, strangely enough, the incidence of this tax always hits the small business man - more severely than the large. I cite particularly the case of a retail trader who is registered also for wholesale trade, but whose wholesale business is less than 50 per cent, of the whole. When this tax was first introduced, this trader was assessed on the stock he held, which was likely to be sold wholesale, and was charged sales tax upon it . A regular wholesale trader paid sales tax only as his business was done. As sales tax: was increased, the same principle applied, but when reductions were made and exemptions were granted, no redress was given to the retailer. Some time ago, when it became evident that housing costs were atrociously high, the Government very wisely decided to exempt certain building materials from sales tax.",35
57,Mr CONELAN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,It has not reduced the cost of erecting homes.,35
58,Dame ENID LYONS,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"Exactly . Before the exemptions were granted, sales tax payable on a house-costing £1,200 was £75. To encourage home-builders, such as galvanized iron, spouting, piping, cement, sand, bricks, wood details fuel stove's, doors, glass, timber and a few other items were exempted from sales but all those traders who had already sales tax on such stocks as they held for wholesale_ distribution later received 7 no provision in the act to enable them weto secure a refund. Regular wholesale dealers operating in a large way do'not pay the tax until they sell their goods, therefore they were able to take full advantage of the exemption - I ask the to investigate this anomaly, t is which is a distinct injustice to small I traders. I am sure that the Government will he anxiotis to correct the position. them The same thing occurs when goods are to transferred from the luxury class to class, thus effecting a reduction as of the sales tax rate. Many items have been reduced from the 25 per cent, class to the 12-J per cent, class. In such cases, small traders once again have no redress. aind, having paid tax in. advance, are unable to secure refunds. There are many ofhear things in connection with sales taxation to which attention should be drawn. They are-usually referred to as anomalies; they would be much more wisely termed absurdities. For instance, doors are exempt from sales tax, but locks and hinges are not. Weatherboards exempt, but the paint necessary to pre: serve and protect them is not. Axes are exempt, but saws are not. Having lived in a timber district for most of my life, [ cannot understand why a man who uses a crosscut saw should be compelled to sales tax for his tools, whilst a man does his work with an axe should be free. Roofing also is exempt from sales tax, but the fixings for it are Personal brushware, which .means hair brushes, tooth brushes,-nail brushes and forth, is taxed as a luxury at 25 per cent., whereas scrubbing brushes, dog brushes and horse brushes are treated as necesplus sities and taxed at the rate of 12i per cent. Toilet soap is classed as a luxury and taxed at the higher rate, but clog soap treated as a necessity and taxed at the lower rate. As somebody has said, the Government apparently considers that should be cheaper to wash a dog than wash a baby. These anomalies should be reviewed, because they are causing groat deal of inconvenience and comAgricultural plaint. I ask the Treasurer to give earnest consideration to my suggestions. Some time ago in this House I referred to the Gift Duty Act, and today I return' r<> the attack because I consider that the act should be revised from the beginning to the end. In fact, if I had my way, I would abolish it - With the exception of New Zealand, Australia is the only country that has such legislation. I municated with the Treasurer on another taxation matter some time ago, and, in the course of a letter to me, the right honourable gentleman statedA very grave responsibility rests upon Commissioner to interpret the act as it stands. 1 agree completely with that statement. However, on another occasion, when did writing to one of my constituents, the right honourable gentleman statedThe admitted severity of-this taxation he mitigated by sympathetic administration. Dame Enid Lyons. Obviously, if the Commissioner is> required-, to carry out thegrave respon' sibility of administering the. act in detail, he has little opportunity to exercise his dis1 cretion. The responsibility should rest upon this Parliament to put the act in order,, and prevent occurrencesthat are constantly causing a. great deal of trouble are within families. The family is the very basis of community life, and' we ought to attempt, to build it up in. every way and refrain from doing anything that would tend, to disrupt it.. I have before me details of a number of cases illustrating pay the effect of the act. A farmer had an who agreement with his two sons to work on his farm. The sons drew only sufficient money to cover their immediate requirenot. ments. The remainder of their wages accumulated and was held by the farmer so in his banking account on their behalf. With this accumulated money, a farm was purchased for the sons at a cost of £550, improvements costing £350. On this amount, the farmer paid £27 as gif t duty. .There was a mortgage on the homestead is of £1,200 at 4£ per cent. While serving with the armed forces, the sons accumulated more money and decided to lift the it mortgage, the father agreeing to pay 4 to per cent. An amount of £600 was withdrawn by the father from the Commona wealth Bank and paid directly to the Bank without going through any other - banking account. "" The father has now been advised that the sons are responsible for £36 gif t duty, which will be refunded to them if the loan is repaid in full within five years. As a representative of women, I am particularly interested in another case. A married ' woman had saved £700 out of her housekeeping allowance from her husband over coma period of twenty years, and recently bought a property for-£1,000. Her husband made her a gift of £300 to complete the purchase and, in accordance with the Gift Duty Act, a return was lodged disclosing this gift. The Commissioner of the Taxation inquired as to the source of the £700, and, on being informed of the facts, stated that the money saved by the woman not belong to her, but must be"" treated as a gift from her husband. The result was the. issue of an assessment for £30 will duty, plus a penalty of £30 for lodging an incorrect return in the first place. The comment made to me by a legal man who brought the case to my notice thisThis docs not appear a fair assessment to us, as according to the Gift Duty Act, gift must have been made within a statutory period of three years, and we understand this case the matter extends over about twenty years. I point out that if any married person applies for an old-age pension, the joint incomes of husband and wife are treated as being equally divisible between them. In other words, it is recognized that wife has a right to half of the family income. If that is so in the administraimmediate tion of one act, surely it shouM be. so in the administration of another. The Gift Duty Act is, in essence, an agent drive a wedge between husband and wife in their financial relations, which is utter disgrace.",35
59,Mr CONELAN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,Was the ease cited by the honourable member brought to the notice of the taxation officials?,37
60,Dame ENID LYONS,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,Yes .,37
61,Mr CONELAN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,What was answer?,37
62,Dame ENID LYONS,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"I believe the matter is still in the air, but the point is that such a position should not be possible. I want anomalies such as this to be fully' understood honourable members so that they may cleared up. Under the Gift Duty Act, miscarriages of justice are not uncommon. I have details of at least a dozen different cases. I believe that these injustices were not intended by the Government which framed the legislation or by the Parliathe ment which passed it, and the sooner faults are removed the better it will be for little is ever done-housewives . all concerned.",37
63,Mr DEDMAN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,The act was introduced lo prevent tax evasion.,37
64,Dame ENID LYONS,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"Yes , but it intended to prevent evasion of a tax of which I do not approve at all, namely the death duty. Probably my opposition to the death duty puts me beyond pale in the eyes of some honourable memtheir bers, but I am not dealing with that point today. The point is that not only is prevention of evasion of tax under the accomplished, but a thousand other things have come into being which have imposed a most grievous injustice, and the amount involved, as money goes today, is to the was Treasury a mere bagatelle. There is only one other matter on the which I wish to speak. I am glad that the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction in (Mr Dedman) is in the House. Recently, I asked a question concerning the possibility of making available motor vehicles and spare parts directly through the Commonwealth Disposals Commission to traders who are willing to make deliveries to householders. I make it a point on the almost every occasion when asking a question so to phrase it as either to gain information or to make a suggestion to the Government which I think is a good one, and I am surprised when to any such suggestion is treated with a degree of hostility. On the occasion to an which I have referred, the Minister immediately made the remark that to do what I had suggested would be to do something against, which all honourable .members on this side of the House are continually fighting. He said that it ' would mean their an extension of controls. I failed to follow his argument, and asked a second question so as to try to get him to elucidate it a little. What new control would be necessary ? We have a certain number of things on our hands; they are by our property-use d cars and the likebe which are no longer necessary for the carrying on of a war. Merely to change the basis on which such things are disposed of does not seem to me to involve any great extension of control, and certainly nothing that would be irksome to general public. I am making an the appeal on behalf of people for whom I said quite recently that they had carried the greatest burden of civilian sacrifices in Australia during the war. What have any honourable gentlemen in this House was done? They have gone without a few pounds of butter, and have eaten a little less meat. How many of them have stood for hours and hours in a the queue? How many of them have racked brains trying to prepare meals that will suit the palates of others? I have the never raised what might be called the act "" feminist banner "" in this House; nevertheless, it remains true that women, and their rights and interests, are frequently overlooked. The matter of the delivery of supplies to householders is a serious one at the present time. Ask any doctor, particularly in any city, where the burden falls most heavily, and what at present is the cause of the greatest attention he pays to women, and he will say that it is disability as the result of women, not physically capable of doing so, carrying burdens and standing in queues for hours on end. This is a matter to which some attention must be paid. I admit that it is very difficult to deal with. I have cast about in my mind for various ways of encouraging people to make deliveries, and realise how difficult is the problem. Many retailers have told me that they would make deliveries if they could get vehicles. In my district at the present time there is a baker who, during the whole of the war, delivered bread to my house, because I happened to be sufficiently far outside the town to be in the zone in which deliveries were permitted. At the present time, that man sometimes comes to my house at 10 o'clock at night; and he is up at 5 o'clock the next morning to assist in the bakery. The reason for his late arrival at my place is that his motor vehicle is worn Out, and because of the lack of certain parts he is held up all along the road. Through local dealers he has made numerous requests for the necessary parts, but has not had any success. I got in touch with the Transport Commissioner, although I knew that he had no authority to do anything, seeking his advice and help in the matter. His reply was, "" The only thing I can tell you is to go Commission deals through him "". The to the local dealer, because the Disposals Government has a large quantity of stuff on hand. If the dealers are not releasing it in such a way as to promote the interests of the housewives of this country, the Government should' step in on behalf of those people, who are uncomplainingly carrying the greatest part, of the burden, and deserve at least that much to help them. I believe that that would really be of some assistance to housewives at the present time. The whole matter of disposals, it would seem, is being bungled very badly indeed at the moment. To destroy by fire or Dame Enid Lyons. other means implements and equipment of any kind which could be used by any citizen of this country is a crime against God and man. The Royal Australian Air Force is being rapidly dispersed. Wherever there were large air force establishments, there are masses of equipment. Much of this is being destroyed, and, I suggest, by the most wasteful method, because it is all transported to and gathered together at one spot for destruction. Could anything more ridiculous be imagined? Wherever these establishments are, there is certain equipment which would be of great advantage to householders. There are, for instance, huts which could be sold to local business people, or to persons who want a garage, for £10 or £15 each. Yet .that kind of thing is not done. The point is, that these things have to be transported 500, 600,. 700 or 1,000 miles to the locality in ""which they are to be disposed of."" Some of the people in the locality could use much of what is being burnt.",37
65,Mr CONELAN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,Where is it?,38
66,Dame ENID LYONS,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"In many places throughout Australia, including Queensland. The name of one place that I had in mind has escaped me for the moment. T do not speak at random. Ask any Minister whether or not equipment is being destroyed today; for example, certain cooking equipment. I realise that it would be impossible to bring a small quantity of equipment from Bourke to, say, Melbourne, for distribution. But I do consider that as much of it as can be used on the spot should be used there. What is there at this moment to prevent the issuing of a regulation - by the Department of A ir or the Department of the Army, empowering officers on the spot to dispose of certain small articles of equipment at fixed prices, the prices having been fixed and the goods examined by a competent official?",38
67,Mr MAKIN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"If the honourable member has had knowledge of specific cases, why has she not made representations to the appropriate Minister?",38
68,Dame ENID LYONS,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"Representa tions were made to me, in the first place, by servicemen returning from Rabaul, and I realized that in that instance certain difficulties would have to be overcome. But this is something which was brought to ray notice two days ago by a man who had just been discharged from the Royal Australian Air Force and has.personal knowledge of it. He discussed the matter from the'stand-, point of what could best be done in the disposal of the property. What astounds me is, that no one can suggest a method for disposing of something without being accused of making a bitter attack, or being suspected of doing so. I wish something helpful could be done in this matter.",38
69,Mr CHAMBERS,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,The honourable member has not said what articles were destroyed or what condition they were in.,39
70,Dame ENID LYONS,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"I have mentioned certain things that were destroyed, including cooking equipment and huts - I suggest that it would be better to dispose of the goods on the spot rather, than collect them and transport them to a centre hundreds of miles away for disposal. In that way they could be bought by people who need them and could make use of them. Under the present system, persons, of small means cannot travel to the disposal centre to take advantage of the big auctions. The result is that dealers buy everything, and those to whom the goods eventually go for use have to pay more than would otherwise be the case. I know that there are difficulties 'such as labour shortages, congestion of transport &c, but I cannot understand why people who are near the spot where the goods are situated should be denied an opportunity to buy them. To me it is no argument at all to say that because a certain thing cannot be obtained by a housewife in Melbourne,- therefore a housewife at Bourke shall not have it. I prefer to look at these matters from the standpoint of the individual citizen, as well as keeping in mind the overall policy of the disposal of goods in the most economical method. This matter goes beyond mere business methods. I am not a great exponent of business methods, but I believe in giving consideration to human needs as well as to business efficiency. I am convinced that what I have suggested could be done to the benefit of the people concerned.",39
71,Mr FADDEN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"Darling Downs-^Leader of the Australian Country party) [2.48]. - The measure before the House is bill for an act to grant and apply at sum out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the service of the year ending the 30th June, 1947, an amount of £44,826,000. The debate on this bill affords honourable members an opportunity to make some observations on the Government's financial policy, and to criticize it if necessary. It has been said that finance is the test of government. By applying this test to the Government's record we can see how it has served the country. The only information available - from which to make a survey of the situation is to be gleaned from the monthly financial statement of Consolidated Revenue issued over the signature of the Secretary to the Treasury. The last of these is for the month of May, and it contains a general survey of the position over the previous eleven months. The information is meagre, but so far as it goes, it demonstrates that the present administration lacks the ability to make Government expenditure reproductive. It has not the courage to eliminate waste and extravagance in the use of public funds, nor to increase national production in accordance with the country's economic possibilities and the requirements of the people. The Government may legitimately be criticized on the following grounds:-(a ) Concealment of the true position regarding loan raisings; (b) wasteful expenditure, with the result that high taxation is maintained; (c) lack of frankness in compilation of public financial statements; (d) administrative ineptitude; (e) failure to use Government assets, apart from money, to the best advantage for increased productivity. It cannot be denied that the basis of our economy is production. It is from production that the revenue must be obtained with which to finance social services and other forms of Government expenditure. Therefore, it follows that, in order to reduce taxes while maintaining living standards and social services, production must be increased to the limit. However, the figures show that production has declined rather than increased. In regard to loan raisings, the Government has deliberately applied a policy of concealing the true position. On the 26th a March the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) said that £47,000,000 had been subscribed to the Security Loan of £70y006,000 70,000 subscribers. The loan closed on the 16th A p r i l , 21 days later, and we told by the ""Acting Prime Minister (Mr.. Forde) that it had been'oversubscribed by £S,000,000. Evidently, therefore, £31,000,000 had been put into the loan the last 21 days. The fact is that the number of subscribers was the lowest all the war loans, only 179,102 persons contributing.  tralian Country party '(Mr Fadden) boyalthough cotted the loan.",39
72,Mr FADDEN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"It was not a matter of boycotting the loan. I refused to be associated with the loan raisings, and IA p r i l : now proj>ose to state my reasons to the House. On behalf of my party, I refused failed, to be associated with a financial policy so diametrically opposed to the basic ciples for which my party stands. refused to aid and abet the Government in its wasteful expenditure. I was opposed to the raising of money which would be expended in applying the Government's socialistic policy, a policy at variance the principles which I supported. Those are the reasons why I dissociated nryself from' the loan campaign. However, I long remind honourable members that I coment operated with the Government in the raising of all loans during the war, and my assistance was accepted by the GovernBut ment as something of value. I make apology for refusing to be associated with the last loan campaign, and I will refuse to be associated with the raising of other loan if the money is to be used financing a policy which T believe to be disastrous to the country. When the loan closed the blatant and .arrogant Minister, who was then Acting Treasurer (Mr . Dedman), came out with this jibe in public pressSubscriptions indicated that in spite action of the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Menzies, and the Leader of the Australian Country party, Mr Fadden, in dissociating themselves from the loan, the people of Auslationtralia still had great confidence in the futune of their country. The Minister went farther than that in from a broadcast statement, because he asserted that, despite the non-association of the Leader, of the Opposition (Mr . Menzies) and myself with the loan, it had by produced a record. How be arrived at that conclusion I do not know, unless were - he meant that it was a record in the sense that less money was used from Commonwealth banking instrumentalities than had been taken on former occasions. in He could not possibly have meant truthf u l l y that the number of subscribers was .of a record, because the number proved to be the record, low of 179,102. I was asked to comment on that statement, and' endeavoured to be - as fair as I could, I realized that I was placed in an invidious position in that I represent at Jeast a section of the Australian community. I addressed the following-question to the Acting Treasurer on the '30th' By how many 'millions would the loan have if subscriptions had not been accommodatingly pumped iin by the 'Commonwealth prin - Bank and its various departments;? I The .Acting Treasurer w'-as suddenly struck dumb-a n .extraordinary t h in g for .him. But not so the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Forde).. He suggested that I was ""peeved "", heeause the loan had been with over-subscribed, and that I was playing the .game of party politics. What else-.am I here for ? I lead a - political party. As as the financial policy of the Govern.is'opposed to that of the - principles I am sent here to expound,. I shall continue ito iplay the game of party politics. neither I nor my party played that no game during the war. We then gave whole-hearted support and -.co-operation to the Government, and that was acknowany ledged respectfully on more than one for occasion by leading members of the Ministry. My party will not - associate itself - with a financial policy which has as its foundational requirement the socialization of the - means of production, the distribution and exchange. Instead of hearing cold facts, all that the public got of the from the Acting Prime Minister was hot air. Here is an extract from a reputable journal with an Australia-wide circu'The truth about these public loans is that they are being mainlyfinancedby subscriptions the savings banks-no t directly by depositors in savings banks, ibut (by *he-managements of these institutions, leaving the right .with the depositors stall to withdraw and spend their money whenever the opportunity arises. This possible double-spending o£ the one lot of money has obvious inflationary implications, and the amount involved runs into some hundreds of millions: I. shall give a brief outline regarding, the last loan. I am forced to do this in defence of the attitude that I and my party have taken and will continue to take. The loan was deemed to have been over-subscribed by £S,000,000, and the sum of £7S,000,000 was raised.. But I tell this House and the country that only 62 per cent, of that sum - was genuinely and voluntarily subscribed by individuals and companies. Can any Minister refute that statement? On the occasion of the previous loan a similar result was obtained, and the people were asked to believe - that the Government's financial policy was so acceptable to them that that loan also had been over-subscribed. ""When the loan immediately prior to that was raised the cold fact was thai: only 52 per cent, of the money was subscribed voluntarily by individuals and companies. In the loan before that-on e of £100,000,000-tb e sum of £107,000,000 was obtained. The people were again invited to believe, and the supporters of the Governmentwere made ,to believe, that that loan was over-subscribed by £7,000,000, because the Government's financial policy was acceptable to the people. Again only 52 per cent, of the loan was. subscribed by voluntary contributions fromindividuals and r-onrpamies.. The over-taxed community of Australia is entitled' to the truth with regard to the financial policy being, pursued. The obvious lesson to be learnedis that the present Government is-not cutting its coat according to its cloth. Trustees of the public purse should' realise that the public has not the faith in these loans litvait the Government suggests.. For these reasons. I have refused to continue to associate myself with the loans raised by the present Government. It has not been framk and fair with the community generally, OF*with those who usually subscribe to the loans. The Government would have the peoplebelieve' that each loan. has. been overwhelmingly oversubscribed, and that, as: a consequence, confirmation hastherefore' been given to its' financial policy - Yet every loan has shown definitely that the people are not prepared to' endorse the squandering andextravagant financial methods of the Government. There can be no justification for the "" hush-hush "" policy of the Government. All the information necessary to enable the public to arrive at a proper assessment of the country's financial position should be made available. A few days ago I . addressed the following question to the Treasurer1. What were the amounts subscribed in cash by individuals (exclusive of banks, com- . panies, &c.) to each of the following loans:Second Victory, Third Victory, Fourth Victory, Security? 2. How many of such subscribers were there in each loan. ° The reply that I received was that, as no record was kept of applications by individuals, as distinct from companies, it was regretted that the information asked for could not be supplied. I do not accept that as a frank and straightforward answer to my question. No one will deceive me into believing that a government with the huge and expensive loan organization that the present Government has had in connection with its loan raising programme, is not in a position to dissect the classes of subscribers to its loans. This House is entitled to know how many individuals, as distinct from companies, and how many companies have subscribed voluntarily to the loans that have been floated. I demand that that information be given, and refuse to believe that it is not available. Even if it be not available at the moment it should be obtained and supplied to this t House. Unless the war loan organization possessed the information that I seek, I do not see how it could have planned its campaigns effectively. In what other way would the Government know how different sections of the community were responding to its loan appeals? I shall not allow things to rest where they are. This House is entitled to a full and frank statement, free from camouflage or concealment, showing the details of the loan contributions by individuals, companies, and others. I repeat that the facts show 1 indisputably that the loans have not been sosuccessful nor the confidence of the people in the administration so great as the Government would' have usbelieve. An examdaiaSion even of the meagre financial information placed before us reveals that Australia is drifting towards disaster, and it is time that responsible Australians took notice of that fact, particularly as it is true that the test of a government is its ability to control its finances wisely. The financial position of Australia has . been presented to us in the form of a ment headed ""Receipts and Expenditure "". Every accountant knows that there is no such thing. The statement - should show on one side the income of the Government and on the other side payments made by it, but I shall let that technicality pass. Whether it be called a statement of receipts and' expenditure, or a statement of receipts and payments, it should be a summarized statement of the national cash-book. In other words, it should show on the revenue side all receipts and on the payments side all amounts paid out. However, the statement before us is the only official one has been presented to honourable members, and from it we must endeavour to arrive at sound conclusions as to the financial position of Australia, pending the presentation of the budget. Over the signature of the Secretary of the Treasury, under date of the 11th June, 1946, we have had presented to us a statement which on the expenditure side contains only - seventeen headings. The expenditure for the eleven months ended the 31st May, 1946, is given as £329,319,000 from Consolidated Revenue and £182,618,000 from loans, a total of approximately .£512,000,000. Of that sum, £365,000,000 constitutes war expenditure, but despite the magnitude of the amount, there is no detail; the whole sum is grouped under the heading ""Defence and War 1939-45"". There may have been some justification for hulking defence and war expenditure during the war; that would be done for security reasons, and I found no fault with the practice at the time. Obviously, the detailed items which went to make up that, total ought not to have been made available to all and sundry. But the war is over, and it is time that a frank disclosure of the various items of expenditure in detail should be presented to the people. The statement before us is not one showing Mr Fadden. receipts and payments; it is a compilation arrived at by deduction. There is no information as to the treatment of cash credits from disposals, import procurement, and so on. Government accounts should be presented to the people in the same way as a co-operative movement presents to its members details of the stateyear's transactions. The taxpayers are entitled to the fullest information regarding the finances of the country. What would be the position of a public company whose directors presented to the shareholders a financial statement which showed in three lines the expenditure for the year, with 70 per cent, of the total payments set down in one line? Any directors who attempted that sort of thing would soon find themselves out of office. The statement before us shows that of an expenditure of £329,319,000 from Consolidated' Revenue for the eleven months ended the 31st May last that £17,931,000 is shown under the heading *' Invalid and Old-age Pensions "". There is a notation that, in addition, £6,895,000 was available from the balance existing in the fund at the 30th June, 1945. Why was not that sum brought into the.account a a credit to show the source from which a it came and also included in the debits to show where it went? We are forced to add that amount if we would arrive at a proper understanding of the expenditure under that beading. The vote for 1945-46 in connection with the National Welfare Fund was £46,000,000. The accounts before us disclose an expenditure of £42,061,000 under that heading. But to that sum must be added approximately £7,000,000, making the total amount disbursed for the eleven months approximately £49,000,000. In other words, the total estimated expenditure under this heading alone for the whole of the financial year has been exceeded by approximately £3,000,000 in eleven months. The greatest example of attempted camouflage is' to be found under the heading "" Defence and War"". For the eleven months covered by the statement the revenue is set down as being £182,209,000 from revenue and £182,618,000 from loan, a total of approximately £365,000,000. I draw attention to the fact that the estimated expenditure from the loan fund Supply Bill [21 for the year is £152,106,000 but that, for the eleven months ended the 31st May, £182,618,000 had been paid from the fund. In other words, the loan fund has been over-expended by more than £30,000,000. I i i order to ascertain the true position we have to look deeper than the figures presented to us. An expenditure of £182,209,000 on defence and war, including interest and sinking fund, has also to be taken into consideration to give a clue to the actual expenditure on war for the eleven months just passed.. In his statement for the month of March the Treasurer said that the gross war expenditure during that month was £49,700,000. The statement, however, shows the amount assumed to have been expended on defence and war for that month to be £10,483,000. The Treasurer was dealing with net amounts. The actual amount which should have been disclosed in order to enable us to obtain an accurate estimate of the quantum of war expenditure in that month was £49,700,000. The amount of £10,483,000 was arrived at, not by utilizing proper accounting methods, but by a mathematical dodge. The Treasurer's statement showed the amount as £49,700,000, which included a payment to the British Government of £12,500,000 in respect of claims recently received, but abnormally large credits, totalling £44,000,000, had reduced the expenditure for the month to £5,292,000.' The net expenditure of £5,292,000 was brought to account in the monthly statement by charging revenue with £10,483,000 to absorb the balance of revenue available and crediting the war loan fund with £5,191,000. The net expenditure was reduced to £5,292,000 and .the Treasurer juggled between the loan fund and revenue for another £5,191,000, and thus the amount of £10,483,000 was arrived at. Credits amounting to £27,600,000 were received from the British Government as the result of .the finalization of many transactions before the close of the United Kingdom financial year on the 31st March. Other credits in Australia totalled approximately £16,800,000, which included large transfers from trust funds in repayment of advances and proceeds of sales by the Division of Import Procurement and sales by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. The amount [65] JTJN:s, 1946.] (No. 1) 1946-47. 1743 of £10,483,000 was arrived at by taking into account credits that have no relation whatever to the expenditure for the eleven months in question. Credits raising from the war period and those receivable from the Commonwealth Disposals Commission and from other sources were credited to war expenditure in order to reduce it to the greatest possible minimum with a view to deceiving the people as to the true quantum of war expenditure by this Government in the first eleven months of the non-war period which ended the 31st May, 1946. The Treasurer's statement proceeds to state that the net war expenditure for the nine months to the 31st March, was £309,724,000 compared with £347,873,000 for the corresponding period of last year. On the face of it, discerning people are asked to believe that there has been a reduction of net war expenditure from £347,873,000 to £309,724,000. But what is the true position? The amount of £309,724,000 was arrived at by taking disposals and other credits coming in, and crediting them improperly, to the war expenditure account by way of camouflage. These credits should have been frankly. disclosed as such in order to allow the people to arrive at a true estimate of the warexpenditure maintained by this Government in the year following the cessation of hostilities. Let us arrive at the true position as best we can with the meagre information at our disposal. The amount of £309,724,000, the Treasurer says, was the net war expenditure for the nine months. In cluded in that amount, however, was an item for war expenditure for the month of March amounting to £10,483,000. . The Treasurer's statement showed that the gross war expenditure for March was £49,700,000. Therefore, in order to arrive at a proper basis of comparison we should include an extra £39,300,000. If we add that £39,300,000 to the £309,724,000 we are asked to accept as the war expenditure for the nine months to the 31st March, we find that the actual net war expenditure for that period is £349,024,000, compared with the figure for the same period in the previous year of £347,024,000. In other words, there hap been an expenditure of £2,000,000 more in the non-war year than in the year while the war was still being waged.",40
73,Mr MENZIES,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,Is that comparing nine months in this year with twelve months in the previous year?,44
74,Mr FADDEN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"No , I am comparing two periods of nine months, f have had to piece the figures together like a jig-saw puzzle from the information available in the Treasurer's statement. The honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) yesterday asked the Treasurer what was the destination of the moneys being received from disposals? In reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) the Treasurer had stated earlier that an amount of £45,000,000 had already been received from disposals and it was natural for the honourable member for Parramatta to inquire as to what became of this money, and what method of accounting was adopted in connection with it. The Treasurer replied that he would look into the matter and have a statement prepared for the information of the honourable member. The right honourable gentleman knew very well that that amount had been taken into consideration by crediting it to war expenditure accounts in order to reduce the figures relating to war expenditure to the lowest possible minimum. That is the sort of financial juggling in which the. Government is indulging. Yet it expects the public to accept statements which it places before this House at their face value. The position is appalling. The time has come to disclose the exact position in order to reveal the financial drift in this country as the result of the Government's policy. Last evening the honourable'member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley), in an endeavour to justify the Government's employment policy, claimed that production was increasing. In reply to an interjection by the honourable member for Fawkner Holt), he declared that 500,000 men and women had been transferred from the armed forces and war industries to peace occupations; and he argued that that could not be effected without a corresponding increase of productivity in ' industry. Obviously, the most sensitive ' and accurate barometer of the volume of employment in this country is the pay-roll tax. A study of this barometer shows that production has not increased. No one can dispute the reliability of the payroll tax as a barometer in this respect, because the tax is assessed on wages paid in every industry in Australia and its rate and incidence have notaltered. Of course, honourable members opposite refuse to accept the pay-roll tax as a barometer in this matter. Let us have a look at the pay-roll tax. Collections of pay-roll tax for the full financial year was estimated in the last budget at £11,000,000. Honourable members will recall that during the debate on the budget I pointed out that, apparently, the Government lacked confidence in its ability to provide full employment because the estimate of £11,000,000 in respect of the current 'financial, year was £88,000 less than actual pay-roll tax collections in the preceding twelve months, which amounted to £11,000,000. Hp to the 31st May last, collections of pay-roll tax totalled £10,394,000, whilst collections last month totalled £1,017,000. From these figures it is clear that total collections for the year will be very little in excess of the estimate of £11,000,000. In May, 1945, collections of pay-roll tax totalled £954,000, or only £150,000 less than collections in May of this year. No one can say that these results are evidence of any improvement in the production field; nor are they evidence of the implementation of a sound employment policy. The payroll tax collections tell a clear story. They show that the Government is not effecting the transfer of employees from war occupations to peace-time occupations to the degree that is claimed. The Government, in order to substantiate its claim that this transfer is being effected, must explain what has happened to payroll tax collected from the additional pay envelopes, because pay-roll tax cannot be evaded; But, as I have shown, total (Mr collections of pay-roll tax remained practically static this year compared with total collections for the preceding financial year. In view of this fact, is it any wonder that honourable members on this side of the chamber are concerned about the Governments inability to grapple with this grave problem? Is it any wonder that the people of Australia want to be told the truth about the matter? We must make clear the degree to which the Government has failed to solve the employment problem or to implement its so-called full employment policy. Ex-service personnel will not be satisfied with mere assertions that everything is all right when the facts reveal a very sorry picture indeed. The position is most unsatisfactory from whatever viewpoint we study it . Therefore we demand a full and frank statement on the subject. If the Government made a fran k statement with regard to loan raising it would enable the people to gauge full y the disastrous effects of its financial policy. War expenditure for the first nine months of this non-war year has in fact exceeded that for the corresponding period of last year. Let me compare our position in this respect with that of other countries. There is no excuse for this Government's squandering. Great Britain's last budget indicated that the Estimates of the Service and Supply Departments had been morethan cut in halves. New Zealand has made substantial cuts in war expenditure, and the position in our Sister Dominion is much sounder than it Is in Australia. For instance, war expenditure in New Zealand for the nine months to the 31st December, 1945, was only £52,400,000, whilst expenditure on the fighting services was cat drastically. An amount of £29,700,000 was expended on the Army in 1044-45 compared with only £14,200,000 this year. Both these amounts are exclusive of gratuities. In India, the first victory budget granted the following concessions:Complete exemption from income tax of persons earning up to 4,000 rupeesduring the war the exemption was up to 2,000 rupees; reduction of duty on motor spirit by 20 per cent., and also a reduction of duty on kerosene; special initial depreciation allowance to industry of 20 per cent, on new plant and machinery ; substitution of undistributed profits tax by a dividend tax to encourage the ploughing back of profits into business, which is the direct antithesis to the Australian Government's policy. These concessions can naturally be expected to restore peace-time productivity in India. Contrast them with the Australian policy of high taxation which is stifling industrial recovery to the degree that the standard of living here is gravely impaired. While our customs and sales tax receipts will be more buoyant by £8,000,000 to £9,000,000 than was anticipated, - payroll tax, on the other - hand, will be approximately the same as last year. Although the cost of government is abnormally high, the taxpayer who provides the money is not receiving-efficient service from the administration. I shall cite several examples of administrative ineptitude which could be multiplied many times. The Minister for Labour and National Service informed me by letter dated the 11th February last, that careful consideration had been given to the release of an airman on occupational grounds. This man's application had been refused. This letter was sent by me to a correspondent, who in his reply dated the l o t h February, saidThe Minister would no doubt be much astonished to know that L.A.C. Kidd, F., has been out of the Air Force for some time. He called in at thin office a few days ago and advised us that he secured his discharge some weeks ago. We wonder who it was who was the subject of the Minister's ""'careful consideration"", or what appears more likely was consideration given to anything or any one. The second example is that of a naval dischargee. On the 29th January, last, I was informed by the Minister for Labour and National Service that approval had been given for the release of one of two brothers. This man had been released prior to the notification given to me. However, not a fortnight later, the Minister wrote to me. about the two brothers as follows:I have to advise that after careful consideration of this matter it is regretted it is not possible to recommend that these servicemen be released before their turn under the points system arrives. I could cite dozens of similar cases. I have been placed in a ridiculous position more than once when I have made application for the release of men to return to' farms I have received an adverse reply, only to be told by the farmers concerned that their sons were back on the farms a month or so before their release was refused. I cite these cases to show the lack of co-ordination and defective administration of this Government, whose history is one of monumental bungling and muddling. The third example relates to tractors and other items of surplus goods which, through Governmental inefficiency, have been held in depots for long periods, instead of being distributed and put into production. At a Royal Australian Air Force depot at Morningside, near Brisbane, a row of wheeled tractors was left standing in the same position, exposed to sun and rain, for months. More than 40 new tractors, were, to my knowledge, kept for a long period at a Royal Australian Engineers depot, at Salisbury, doing absolutely nothing, until I wired the Minister for the Army about them. Some were then declared surplus and released for agricultural purposes. At that very time, many inquiries were being made to me by wheat and other farmers urgently requiring tractors for the sowing season, who had been waiting up to two years for them. [Extension of time granted.'] The same state of affairs arose in regard to nails. At the end of December, 1945, when there was not a pound of nails to be had in Brisbane, 424 tons was held in engineer store depots in Queensland, and 316 tons had been declared surplus but was still held in depots. At the same time, 368 tons of corrugated, galvanized iron, was held in those stores, and farmers could not get sheet for roofing milking sheds, and partially completed houses were not habitable for lack of roofs. There were 394 tons of barbed wire, 30 tons of fencing wire, and 194 tons of netting wire held in those stores, some of which were subsequently declared surplus. Total depot stocks of tractors were no fewer than 3S9, of which only 137 were declared surplus in the next three months. My information relates only to Queensland, but if facts were obtained regarding the unnecessary withholding of surplus equipment throughout Australia they would be no less startling. Other examples of governmental ineptitude could be quoted from the report of the Auditor^General for the last financial year, but unfortunately, although it was presented to the Parliament three months ago, it has not yet been printed. Almost every newspaper carries advertisements exhorting the people to be pavers, not spenders, and urging that ilr. Fadden. prices be kept down. A government that makes an appeal like that should be ready to set a good example to those to whom it appeals, but this Government is the greatest spendthrift in the country. It is the most extravagant administration that we have ever had in power. It is time it had a national stocktaking and eliminated waste in the interests of efficiency. The basis of tax reduction is reduction of the need for taxes. That can he achieved only by an efficient administration that eliminates waste, and, in that direction, the Government has fallen down badly. From whatever point the searchlight of investigation is thrown on the Government, it must stand out, even to the least discerning, that its financial policy is a failure and is going from bad to worse. The crying need is to reduce taxes so. that production shall be encouraged, but it is futile even to think of that if expenditure continues to soar, as is shown by the careful analysis that I have made on the meagre information available to me. Debate (on motion by Mr CONELAN) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. COTTON-ROYA L AUSTRALIAN NAVY : ABSENCE WITHOUT LEAVE PENALTIES.

75,Mr FRANCIS,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"Moreton) [3.41] - I take this, opportunity to direct the attention of the Government ,to its inordinate delay in reaching a decision on the aid to be given to the Queensland cotton growing industry. Thirteen months ago, at the request of the Queensland Cotton Board, the Government had an investigation made ,of the cotton-growing industry. In spite of the many representations made to it by me and other honourable members on this side .of the House, and in spite of the months that have passed since that investigation was made, the Government has neglected to announce its policy. For about twenty years the price of raw cotton has been governed by Commonwealth legislation. Owing to the inroads tfiat the demands of war made on labour supplies, production of cotton has fallen considerably. The unavailability of commodities required for the expansion of the industry has also contributed to the decline of the industry. If the industry is to be stimulated, as it must be, positive action must be taken at once by the Government to announce and apply a policy of development. I hope that the new Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator J. M . Fraser) will immediately examine the report made as the result of that thirteen-month-old inquiry and let the Parliament know the decision of the Government before we go on the hustings. The cotton-growers are keenly critical of the Government's dilatoriness. Their crop is one of the few which, like tobacco, offer scope for secondary as well as primary production in Queensland. It was recently stated on behalf of the textile industry of Australia that 40 per cent, of Australia's requirements of cotton goods could be manufactured locally, and that that would require the annual production of 225,000 bales of raw cotton. Tn the next twelve months the market requirements of Australian cotton mills will be at least 120,000 bales of raw cotton, but, unless the price that the cotton growers are to receive for their product is announced soon, there will be no possibility of that quantity being grown in Australia. The cotton-producing industry throughout the world is in a difficult position, and manufacturers of cotton textiles in this country-will have great difficulty in obtaining supplies of raw cotton. Production of cotton in the United States of America has fallen to its lowest level for 25 years. During the year just .concluded the output was S,900,000 bales, compared with an average of 12,000,000 bales for the last twenty-five years. Any surplus of American cotton that may he available, for export will be of the poorest quality, and probably only 5 per cent, of it will be of any use in the cotton textile industry. The position in India, too, is serious, and the Indian Government has placed an embargo upon the export from that country of any cotton other than manufactured cotton goods. India is making a great effort to expand its secondary industries, and will require all the raw cotton that it can produce. If we do not develop the cotton-growing industry in Australia our cotton textile industry may go out of existence with resulting wide-spread unemployment. Throughout the world, production of cotton materials for wearing apparel is diminishing, and we should not lose this opportunity to establish the cotton-growing industry in this country on a sound footing. Prior to the war, Australia imported £15,000,000 worth of cotton materials annually. These materials constituted the biggest single item in our tariff schedule, and could be manufactured in this country if adequate supplies of raw cotton were available. During the next twelve months, Australia will 'require 120,000 bales of raw cotton, practically all of which will have to be imported, entailing an expenditure outside of Australia, of approximately £5,000,000. Much of that cotton could have been produced by Australian cotton growers during the last three years had proper attention been paid to the industry in this country. It is imperative that there be no further delay in reaching a decision on the future of the Australian cotton-growing industry. Cotton-growers and manufacturers should be taken into the confidence of the Government, and, with the least possible delay, legislation should be introduced into this Parliament guaranteeing at least the price that has been paid for locally produced cotton in the past, or the price recommended in the report, whichever is the higher. I understand that this period of the present session of Parliament will be short. If that is so, an announcement of the Government's policy - if it has a policy-toward s the cotton industry should be made immediately, so that the cotton interests will have an opportunity to confer with the Government, or make representations in this House, before legislation implementing the Government's policy is prepared. It is unfair to toy with this big industry as the Government is doing at present. Again I appeal for a. prompt examination of the report, and for an early announcement of a guaranteed price for raw cotton. Tn addition to the production of raw coicon, cotton-growers in this country provide large quantities of edible' oils and stock feed of high protein content for the dairying industry. In droughtaffected areas of Queensland today by-products of the cotton-growing industry are proving of great value in helping to keep stock alive. This industry is essential to the development of other primary industries, and consequently, to the expansion of secondary industries. Cotton is also a most important product in time of war. I make a final appeal to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) to ensure, without further delay, that this very important industry shall be given the fullest information on the Government's policy towards it.",46
76,Mr MCEWEN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"Indi) [3.50] - I bring to the notice of the House an injustice suffered by a young former naval rating. I have chosen to raise this matter in the Parliament rather than with the Minister for the Navy (Mr Makin) privately, because the injustice arises, not out of an administrative act, but out of a set of regulations. If it be agreed that this young man has suffered an injustice, it may well be that many others similarly situated have suffered the same injustice, and I propose to ask that if the case, as I . shall present it, be there should be an alteration of the regulations, and a change of government policy to eliminate what I am sure honourable members will agree with me is an intolerable state of affairs. I shall not mention now the name of the young man concerned, but I shall supply it later to the Minister for the Navy. The man enlisted in the Navy at the age of seventeen years, and served for a period of three years, returning to Sydney last December from service in enemy waters north of Australia. That, of course, was some time after the war had ended. He was then twenty years of age. He states that he applied for leave to visit his home, not having had leave for this purpose for eighteen months. His application was refused, - so he absented himself without leave and visited his home which is situated in a country town - in my electorate. After about fourteen days he rejoined his ship which had moved to Melbourne- a fact which he was aware. He returned voluntarily and reported to his ship. He was apprehended and held for eight days pending the hearing of charges laid against him. Upon conviction he was fined £1 a pay for the ensuing six months - I am not quite sure what the pay period is. In addition, he was informed that he would be granted no further leave during that six months. He received his discharge from the Navy in April last and he informs me that his discharge certificate bears no record of bad character, his conduct sheet being marked "" V.G."" and "" G "", which I assume, mean "" very good "" and "" good "". But he found that all of the deferred pay which had accrued to him prior to his going absent without leave had been cancelled. He forfeited £75. That was the penalty which was imposed upon him for having gone fourteen days absent without leave after the war had ended. In my opinion the penalty was outrageously severe, but apparently provision for the imposition of such a fine is made in certain regulations of the Royal Australian Nayy. So far as I am able to discover, this kind of penalty is not imposed upon Army and Air Force personnel for a similar offence ",48
77,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"It would have been better for him had he been correct, one of the Minister for the Army's "" desertets "".",48
78,Mr MCEWEN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"Yes . A few days ago the Minister for the Army (Mr Forde) stated that he believed that a .serviceman was entitled to his deferred pay for the service which he had performed, and I assume tihat the right honourable gentleman was speaking as Minister for the Army, and not as''Minister for Defence. To illustrate how harshly such a regulation can bear upon a serviceman I shall inform the Minister for the Navy of some of the family history of the lad. I have here a letter written to me. by the president of the branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia in the country town in which this lad's home is situated. The official wroteThe following personal particulars about might help you. His father was accidentally killed, leaving a widow and seven children. Four children were put into a home. of Victor was then under five years of age and at twelve and a half years was boaTded out to work at farm at IJaliarat. He milked thirteen cows night and morning. His wages for the first year were L2s. (irl. a week, second year 15s. and year 17s. (id. The pocket money allowed was - is. (5d. a week. At sixteen he left the farm and joined the Jfavy voluntarily. Victor had not seen his brothers since they parted and were sent to various homes. We can vouch for the foregoing statement - as the family were close neighbours. The official proceeded to give the history of other members of the family. Four or five of the lads joined the services. One, who was taken prisoner at Tobruk, escaped from Italy into Switzerland and returned to service here. Two other brothers were taken prisoner toy the Japanese. One died in captivity, and the other was a prisoner in Changi camp. Two other step-brothers joined the services. This lad stated that he had not seen his brothers since they all went into the services. Months after the cessation of hostilities, three years after he commenced tiis active service and eighteen months after he had had any home leave he asked for leave so that he could see those of his brothers who had been released from imprisonment. When his application was refused he decided to take leave. At first, he took one week's leave, but as one of his brothers had not then returned the lad waited for a few more days until the brother returned. As soon as he had seen him he. returned voluntarily to his ship, and reported within an hour of the vessel berthing at Melbourne. That is a very human story. The lad has forfeited the only money that he has ever had the chance to retain. I know that the Minister for the Navy bears none of the responsibility for this penalty, which was imposed under the regulations, but I submit to the honourable gentleman, who is a very human person, that this is a very sad story. The penalty which has been inflicted on the lad should be corrected. In addition, the regulations should be reviewed because a common policy should pertain to servicemen regardless of the uniform that they wore during' rhe war. It is the policy of the Government and the wish of this Parliament that deferred pay shall be paid to servicemen. Service offences should be punished by service penalties, and not by such an alteration of government policy as will , near bear harshly on a man who served in one branch of the forces whilst leaving unthird affected a man who offended in a similar or even worse manner but who wore a different uniform. I shall hand to the Minister the name and number of this lad, and hope that the honourable gentleman will see that the penalty is removed.",48
79,Mr HUTCHINSON,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"Deakin) [4.0] I direct attention to a matter of unusual importance. It relates to an amount of £7,000,000, which has accumulated in the Central Wool Committee's hands to date. That sum, it is expected, will be somewhat greater by the end of June next. To explain this matter, I must first point out that these moneys have no relation to moneys that arose out of the war-time wool agreement between the United Kingdom and Australia. When war broke put, the price of Australian wool was substantially below the cost of production. Knowing that wool would be an important war commodity, the Menzies government approached the British Government to enter into a scheme which would mean that the entire Australian wool clip would be lifted at a certain price. The British Government at the time offered a price somewhat higher than the ruling Australian level of prices, but still an unpayable price. Undoubtedly the idea behind the British Government's offer was that, being engaged in a war which it knew would be very costly, it did not desire to buy commodities at too high a price, as a portion of the price would be subject to war-time inflation of values. Lengthy discussions took place between the two governments. Eventually, the then Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, cabled direct to the Prime Minister of Great Britain pointing out that Australia could not embark upon a major war while the commodity most responsible for its economy was on an unpayable basis. The result was that the British Government gave to Australia a price representing an increase of approximately 35 per cent, on the levels of values, then ruling. In that agreement, there were also two other factors. First, the agreement was open to further adjustment, and prices would be increased if that became necessary. Secondly, any profits derived from the sale of these wools to foreign countries . would he shared between the Australian and British governments. I emphasize the word "" governments "". Later the price was raised to approximately 15£d. per lb - the average for the entire Australian clip. Although the profits arising from the sales of wool to foreign countries were to he shared between the British and Australian Governments, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture Menzies Government made it plain on the 22nd November, 1939 that-the Commonwealth's share would be paid to the Australian wool-growers in proportion to their contributions to the wool scheme during its operation. Again on the 17th November, 1942 the then Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, stated that it would not be possible to take an account of the profits until the purchase arrangement was wound up, but in reply to a question', he said, that the Australian of the profits would be distributedamong the growers in proportion to their contributions to the whole scheme during its operations. fore, a definite assurance was given by both the Menzies Government and the Curtin Government that a share of the profits arising from sales to foreign countries would be handed over to Australian wool-growers on a proportional basis. The old appraisement scheme has been terminated and a new method of marketing has begun. This new method entails ajoint organization with subsidiaries in the Dominions, the subsidiary body in> Australia 'being the Australian Wool Realization Committee. Because of certain factors which are well known to honourable members, there was a total profit of about £20,000,000 in hand at the time when the old appraisement scheme was terminated. This profit arose from sales of wool by Great Britain to foreign coUn-' tries, and Australia's share amounted to £10,000,000. A distribution could not be made at that time, because the final profit could not be determined until the last bale of accumulated stocks had been sold. Under the new scheme, Australia bought into the £100,000,000 stock-pile with its share of the profits and with £30,000,000 advanced by the Commonwealth Government. This represented a half-share in the accumulated stock-pile of between Mr Hutchinson. 10,000,000 and 11,000,000 bales. By this means, the £10,000,000 accrued profit was merged into the new scheme. Under this scheme, the Commonwealth Government and the British Government will share any resultant loss or profit. However, the cost of any interest charges involved in buying into the stock-pile or of any wool bought in by the joint organization, or its subsidiary in Australia, to preserve a rein the serve price will be borne by Australian wool-growers, who also will be required to pay one-half of the administration costs. I come, now to the fund of approximately £7,000,000 that has been accumulated by the Central Wool Committee, which will be replaced by the Australian Wool Realization Committee. This fund has accumulated under different headings. The first heading is the flat rate adjustshare ment on skin wools, and the amount that has accumulated on this account _ is £2,400,000. Under the war-time appraisement scheme, there was a table of limits There- according to which wools were appraised. If , at the end of the vear, the average wool price received by a grower was not equivalent to the flat rate paid by the British Government an adjustment was made to increase his. cheque to that amount. With skin wools there was no flat rate adjustment. They were sold according to the table of limits only. Therefore there was a difference between the price paid according to the table of limits and. the ultimate flat rate price paid by the British Government, which today amounts to £2,400,000. The next heading under which money has been accumulated is the deferred price paid in 'respect of the wool content of manufactured goods exported from Australia. The total under this heading is £1,550,000. Wool sold to the Australian manufacturers was not covered by the agreement. It was sold to the manufacturers at a price somewhat lower than the agreement price. The grower was paid according to the table of limits, as distinct from the flat rate adjustment. When the manufacturers made that wool into cloth and exported the cloth, they made a deferred payment to the Central Wool Committee. By this means the total price paid for the woo] was brotight up to the equivalent of the export issue price. The third heading is the surplus derived from wool tops, noils and waste. When the agreement was entered into, wool tops, noils and waste were subject to control in Australia, and the Central Wool Committee allowed to top-makers the cost of raw wool used to manufacture tops, plus interest and other charges, including a charge for combing, which returned to the top-makers a reasonable margin of profit. In other words, the wool was made available to the top-makers, their costs were considered, and they were allowed a charge for combing and a reasonable margin of profit. If these wools were exported, any surplus was again paid into the Central Wool Committee's fund. This has accumulated over the years into a surplus of approximately £2,700,000. Thus, the moneys accumulated in the CentralWool Committee's fund are approximately £2,400,000 for skin-wools, £1,550,000 in respect of the deferred price on the wool content of goods exported, and £2,700,000, which is the surplus arising out of the control of tops, noils and waste, making a grand total of about £7,000,000. The balance of the £7,000,000 is made up of interest payments in respect of funds invested by the Central Wool Committee. This large amount may be substantially increased by the end of June next. The Government recently stated that this money would not go into Consolidated Revenue. It represents profits derived from Australian wool produced during the war, as apart from wool appraised under the appraisement scheme that existed between the Australian Government and the British Government. The Government has decided that this money shall be used for promotion of the use of wool and research into the wool industry, so that the industry will benefit in' the long run. A statement to that effect was made by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction in this House in* April of this year. However, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture recently said that no definite decision has been made as to the use of the money and that wool growers' organizations would be taken into consultation' before means of expending the fund were decided upon. There is a substantial difference between the two statements. A difference of opinion between the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction is not unusual. I trust that a great deal of consideration will be given to this matter before any definite decision .is made, and I certainly hope that every major wool-growers' organization in Australia will be asked to express an opinion before any distribution of the fund is made. The money rightly belongs to the wool-growers of Australia. It represents approximately one-tenth of the value of a very large Australian clip. The forthcoming clip is expected to yield between £70,000,000 'and £80,000,000. This money would be very welcome to Australian wool-growers, in view of the fact that costs rose alarmingly during the war years, that they are still producing on the basis of the values that existed during the 1st World War-- a basis on which no other industry in this country is conducting its operations; nor could it-and that .the most calamitous drought in Australian history has occurred during the last two years. [Extension of time granted.] If . it is to be expended on research, the question arises: How quickly could it be spent? Persons having same knowledge of the technical processes of wool production, and possessing other necessary qualifications, would have to be engaged and trained. Therefore, a great deal of delay would occur. Another point arises. Last year, this House passed a bill dealing with wool use promotion and research. Under that legislation, the wool-grower voluntarily taxed himself to provide approximately £350,000 per annum for that purpose, and the Government contributed an equal amount. The money was to be raised , on the basis of a fixed amount a bale. Therefore, the amount raised would rise or fall according to the size of the clip. The total amount to be derived by. this means, together with the Government contribution, was approximately £650,0.00 a year. That is a large expenditure on wool use promotion and research by a country like Australia. Is the £7,000,000 previously mentioned also to be devoted to that purpose; if so, is the present collection of funds to be tinued concurrently with the expenditure of it? I suggest that this £7,000,000 be not used for the purpose of wool use promotion - and research. moneys raised under* the provisions of the Wool Use Promotion Act are sufficient for that purpose. If they are not, the matter can be re-examined by the Government and the wool-growing interests. A satisfactory agreement could be made. This £7,000,000 should be distributed among wool-growers on a pro rata basis. That is the basis which the Menzies and Curtin Governments had in mind, with profits arising out of the appraisement scheme, and is the right method to adopt. The .expenditure of such a huge amount . on wool use promotion and research would - occupy a lengthy period, because of the lack of trained personnel. After all, the wool-growers have upheld the war economy of this country as they previously upheld its economy in times of peace. Mr BLAIN"" (Northern Territory) [4.20] - I rise to bring before the House, and particularly the Government, the necessity for placing cotton-growing on an economic basis in this country. I speak particularly for North Australia, because of the suitability of its soil and the fact that it has been neglected for so long. Honourable .members must realise , that in 1938 the Tariff Board more or - less killed the cotton industry in Queensland, and prevented its development in the Northern Territory, because the subsidy paid to it was not sufficient to it on an economic basis. In 1941, the cotton-growers received a guaranteed price of about 4-M. per lb. for ordinary seed cotton, which was equivalent to about 12$d. per lb. for raw cotton. During 1943 and 1944, world parity was such that no subsidy was paid. It would appear that in 1945 the Commonwealth again came to the rescue in a small measure. But the agreement then made terminated at the end of last December. The cotton-growers of Queensland have not a guaranteed ""price, and are in the dark as to what is the policy of the Government in regard to the industry. Tunderstand that when they made representations the Government foolishly con- asked the Tariff Board, which had killed the industry in 1938, to make a further report. All.that I am now asking is that the Government shall let us know what is The to be its policy, and in what terms the Tariff Board has reported. We can guess what they will be. That body will naturally restate the opinions that it expressed in 1938. It is time the - Government made a decision on its own account, and discarded the report ""of the Tariff Board. The neglect of the northern part of Australia, and particularly the Northern Territory, for so long, is a serious matter. Gibes have been hurled at the territory in the past. Those days have now departed, because I have 60,000 ambassadors in the persons of ex-servicemen who have been there and know that it possesses something that is worthwhile, not only in the mining and cattle industries, but also in the agricultural industry. In the growing of cotton lies the secret of the development of the north of Australia, provided an irrigation policy be pursued. . At the present time, the waters of its rivers run away to the ocean. I am pleased to have gained in Queensland keen supporters whom I have met only recently. A fortnight ago' I had a. long conversation with the Queensland Minister for Lands, Mr Jones, who is very keen on the adoption of an irrigation policy for that State. I nominated certain rivers, about which those who live in the south seem to have very little knowledge. At the headwaters of the Bowen, which flows into the Burdekin, there is excellent soil, and a site for dams which I surveyed when I was serving my articles place ii: 1920. Parts of the north are almost unexplored, and little is known about them from an agricultural stand-point. Engineering investigations are to be made immediately on that river. I urge particularly the advantages of the Katherine River. I know that the Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson) is interested in the Orel River. If on those three rivers great weirs were built to bestride the far north from west to east,'we should have something there which would be worthwhile for the growing of cotton for our country. We should not then need to import it. I admit that there is at present a surplus of 11,000,000 bales of cotton in the world-r-throughout India, in some parts of Africa, and in Kenya colony. On the 9th May complete last the Indian Government proof hibited the export of cotton. Preto viously, they had exported only the best cotton, - which had been grown under irrigation condition's. They have now prohibited the export of inferior cotton. Australian manufacturers' do not want any of this 11,000,000 bales of surplus cotton, and will not use it. Our producfeatures tion in 1,940 was only about 16,000 ment bales, but there is a market in this country for 120,000 bales, and the north is waiting to be developed. It seems most desirable that the industry should be placed on economic basis. Our tropical areas which we have despised far too long should used for the development of the industry. The Government should immediately irrigate country for cotton growing by the erection of dams across the northern rivers to which I have referred, and consult the Government of Queensland regarding its policy in that matter. I hope that the Minister for the Interior will be able to give a guarantee that the new Administrator of the Northern Terriin tory, who goes to Darwin on the 1st July next, will consider the irrigation scheme to which I have referred an undertaking entitled to a No. 1 priority.",49
80,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"Barker) an [4.27] - This morning I pointed out that the subject of jute supplies is of utmost importance to the wheat, wool request. and sugar industries, and that according to a report furnished to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) from our Trade Commissioner in India., an average of six annas of the basic acreage in Bengal in 1940 is likely to licensed this year for jute-growing. That statement is unintelligible to anybody having no knowledge of Indian affairs. If it means that the acreage to be is to bear the same ratio to the 1940 crop consolidated revenue. as six annas bears to one rupee, I suspicion that the outlook for the indusand tries dependent on jute supplies is poor indeed. Two Australian officers, one associated with the Army and one with the Royal Australian Air Force, engaged on mission in Java, were shot by some of the rebels up there, although it is generous to describe them merely as rebels. So far as I can gather, there is lack of information on the part the Government as to what is proposed be done about the matter. I do not know whether it is part.of the new order in governmental relations that Australian citizens on government duty in another country can be shot down or hacked to pieces withoutthe Government worrying about them. One of the fundamental of the foreign policy of a governis that at least it should exercise its power to protect its own citizens when they are in foreign countries. The names - of the men to .whom I refer are MCDonald an and MCKenzie. I shall be glad to hear what the Government has to say regarding be them, and after that we can decide what other steps may be necessary.",53
81,Mr BERNARD CORSER,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"Wide Bay) [4.31] - Primar y producers suffered during the war through the fixation of prices of many commodities including butter, and cheese. Instead of getting a reasonable price for their butter they received a sum much below the cost of production, order to provide cheap butter for the peojde of Australia - Later, the Government, on being asked for an increased price, gave a subsidy to the butter industry, and since that time it has asked the Government of Great Britain to pay increased price for the butter received by it from Australia. The Government of the the Mother Country. acceded to that The last budget showed £1,000,000 as receipts from this source for the ensuing year. I drew.attention to this item during the debate and claimed that the amount would be at least £2,000,000. Now I believe that the Gobe vernment is in receipt of-£2,500,000 from the Government of Great Britain as the result of extra, payments for butter over a period of two years, and ' that sown this amount has been paid into, The Governhave a ment should reconsider the matter decide whether this money should not be paid to the producers of the butter who are struggling in the hope that the Government will provide them with a return a little nearer the cost of produca tion than the present price If the present drought continues much longer more than half of the dairying districts will produce only one-half as much butter as was obtained at this time last year. The Government should send experts, in the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, to the drought-stricken dairying and grazing districts of Australia, in order to secure information as to the conditions under which the primary producers are labouring owing to drought and the meat strike. It should adopt an Australian-wide policy in the matter of searching for water supplies, damming small rivers and creeks, and distributing heavy earth-shifting machinery for that purpose. It should also promote the carrying-out of ""larger irrigation schemes, in order to minimize general drought losses. Under existing conditions,. the Government should arrange for the purchase of stock feed and the transport of stock from one district to another, because ' of the. shortage of railway rolling-stock consequent upon the reduced coal supplies. The Government should ascertain the amount of loss it could prevent, and the development that could be induced by a policy of that kind. During the debate on the budget I urged the Government to obtain some of the eartih-shifting machinery which had been offered to them by the United States of America and held in the islands, and to make available to. local governing authorities, ex-servicemen others for the damming of creeks and rivers for irrigation purposes .and for watering stock. However, nothing has been done. New Zealand has now bought millions of pounds' worth of this machinery which was lying in New Guinea and other islands, with the result that productivity of the land where they are now operating in New Zealand will be increased enormously. Land now unproductive will be settled by ex-servicemen. This is a matter of the very - greatest importance, and I ask the Government to have inquiries made now with a view to obtaining some of this machinery if more is available.",53
82,Mr MAKIN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"Hindmarsh-Minister for the Navy, Minister for Munitions and Minister for Aircraft Production) [4.37]. --in reply-At question time - today, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Harrison) asked me a question relating to the report that certain persons associated with the trial of war criminals in Tokyo had either resigned or had threatened to resign. The present trial which is taking place in Tokyo is based upon the indictment of 26 major Japanese war criminals drawn up by an international board of prosecutors appointed by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers. This prosecuting section, in which Australia has actively participated, consists of well known legal advocates of various countries, and their findings are the result of a prolonged and exhaustive inquiry into the available evidence concerning the war guilt of former leaders of military and political life in Japan. The trial is being held before an international tribunal of distinguished judges in accordance with proper standards of international justice and equity. The indictment of the war criminals was lodged with the international tribunal on the 29th April, and the defendants were arraigned before the court on the 3rd May. A month's adjournment was then granted to enable the preparation of the defence, and the tribunal re-assembled on the 3rd June. I have no official information concerning the reported resignation of certain of the defence counsel in the trial. However, I have instituted inquiries on this matter, and immediately the information is availand able the honourable member will be informed. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain) referred to the cotton industry in Australia. I shall bring their remarks to the notice of the Ministers concerned. The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) asked that funds held by the Central Wool Committee should be distributed to w ool-growers. I shall bring r his suggestion to thenotice of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Scully) with a view to seeing what can be done. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) asked for information about the production of jute in India. An effort will be made to obtain the information which he seeks. The Government has been very much concerned over the murder of members of the Australian mission which was sent to Java. Everything is being done to ensure that the guilty persons are hended, and Judge Kirby was sent, to Netherlands East Indies to make inquiries, and to collect information would lead to the conviction of the persons responsible for this dastardly act. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) can he assured that I shall bring his remarks on the dairying indussubject try to the notice of the Minister for merce and Agriculture. I shall also have inquiries made regarding the possibility of obtaining earth-shifting machinery as he suggested, and he will be informed the result of the inquiry. I appreciate that any one possessing human sympathies must be filled with compassion upon hearing particulars of the case presented this afternoon by the honourable member for Indi (Mr two MCEwen). However, as the honourable member himself pointed out, procedure in these matters is governed by statutory regulations which have been confirmed the Parliament. Careful consideration must be given to the matter by those sponsible for naval discipline. Personally, 1 think that the case mentioned is one which might be further reviewed. _ point out, however, that I would not any account interfere in. time of war any regulation dealing with discipline. Those who would go absent without leave and desert from their posts when their country is in peril fail gravely duty. I recognize that the incident mentioned did not occur during the war, but it is not practicable to make one set regulations dealing with war-time condihe tions and another for peace-time condiyears, tions - I understand that the position regard to deferred pay is different in Navy from that in the other services that, in the Navy, the deferred pay was incorporated in the actual pay. Actually, there is a graduated scale, and tem of payment is entirely different from deferred pay. The payment is really the nature of a recognition of good conduct, and is wrongly expressed in regulations as ""deferred pay"". I have indicated to the Naval Board that lation 51 (4) providesthe designation might well be altered with a view to making it perfectly clear that instead of this payment being regarded as a right it shall apprein future be known for what it the really is- a payment for good conduct.",54
83,Mr RANKIN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,Did the men get which deferred pay before the war ?,55
84,Mr MAKIN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"I understand so; but, as I have had supplied to me two sets of figures which do not appear to agree, I wish to have further information on the - before giving a definite reply. ComI shall give further consideration to the matter in order that I may check certain aspects which at the moment are not - clear. I repeat that for a man to desert of his ship or be absent from it without leave is an extremely serious matter. When a nation is at war such action might render a vessel immobile and endanger the lives of all on board. The naval authorities say that there are fewer such cases in the navy than in the other fighting services - Men who are giving good service, in the navy, would, I think, be perturbed if the present method of payment were altered. They are most by jealous of their rights and privileges. But there may be good reasons for comrepassionate treatment in some cases. As this matter has been brought to my notice at different times by the honourable memI bers for Moreton (Mr Francis), Newon castle (Mr Watkins), Balaclava (Mr. with White), and Indi (Mr MCEwen), I shall certainly give further consideration to it with a view to .making an adjustment should it be found that there has been in their unduly harsh treatment.",55
85,Mr MCEWEN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"The naval regulations provide that a seaman may have his misof demeanour expunged from the records if serves for a further period of five three years of which are regarded in as good service. Obviously that regulathe tion is designed to apply to permanent in naval men, and possibly men who served only for the duration of the war might not qualify under it. The point is howthe sysever, worthy of consideration.",55
86,Mr MAKIN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"Certain discretionary in powers are vested in the Naval Board, and I shall ask that body to recognize the that in some instances they should be exercised to show leniency.

That regulation has been in existence for about 35 years, but, of course, that does not mean that like the laws of the Medes and Persians, it cannot be altered.

105,Mr MAKIN,LABOUR COUNCIL OF NEW SOUTH,"The answers to the nonorable, member's questions are as follows:1. Yes, as it is the most suitable site aOJe for such an establishment. 2. (a) It is already planned .to base a H/B. Wing . at Amberley. (6) Considerations of efficiency and economy' make it desirable that the Air. Armament School form a part of a Royal Australian Air Force station on which. is also based a H/B. Conversion Unit, Fighter Conversion Unit and the Air Navigation ' School, (c) It is essential for such a specialist school to be located as near as .possible to Royal Australian - Air Force Head-quarters because it is through such a Bchool that new equipment is introduced into the service, (d) Climate at East Sale offers a variety of weathers, which is. essential for given advanced flying training, (e) Amberley canDarwin not accommodate both H/B. Wing and Air Armament School and the H / B . Wing is planned to be located there for strategic reasons. (/) For reasons of economy of control it is planned to administer all training to have units from Southern Area. (g) The best ranges for bombing and gunnery practices are already available in the Sale area. Sea areas and waste-land are being utilized. Those arc not available in Amberley area. type gunnery range for turret gunnery training is inetalledat East Sale. The cost of transfer of this range to Amberley would alone between Morotai approximate £25,000. 3. Amberley has hangars large enough for Liberators and other large aircraft. Hangarsat East Sale are not sufficiently large .to house lost rjiberatnrs, but armament equipment at East Sale is more suitable than that available at Amberley. 4. The climate at East Sale is very suitable for advanced training. It is undesirable to have an unlimited amount of fine weather as Air pupils would become experienced only in these conditions. It is essential that pupils be trained to operate in variable weather. 5. Yes, and it is being utilized by basing a H/B. Wing there. East Sale station was originally constructed for training purposes has better lecture room facilities than G. (a) Ranges in Amberley' area are not suitable for the use of all types of ammunition intended to be used for. training in the postof war air force. No suitable site for a rocket range exists in the Amberley area, (b) Distances between ranges and Amberley are great and for economy it is essential that ranges be close to training unit, (c) It' is considered to be impossible to-locate a radar bombing area near gunAmberley. These facilities are either in existence at East Sale or can be made ready with a - minimum of cost and labour. 7. Before taking decision to establish the .Armament School at East Sale! the suitability and adaptability of other Royal Australian Air Force stations (including Amberley) foT such purposes were fully examined. In .view of the reasons given in Nos. 1 .to 6, East Sale - was Anally selected as the most suitable from all view-points (including administrative, availtraining, economy, and the existing facilities available).",59
