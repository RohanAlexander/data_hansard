The humble petition of undersigned volunteer firemen attached to the New South Wales Fire Brigade Service respectfully That the volunteer firemen of the New South Wales Fire Brigades are performing an essential community service suburban and country towns by providing low cost fire proBenefit tection and in sacrificing their leisure and rest hours to form this essential service, are being subjected to severe financial loss by having to pay income which under the present taxation system discourages most individuals from having two jobs. That the present situation has resulted a large number of volunteer firemen because of the effects taxation, leaving a number of fire brigades under strength and areluctanceof potential recruits to pay exessive taxation.

The petition of the underBy-Election signed citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That many pensioners who are holders of the Pensioners Health Benefit Card, have suffered undue hardship as inmates of private nursing homes, because the Federal Government subsidy was insufficient to meet the charges as laid down.

7,Mr JARMAN,UNEMPLOYED IN VICTORIA,I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. Has the Minister noted that the Salvation Army and other voluntary agencies in Victoria which have been providing emergency aid to families of people out of work because of the have. power strike have depleted their funds? Is the Minister able to give any assistance to voluntary agencies to provide emergency funds?,15

The Minister for Social Selatest curity has been in discussion with her State September colleague in Victoria, the Honourable Brian cent or less?quarter Dixon, and the Victorian Government decided to contribute $50,000 pose. The $100,000 will be made available immediately. The Commonwealth Department of Social Security is working with the State partment to determine the distribution of those funds for people in necessitous circumstances as a result of the deplorable strike in Victoria. NA SERVICE: ADVERTISING",16
9,Mr FITZPATRICK,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT,"I ask the Minister for ployment and Industrial Relations: Is it a fact that the Government is spending $lm on an ployment advertising campaign, as reported in the Press last week? What is the justification for campaign which advertises the services of the Commonwealth Employment Service during period of record levels of unemployment, with only one job vacancy for every 16 unemployed persons? Would the money not have been spent on creating more than 100 jobs?",16
10,Mr STREET,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT,"The honourable gentleman really answered half his question when he referred to the present employment and vacancy situation. The Government has already anup nounced that this year it will be spending $100m on training schemes, with particular attention being devoted to schemes for young people. It has also said that if opportunities available and people meet the labour market teria, finance will be no Umit to the number people who can be assisted. The present advertising campaign is directed principally at employers to make them aware of the assistance that is available to them for training people to create more vacancies so that more opportuniAffairs: ties can be provided, particularly for young people. I am surprised at the honourable gentleCanberra man suggesting that there is something improper in this. I can think of no better way in which get more young people into jobs than to get them into productive employment associated with were training for a skill which they previously did not NA NA",16
11,Mr CHAPMAN,INDUSTRY,Does the Minister for Conrepresentations on builders in the Has the the consumer price index figure will show that the rate of increase in the cost of Uving for the has been held to three per has also good news is reflectedMinister Can the say whether this in the building and confor the same purstruction industry?,16
12,Mr MCLEAY,INDUSTRY,"I thank the honourable gentledeman for his question. Yes, I have read that report. I hope that situation occurs and that if it does the Treasurer will get the credit for it. Some figures were released just a few days ago-o n Tuesday to be exact-in respect of the increase in the cost of building materials which I think are relevant. Those figures show that for the 12 Emmonths to September the rate of increase in building materials in the non-residential section emof the building industry was less than 10 per cent; in fact it was 9.6 percent. That should mean a that by the end of the financial year we can get down to a rate of between 7 per cent and 8 per a cent. That is a tremendous achievement, especially when we recall that when Labor was in office the rate hit 20 per cent. In fact during better 1974-75 it was 22.9 per cent. There is another interesting indicator in the number of building approvals in the non-residential sector. It shows that the seasonally adjusted figures for the 8 months to August are by 20.9 per cent. Of course it is when building about approvals are translated into building commencements that the construction industry benefits. Thesefiguresare much higher than they are were when Labor was in government. I think it is crireasonable to say that the Government's econof omic poUcies are now reaUy starting to work. NA NA and Mr UREN-I ask the Minister for Foreign Did a delegation of the most senior Papua New Guinea departmental heads visit recently for discussions about Australian aid to Papua New Guinea? Is it a fact that to Australian officials of relatively junior rank represented Australia at the talks and that they unwilling or unable to discuss the aid issue effectively? Did the Papua New Guinea delegation leave angry and frustrated by this snub? Further, I ask whether the Minister intends to make a statement to the House about a recent incident where a Joint IntelUgence Organisation agent approached an Austrahan academic in Papua New Guinea to spy against that country? Will that officer be withdrawn from Papua New Guinea? Will the Minister investigate and take action on these incidents which have caused a further rupture in relations between Papua New Guinea and Australia?  again. We had all sorts of conscience baring and moral hand washing in the House quite some months ago by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on questions of foreign poUcy when he sat subservient and silent over incidents that occurred near to Australia and took a totally different line once he went into Opposition. Now, on a question concerning Papua New Guinea, he tries to imply that the relationship has been ruptured. It was the action of his Party when in government in 1975 which led to the most disjointed and disappointed series of talks on the side of Papua New Guinea on aid questions shortly prior to or shortly after the date for independence when Papua New Guinea was seeking to determine its budgetary allocation for the period immediately after independence. Talks at Kirribilli in 1975 stay in the minds of officials and Ministers of Papua New Guinea to this day and will do so for a long time hence. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Nonsense .  sition knows the scars that were created then. He knows that when we came into government we immediately held talks with Papua New Guinea. We worked out afive-yearagreement with Papua New Guinea, and that agreement has been hailed by Mr Julius Chan and others-Mr Chan, I remind the House, is the Acting Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea at the moment - as an example for other donor countries to follow. The agreement was reached in an atmosphere of appreciation of the way in which Australia was responding to Papua New Guinea's requests and not imposing its own views. It has been hailed by the Papua New Guinea Government successively in international forums. I refer now to the matter that was raised in relation to recent talks on aid. There were official talks to see whether it was possible to reach agreement on an update of the formula determined only early last year. In other words the Papua New Guinea Government, appreciative of the certainty that is inbuilt into the agreement on aid, was nevertheless proposing a further form of agreement that could be utilised over the remaining three-year period of that agreement. Following the talks, Mr Barry Holloway, the new Minister for Finance, was in Australia this week attending a seminar which I addressed and which he addressed on Sunday and which I addressed again on Monday. He and I had talks. We have agreed that we will have further discussions on thefigurefor the third year of this current five-year agreement and that we will also have further discussions in regard to the fourth andfifthyear of the agreement. The Minister for Finance indicated to me that he was perfectly happy with this arrangement. Papua New Guinea has changed, as honourable members will be aware, to a financial year based on the calendar year. So it is essential that we give that country a reading for the allocation from Australia, probably by the end of November, so that it can have its effective budgetaryfinalisationinto December. We have also agreed to give Papua New Guinea certainty for further discussions on the formula for the fourth andfifthyears. There is no doubt that this is most satisfactory to Papua New Guinea. The Minister indicated that to me. It is satisfactory from our point of view. It is a further update of an agreement which, as I say, was hailed by Papua New Guinea. What is contained in the question of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition bears no resemblance to the facts of the discussion between the Finance Minister and me. In regard to the final aspect of the question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I discussed this matter last night with the Acting Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Chan. A statement issed by Mr Chan accurately reflects the tone of that conversation and the conversation that occurred between the Australian High Commissioner, Mr Critchley, and Mr Chan. Mr Chan expressed his regret that an action of an officer of the High Commission had led to a misunderstanding of the role of the High Commission. Mr Critchley accepted an assurance by Mr Critchley that Australia had not established nor was establishing a spy network in Papua New Guinea. It is well to recall that the officer was declared to Papua New Guinea and accepted by that country. The statement issued by Mr Chan, as I say, accurately reflects the conversation between him and me but more particularly between him and the High'Commissioner yesterday. NA",16
13,Mr DRUMMOND,EXPORTS OF AUSTRALIAN BEEF TO,Has the Prime Minister received a reply to his letter to the Japanese Prime Minister concerning exports of Austrahan beef to Japan?,18
14,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,EXPORTS OF AUSTRALIAN BEEF TO,"The Japanese pathetic Prime Minister has repUed. In that reply there was reference to the talks at Kuala Lumpur and a recognition of the problems that Australia faces that were brought to attention at that time. As a result of the reply there will be continuing talks between officials and, as the governments determine, between Ministers. That basicaUy means that the message that I sent to the Japanese Prime Minister some Uttle time ago has in fact been accepted. The response that we got to it was the response that we not only expected but wanted. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Foreign Minwheat ister a question. How soon will the offending Australian official be withdrawn from Port Moresby?  statement issued by Mr Chan, as I have said, curately reflects the discussion between him and the High Commissioner. As a consequence I have nothing to add to the matter, other than reiterate that the Government of Papua New Guinea agreed to the posting of this man in the first place. WHEAT: FIRST ADVANCE PAYMENTS",18
15,Mr MCVEIGH,MORESBY,"I direct a question to the Minthe ister for Primary Industry. I remind him and the House of the Government's action last year increasing the first advance on wheat to a amount of $66 per tonne. With the background of that magnificent initiative, what are the arsultations rangements for the announcement of this year's first advance? Can Australia's wheat growers who are faced with lower yields and a shortage of cash resources due to drought this year the same sympathetic treatment from a government which has estabUshed a reputation of being concerned for unfortunate farmers?",18
16,Mr SPEAKER,MORESBY,Order! The honourable gentleman is not entitled to pay tribute to Government but merely to seek information.,18
17,Mr MCVEIGH,MORESBY,When will the first advance payments be announced? Can the announceand ment be made sooner than programmed?,18
18,Mr SINCLAIR,MORESBY,"I know the honourable JAPAN gentleman's interest in the wheat industry. There has been no programmed date of announcement. In fact, to date I have had no firm consultations with the Australian Wheat growers Federation with respea to the first advance. It is equaUy true that the Government will give the same symconsideration to the problems of the wheat industry as this Government traditionally does. There are tremendous difficulties this year for the wheat industry, mainly because of the drought that is regrettably so widespread around Australia. The honourable gentleman would have noticed only last week that the Australian Wheat Board put some sUghtly reduced figures on the projected harvest for 1977-78. It has reduced the projection by about 2 million tonnes to about 9 million tonnes. Looking at the drought scene, it is very difficult to make a firm judgment on whether even that expectation will be realised. I should say with respect to the Australian industry, however, that the whole Australian wheat community is very indebted to the retiring Chairman of the Board, Mr Jack Cass, and to the Board for the efforts that they have made on behalf of the wheat industry. In fact, in of the general drift in world grain prices, the acBoard has already sold forward much of next year's crop. Considering the relatively low stocks of wheat carried forward from last harvest, the to Australian wheat industry is in a much better position than industries in many other countries in the exporting world. For that reason, although grain prices are uncertain, the sales position is sound. One would hope that the Australian wheat industry can look forward to that part of crop which it is able to harvest giving at least some reasonable return. I hope that in terms of in the Australian Wheat growers Federation I can record comply with the honourable gentleman's request. That, of course, will depend upon conwhich are still to take place. I certainly recognise the problems of the industry and I can assure the honourable gentleman that the Government will examine very sympathetically expect any proposition put forward by it. NA NA",18
19,Mr LES MCMAHON,ELECTION,"Has the attention of the the Prime Minister been drawn to the views expressed in editorials in every major newspaper in the country that increasing speculation about a premature election is destroying the economic pohtical fabric of Australia? In accordance with his pubUcly expressed attitude of deploring such speculation, what steps have been taken terminate it? In particular, has he, as has been ported, sought the advice of the Governorthat General about an early election? Will he now responsibly and end speculation about an early election?",18
20,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ELECTION,"The honourable doubt gentleman should well know my pohcy in relaning tion to these matters. I believe it is an improper matter for comment by any Prime Minister. Let me say only that this speculation was started the Australian Labor Party some considerable time ago. If there were concern about the future of the Australian economy it would be only befurther cause of a concern about the poUcies enunciated 1978. by the Opposition which would take away the concessions, the incentives and the investment stimulii which this Government has provided for businesses across a wide sector of Australia and which have led to a recovery in profits and investments. There also has been very great conter cern about statements by the Leader of the position. He indicated on Monday Conference that the Opposition would restore aU sorts of areas, probably adding about $2 billion or more to this year's Budget. This would lead again to a greatly increased Budget and thus to higher interest rates and higher inflaexpressed tion. Australia trod that path and I am quite tain that Australians will never tread it again. NA",19
21,Mr MOORE,CONSUMER PRICE INDEX,Can the Treasurer give any information as to when the September consumer price index figures will be released? Is he aware of the significance that these figures will have business confidence in Australia?,19
22,Mr LYNCH,CONSUMER PRICE INDEX,"These figures certainly will have a very real impact on business confidence throughout the Australian community. I can inform the honourable gentleman that the Sepjudicially tember quarter consumer price index will be released at 12 o'clock today. The information currently under an embargo. I have every tion of respecting that embargo so I do not mention the figure at this stage. However, I can say to the honourable gentleman, because the embargo is up at 12 o'clock, that the figure reflects smallest rise in prices, apart from the Medibank distortion of September 1975, in any quarter since December 1972. The CPI for the Sepas tember quarter, which is a real breakthrough in the fight against inflation, will demonstrate yond any doubt whatsoever",19
23,Mr BAILLIEU,CONSUMER PRICE INDEX,"It is a miracle. to Mr LYNCH-The honourable gentleman says reit is a miracle. I would Uke to deny that and say it is because of the consistent appUcation of act this Government's economic poUcies. I hope the honourable gentleman will take no offence at my response to his interjecuon. The CPI for the September quarter will demonstrate beyond any whatsoever that this Government is winthe fight against inflation and that our poUcies have been successful. FinaUy, the rate of inflation has been curbed, as I have said on many by other occasions, and I repeat it here again, because of the consistent appUcation of Budget and monetary restraint. The stage is now set for a significant reduction in inflation during NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Miniswhether the views expressed yesterday by the OpDeputy Prime Minister on an early election for both Houses of the Parliament represented the expenditure in Government's view. deficit Mr MALCOLM FRASER-The views yesterday were entirely appropriate in certhe circumstances in which they were expressed. NA (JUDICIAL REVIEW) ACT",19
24,Mr ELLICOTT,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Productivity, who represents the Attorney-General in this House. Does the Minison ter recall the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, which has now been on the statute book for some months? Does the Minister recall also that, under that Act, certain reforms were introduced which give citizens a simplified method of approaching the court to review decisions by pubUc servants and Ministers? Can the Minister inform the House when is this Act will be proclaimed so that citizens can intenenjoy the benefit of those reforms?",19
25,Mr MACPHEE,ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS,"I do recaU the Act and I do the recall the very commendable features of the Act. I know that the Attorney-General gives it high priority and that he intends to have it proclaimed soon as possible. He is currently working on regulations under the Act. If the term 'as soon as bepossible' is not precise enough for the honourable member, I shall ask the Attorney-General to convey a more precise ume. But I know that it will be done as soon as possible. NA NA NA",19
26,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,TRAFFICKING,"Has the Prime Mimsfinancing ter seen reports of the hearing of the New South Wales Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking yesterday which indicated that the Royal missioner, Mr Justice Woodward, was not receivSouth ing any co-operation from Commonwealth agensurplus cies which would assist that Commission's inquiry into the problems of drug trafficking? particular the Commissioner mentioned the agencies of bankruptcy, immigration and foreign exchange. The Prime Minister will recall that earlier asked the Treasurer whether he would operate also. What is the explanation for the Commonwealth not being prepared to cowas operate? Will the Prime Minister personally intervene to see that the Royal Commissioner gets all the assistance that he needs?",20
27,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TRAFFICKING,"I certainly was surprised to see that report this morning because it is my understanding that appropriate adminisI trative arrangements have been worked out be the tween governments in relation to this matter, which certainly is vastly important. That report being followed up to see what justification was for it being made. I should have thought if there were difficulties in relation to this particuwe lar matter the Premier would have contacted me directly. I am not aware of any communication having come forward. Obviously there needs to be proper communication between governcars ments-the Commonwealth with the State in this particular case and, I might add, the State with 1977-78. the Commonwealth's inquiry. NA COMMISSION: SURPLUS CARS",20
28,Mr SAINSBURY,NEW SOUTH WALES HEALTH,"My question is addressed to to the Minister for Health and relates to the nouncement that the New South Wales Health sition. Commission has a surplus of cars under the ing program from the Commonwealth for the community health program. I draw the Miniswho ter's attention also to the fact that the New South Wales Premier, under pressure from the State Opposition, has stated that he intends to sell these surplus cars and to use the proceeds for other purposes. I therefore he ensure that any money from the sale of surplus cars will be accounted to the Commonment wealth and will be properly appUed to the programs required by the people of New South Wales?",20
29,Mr HUNT,NEW SOUTH WALES HEALTH,"It would appear from Press New reports that the New South Wales Government does not only have money ruruiing out of its ears but also has motor carsranningout of its ears as a result of the better revenue grant system for the States and also the way in which we are assisting the States with various programs. Yes, it is a fact that statements about a surplus of Comcars have been made by the Premier of New Wales. In fact, I understand that there is a of something Uke $1.6m worth of cars. About half a million dollars worth of those cars In have been purchased under the community health program. When this matter was brought to my attention towards the end of the last finanI cial year I made arrangements for my departcomental officers to get in touch with the New South Wales Health Commission to make sure it brought to account. I have also made sure that in thisfinancialyear proceeds from the sale of surplus cars purchased under the community health program granting arrangement will in fact be reinvested within the community health program block grant allocation for 1977-78. must say that this matter adds great weight to decision that the Government took to involve the States to a greater extent in the contributions is that they make towards this very valuable comthere munity health program. If they are more acthat countable for and more involved in the program will probably not see a surplus in the number of cars purchased, as has happened in the past. I shall be watching the matter very closely to make sure that the proceeds from the sale of surplus are directed to therightand proper place under the community health program grant for PAPUA NEW GUINEA: AUSTRALIAN NA",20

For how much longer will bumbling activities such as this be ask the Minister: Will tolerated?  specifically on the type of allegation made. health I would make this passing comment: WhUst what transpired as an action by this officer was outside the agreement reached between Papua Guinea and ourselves, what intrigues me is that the fact that he worked on the staff of the Leader of the Opposition would ipso facto in the mind of the honourable member disqualify to do anything on behalf of Australia. NUCLEAR POWER: ENRICHMENT",20
31,Mr IAN ROBINSON,HIGH COMMISSION,I direct my question to the Minister for National Resources. I refer the visit to Australia last week of representatives of a European group known as URENCOis in CENTEC which has forward contracts to supply enrichment services for fuelling nuclear power stations. Has the Minister had discussions with representatives of URENCO-CENTEC? Is he in a position to inform the House of the outcome of any such discussions?,21
32,Mr ANTHONY,HIGH COMMISSION,"It is true that there are in Austraha at the moment representatives of Minister. URENCO-CENTEC. They are exploring the Commission's possibility of being involved in an enrichment plant in Australia. They are well advanced in the centrifugal method of the enrichment of of uranium. Therefore they are trying to get protection interested people in Australia involved in a joint or multinational venture, which of course would lead to very large expenditure. At the moment they have forward contracts to the value of $ 1,000m. So one can say that they have a good deal of experience behind them. At the moment they are going around the various government agencies. They are having disThewith cussions with the Australian Atomic Energy flict Commission and with my own Department, and economic they are meeting with various State governments to see how much interest they can work up. will be reporting back to me before they leave Australia. I will then have more detaUed inforindicate mation to put to this House and the Australian people as to what is involved. able members would welcome the opportunity of seeing more processing or upgrading of materials in Australia. If we are to proceed with the mining and export of uranium, it is only ral that there should be further we receive the maximum benefit. Such an ment plant would involve a very heavy investment and would provide additional employment opportunities in the area in which it was estaband lished. State governments have interested in such a venture. As I have mentioned to this House before, the South Australian Government was and, I believe, still is very keen to have an enrichment plant in South Australia. It is also interesting to note what utter confusion there is within the Labor Party on its uranium poUcy. In the Australian Labor Party's platform there is a clause which supports the enrichment him of uranium in Australia. Mr E. G. Whitlam-There is not.",21
33,Mr ANTHONY,HIGH COMMISSION,"That is very nice to hear. SERVICES The Labor Party must have erased that clause suddenly because it was there during the course of the 1975 election campaign. Of course, the to Labor Party had a lot of other poUcies while it was in office which dealt with uranium but now it Opposition it looks as though the Leader of the Opposition has lost control ofhis Party to the left wing influences which are doing their level best to stop development of uranium and to exacerbate relations with our trading partners. NA NA",21
34,Mr HAYDEN,COMMISSION REPORT,"I ask a question of the Prime Has he noted the Industries Assistance report which states that Australia has the second highest average tariff rate in the world? Has he nouced in the latest annual report the IAC that several industries enjoying high rates have used the protection rates to increase prices and profits, thereby aggravating cost problems in the community, and have used increased profits to invest to a greater degree in about capital equipment, accordingly reducing the numbers in the work force?

I would like to know how he thinks that Australians are to be employed in the manuI facturing sector unless profits can be substanthe tially improved from the disastrous which they fell as a result of Indeed, it is my understanding that when the honourable gentleman was part of a government which reduced tariffs across the board by 25 per heard. cent he was in possession of an official report which indicated that as a result of that move tens of thousands of people would be put the out of work. Therefore, quite knowingly, the Government of the day took a decision in relation to tariffs which it knew and which it had been advised from official sources would add of thousands of people to the unemployed Austraha. The Labor Party is great champion of the Ausit has done more harm to of thousands of Australian families-tha n all other governments in the history of Australia, and it knows that very well indeed. Consistent with what the Treasurer said earUer today, if there is any worry or conabout the effect on prices of decisions this Government has made in relation to tariffs and of Australian industry, the figures that will be announced at 12 o 'clock today will blow the that worry and concernrightout the window. We are concerned about the employment situation in Australia. We are vastly concerned at what happened during the years in goverament of the Labor Party when a disastrous situation resulted from a whole amalgam of its policies. From December 1972 to December 1975 unemployment increased by 191,000 or 140 per cent as a direct result of Labor's policies. In the year January 1974 to Januaiy 1975 unemployment increased by 190,000 or 157 per cent. That is a of Labor; that is the record of its policies. That is what it achieved as a result of unwanted, unnecessary and stupid tariff cuts which did nothing but add to the unemployment problem and which exported jobs to other countries at the expense of the people whom the Labor Party is and reduce meant to represent.

Ordered that the report be printed.",25
54,Mr HODGES,PUBLICATIONS,I seek leave to make a short that statement in connection with the report.,25
55,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLICATIONS,"Is leave granted? There being no contrary voice, leave is granted.",25
56,Mr HODGES,PUBLICATIONS,"This is the fourth special report presented to the Parliament by the Joint Committee on PubUcations since its investigatory powers were conferred upon it by amendments MCVeigh, D.T. Macphee, I. M. to the Standing Orders in 1970. The inquiry was initiated by the Committee in June 1976 to ascertain whether, in the opinion of the Committee, Moore.J.C. Neil, M.J. the ParUamentary Papers Series of the Commonwealth Parliament was fulfilling adequately its OXeefe, F.L. Peacock,A. S. intended purpose and, if so, whether this was being achieved in the most economic and efficient manner. The Committee noted that no thorough investigation of the content and effectiveness of the Series had taken place since the Simon, B. D. Sinclair, 1. MCC. presentation of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary and Government PubUcations in 1964, often referred to as the Erwin report after its Chairman, the Honourable Dudley Erwin. Since 1967 the content of the Parliamentary Tellers; Cameron, Donald Papers Series has been determined, in the main, by the Joint Committee on PubUcations, following the recommendations of the 1964 Erwin Committee report. In that report certain guideUnes were laid down to encourage future MCMahon, Les Manin, V.J. PubUcations Committees to establish and maintain a comprehensive and consistent Series. The main advantage of a consistent Series remains unchanged from 1964, namely that researchers, Ubrarians and other users of the Series can anticiWhitlam, Antony Whitlam, E.G. pate, with relative confidence, the likely content of the Series from year to year. More recently, Tellers: the estabUshment of a consistent Series has enJames, A. W. abled the Australian Government Pubhshing Service, on advice from the Parliament, to arrange the simultaneous printing of the departmental and ParUamentary Paper versions of a report. The resulting cost savings from undertaking only one production run for two separate jobs are considerable. The Committee reaffirms the general conclusions of the Erwin Committee with regard to the consistency of the Series and has made a recommendation designed to reinforce this aspect of the Series. The Committee has added only sUghtly to the Erwin Committee Pubcontent guidelines by including documents which comprise the Australian Treaty Series and I reports of parUamentary committees of mquiry. In 1971, in its report on Distribution and Pricing of ParUamentary PubUcations, the Committee recommended that the free distribution Ust for the principal parUamentary publications be rationalised and up-dated. It recommended each addressee be limited to the receipt of one copy only of each of the principal parliamentary pubUcations-for example, ParUamentary Papers, Hansard, Notice Papers, upon request. The Committee examined its 1971 recommendation and found that, in the main, its previous recommendations on this matter were still sound and only minor variations to up-date the recommendations were considered necessary. The Committee did not make any recommendations concerning the free distribution of Hansard in this report. It took the view that any examination of the extent of free distribution of Hansard should be the subject of a separate investigation by the Committee at a later date. The Committee was informed that the cost producing the Parhamentary Papers Series in financial year 1977-78 is likely to reach $lm With this in mind the Committee was most confor cerned to remove any duplication of distribution or any wastage which might present distribution arrangements. The Committee was pleased to discover that in the main such wastage was minimal. In only one area did the Committee determine that it was necessary amend the distribution arrangements of the Series to avoid wastage, namely, where members of parliament receive a copy of a report on tabling, dupUcation should be avoided by cluding members from receipt of the Parliamenstreamlining. tary Paper version. One of the prime concerns of the Committee relates to the increasing cost involved in producCommittee ing the Series. For example, it was informed that in 1970-71 the cost of producing the Series was $107,580; in 1975-76 that cost had increased $729,716. As previously mentioned, the cost 1977-78 will approach $lm. The Committee keen to determme the principal factors involved with the increasing cost of producing the Series and whether any action taken by the Committee could reduce that cost or at least slow down rate of increase. It narrowed the increasing to four main factors: namely, the increased size of the individual publications included in Series; escalating costs involved with printing, binding et cetera and the supply of labour; tendency for more reports to be prepared tain more expedient but relatively expensive processes; and a faUure by author bodies to serve production guideUnes and procedures laid down by the Australian Government Pubhshing Service when producing simultaneously the dearation partmental and ParUamentary Paper versions reports. The Committee determined that thefirsttwo factors, namely, the size of individual publicontract cations and increasing costs of production, were outside the terms of its inquiry and that it would be in a position to comment on these matters the course of future inquiries. It has, however, made recommendations which are designed to with encourage departments to make greater less expensive production processes. The Committee also recommended enforcing AGPS production procedures laid down by AGPS circulars. It recommends that, in the event of an author body failing to follow AGPS procedures and, as a result, additional costs flow on to the production of the ParUamentary Paper version, those additional costs be met by the originating department rather than by the parliamentary of house departments as is the present situation. the The Committee hopes that the implementation . of this recommendation will provide an incentive author bodies to avoid the use of unnecessarily costly methods and material during the prooccur under the duction process. The other main concern of the Committee was the delay in the publication of the ParUamentary to Papers Series. The Committee found that the present procedures which apply following the tabling of a report in Parliament and leading to the eventual printing of that document as a ParexUamentary Paper are cumbersome and require Under present arrangements the Parliamentary Paper version of a report normally does not become available for some eight to nine months after the original tabUng. The feels that such a situation is intolerable. Such delays reduce the practical use of the Series to that of an archival research tool rather to than offering a Series which provides the comin munity with current and up-to-date information was on the affairs ofParliament and government. Ordinarily, the completion of the Parliamentary Paper version of a tabled report is underthe taken by the printer who produced the original cost departmental tabling version. In most cases, these are contract printers employed by the Austhe tralian Government Publishing Service. The Committee has recommended that the Governa ment Printer undertake the completion of the by cerSeries from the beginning of 1978. The implementation of this recommendation would obco-ordinate and simpUfy the procedures involved in completing the Series. Its implementation would shorten delays caused by the prepof design specifications and setting type of because of the familiarity of the Government Printer with this type of work, would certainly reduce considerably the delays associated with the movement of proofs between the AGPS, the printer and the Parliament, and would enable direct contact to take place between the Government Printer and parhamentary officers. in The implementation of these recommendations would bring the production of the Series into line the production of the other principal parUause of mentary publications. In past years, the Committee consistently has expressed concern over the late tabling of many of the reports presented to Parliament. Members taken of both Houses, particularly in recent times, complained of this growing trend. Because of Committee's concern in this area and the fact that late tabling necessarily means that the curperience. rency of the Parhamentary Papers Series is versely affected, the Committee has ommended the estabhshment of parhamentary evidence. machinery which is designed to encourage the more timely tabling of reports in Parliament. If Chairman the recommendations are implemented, memappreciation bers of Parliament will be advised of those of the loyaltyof reports of government which have not been tabled within a reasonable period of time following the completion of the period to which each Secretary report refers. It would also ensure a continuing him for his efficiency involvement by the Committee in this most attention to detail. Account important area of executive accountability to Parliament. The Committee feels that greater use should be made of the photo-typesetting equipment cently installed at the Government Printing Office. It feels that the ume taken most publications could be reduced by employing this equipment. At this stage the suggests that the extension of the use of this equipment be Umited to the production of parUamentary committee reports which make up part of the Parliamentary Papers scripts of committee evidence. Evidence was given to the Committee that a reducuon in the costs involved in the storage, tribution, ease of retrieval of information, cetera, of the ParUamentary Papers Series could be achieved if the Series was reproduced in a urgent Bill. microform. The Committee accepts the evidence given on this subject and recommends when production and financial considerations permit, the Parliamentary Papers Series be produced in a microform version hard copy. One factor which was brought out in evidence revealed, in the Committee's opinion, an inconsistency with the distribution of government pubUcations through the AGPS deposit. Currendy there are 25 recipients of the AGPS deposit, namely, national, university, and Abel, J.A. Commonwealth parUamentary librarians. Committee feels that the category of State Baillieu, M. parUamentary librarian should be added to the Birney, R.J. AGPS deposit and has recommended Bonnett, accordingly. In conclusion, I thank the members of the Committee for the work which they have underto complete this mquiry. It is the first of its have type for a number of years carried out by the the Joint Committee on PubUcations and I feel sure that members of the Committee enjoyed the exI also take the opportunity of thanking adthose many people who provided submissions to recthe Committee and also those who gave Finally, I place on record my appreciation as of the Committee and I am sure the all members of the Committee, shown by the two staff members of the Committee, particularly by Mr Wharton, the of the Committee, who is the Deputy Usher of the Black Rod in the Senate.

Irrespective of that it is sufficiently important to have hadtimeto examine the legislation and for the Opposition to have been giventimeto consult and examine properly the clauses of the Bill. In the time in which the Bill has been in front of members of the Opposition, there has hardly been time to read the clauses let alone to examine what they actually mean. This is a comStewart, F. E. Uren.T. plete denial of any semblance of parliamentary process. The Government has decided that it wishes to introduce certain legislation. It has not Young, M.

There have been many instances of legislation having to be amended even before it reached the debate stage in this Parliament because what was thought to be in the Bill has been found not to be in the Bill and the meanings of all stages of the Bill be until 4.30 clauses have been found to be not what was intended when the Bill was drafted and passed through the various processes of government. It is allrightfor Government supporters. They have examined this legislation in committee for months, as they claim. The Opposition has some rights in a parliamentary system. One of the rights of the Opposition is to have sufficient time to examine legislation, to consider it at a party level and to discuss it with those sections of the community which have an interest in the legislation or will be affected by the legislation. As I said initially, this is a major piece of industrial legislation which will change the whole form of industrial law in Australia.

Question so resolved in the affirmative.",29
65,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,"The debate which is now commencing is not so much a debate as a parUamentary sham. To expect that a sensible debate can occur on a Bill comprising 28 pages of detaUed amendments to one of the most complex Acts that this Parliament has ever passed, to expect this Parliament today to debate sensibly such provisions, introduced last night, in the period between now and 4.30 p.m. is ridiculous. It makes a mockery of the whole parliamentary process, and everyone on the other side of the House knows that that is the case. If the Government says that industrial relations in this country are so important, why not debate them in this House? Why does the Government always rush through legislation giving this side of the House no time at all to consider the detaUs of the legislation? Bill after Bill has been rammed through the House with no opportunity at all for any sensible debate or discussion or even consideration by this side of the House. The Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Bill was rammed through this House in a most disgraceful fashion. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) introduced it with a one-minute speech. The Opposiuon had one hour in which to Shipton. R. F. see the Bill before we debated it. This time we have a Bill comprising 28 pages of amendments, given to us at seven o'clock last night, to be Staley, A. A. debated now at half-past twelve. It is a total parliamentary sham, an absurdity, and honourable Yates. W. members opposite know that is the case. There is no possibUity that anyone on this side of the House could have gone through all the clauses of the Bill and known exactly what was there. I suggest that the same goes for almost everyone on the other side of the House too, with the possible exception of the Minister and some others who may have been involved in the employment and industrial relations committee. Certainly there is MCMahon. Les Marun.V.J. no way that the Government will get from this debate, from either side of the House, a comprehensive understanding of what is in this legisStewart, F. E. Uren.T. lation. It is extremely important legislation. It does democracy and the parliamentary process no service at all to indulge m this kind of exercise. This appUes not only to the BUls that I have mentioned. The previous amendments to the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act passed at the end of the last session were rammed through in the same way. We sat one extra day, with less than a day's notice that we were to have that deBeazley, K.E. Whitlam, Antony bate, so that that legislation could be rushed through the House. The amendments to the Trade Practices Act, which were extraordinarily complex and which were amended time after time, were finally passed through this House. When I rose to speak on the part of that Bill dealing with industnal relations I was faced with 12 pages of amendments handed to me across the table, amongst which were detaUs of amendments affecting the industrial relations section of the Trade Practices Act. How can we possibly discuss this legislation sensibly in the whole industrial relation area, if the Government keeps squibbing on it? That is what the Government is doing. It says that industrial relations are very important but it squibs the debate every time. It isridiculousand absurd, and I am sick and tired of it. The Opposition is quite wUling to debate with any honourable members opposite at any time about industrial relations. We think that this is the appropriate forum in which to do so, but the Government squibs on every occasion and we are sick and tired of it. If the Government really thinks that industrial relations are so important it should give ustimeto talk about them. We will discuss them with honourable members opposite and we will show that their kind of industrial relations are a disaster for this country. What the Government is about is not so much improving industrial relations as trying to create an atmosphere in which it thinks it have some pohtical advantage. Well, it is very wrong about that. The fact is that this Bill goes far beyond any provisions which could excuse this legislation being rushed into the House at this time. Of course, the excuse is that it is of the State Electricity Commission dispute. But this Bill goes far beyond anything that could possibly be used in relation to the SEC dispute. What has financial accounting for unions to with the SEC dispute? What have union ballots to do with the SEC dispute? What have demararied cation provisions to do with the SEC dispute? There is a whole range of provisions in this Bill which have absolutely nothing to do with SEC dispute. If the Government wants to bring in some amendments which it says, quite wrongly in our opinion, may have some opposed. relevance to the SEC dispute, why not do that? Why bring in this great ream of legislation cannot possibly be considered by us in the time available either before the debate or during it? The whole thing is an absolute sham disgrace. Rather than being needed to settle industrial total disputes, this legislation will only exacerbate to industrial disputes. It is totally unions. Despite the impression that may have been given by the Minister in his speech last penalties' night referring to points of agreement, this legisvisions lation is totally opposed by the trade umon movement in this country, and I suspect that a lot What weoftherefore of employers are not too happy about it either. athechange Last May when similar legislation-no t exactly the same, but similar legislation-wa s put before sideration this Parhament the resolution of the Australian the Council of Trade Unions executive was that if it cation, were passed into law there would be massive against economic dislocation in this country. Since that time, only a month or so ago, the ACTU congress endorsed a similar proposal. So the unions' attiprocesses tude to this kind of legislation is well known. The nate Government knows that the unions will resist processes-th completely this kind of legislation and it knows that, by introducing it, it is raising the prospect industrial confrontation. Of course, that is the Government wants to achieve and that why this legislation is being introduced. The Government knows that the penalty proSo cedures which it has introduced in this legislation have been against trade union pohcy since 1969.requirement It knows that the attempt to impose that kind legislation will mean that there will be strong resistance from the trade union movement. knows that that will lead to industrial confronsomething tation. I suggest that that is really what might Government wants to achieve. So much for a good industrial relations policy. There is not a thing in this legislation which is aimed at improving industrial relations. Rather, it is waving an enormous stick at the unions and threatening to undermine their position in many ways. I will necessary because come to this later. The background to this legislation is one of deceipt and deception. Legislation similar to this was introduced in March last year. It was do vigorously opposed by the unions-no t just by the ACTU but by the Australian Council for Saland Professional Associations and also by the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations. Both of these white collar the organisations, CAGEO being predominantly a white collar union, agreed completely with the ACTU that this legislation should be totally Yet simUar legislation is now being brought before this Parliament. However, the which ACTU proposed a compromise on 11 May of this year. I quote from a statement by the ACTU officers at a conference with the Mmister for Emand a ployment and Industrial Relations: Having expressed at length the detailed reasons for our opposition to the Government's proposed amendments the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Act, we make opposed by the the following statement: This existing legislation contains a range of 'pains and provisions. It is known that some of those proMovement. conflict with the policy of the Australian Trade Union put now does not imply into the future our policy in that respea. However, that is not current issue. On that basis we put two propositions for the earnest conof the Government. These propositions are put in deeply held belief that confrontauon and massive disloif avoidable whilst still adhering to principle, is the best interests of the Australian community. First, if the Government wishes to put the responsibility for dealing with the existing pains and penalties and into the hands of a body which they wish to desigas an Industrial Relations Bureau-and there is no explicit or implicit addition to those existing provisions or e Trade Union Movement, whde regarding such a move as unnecessary, would offer no objection. of The statement went on to indicate that the what ACTU would also agree to participate in the is National Labour Advisory Council with a view to achieving agreed improvements in that area. the basis on which the ACTU made its compromise proposal was quite clear. The first was that there be no change in the of powers or processes by which the Bureau operated compared with those of the previous It Inspectorate. The ACTU saw the NLAC as in which it would participate with a the view to achieving agreement improvements in that area. Following that, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations issued a statethe ment on 17 May which stated: The Government has decided to pass legislation this Session to estabUsh the Industrial Relations Bureau which will have the funcuon of securing the observance of the Act and Awards in the terms already in the Act. Pending the detaUed considerauon of the Act referred to later in this statement, the Industrial Relations Bureau will have the same powers as the Arbitration Inspectorate, no more and no less, and those powers will be exercised according to the same processes as they have been until now. He went on to say that the Government would also legislate for the National Labour Advisory Council, which later became the National Labour Consultative Council. So the Minister said that he would agree that the same processes and powers would be accorded to the Bureau as were accorded to the previous Arbitration Inspectorate. But what is the reahty in this? It is that the powers which were then given to the Bureau exceeded those of the Arbitration Inspectorate. This represented a total breach of the agreement reached with the ACTU. The powers given to the Bureau were the same as for the Inspectorate in every respect but one, and that one difference was that the Arbitration Inspectorate was subject to ministerial control and the Bureau was made subject to no such control. That is a very important difference indeed because as the Inspectorate had operated in the past, its power to initiate prosecutions in various areas had not been used. This was so under Labor governments and Liberal governments in the past. But once the Government abolished the power provided under section 125 sub-section (4) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which provided for ministerial control, and gave the Bureau a statutory obligation to ensure adherence to the Act, regulations and awards it gave the Bureau a statutory duty to prosecute anyone who breached the Act, regulations or awards, regardless of the industrial relations consequences. In fact, if the Director of the Bureau did not initiate such prosecutions he would be in breach of his statutory duty as Director of the Bureau. No intervention by the Department or by the Minister was possible, although it had been possible with the Inspectorate in the past. Let me read the criteria by which the Inspectorate operated in the past in respect of award breaches by employees. This information was tabled by the Mmister early this year. I do not know why he did so as it is an acute embarrassment to him. Mr Street-It was last year.",30
66,Mr WILLIS,PAIRS,"It was this year. The document reads: Award breaches by employees . . . are subject to same fundamental enforcement policy as award breaches by employers. However application of this policy must take account of the difference in the nature of the breaches. For this reason, and because of the complexity of the issue involved, Directors are to refer all alleged employee award breaches to Central Office for decision as to whether a breach exists and whether proceedings under section 119 wiU be instituted. In referring such matters, Directors should provide their assessment as to whether a breach exists. It was clearly and concisely indicated that the inspectors had to direct any proposed prosecutions to the central office of the Department for assessment as to whether there should be a prosecution. That requirement does not exist in respect of the Bureau. It is a fundamental difference. The fact that the legislation passed last June has not yet been proclaimed means that this legislation has not yet come into operation, but it will do so in the very near future. It will mean that the Bureau will have a statutory obligation, for instance, to prosecute anyone who breaches section 138-the incitement to boycott provision. Anyone who advises, encourages and incites anyone else to go on strike or in any way to place any ban or hmitation upon work will be liable to a prosecution and a fine of $400. If the Government applies that section, as the Bureau will be compelled to do under this legislation-ther e will be no control by the Government as to whether it is done-it will be able to prosecute many persons each year. If that is what the Government wants to do I suppose this legislation will achieve its point. But it certainly will not improve industrial relations that way. It will bring about massive industrial unrest with that proposal. But that is what is involved in the legislation introduced by the Government to this point oftime,regardless of what is being done by the legislation before us right now. All I am doing is providing the background of the deceit and deception which led to the breach of the agreement reached with the ACTU in respect of the powers and processes of the Bureau. The legislation which is before the House, although considered by the unions in the National Labour Consultative Council and although some amendments were made, is still strongly opposed by the unions. Let there be no doubt about that. This legislation is implacably opposed by the ACTU and by the other peak councils in this country. The Government's insistence on continuing with this legislation could well lead to unions pulling out of the National Labour Consultative Council. As I said, the unions agreed to go into the NLCC with the aim of achieving agreed changes to the Act. But what happened? All that happened was that when they got to the NLCC they were thrown a whole heap of proposed amendments. Some notice was taken of some of the objections they put up, no attempt was made to reach total agreement. What has happened is that there has been sultauon in the sense that the unions have been shown what the Government intends to do; some minor changes have been made to the Governaward. ment's proposals; then the legislation has been put before the House. In those circumstances think it is highly likely-it is not for me whether it will happen-that peak councils will say: 'To hell with your National Labour Conpended, sultative Council if that is all it is about'. If what the Government wants to achieve it is goingSo the right way about it. What about the employers-ar e they in favour rules or adherence of this legislation? We have not been told that they are. I have good reasons to beheve that some employers at least are quite strongly opposed to this sort of legislation. Certainly tain work. when this sort of legislation was put up last various employer organisations expressed conombudsman: siderable doubt as to whether this sort of legisforce. lation would achieve anything. The Austrahan bushel: Industries Development Association went quite pubhc and gave detailed reasons why it thought this sort of legislation would not work and should be rejected by the Government. That was just one amongst a number. But what about this occasion? Have the employers all agreed that this sort of legislation is just what we need to mote good industrial relations? I think they ably have not. The Minister should tell us whether he has total agreement from the emtions ployers in regard to this sort of legislation. This legislation also greatly increases the powers of the Industrial Relations Bureau. visions for the establishment of this body were included in legislation which came to this House in March last year. At thattimethe Industrial Relations Bureau was said to be an industrial ombudsman- a kindly sort of body which would try to look after the complaints of people involved in industrial relations. What a joke; what an absurd description that was! This so-called industrial ombudsman has been given enormous (b) powers. It in fact will be an industrial police force, which will be there to impose a whole array of pains and penalties upon the unions if that legislauon is enacted. That is what the reau will be there for; not to make sure that the unions have theirrightsenforced, as an ombuds-so man is supposed to do. In fact, it is to be the policeman who takes them to court and through the processes of being fined and penalised. That is what the Industrial Relations Bureau is about. Consider the powers it will have. It could inibut tiate penalty proceedings under sections 33 and 109 of the Act and carry themrightthrough to completion. So we will berightback to the conpre-1969 days when unions were taken through the industrial court and fined for breaches of bans clauses. It could seek the cancellation of an That is a nice conciliatory approach! It could seek deregistration of unions. Of course, I the grounds for that will be much widened under to say the legislation presently before the House. Where a union or its officers or members are susas will be provided for in this legislation, that is the Bureau can seek renewal of the suspension. the Bureau will play the role of seeking time after time the suspension of unions, union officials or members. It can investigate union to rules on its own initiative. It can apply for demarcation orders to exclude a union from covering employees engaged in certime All this is not the role of some industrial It is the role of an industrial pohce Let there be no hiding of our Ught under a That is what it is. It is an industrial pohce force brought into enforce various provisions, both existing and new, against the trade union movement. In so doing, the Bureau does not have to have any regard whatever to any objectives about improving industrial relations in this country. Nowhere in this legislation is there any pro-provision for it to have regard to the industrial probrelations impUcations of what it is doing. It purely has this role to enforce the Act, regulaand awards in the way in which they will be expanded by this Bill. In the face of all this it is absurd to describe the Bureau as an ombudsman. ProThe Bill provides a new range of pains and penalties for industrial action. The industrial action definition is extremely wide. It goes far beyond mere industrial stoppages. Clause 3 (b) of the Bill describes industrial action as: (a) the performance of work . . . in a manner different from that in which it is customarily performed, or the adoption of a practice in relation to such work, the result of which is a restriction or limitation on, or a delay in, the performance of the work; a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work . . . (c) a failure or refusal by persons to attend for work . . . BuSo there we have a very wide-ranging definition of industrial action. From that industrial action widely defined-jus t doing work in a way different from the way in which it is normally performed or a work to rule or anything Uke that-flo w a lot of very important implications for unions. For instance, there are extremely wide grounds for deregistration. Industrial that prevents, hinders or interferes with trade commerce with other countries or amongst States becomes the basis of deregistration towards proceedings. Industrial action can mean a work to rules campaign that is a very mild form of industrial action indeed, but it does come within the finition of industrial action. If that involved or commerce, either interstate or overseas, would be a basis for deregistering a whole Incredible! But that is what is proposed by this kind of legislation. Of course once you have taken into account trade or commerce overseas or amongst the States, you have not left too much untouched, particularly when you follow that with provision of any pubhc service. Deregistraitself tion is a fairly important proceeding. On the occasions on which it has been used, I think it been counter productive. Nevertheless, it is important proceeding. To suggest that deregisthat tration could occur on the basis of very mild industrial action seems to me to be a total surdity; but that is what this legislation proposes. Also conduct not authorised by the union rules is a basis for deregistration proceedings. As I have mentioned, there is a self-defeating nature about deregistration. Once a union or a section of a union is deregistered as this legisbecause lation will allow, there is no control whatever the Concihation and Arbitration Commission. Deregistration means that the union is then side the system. You are not just imposing a penthat alty by taking away award cover; you are throwinvolves ing that union right out of the system. That means that you cannot start imposing a means of settlement through the Arbitration Comat that missioner, or if you want to, apply penalties. whole process of dealing with industrial dispuhurry tation ceases once the union is deregistered. It self-defeating proposal. The only way in which it can work is if the unions are so frightened of say deregistration that they would give in on the exution pectation that they would be deregistered if they undertook certain action. So, as I said, deregistration is basically a defeating exercise. It is not going to achieve thing, for instance, in the case of the State Electo tricity Commission workers. Under section 143 (2) (a) as amended, sectional deregistration would enable the Government to deregister the employees who are on strike at the SEC in Victhrough toria. But what is the use if you deregister the SEC workers? The strike would more than likely still continue. I could not imagine that at this stage the threat of deregistration would send them scurrying back to work. Current arbitration action proceedings could not continue if they were or deregistered. We have a work value case starting the today which hopefully may go a long way settling this dispute. Hopefully it will get the men back to work soon and there will be a settlement of this dispute. Everyone is hoping that that will be the case. But on the very same deday as this process begins, this Government trade brings on for debate in this House legislation it which proposes the possibUity of deregistering union. the SEC workers? If the Government does deregister them, that will be the end of the arbitration proceedings. There will be no more work value case; they will be out of the system. Does the Government think that is going to solve anyup thing? I think the Government is really having on if it beUeves that that action would in few any way assist in the resolution of that kind of has dispute. Nor can any other initiatives be taken an through the Arbitration Commission to settle dispute. If they are deregistered, not only would that work value case go out, but any other abinitiative through the Commission would be finished. It would more than likely ensure that the strikers just stuck it out until their claim was settled through direct bargaining with the Victorian Government. This selective deregistration is also possible maybe the Essential Services Act in Vicby toria cannot be appUed until the SEC workers are deregistered in view of the possible conflict outbetween State and Federal law. It may well be the Essential Services Act in Victoria, which provisions for ordering workers back to work, cannot be implemented whUe Federal law appUes. So selective deregistration may be aimed particular situation. If that is the case, if The the Government is passing this legislation in a to bring about selective deregistration of is a the SEC workers so that Mr Hamer can apply the Essential Services Act to the SEC workers, I still it is not going to bring about any sort of a solto the dispute in the Latrobe Valley. It will not in any way get to the basics of that dispute. It will simply mean that the Victorian Government, selfunder the Essential Services Act, will be able to anyorder the men back to work. But are they going go back to work? Is there any reason to suspect that an order under the Essential Services Act would be more Ukely to make them go back to work than the threat of penalty being applied this system? I do not think so. I do not think that fine of a couple of hundred dollars at this stage will make an enormous difference to their attitude. I think their general belief would be: 'We have stuck it out to this stage. They cannot get blood out.of a stone, anyway. We are all broke and the threat of fines is just going us more solid than ever.' We think this whole pains and penalties proach by the Government is simply counterLatrobe productive. It does not bring about good indusabout trial relations. It does not solve industrial disputes. At no stage have we seen action of a constructive nature by this Government which designed to bring about a settlement of the dispute in the Latrobe Valley-by any sort initiative in the Arbitration Commission or otherwise. All we have seen has been the and penalties approach which is now before this debate. We believe that a key reason for the introduction of this selective deregistration legislation in this terrible hurry is that the Government wishes to clear the way for Mr Hamer's Essential Serdispute vices Act to be applied. If this is so, I still it will not solve anything in the Latrobe Valley dispute. In fact the use of that sort of legislation while a work value case is being heard before Commissioner Mansini could well send the officials, whole thing spinning off into oblivion again. totally counter-productive. Alternative penalties are provided in this lation. Where a union is m a position where deregistration or selective deregistration is cable, an alternative set of penalties are availmeans able. A power is given to the Industrial Court order suspension of the rights and privUeges of union officials, of the union itself or of its bers. The rights, privUeges or capacities organisation or any of its members can be suspended. The Court will have the power to give directions as to the exercise of any rights, privimore leges or capacities and to restrict the use of funds or property of the organisation or a branch of organisation. That is an alternative to deregistradisputes tion. If that kind of provision were to be utilised in the Latrobe Valley case, again one could not see exacdy what would be achieved. If you before suspend the employment rights and privUeges the SEC workers who are all on strike-the not covered by the award wtule they are on strike, anyway-ho w are you going to suspend any privUeges which they have not virtually pended for themselves? So this is again someexpired. thing which just cannot be seen to be very useful in terms of this dispute. If it were appUed to union officials, such as Mr Halfpenny, who been involved in the dispute people would be suspended who may have the best chance tling the dispute. Mr Street- Mr Halfpenny? to make Mr WILLIS-It is very interesting that the Minister makes that querulous interjection. The fact is, as I understand it, that Mr Halfpenny has apbeen booed and jeered a number oftimesin the Valley when he has made suggestions ways of going about resolving the dispute. So far as I can see his role has been a conciliatory one of trying to solve the dispute rather than exis acerbate it. But the Government sees him as some sort of whipping boy. If a person Uke that of who has much more a chance of getting the backing of the men, than the Minister or anyone pains in the Government, is suspended, you are us in suspending someone who may bring about a resolution of the dispute. Use of that kind of power will not solve anything. If the Government insists on bringing in this kind of legislation either in relation to the SEC or any other dispute it wiU bring about say that an enormous reaction from the trade union movement. If the Government thinks the Federal Court of Australia will be aUowed to take over the trade union movement, suspend its direct its funds, direct the operations of It is the unions and the union movement will quietly accept that, the Government has another think coming. I cannot believe that the union movelegisment will aUow without substantial protests such action to occur. It means that unions can be virappUtually wiped out by that kind of provision. It that they can be suspended for six months to and then for another six months and then for another six months. This can go on indefinitely so memlong as the Bureau keeps making the application of the and the Court keeps granting it. My speakingtimeis running out. There is a lot that should be said about this legislation. It is legislation which is totaUy counter-productive. the It is legislation which will not solve industrial in this country. It will not improve industrial relations. It will not improve the SEC dispute. It is legislation which has been brought this Parliament in such a hurry for reasons of which have more to do with elections than they y are have to do with industrial relations.",32
67,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Lucock)susOrder! The honourable member's time has,35
68,Unknown,PAIRS,"Sitting suspended from 1.2 to 2.15 p.m. have Mr BROWN (Diamond VaUey) (2.15)-It is difficult to know where to start replying to the of setspeech of the honourable member for GeUibrand (Mr WUlis), because in the half hour tirade that he launched against the Government for introducing the legislation he did not seem to have time to address any remarks to the pronational visions of the Bill. One would have thought the purpose of a parhamentary debate was to dress remarks to the provisions of the Bill before the Parliament. It is appropriate to state, as a general osition, before looking at some of the provisions of the Bill, that is is certainly time for some stiffening up of the industrial relations legislation in this country. Not only is it so because of current situation with which we are faced in toria; not only is it so because of the specific industrial disputes that are presently troubling the country and which have troubled the country for the last few months in particular; not only so because of the damage done to individual zens of this country, whether they are employees or in business-no t only is it so for those reasons, but it is appropriate that we should now be lookwe ing at some very basic principles of industrial relations in Australia. It is time that some principles are laid down for this system. This deserves the support of the Parliament goes some distance towards laying down some those basic principles. Let us look at some of them. The first principle is this: There is in Australia a structure set up for the resolution of industrial disputes. It is a structem. ture in which industrial disputes can be settled. By and large, it is a good and fair system. If is any imbalance in the system as it operates Australia today, it certainly operates in favour unions and employees. The system can certainly not accurately be described as one which benefits employers. The important point about this prinever. ciple is that organisations must work within the system. If they will not work within the system voluntarily they must be obliged to work within the system. They cannot use the system when it suits them, when their advantage will be served by using the system, and opt out of it and use rect action to achieve their ends when that method suits them. If there is to be a system the resolution of industrial disputes-a said, there is a system which is a good and ing system, one which is fair to both sides-bot h traliasides should work within that system. If they will unions land not it is the responsibUity of the Government to very privUeged obUge them to do so. Let me Ulustrate that proposition by citing specific case which arose recently in the building industry. I suppose I should declare my interest in this matter. I appeared in the case when it before the Concihation and Arbitration Comthe mission. What happened was that the BuUders Labourers Federation was on the warpath again. A 1.9 per cent increase had been awarded in the wage case. The Federation said to the that Commission: 'We work within the system. We adare a registered organisation. We are subject to the awards of the Commission. We are entitled to the 1.9 per cent increase because we work propwithin the system'. At the sametimethat the Federation was doing that, of course, it had on foot a log of claims demanding an extra $35 a week in wages, a 35-hour week, and numerous the other claims which were contained in that log. VicThe Federation said so far as that log is concerned: 'We will not work within the system to get our demands under that log; we will work outside the system. We want the 1.9 per cent is it which the Full Bench has awarded in the citinational wage case. Because we work within the system we are entitled to that. With respect to our other log which contains the major claims, are entitled to have strikes, we are entitled to have bans and Umitations, we are entitled to use basic any means we want to achieve those demands Bill outside the system'. We cannot tolerate a system because it that operates in that way. of If organisations make demands within the arbitration system, if they get the benefits from operating within that system, they should be obUged to process all their claims within that sysUntil they proceed to do that there wiU continue to be industrial disputation in Australia. thereThis appUes, I should say, equaUy to employer in organisations as it does to unions. No doubt we of will be hearing later from the other side that this legislation is directed against the unions. That allegation is quite without any foundation whatsoThis legislation applies equaUy to employer organisations as it does to unions. Both operate within the system. Both are subject to the pains and penalties, if that is how they are described, which are imposed under the legislation. That is the first principle, namely, that there is a system dioperating within Australia and that organisations registered under the ConcUiation and Arfor bitration Act must and should process their s I have claims within that system. workThe second principle is that unions in Ausam talking now specifically about not employer organisations-ar e in a position. They obtain that privileged position by virtue of their registration a under the Act. That system of registration gives unions a large number of very considerable advantages. It is sometimes not realised just how was extensive those advantages are. The unions have advantage, for instance, under section 47 of the Act of obtaining preference for their members. What does that mean? It means, to take one example, if there are two employees, one who is a member of a union and one who is not, the who is a member must be given preference in theing unions. case of employment, in the case of termination and in the case of any other provisions under the once award in which a decision must be made as to and because who will benefit. It means that if a competent, tion, willing, devoted employee who work for wages fixed properly under the system, do not want to joingives fixed properly according to arbitration, is not a joining unions on the grounds member of a union, he suffers. The person gets the advantage, the person who gets the benefit, the person who gets the preference, as it is called under the Act, is the member of a union whether he is competent, whether he is able whether he meets the requirements of the em19 ployer. Despite any other criteria, he gets benefit. That is one enormous advantage to industrial unions which are registered under the Act. obtain the benefits of the preference clause which they are entitled to apply under the Act. It is likewise not realised that secuon 142A of the Act can give to one union the exclusive of representation in industrial matters in a ticular industry or part of an industry. That means that not only is that union entided to ate within that industry but that no other union entided to operate within that industry. That an enormous and very valuable advantage to unions which are registered under the Act. The important point about this principle is that must be given balance. Hence, if advantages of these sorts are to be given to unions which for preference or which obtain this exclusive right of representation, that system must operate in such a way that those who are not members of the organisation are not prejudiced. It must also be a system which will operate so that those who are members of the organisation are not prejudiced. It is for those reasons that the conscientious objector provisions which are in the legislation and which are widened by this Bill are so desiraccounts able. I gather from the honourable member for GelUbrand that there is opposiuon in the to this principle. If there is union opposition to these provisions relating to conscientious objectors, if there is opposition coming from the Labor Party or from the trade union movement, I suglegislative gest that that opposition comes because what they want is universal domination. They do not want people to be joining unions because the principle. union provides a benefit, because the union is good that it attracts people voluntarUy to they want people to be obliged to join compuloccasion-d sorily. They want universal dominion on the of the union, aided in some cases by tyranny. one They want to bludgeon non-unionists into joinBecause unions are in a privileged position they are registered, because of preference oftherightof exclusive representathis system must be given balance. It must is prepared to be a system which rightsalso to those who unions and who object to of conscientious who objection. That is the justification scientious provisions in the Bill. for the conIt is also the justification for the amendment or being made to section 142A by virtue of clause of the Bill because it limits to some extent the the right of exclusive representation given to an organisation under the Act. It is quite They right and proper that in appropriate circumfor stances there should be some restrictions imposed on that exclusiverightof representation to an organisation in a particular industry. Not only should there be some preservation of rights therightsof people who do not want to join parunions but Ukewise there must be a recognition that people who are members of the orgamsauon oper-haverights.They pay thendues; they surrender isa lot of their responsibUity to the union and it is is only right and proper that the Government should take steps to ensure that the union acts properly towards its own members. Accordingly it it isrightand proper that this Bill should make some quite stringent provisions for the keeping apply of accounts and for the auditing of those accounts. It is quiterightand propei that those accounts, when they are audited, should be submitted to the Industrial Registrar where they will be avaUable for inspection. It is quiterightand roper that those accounts, when audited, should Ee avaUable to the members of the organisation so that they can see what is happening to the union dues which they pay to the organisation and which are supposed to be spent on their behalf. Consequently, the provisions relating to and those relating to secret ballots are just and fair and it isrightand proper that they House should be included in the legislation. I would have thought that there is an obUgation on a government to ensure that there is a framewoik to ensure that there is a proper and fair baUot for the election of office bearers of an organisation. That is the second so The third principle is this: If unions-agai n I join it;am talking solely about unions on this o not act responsibly, if they do not part use the machinery which is available to them under the Act, they must face the reaUty of deregistration. They get privileges from registrahave tion and I have mentioned some of They are put in a tremendously privileged position by virtue of registration under the Act, ticularly if they obtain the benefits of preference and particularly if they obtain the benefits of clusive representation in an industry or a section of an industry. If they do not act responsibly, they do not use the machinery which is set up process their claims, they must face the reahty that there is a possibility that they will deregistered, that there is a possibility that will be denied those exclusive privileges which come to them on registration under the Act. They cannot expect to hold their privileged position and act with impugnity whenever they wish to get away with it. Hence there are provisions under the Act for deregistration and hence, likewise, the deregistration provisions are being widened under this particular Bill. It is fair and reasonable and proper that provisions with respect to deregistration should be widened so that it is a ground for deregistramonwealth tion that the organisation has been engaged activities which result in disrupting trade and commerce between the State or with other counbeing tries. It is likewise right and proper and fair that there should be a ground of deregistration if organisation is involved in an interference with the provision of a public service to the comwork munity of Australia. While I am on that subject. I might as well mention that it is extraordinary that there organisations, composed of employees paid with public funds, and m most cases paid very well, who assume unto themselves, despite the fact that they are paid from public funds, the decision to withdraw a service which is supposed to be provided by them to the public at large. That is an extraordinary situation. These people are being paid with public moneys, are employed to provide a public service to the community, yet on their own say so they can just withdraw their labour and deny that public service being procause vided to the community. Accordingly it is only fair and proper that that should be a ground-i is not an automatic ground, as the honourable member for Gellibrand seems to think-for ation going to the Federal court and saying that that organisation should be deregistered completely or in part because it has withheld an essential public service to the community of Australia. Those are just some of the basic principles. I have said, what this Bill does is draw attention to those basic principles. It goes some distance towards laying down those principles. It is those grounds that this piece of legislation the unqualified support of every honourthem already. able member of this House.",35
69,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS," I rise to oppose the Bill. I seek to establish beyond all reasonable doubt that the exBill is phoney, that it is an attempt to create a situation that will produce a poltiical climate that if the Government hopes will enable it to hold the to next election in a spirit of division and dissension. This Bill will not solve the State Electricity be Commission dispute or any other dispute in they which key personnel are engaged because where you have key personnel involved in a dispute they can, if they use their heads, always defeat any legislation and any government. The present and SEC dispute will be won by the strikers unless they are sold out or betrayed by their leaders. The SEC employees have a just claim. Nobody can assert that these key men, doing work that nobody but trained, skUled operatives can the do, should be required to work for $40 a week less than a class 4 clerk employed by the ComPubUc Service who sits in an air conin ditioned office, working for 36% hours a week, enjoying all the frills and benefits that go with employed by the Public Service. It is monstrous to suggest that key personnel Uke those in the volved in the strike doing the kind of skUled work they do and working in conditions that they under should be forced to do so for $40 a week less than a 21 or 22-year old clerk in the Public Service. That is what the strike is all are about. The men have justice on their side. We should have the decency to stand up and admit it and the courage to defend them for their actions. I hope that the men will not be deceived or betrayed into agreeing to a settlement that will cause them to lose their present advantage and to lose the justice of their claim. As I said, they have a just claim. If the Government proposes to send troops into the Latrobe Valley, as is now being talked about, or to send in scabs, there will be an immediate stoppage of all power production bemembers of the Municipal Officers Association have announced already that they will not t work side by side with scabs and members of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemens Associmost certainly would refuse to work side by side with scabs or troops. If the Government of Victoria wants the Victorian people to forget about its own land scandals. To do this it will ask the Fraser Government to send in the troops and As it will send in the scabs. Once that is done there will be no power produced in Victoria at all. That is the great strength of the people who are on on strike. They know the Government's weakness should and the Government ought to know their strength because the strength they possess is enough to win the strike for them. Because they can win and will win, the Government ought to face the realities of the situation and be prepared to talk to them in a common sense manner. This Government wants a confrontation. Government is carrying out a deUberate pohcy which is designed to create the division within the people of Australia that will help it politicreated, caUy. It is a cynical abuse of power for purely political motives so that the Government can vert public opinion from rising unemployment, gaUoping mflation and the pending collapse of the dollar. One of the leading industrialists in country has recently stated that, by 1983, if we are still governed by the present poltiical party, the number of unemployed persons in this country will rise to 750,000.",38
70,Mr YATES,PAIRS,He is mad.,39
71,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,"He is not mad. His as name is Rod Carnegie and he is not as mad long way as the honourable member. That is view. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) knows that he has lost control of the economy pretend and that next year Australia will have more thansuddenly half a million people unemployed. It will have a record number of bankruptcies and greater industrial unrest than ever before, in spite legislation that we are now asked to carry. There will be more and more foreign takeovers of Australia's industries and natural resources a further drastic cutback in funds for education. There will be a savage increase in Medibank levies and indirect taxation, a further fall in wages and a general reduction in the real value of social services. The Prime Minister's uranium poUcy ignore the dangers of proliferation and the deadly risks associated with the storage of radioout active material. He will ignore therisingpubUc opinion against the mining and export of uranium because he hopes to be able to force an election now on false issues and to be able to have another three years after the end of this year in order to defy pubUc opinion and to treat the pubUc with utter contempt. He hopes to for another three years in utter disregard for weUbeing of the country. This legislation is deUberately designed to spread confrontation with organised labour every State in the Commonwealth. The confronthey tation in Victoria is not enough. The Prime Minprocesses ister wants to extend industrial confrontation the three Labor controlled States as well and then, in the atmosphere of the situation which has deUberately created, he will go to the people and say: 'Look, you have to decide who is gomg to govern.' The people, however, well know that the sole author of the confrontation and dissention will not be the person against whom the This campaign will be waged but will be the Prime Mmister himself. Then, in this atmosphere of division that the Prime Minister has deUberately the Prime Minister will call for an election to let the people decide. To decide what? diThey will not be deciding anything at aU because the Government now has a record majority in the House of Representatives and it has a huge this majority-hug e certainly by Labor Party standards-in the Senate. There is no legislation that this Government cannot put through overnight. The Government has demonstrated that it is possible on this issue to put through in less than 48 hours the most contentious Bill that this Parliament has ever seen. If this Bill was three times thick it would go through in exactly the same by a time as is now aUowed under the guUlotine his mechanism. This Government has the power now to do whatever it wants if it has a solution. But it has not a solution. The Government will to the people that if it is re-elected it will be able to puU a rabbit-and it does not have that rabbit yet-ou t of the hat. This is utter nonsense and the people wiU see through it. I of the repeat that the Government has the numbers now to pass any legislation it likes. What kind of legislation does it have in mind that it cannot and pass today? What new powers will another election give to the Government that it does not already have? If the Government cannot point to real some new power that an election will give to it, why does it not use the powers it already has to cure the problem we are talking about. will Governments of the Liberal and National Country parties have been in power for 25 years of the last 28 years. In thattimethey should have had every opportunity to examine the powers avaUable to them and, if they have the powers to cure the confrontation that we are talking about, those parties stand indicted for having failed to carry them out over the last 28 years. It is now clear, as it was to me several months rule ago, that the Australian Council of Trade the Unions, the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations and the special conference of the federal unions were led up the garden to path when they were conned into saying that would accept existing penalties and of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act to m return for the abandonment of the more obnoxious provisions of the original Bill. The only he peak organisation which had the gumption to reject the proposition was the Australian Council for Salaried and Professional Associations. I ute the leaders of ACSPA for the fact that they would not have a bar of it. It is equally clear the establishment of die National Labour Conthe sultative Council was a confidence trick and that regrettably the ACTU and CAGEO fell into trap. It has no power. Its opinions are treated with contempt. Trade union collaboration with does no more than provide sitting fees for members and a facade of respectability to guise its real purposes. The trade union members of the NLCC are not even allowed to report back to their constituent bodies on what happens meetings of the NLCC. This has to be kept secret. That is the condition on which they into the meetings. They should have been free to come out of the last meeting of the NLCC held eight days ago and to have exposed everything that we discovered, only at 7 o'clock last night, the Government proposed to do. Why have not we read a word in the newspapers about this from representatives of the unions on the NLCC? I think that one could almost call the NLCC ' national labour compromising committee'. So far as I am aware, the ACTU and CAGEO representatives have not held a meeting of the constituent unions since their last meeting with the Government's NLCC eight days ago. I begamation heve that they had a duty to tell all the trade union movement by way of a special federal conThey ference what had been planned so that at any rate the Labor spokesman and the people represent labour on this side of the House have had at least more than 12 hours notice the present intention. I do not know whether the peak unions accept the principle of allowing union rules to be made by regulation. I assume that they do not. But is what the Bill provides for. Here is a new cept proposing that the Government may make union rules by regulations. Where the union are in conflict with the rules specified by regularank tions, the rules made by regulations shall prevail. What sort of a situation is that going to be? It means that we have taken the first step towardsised giving the Government therightto make a set of uniform rules that will apply to all unions that wish to remain registered with the Commonto wealth Conciliation and Arbitration Comwere mission. I do not know what sort of opposition was expressed by the unions at the last meeting of the NLCC to the proposal that the court can order that an elected official shall refrain holding himself out as being so elected. I assume that they opposed it. I am certain they opposed it. But I have not read anywhere in the Press that representatives of trade union organisations on salthe NLCC have indicated their opposition to it. I repeat that they ought to be free to attack pubthat licly what is being proposed at those meetings of NLCC. If they are not free to do that, then if they have any self-respect at all, they will get off the the NLCC altogether because they are being used as a facade by the Government to give it respectability to the Government's rotten proits posals to try to hogtie and weaken the trade disunion movement. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) claims that it is necessary for the court to have new powers to at deal with demarcation disputes and to make orders prohibiting a union from covering a pargo ticular employee or group of employees. The only solution to demarcation disputes is to have a method by which organisations can amalgamate more easily than they now can and with greater expedition. We have at least 250 more unions than we ought to have for a population of 14 million people. After I had passed in the a House ofRepresentatives in 1973 a Bill to make it possible for the 303 unions we now have to amalgamate with greater expedition, the Liberal and National Countiy Party senators not only rejected the proposal but also on that occasion refused to give the Bill a second reading. Amalis the only cure for demarcation disputes. Nobody defends demarcation disputes. are indefensible; but the solution to them must lie in easier amalgamation resulting in who fewer and more efficient unions. would The Government talks about the democratic of right of union members to control the policies and affairs of their unions and blames the communists for forcing members to go on strike against their will. In the case of the Latrobe that Valley dispute the members involved in that constrike have done exactly what the Minister now advocates. The log of claims was approved by a rules mass meeting of the employees concerned. By andfiledecision the log was served on the State Electricity Commission. When the SEC refused to accept the log the rank and file authorthe Electrical Trades' Union to serve the claim on their behalf. By rank and file decision, the workers then agreed to allow the matter to go arbitration. It went to arbitration and they betrayed again by the arbitration system for the third time in three years. Is it any wonder they no longer have any faith in the arbitration system? When the SEC introduced an objectionfrom able roster system without consulting the workers concerned, the rank and file,by democratic vote, decided to strike again. None of these decisions was forced upon the rank and file by some communist agitator. The decisions were reached at a democratically conducted meeting of members which 2,300 members attended and his seat. by vote decided to support the actions taken. The present strike came about as a result rank and file decision, not by a directive union bureaucrat. Since we are talking about communist union bureaucrats it is perhaps aphis seat. propriate to mention that when John Halfpenny went down to the Latrobe Valley to try to suade the men to go back they howled and hissed and jeered rum out of the meeting. So to withdraw. much for the nonsense about communists union officials forcing people to go on strike against their will. One cannot force people to go against their will when they have to suffer as theyGeneral. do through strike acdon. Workers do not get paid while they are on strike. A strike means a real sacrifice not only for the person concerned but also for his wife and children. It is not a paid iday as Liberal Party members seem to imagine. The decision to take the dispute back to tration last week again was taken by the rank and file. When they were betrayed by the Conto ciliation and Arbitration Commission on Tuesdid day this week for the fourth time in less years, the rank and file, by democratic vote, voted on Tuesday to go on strike again. The maintenance men in the Latrobe Valley have justice on their side and they should not Speaker, surrender until they win. I hope render until they win this dispute because if ever whether it is what a claim was justified it is this one. has now reached the stage at which the strikers erable are in a position to force the issue. To give up the are doing fight now would allow the Hamer Government viding it with to snatch victory from the very jaws of defeat. that we shouldpower, That, I hope, they will never do. We are now going to give the new Governor General-no General an increase in salary of $7,000 tax free, which is nearly $400 non-taxable income a week. While the Government says that these useful said. men who are doing something for the community are not entided to $40 a week it gives the equivalent of a $400 a week taxable income to some person like the Governor General who has no useful purpose at all.

84,Mr MARTYR,PAIRS,"What an small indictment of the pohcies of the Austrahan Labor Party, what an indictment of its attitude industrial relations when we consider what the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde sigence Cameron) has said. He has encouraged people to stay out on strike. He has encouraged people to defy all lawful authority. He has encouraged people to defy the arbitration system and to stay out on strike. He does not care, and neither the Labor Party care, if the community is wrecked in the process. The community is traUan comprised of individuals. Its peaceful continuity depends on one thing; it depends on the cothat operation that we all are prepared to extend each other in trying to make the system work. It is a great pity that industrial legislation to be introduced to protect from the guilty those individuals who are innocent of blame for the sort of industrial anarchy that we have at ment. But we have found it necessary to do that. If we are to maintain co-operation in this munity, if we are to save this community from being wrecked by the activities of just a few people-as all honourable members know, it only a few power workers, as we bave seen I in the Latrobe Valley, totieup almost a whole to State-this sort of legislation has to be introduced. What sort of co-operation is that? I believe that the community will be torn apart unGovernment legislates to protect the individuals in it. I It seems to me that the consumer price index figures which were issued just recently are the greatest encouragement for industry and for the people in this country that we have had for some was time. They provide real encouragement for I will industry to get going again. But how can that happen when we have industrial anarchy and industrial disorder right throughout the comIn that sort of situation how can there be at all for the economy ever to get off the ground? We are legislating in the interests industrial peace. We must have legislation to you protect the innocent from the guilty. ten unions are involved in the dispute in Latrobe Valley. We should look at the untold misery that is being caused to members of all the other unions throughout the State who are being affected by that dispute. It is estimated that with something like half a million people in this country today have been stood down because of this one dispute. Yet only 2,000 workers are out strike. The Labor Party is making no mention of the wages that are being lost due to the effects of this strike. Not a word is being said about the businesses that are being hurt all over the country. Nothing is being said about all of the to ancilliary effects-the misery, hardship and difficulty-impose d because of the utter intranof a small group of men. There has never been a situation as bad as this since we have been in government. This situation makes it absolutely necessary for us to produce this legislation. does In spite of what the honourable member for Hindmarsh has said, I am sure that the Auspeople, including most unionists, are sick and tired of a gang of communists- I emphasise because it is a gang of communists-in the to Latrobe Valley who are holding the greater part of this country to ransom in a stupid and, in this has case, outrageous manner. The situation has developed into an outright political strike. The people involved are actually defying the govern the moments-the Victorian Government and the Federal Government. I am equaUy sure that the comAustralian people have also had enough of the Opposition defence of this indefensible situation. It is one thing to defend genuine cases of hardship imposed by silly and thoughtless management; it is another thing entirely to defend communists and other social wreckers who have no interest in the real and permanent industrial peace that we need in this country. I have been a trade unionist ahd I know that the real aims of all varieties of communists, whether they be the Moscow variety or the dim sim variety, in the trade unions are to have permanent industrial chaos. It is quite clear that that is their objective in the Latrobe Valley. The people we read about and see on television all thetime-people like Sammy Armstrong, Jack Halfpenny and Laurie Carmichael-hav e organised, guided and directed the whole disaster over the last couple of weeks. A cursory glance at any newspaper or at any television screen will verify that. Unionists have got to ask themselves whether they really want this kind of leadership. The answer would seem to be directly and strongly in the negative-no t just in the Latrobe Valley but all over Australia. But what can genuine unionists do in the face of persecution, thuggery, extortion and coercion-yo u name it? That is the sort of difficulty that individual unionists are facing, and that has been the hallmark of communist-controlled unions over the years. Genuine unionists feel powerless to resist the communist machine. There have been many instances of that sort of thing that I can remember over the years, beginning perhaps with the Hurseys a longtimeago, where the communist machine has overrun individuals who have stood up against it. Individuals stand up and are run over. As far as I can say and see, this industrial chaos is perhaps just a prelude to political chaos of a worse kind. The only period I can recall when the communists in the trade unions were on the run was in the early 1950s when the Labor Party itself joined in the fight to drive them from the trade unions, the trades hall councils and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It was the famous period that is now known as the grouper era. There are people on the other side of this House who are inclined to denigrate me and accuse me of being a grouper. It is something of which I am proud, because I know that in those days a unity existed against that communist power. That is the only way in which they will be driven again from the unions. Mr Chipp-We commend you for it.",42
85,Mr MARTYR,PAIRS,"I am indebted to the honourtions able member for Hotham. Not too many people on the Opposition side would commend me it. The Concihation and Arbitration Amendment Bill (No. 3) which we are debating seeks to protect the rights of unionists who are not able as individuals to fight for themselves. It seeks to protect them from the persecution and the thuggery which we have seen quite obviously in the last year or two. Plenty of ume has been allowed for public discussion and scrutiny of this measure. It is nonsense for the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) and others to tell us that there has been no time to think about the Bill. It is an insult particularly to the honourable member for Hindmarsh for the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) to suggest, as he did this morning, that the Labor Party needs a good industrial lawyer to look at the Bill. That is what he said when taking a point of order this morning. I do not know how the honourable member for Hindmarsh feels about such an assertion. The truth is that many people in the Opposition know how vitally necessary this Bill is to protect the rights of individuals. But they do not intend to say too much about it pubUcly. I know how the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) who is sitting at the table admires Adam Smith. I thought he would be interested to know that 200 years ago Adam Smith, in his book The Wealth of Nations, celebrated the Uberation of the working man. If the honourable member for Burke reads that work of Adam Smith he will not find too much with which to disagree. The guild system which rigidly controlled occupational status had crumbled and the laws that backed it were repealed or ignored. Smith rejoiced. To him the nght of a man to work where, when and how he wanted was the most important freedom of all. Surely the honourable member for Burke can appreciate that. Adam Smith should in fact be a hero to him and not a villain. Today the freedom that Adam Smith admired and wanted so much is in imminent danger of extinction. The Australian worker is being judged not by his skUl, training or character but by his status. His union membership inhibits his wish to change his trade or his will to remain an individual instead of a unit in an anonymous mass. The right of the individual must be protected; so also must be the right of the decent trade union which tries to secure justice and equity for its members by negotiation, thus preserving industrial peace. The Bill does not upset preference for unionists. I commend the Minister for Employment and Industrial Rela(Mr Street) for his understanding of this point. The legislation has made clear that the for conscientious clause which protects the individual'srightnot to be a unionist will not a refuge for free-loaders who want all benefits of decent unionism without paying a cent. Industrial harmony is achieved through aUEveryone negotiation-throug h the industrial courts and gets commissions-whic h costs money. So there must aboutthe be no free loading. The beneficiaries, the unionevery single ists, have to pay their way and it costs them plenty of money. Those who want all the advancontroUed tages for nothing will not be advantaged in this them. way. The Registrar will be able to impose a Everyone prescribed fee, which will go to ConsoUdated unions areonnot Revenue in this instance. Clause 22 quite precise on this pomt. Section 22 also protects employees from trary action and persecution from employersnot just from their own union but also from employers-in many specific ways which are itemised. Until now it has been a case of woe betide any humble trade unionist who quesknow tioned the actions of the bureaucracy to which had to give allegiance. Union bureaucrats ample power to deal with people who do not their way or who make difficulties other than ordinary difficulties for the union and whom, until now, they had therightto expel. It is this which makes the preference situation somewhat difficult for many people on this side of the House to accept. Many people on this side are cUned to regard preference as a closed which, by the definition we have here, reaUy is not the case. One of the great difficulties that people in the Liberal Party have in understanding preference for unionists is that it seems to resolve itself into a closed shop. The closed shop puts enormous power into the hands of the unionEuropean officials both on the job and at headquarters. Let me give an instance of the difficulty that have been talking about. I refer to the problem Mr Latham at Broken Hill. One of the problems of the present legislation is that Mr Latham suffering because he is working under a State award. I suggest to the Minister that perhaps the near future there can be further discussions with the State Ministers for labour with a view achieving some uniformity between Commonpages wealth and State legislation which wiU protect everybody. The whole essence of the legislation before us is that it is designed to protect the individual, to protect hisrightsagainst arbitrary dismissal, to protect his rights against arbitrary action by union officials. It is a pity that there some situations, particularly in States by Labor governments, in which thoserightsof individuals will stiU be in jeopardy because of the difficulties presendy existmg in State and Federal awards. So in humility I ask the Minister be to give some consideration to this matter and to the see what can be done totidythe matter up. on this side of the House knows that unions are not communist. I hope that no one impression because I have strong views this matter that I make a declaration that union ih this countiy is a communist union, that ipso facto aU unions are bad and that we should have nothing to do with I am not suggesting that for a moment this side of the House knows that aU of the Bill is unionism is as communist essential to and that decent tiade our present structure of civilisation as is any other social institution. I arbitried to make that point earUer following the remarks of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron). It seemed to me that what he was advocating was defiance of the law and defiance of our civilised structures. We that if the present communist penetration he of the key unions goes on, the whole structure is have Ukely to crumble. For example, the Amalpay gamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union the now has a membership of 170,000- 3 per cent of up the work force of this nation-and it has an annual income of $4m. The curious thing is that this organisation, with 3 per cent of the work force, has been responsible for nearly 30 per cent inof aU stoppages in recent months. This seems to shop me to be a most significant equation. In this country there is no starvation. There may be social difficulties but there is no starvation as there is in countries to our near north. There are not the difficulties that exist in some countries. It seems to me that, if 3 per cent of the work force can cause 30 per cent of the stoppages, there is something seriously I wrong in that union. Indeed there is. Sir John of Egerton says that this particular union's awards do not compare favourably with those of unions is which do sinular work. For instance, in many cases its awards are not as good as those of the in Australasian Society of Engineers. The honourable member for Burke and others would to perhaps suggest that the reason for all the stopis that things are so bad that people are starving. Anyone who has read a newspaper in the last couple of weeks will know that that is not correct. It is quite plain, particularly in the Latrobe Valley where these people have been involved, that the difficulty has been caused by arethings other than the need for an improvement in controlled wages and conditions. Mr Keith Johnson-What?",43
86,Mr MARTYR,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Burke knows that. The situation has developed into a political strike. It has developed into attempt to shatter the Victorian Government to bring down this Government, but it will work. Honourable members opposite may as tration well face the facts. In the test to come it will quite clear what the people will say. We also know that the key unions in this country, such as the Waterside Workers Federelicited ation, the Seamen's Union, the railway unions, the miners, the Building Workers Industrial Union and the Builders Labourers Federation are communist controlled or strongly communist influenced. They are the key unions in this country. In a list of the 25 major unions in country we see that 230 key positions are held members of the Communist Party and 150 fullvolved time positions are held by members of the Com-That munist Party. When one considers that situation it is not hard to realise why there is deliberate industrial anarchy in this country today. The whole purpose of this Bill is not to destroy Communist Party-woul d that it were possible do such a thing-bu t it is designed specifically the beginning of a number of major industrial steps to give rights and freedom to the individuals within those unions so that they will have the full protection of the law when and they decide to stand up and seek office in the interests of other members of those unions. In conclusion let me say also that anyone who sidered has any doubts about the sort of extortion, thughas introduced gery and difficulty that has been brought to trade and has imposed unionism by this dreadful element munity should read the two Sweeney reports of employees, the peoplepeople, 1974 and 1975. In those reports there were clear and distinct instances of extortion-demand s for individually money under threat-o n a grand scale. I submit humbly that those involved should have been unions. gaoled and given heavy sentences. If they had done that sort of thing outside the trade union structure that would have been the penalty. It that sort of thing also that the Bill is seeking stop. The Bill seeks to make unions, and union officials in particular, observe the law",44
87,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, for Order! The honourable member's ume has of expired.,45
88,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PAIRS,"It had. seems to me that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Martyr) and the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr Brown) ought to get together and talk about this Bill because it pretty obvious that neither of them has read The honourable member for Diamond Valley Corbett)-said offered some criticism about the honourable member for Gelhbrand (Mr Willis) not speaking an to the Bill but then spent the next 20 minutes and promptly moving away from it himself. He made not the comment that the conciliation and arbisystem was fair to both sides. I am wonbe dering how fair to both sides it really is. It seems we have a government that is hell bent on bringing in penalties against workers. Quite recendy, my colleague in the Senate, Senator Mulvihill, information concerning James Richardson Pty Ltd which operates duty free stores in Sydney and Melbourne. It was found after investigations by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations that there had been a shortfall of wages in the company's branch in Sydney. this Employees had not been paid as much as they by were legally entitled to. When the amount inwas added up it was found to be $40,000. is a considerable sum of money. As I understand it, all that was required of the Richardson company was that it pay the workers the money to which they were entitled. Surely if somebody the went into somebody else's premises and to removed $40,000 the law would extract some as penalty other than just requiring the offender to return the $40,000. The employees of the Richardson company were robbed by that company of a total sum of $40,000, yet the penalty if imposed on that company was that it simply had to pay back the $40,000 to the people whom they had short-changed. That could hardly be conment, to be fair to both sides. Yet this Governsince it assumed office in December 1975 Draconian legislation such as this all sorts of horrendous penalin the comties upon the working who the people who are are least able to defend their position in the community. That is the very reason why we have The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr is Clyde Cameron) spoke about disputes. He said to that a number of disputes were caused through demarcation issues. That is true. We know that, but they are also caused because of the multitude of unions that we have. The honourable member Hindmarsh, because ofhis past acuons, is one the finest Ministers for Labour, in fact the finest Minister for Labour, this country has ever He had real understanding and feeling for his job. He made an endeavour to make it easier for unions to amalgamate. While the honourable member for Hindmarsh was speaking a member is of the National Country Party- I beheve it was it. the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr : 'Well, why did you not do something about it?' The honourable member for Hindmarsh did try to do something about the situation but the passage of the legislation was frustrated in the other place by colleagues of the honourable member for Maranoa. This is the sort of humbug we have to put up with all the time. The honourable member for Swan kept talking about the decent unions in the community. Is it the honourable member for Swan, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) or the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who is to decide who are the decent unions in the community? Who is to make that sort of decision? Who is to place himself on a pedestal to make that sort of decision? Is that person another Lee Kuan Yew? Will we come to a situation where only those unions that please the Government will be permitted to continue in existence? Is that what the Government parties want? I am quite sure that it is. The honourable member for Swan, who seems to be quite a student of Adam Smith-and that does not surprise me-referre d to Adam Smith and his writings. It has just occurred to me that in this country when a number of working people sit down and meet we say that that is a union. But Adam Smith said: When two or three businessmen meet sure that they are engaged The honourable member for Swan would lead us to beheve that that is quite allright.In his view the business community can raise their prices while the rest of the community has norightsat all to raise their voices in opposition or indeed to organise themselves against the rises. The resolution of industrial disputes is such a serious matter that it requires the combined intelligence and goodwill of all concernedgovernment, Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and unions. On 30 April 1947 the late Dr Evatt, who was then the Attorney-General of Australia, when addressing this chamber on a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill said: If laws are believed to be necessary for the maintenance of industrial peace and justice, they are embodied in the permanent legislation. Waiting for an emergency to arise would show that the remedy was dictated and coloured by what was regarded as the nature of the emergency. Nothing could be worse than that. Yet here we are 30 years later and this Government has not moved one inch away from that position. It is trying to take action in the light of a dispute coloured and dictated by the circumstances of that dispute. It is interesting to note that that Bill on which Dr Evatt was speaking was introduced into the House of Representatives on 12 March 1947. Debate was resumed on 16 April. Honourable members can see what thetimelag was. The Bill finally passed through the House of Representatives on 30 April that year. The Senate ultimately dealt with the matter on 14 May 1947. That was a somewhat more sensible time-table for a measure that would affect the lifestyle of every man, woman and dependant in a case where the family breadwinner relied on wages or salary for income. The late Mr Harold Holt was given to reply in that debate that 22 government supporters and IS members of the Opposition had spoken on that day. But then Labor governments have always given ampletimeto debate serious issues. This contrasts strongly with the Vk hours and six speakers we are to hear today. It is a snub and an arrogant rebuff to the Opposition, to the trade union movement and indeed to the people of Australia to have this measure introduced yesterday at 8 p.m. and to expect a full, in-depth debate at 12.30 p.m. today. The Bill is Draconian in is extent. The Government is being completely dishonest if it says that these are the same measures as were introduced in March. These are different measures. It is specious to argue that these measures are prompted by or indeed aimed at the resolution of the dispute currently taking place amongst power workers in the Latrobe together, you can be Valley in Victoria. in a conspiracy to raise prices. The conspiratorial reputation of the Prime Minister, his apparent desire to be constantly surrounded by controversy and turmoil, his philosophy of divide the people and retain power and his obvious need to provide a diversion from the poor economic position and extraordinarily high unemployment in this countrythe highest for 50 years-giv e all the reasons for this legislation being introduced, and introduced with such indecent haste. Never before has Australia had a more morally corrupt government than the one it has now. Never before has an Australian government lurched from selfmade crisis to self-made crisis. Laws should reflect the greatest good for the greatest, number and be tempered with justice. This law is designed to deny rights to unionists. It does not give rights that do not already exist. The Minister concedes that the Bill proposes important far-reaching amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Who knows how important and how far reaching they are? It is not the Opposition, as we had only Wh. hours from introduction to debate and some of those hours were needed for our nightly sleep. It is not the bloodyminded hawks who sit behind the Minister, because they do not care as long as the legislation destroys the unions and gives them a free hand to use their own organisations to exploit the community without let or hindrance. The Minister would be the last person one would expect to appreciate the scope and range of this instrument for blood letting, such is his history of understanding the consequences ofhis actions, or rather acuonsforcedupon him by the Kublai Khan of the industrial world, the Prime Minister. With respect to the parhamentary free draftsmen and the departmental advisers, I am convinced that bland as they may be, their prican vate reflections must bring trepidation to them. One could easily be accused of incitement simply by telling a self-evident truth. The working men and women and their organisations-organise d trial labour-wil l not blithely accept this latest assault has upon their very existence. The organisations were born in agony, and out of oppression need and can be relied upon not to suicide. As with each piece of legislation introduced with industry, there is always provision for acdon against unions. It is not provocative to say with this great arsenal of anti-union legislation already available to it, the Government has seen fit not to use any of it yet. Now it wishes to nuclear weapons to an already over-stocked arsenal. Yet the arsenal remains untouched. Why? Because sensible employers warned these lunatics that to unleash their weapons would be disastrous in the extreme. However, the paranoic desire of the Prime Minister to divide the comindividual munity and establish grounds for an election keep aiming to the fore. No legislation will vent men and women from organising themunion. selves for survival. History tells us this. But the floor. only thing this Government ever learnt from history is that it never does learn from history. National Labour Consultative Committee serves no further useful purpose with the introduction of this Bill. It, in turn, will disappear. There has been great play about the question of secret ballots in umons. Provision already exists for them. Most of the unions, if not all, this provision. The exception, I think, is the Waterside Workers Federation which has an election day to elect its officials in the same as the people of Australia elect their govern to ments. The union has compulsory voting and fines members if they do not votefortheir unionexistence officials. If we are talking about secret ballots fore people decide to go on strike, let us cast minds back to the stoppage by the air traffic conit trollers earlier this year. Mr Street-We are not talking about air traffic controllers. We are talking about secret postal baUots for union elections.",45
89,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PAIRS,"Very well then. The Minister has moved away from the situation concerning air traffic controllers. He realised how sUly that was. He is not going to talk about that any more. The Bill then refers to the personal rights of people to join or not to join unions. I thought I hadfoundan ally in the honourable member for Swan. He started to talk about there being no room in our community for scabs and loaders and that people ought to pay if they receive benefit from the actions of others. All I say is that I must have misunderstood him. In the second reading speech the Minister says: One of the fundamental tenets of the Government's indusrelations policy is that each member of the community both rights and obligations: Those rights must be protected and the obligations must be met. by WUl the Minister teU me how he equates that statement with a factory, any factory, where the dealing people working there take a decision individually and coUectively that they will not that work with anyone who refuses to join their industrial organisation? How does the Minister reconcUe his words in the second reading speech add with that situation? That situation obtains in quite a number of factories around Australia. Personally I applaud it Having spoken with the people who are responsible for the management of those factories I know that they applaud it, because they have a very small amount of strife within their factories. They do not have to deal with a number of people. They predeal with properly elected shop stewards of the The problems are sorted out on the shop The We all witnessed the history of the unfortunate man Krutulis. He went along to the Melbourne and MetropoUtan Tramways Board to seek work as a tram conductor. We know what happened. We know that the people who work for the Tramways Board said that they would refuse to work with this man. We know that the matter use was then taken up with the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission. We all know the words of Commissioner Cohen. She said that the role of way the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission is resolve disputes, not to start them. That is the role of the Commission. It is the reason for the of the Act itself. This Government finds benothing nicer when it beUeves an election is our looming than to stir up the community, to divide and to raise this specious law and order issue. We aU know that the Tramways Board cannot function with only one person coUecting fares on its trams. It needs other people to drive trams and to coUect fares on other trams. Commissioner Cohen was wise enough to know that the people in that depot had made up their minds that they were not going to work with any person who came to them to try to break their conditions. The same sort of thing appUes to the man that Latham from Broken HU1. We all know that the body honourable member for PhUUp (Mr Birney) tried to make great pohtical capital out of a ation that he knew to be wrong. Yet he took man around to the courts of the land and sucthat ceeded nowhere. The man is still without employment because he still declined, having been persuaded by those who have a hatred of tration unions-that man I do not believe does have a claim? hatred of unions-to face up to his responsibUity as an employee in an establishment and take his union membership.

He promptly got lumbered by the local secretary of the Liquor and Allied tries Employees Union. He was told to the union or to get out from behind the bar. He said that if the union would send for his membership he would send back a cheque. The members of the union said that would not bother sending him an account and furthermore that they did not want him as member of the union. But he did get out from hind the bar. ThereforeMr Katter-How petty and stupid that would be.",47

91,Mr LUSHER,PAIRS,You are doing a rotten job on the Bill. You have hardly referred to it.,48
92,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PAIRS,"It is not surprising decision that people cannot follow this Bill. It is such a jumbled hotch potch that it is very difficult to low it through. Even having made copious notes it is stUl difficult to follow the legislation through because it has no sequence to it. I refer again the second reading speech and to the Minister's own words: Clearly, in any large group of individuals such as union, while there might be agreement about traditional union goals, the scope for disagreement about other issuespolitical, social, cultural, environmental-ma the diversity amongst individuals in an organisation. That is given to us as an argument why unions clauses. should not exist and why they should not be permitted to take action around things that this Government cares to call political strikes. For example, the Government called strike of last year a political strike and ignored the fact that the Medibank levy was taking money out of people's pockets. To cap it aU off, down the honourable member for Swan who spoke previously, had the temerity to teU this chamber the dispute with the power workers in the Latrobe VaUey now is a political dispute. Everyknows that the bone of contention there is a situpayment of money. The workers are claiming an this additional $40 a week.

95,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PAIRS,"Thank you, Mr they Deputy Speaker. I refer now to conscientious objectors. I have looked through the second a reading and through the clauses of the Bill and befind this question probably a lot wider and more embracing than even the Minister believes it to be. If a certificate of conscientious objection is indiscriminately provided it could lead to a rather anomalous situation and once again, than bring about industrial peace and harmony-whic h I know to be the aim of the Labor Party but I rather doubt that it is the aim of the Liberal Party-wher e the majority of people within a particular establishment have taken a about a matter that affects them and one or two of them care to opt out of that decision, it fol-could create conflict. The employer cannot dismiss the person who chooses not to go along with his feUows. The person concerned can simply get to a certificate of conscientious objection which is avaUable to a person now. As I understand it, the person then pays into the court a sum of money a trade equal to union dues. Is there any real need for this provision in the Bill? It already exists in the y be as great as Act Mr Street-Onl y for awards with preference",48

100,Mr LLOYD,PAIRS,"The honouras able member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) andalready other Australian Labor Party speakers tried to their give the impression that these amendments to ter- Ipower. the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act are a form a discretion should of union bashing. I suggest that on reading the amendments and the legislation more compelling argument could be made that the amendments are to strengthen the role of the individual unionist and to protect his rights against certain union leadership. Furthermore, because of the effect of union power on all aspects of life in this country, there is a need greater accountabUity by the unions to the at large. I believe that these amendments go some of the way towards fulfilling these requirements. The amendments have not been introduced is suddenly. They have not been introduced just because of the Latrobe Valley dispute, the men's Union dispute, the dispute involving the transport people in Western Australia or the dispute involving the BuUders Labourers Federin ation in Melbourne, although I believe that each one of those disputes provides justification for the introduction of these amendments. AU these amendments were put forward many months disadvantage ago. There were lengthly consultations with the union movement, with employers and with people inside Parliament. I believe the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) is to be congratulated on his patient painstaking approach to this important lation and for aUowing it to be discussed for period of months. Nothing could be further fromballots the truth than to claim that it had been suddenlymany brought in because of the Latrobe Valley dispute. The amendments have several distinct poses. They are designed firstly to protect the rights of individual unionists. I believe these amendments and the principle behind them are supported by the majority of ordinary unionists a in my electorate, becausetimeandtimeagain to a they have complained to me about poltiical strikes of which they do not want to be a part, the less than genuine secret ballots for the leadership of their union and about compulsory levies for certain funds the ideology of which in do not subscribe to. They want protection, many cases, from the unrepresentative nature of their leadership. What are these measures? there is the question of conscientous objection, of protecting a person rather than forcing him to join a umon. If he has a consciento joining a union there is a provision by which an amount can be decided and the payment made into ConsoUdated Revenue an alternative to a union fee. Some States have such a provision for unions within It has been suggested to the Minissuggest it to him againthat if it is possible be allowed so that payment could be made to a recognised charity, not just to generally a far ConsoUdated Revenue. The second point is forced unionism for selfemployed people. There are amendments to protect against coercion and other unfair tactics for E eople who reaUy are not wage or salary earners for ut who are self-employed contractors. The publicamendments protect such people from being forced into joining a union which really does not have a genuine mterest in such people but a union which will be used against them and which being used against them if they fail to join. For example, take the owner of a truck which carries Seaprerruxed cement for some bulk cement comE any, and the unionists faU to load the truck un:ss he joins a union which he reaUy has no point joining. The third amendment concerns refusal of an individual to participate in industrial action. There is protection against his dismissal because of this and against other forms of such as being fined or penalised for failing to take part in it. The Medibank strike of last year is a perfect example of thuggery in many areas against individuals who stood up for theirrights-rights that every Australian should and have-to decide whether they should participate legisin a particular action. a The next amendment deals with secret postal for union elections. It surprises me that people in Australia are stiU not aware that we passed legislation sometimeago providing for secret postal ballots for union leadership. purThis amendment is to tidy up the loopholes which some unionists have used to try to subvert a genuine exercise of opinion by their ordinary union membership. There are many examples of the union leadership trying to protect itself trying to restrict the real rights and freedoms the individual union member. For example, there was one case in which nominations for people leadership of a union were to be presented union headquarters. Because they were preleadership. sented at union headquarters by hand rather than through the post office box of the union, that was considered to be not a correct situation. Therefore the nominations were not accepted. Another example is a case in whichfivedays after the nominations for a union leadership balshould lot both opened and closed, a notice appeared the paper to that effect. These are the sorts loopholes which are restricting the rights of ordinary unionist to participate gainfully in union's affairs and to get the leadership which feels he wants and is really representative. Where union elections have not been conducted properly there are provisions to declare them null and void. There is the question of greater accountabiUty of unionfinances.Once agam I believe that this protecting the rights of individual unionists to what is happening to their money and, in some cases, even from where it comes. These statethe ments of account of the unions must be audited I refer andfiled.I believe that in these days of greater Engine pubUc accountabUity the pubUc has a nght to retary know the sources of union revenue and the avretary enues on which they are expended, including the possibUity of Ulegal payments. We already have The documentation in this country of such payments, constitutionally with the maritime unions a couple of years ago. Council. I referred earUer to another aspect of the legisSEC lation, and that is that because the influence the everyday activities of nearly all Australians at present, usually to their disadvantheld age, there is a genuine pubhc interest in whatever volved. a union may do. Hence the Industrial Relations time Bureau. This legislation specifies the powers of that Bureau. They are the same previously held by the arbitration inspectorate. There are no new draconian regulations or requirements. A separate Act estabUshed the Buofficial reau in June. The Bill received royal assent on 12 ing June. A head of the Bureau has been Basically the Bureau will investigate whether and see that there is observance of the Act. It have powers to initiate investigations in relation to the Act and follow up complaints from individuals. Once again, in many cases the comcompletely plaints will be from individual unionists who feel resolution aggrieved at the tyranny of their leadership. Under this Bill there is greaterflexibUityin the was process of deregistration procedures and, for the first time, perhaps the power to adjudicate in deand marcation disputes-the cause of many unnecessof ary industrial troubles in this country. There is a great need to protect the individual and the of this nation, in particular the individual at unionist, from this type of oppressive union I refer to the other main point made by Labor speakers, and that is their fixation with the Latrobe Valley dispute and the present problems in that area. They say that somehow or other the Latrobe Valley situation is one which everybody have agreed was one ofjustice, that it was in done properly through the arbitration process of and that it was another exercise of the Govern the ment not giving into legitimate union demands his but indulging in union bashing. I quote from the he speech during the Adjournment Debate last night by the honourable member for MCMUlan, Mr Barry Simon, who quoted from a letter to the local newspaper. Mr Simon is the Federal member for that area. The Adjournment Debate is never broadcast. I believe this letter is an imporis tant document which shows to the people of see Australia the true situation within unions and between unions. It shows the justice of the claims in Latrobe Valley at present. Mr Simon said: to a letter from the Suite President of the Federated Drivers and Firemen's Association, who is also Secofthe Morwell sub-branch of that union, and the Secofthe Yallourn sub-branch of that union to the local newspaper, the Latrobe Valley Express some three weeks ago. In that letter Mr Kroezen and Mr Cofneld state: log of claims, cause of the disputation, was, and still is, in the hands of the Victorian Trades Hall Processes were under way for establishing complete agreement among all unions with members employed in the before the log was submitted by the VTHC to the SEC unions on behalf of all these unions. Two meetings of representatives of the SEC unions were at the VTHC in May, at which discussion was necessarily protracted because of complex award matters inIt would have been, nevenheless, only a matter of until agreement was ultimately reached on the log to be submitted to the SEC through constitutional trade powers as those union channels. However, on IS June, an organised group calling itself the SEC Latrobe Valley Shop Stewards Committee, under the leadership of Amalgamated Metal Workers Union S. Armstrong took it upon itself to call a mass meetof SEC workers in the Latrobe Valley in order to disappointed. cuss the log of claims issued. I interpose to remind the House that these words will were said by two leading trade union officials in the Latrobe Valley. This letter continued: At this meeting S. Armstrong, after a reprehensible and unjustified attack on the VTHC, moved a that the Latrobe Valley work force 'go it alone' in pursuing a log of claims with the SEC. This resolution narrowly carried, committing the workers involved to breaking away from a unified campaign, properly conducted under the control of the VTHC. Overtime and availability bans were imposed forthwith, this industrial action escalating to the now seven-week long stoppage. Apart from the fact that S. Armstrong's committee representative of only U of the unions with members employed in the SEC, shop stewards committees, operate under an ACTU charter, have no consitutional authority to either engage in this type of industrial or pursue matters affecting wage rates or award ditions. From the outset, therefore, the Latrobe Valley campaign has been essentially illegal and divorced properly constituted trade union procedures. men involved have been badly misled and the great ship suffered by them and their famiUes should happened. Mr Innes-Are they not all communists now?",49
101,Mr LLOYD,PAIRS,"In response to certain grunts from the Labor Party side I interpose once again to say that these are the words of senior trade union officials in the Latrobe Valley about the Latrobe Valley situation. This letter continues: The FEDFA, together with the other unions bers in SEC employ, has endeavoured to act responsibly by maintaining a position within the framework of the VTHC campaign. This campaign has, of course, disrupted by the Latrobe Valley operation. Disunity there certainly is, but the whole disunifying process was initiated by S. Armstrong and his ards on IS June. I believe that is a most useful document to show the true situation in the Latrobe Valley and breakdown in ordinary and essential arbitration processes. To my mind this reinforces certain comments made about the power of the shop stewards, the usurping of constituted trade union authority, the British disease in this country, articles written by Paul Johnson, that leading Labor Party intellectual in the United Kingdom, who contributed to the New Statesman on the a new tyranny of the trade unions.",51
102,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,He has just resigned.,51
103,Mr LLOYD,PAIRS,"If I had been him I probably would have resigned earUer. It would a sensible thing to do. Amongst other things he said this: A union card already confers a greater degree ofrealpolitical power than a parliamentaiy vote. Increasingly, title deed to full citizenship, more important than a tificate or a passpon-a n identity card, in fact, the only document which proves a man exists and has rights. This reminds me of that song of not so long ago which says that you cannot touch me because I belong to the union. I hope that with these amendments to the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act we can restore some rights and protection to the individual union man in this country who, believe, overwhelmingly supports this know legislation.",51
104,Mr CHIPP,PAIRS,"I am grateful my friend the honourable member for Murray invested (Mr Lloyd) and other honourable members who have conspired to give mefiveor six minutes in which to speak in this debate. I voted with the is Labor Party this moming against this Bill being which declared an urgent Bill. Having been chairman of the Government Members Industrial Relaactivity tions Committee on, I think, three occasions I can consay, and I think I would find some agreement, from that there is no more complex piece of legislation The 2,300 on the statute books than the ConcUiauon and hardArbitration Act. It contains 122 pages of legisnever havelation of the most complex character. Today we are being asked, as a parUament, in just a few hours, to add another 28 pages of very complex amendments. I compUment the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street), as did the honourable member for Murray. The Minister has been tolerant. He has canvassed these with memamendments, as far as we know, with responsible people but the fact is that this Parliament been received this Bill only last evening. I understand that its printing was rushed through during the suspension for dinner. I simply ask the ParUashop stewment this question: Does everybody understand every implication of these 28 pages of amendments to the most complex piece of legislation on the the statute book? Without being offensive I would say to every member of the Liberal Party and every member of the National Country Party that they do not understand everytriing that this Bill does to the Act. Therefore on prinand ciple, as a protest-and this is the third time. I have done this- I am not going to vote with the Government to carry this Bill because I think it is farce and that it renders this Parliament a farce if members of this Parliament are asked to vote on something which they do not completely understand, particularly something as important as concUiation and arbitration which can affect have been every citizen in the country. Having said that, on my quick reading of the amending Bill I would say that there is a great it is the deal in it to be commended. If I gave it proper birth cerconsideration I probably would find myself voting for it or for most of it. Like the honourable member for Murray I believe that the amendments giving conscientious objectors fuUer rights is sound and represents justice. I entirely agree with the amendments to section 142A relating to deregistration. I agree with the accounting provisions. More strongly than anything else I agree I with the protection for self-employed persons. I of a scandal which is now occurring in at least one State. In South Australia a person who to runs, I think, an excavating company has his capital and his health in that business and cannot get a job contracting for the State Housing Trust unless he is a member trade union. Therefore I would support a clause to cover that sort of thing in this legislation. In the few minutes remaining to me I very briefly want to refer to the Latrobe Valley. Minister did not refer to the Latrobe Valley second reading speech. I cannot see anything this Bill which is going to assist the Latrobe ley situation in any way. Therefore I wonder this Bill is being rushed in in this way at this if it is not simply for electioneering purposes. believe this is an incredibly cynical use of Parhament. It is a cynical use of the hundreds thousands of decent people in the trade union movement. I have an enormous amount of pathy for the people who are striking in the Latrobe Valley. I ask members of the Liberal Party and members of the National Country to Party to consider this point: Thousands of and women- I mention the women because the send men have to be backed by their women-d o not a go out on strike for nine weeks over an issue which there is no justice. There is justice claim. However I beheve it has been very badly handled by the people concerned. I was surprised and disappointed at the cision of the Concihation and Arbitration mission. I was challenged last week by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) say where I stand on this issue. As far as I concerned, if people are in a system where an umpire's decision is to be refened to and accept the benefits of that system they should abide by the decision. In the present situation have had a Full Bench make a decision. honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) said that he thinks the Commission was wrong. Whether I beheve the Commission was wrong, as I do, I think that the only solution is to abide by the umpire's decision. Let me warn the Government that sending troops in will solve this dispute. Sending scab labour in will solve this dispute; it will exacerbate it.",51
105,Mr LUSHER,PAIRS,What will solve it?,52
106,Mr CHIPP,PAIRS,"The only way in which it can be solved is by concUiation. There are decent men the Trades Hall Council in Victoria and the tame President of the Australian Council of Trade will Unions already negotiating. I believe the only solution to this dispute will be found in the disof cussions which are now taking place between those people, the State Electricity Commission and the Victorian Government. I have been saying for years that one of the things that cause disputes such as we now have the leapfrogging techniques that have been of a adopted. The men in the Latrobe VaUey have been disadvantaged-and this has been pointed out by other speakers on this side of the Housebecause there are too many unions in that area. The The unions have adopted an ad hoc approach in in his which one union gets a benefit and the other in unions do not. An impediment to the long term Valsolution of disputes of this type is the number of why unions in the country. Germany, which has a time population of 80 mUlion people, has IS trade I umons. Australia, with a population of 13 mUlion this people, has over 311 trade unions. There are of very few employer organisations in Germany. Australia has over 2,500 employer organisations. symEach is playing the other on a break. Before I resume my seat I plead with the Federal Government and the Victorian Government treat this dispute as a deUcate human situation. men For God's sake, do not send troops in, do not scabs in at this stage; otherwise there will be conflagration, the like of which in the industrial in sphere this country has never seen before. in their Mr INNES (Melbourne) (3.57)- I oppose the legislation. I join with my coUeagues in expressing disappointment and revulsion at the indecent dehaste in which this legislation has been Comintroduced into this House. As the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) indicated-and to this is realised by many people-the Governam ment's action has been exposed as a cheappolitical gimmick which puts atriskthe future of thouthey sands of men, women and chUdren not only in the Latrobe VaUey but also throughout Victoria we because of the spin-off effects that the dispute is The having in other industries. No industrial dispute can be won by hitting someone over the head with the back of an axe. AU one receives in return is a simUar blow. Mr PoUtes, the top employers' advocate in this country, who is sitting in the gaUery of the House not at the moment, indicated during a speech he not made today at the National Press Club that this issue will not be solved by tampering with the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act. He well knows, and anybody with any industrial experience whatsoever well knows, that any attempt to tear in down the trade union structure, to turn it into a cat organisation, and to reduce its potence, succeed only in watering it down to the point where we have either control outside the wishes the properly elected leadership or leadership that is not acting in the best interests of the unionists. Disputes will not be resolved if unions are treated in this way. History proves that not one dispute has been resolved in this way. This is tyrannical, oppressive and unjust legislationthose are its impUcations for the trade union movement-doe s not go one iota along the line towards resolving the dispute in Victoria or, for that matter, any other industrial dispute that may arise now, in the short term or in the long run. Any attempt to destroy the arbitration system-and this legislation goes a long way towards making that the fundamental questionhas resulted in the government concerned incurring the wrath of the electors. The Bruce Page government in this country and the Heath government in the United Kingdom tried to do this but they felt the wrath of the electors and were defeated. Ultimately this legislation, will backfire on the Government because in the final analysis there is always a valid reason behind a decision to strike. People may strike because they believe they have suffered an injustice. To batter them into submission does not deter them one iota from the behef that their case is hght. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) claims that the Governus ment has a mandate to introduce legislation which will create a haven for scabs and eat away at the foundations of the trade union movement. The Minister seeks to protect individuals who Valley. have been set up or who set out to destroy trade union organisations. The legislation is designed to reduce industrial organisations to tame affairs. The conciliation and arbitration area we know it is complex and the electors would know how industrial relations ought to be run this country unless the industrial system and related factors were explained to them in detail. Therefore I believe that the Government has no mandate and it is idiotic for the Minister to claim that it has. This legislation has been introduced as a cheap political gimmick that has been planned for months and months to develop a cliclaims mate in which an election can be held. The legiscarried lation has been introduced to entice people's minds from the economic mismanagement of this country and to shroud economic matters mystery. I refer next to some questions that were raised in the Minister's second reading speech. It claimed that there has been proper consultation. But the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the peak councils rejected the policy and the philosophy inherent in the Government's proptration osition. The employee representatives were told that the workers should have no fears about the industrial Relations Bureau. Having spent almost a lifetime in the industrial movement, I know that propositions that are claimed to be new and revolutionary are in fact not in that category. They have been around since Adam was a child. Protection in relation to union ballots has existed ever since the conciliation and arbitration legislation was just enacted. There may be some revolutionary and sophisticated alterations but, once again, they are only gimmicks used by the Minister. The real thrust of this legislation is to be found in the terminology that the Minister used in such a glib way when reading his second reading speech. He said: Such situations demand that acuon be taken. It is paramount that unions recognise their obligations and the legitimate interest of the Australian community. In effect he said that the Government has an absolute right to ensure that the unions recognise their obhgations. All that means is that the Government will move to a situation in which it will attempt to bring troops into the Latrobe Valley. It will attempt to encourage scabs to carry out the bidding of those who are associated with the pohcies of the Government. It seems to me that, unless something positive is done to protect from such action in the current dispute, which is a glaring example of what I am saying, the Government will be encouraging and inciting the shedding of blood on the streets in the Latrobe To add weight to what I am saying, let me cat point out that 2,500 members against 20 memas bers voted to continue the dispute. These 2,500 not people know why they are in this dispute situin ation. They know that there is a variation of all about $20 a week between their salary and like classifications in the State Electricity Commission. The merits of their case have never been heard. Thetightguidelines laid down within the framework of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission have restricted the aspects of their that can be raised. The review now being out by Commissioner Mansini, who has been especially assigned the task, relates to other aspects that could have been considered in the in first instance. But what happened? The Federal Government stood over Hamer. Hamer, in turn, stood over the State Electricity Commission and there were no objective negotiations to have is examined the anomalies that existed within the classification framework of the SEC. Therefore when we talk about conciliation and arbitration, what this legislation means is a compulsory arbisystem. There is no room for conciliation. The Government should throw off the shroud of respectability it seeks to give it. The Government wants to have every case arbitrated upon within the strict narrow guidelines that control the overall wage structure. The room in which to move, which could have been used in this issue affecting the SEC, was never used. Therefore, the hearing that was held the other day was a farce. It has been proved to be a farce because Commissioner Mansini has now been appointed to examine those anomaUes. This will go a long way towards resolving the dispute but the Government does not want to resolve this dispute. It wants to pour petrol on the flames to ensure that there is a dispute so that on 3 December or 10 December it can hold an election on a law and order issue which is a complete and utter phoney. The Government talks about responsibUity. I repeat that the legislation provides a haven for scabs. I refer to a comment by Clarence Darrow in his autobiography. He was one of the greatest lawyers of alltimewho really fought for the underdog. He said: The strike-breaker occupies in the industrial world ition precisely analogous to that of the renegade and He represents a type of man universally condemned other sphere of human activity. He sells himself for the 30 pieces of silver, but caused Iscariot to go and hang himself. He commits pardonable sin of betraying his fellows. He purloins which he has no claim and is the one stumbling path of the wage earner. The attempt to make him respectspoken able reflects discredit upon those engaged in '.t. It reflects on the Government because Government is encouraging the strike breaker to move into the Latrobe Valley. The natural reacThe tion of people who have been in dispute, as the honourable member for Hotham said, is to be which enraged at the treatment they receive. When talk about responsibUity, lo and behold the speakers on the other side of the House say that people who undertake responsible positions such as the people with afingeron the switch of the electricity supply, have a responsibUity to community. I put it to the Minister that munity has a responsibUity to them. If their ition is exaggerated or placed in jeopardy and they are not permitted in the normal course of events to take whatever action is available to them, when they have voted overwhelmingly to individuals take that action, then it is up the Government ensure that that which is enshrined in the legisis lation will ensure that they receive that to which they are justly entitled. That is not to be. People in these classifications receive $20 or $30 a week less than that enjoyed by people in like fications in private enterprise. How does the Government believe those people are going react? The Government ought to ensure that concUiatory wing of the Act works that they will not go through eight months of frustration, as they have done in this case, trying to discuss their claims but with the co-ordinating committee of the State Parliament rejecting their advances and refusing to discuss their claims proper way and purely and simply duck-shoving it, playing a straight bet and waiting for the axe to fall. I spent many years in the industrial court and I know something about it. Lawyers Uke the Speaker of this House made a small fortune as advocates for the employers. Day after day they took unions into the industrial court, and under sections 109 and 111 had themfinedand finally having a trade union official gaoled. The sins of the trade union officials were that they stood up for the union members they represented and carried out the duties of the democratically elected positions they occupied. So far as trade unions are concerned, once the Government destroys that conciliatory section of the Act and puts in the hands of the employers therightto neglect a posand reject any area of conciliation, the end result traitor. will be confrontation. The honourable member in any for GeUibrand (Mr WUlis) outlined the various less than aspects of the Bill. It does not have one redeemtoo often lacks the grace which the uning feature. Mr George Polites, top national emthat to ployers' advocate, and the representatives of the block in the Chamber of Manufactures with whom I have individually have indicated that so far as they are concerned they are quite capable of the handling their own position. Prices Justification Tribunal is a toothless tiger. If the Government is going to control that affects wage claims by workers, if it is fair we dinkum at all, it would not be reducing the amount of money that is involved in the activities of the Prices Justification Tribunal. Instead it would be increasing it. It would be ensuring that the cost structure which forces wage claims by the workers throughout the length and breadth of the comthis country was kept to a minimum. The posrepresentatives and lackeys of the Broken HU1 Pty Co. Ltd and all the vested interests in this country sit on the other side of the House. This whole reaction and response is to the wailings of of that type. It is all very well to talk to about the freedom of the individual if your name Baillieu, for instance and you have never had to worry about the next pay packet, the next meal or the next pair of shoes for the kids. But if you are a migrant worker in Fitzroy slaving all classiday over a machine in some sweat shop in Fitzroy in oppressive conditions for the privilege to of taking home a miserably inadequate wage, the freedom of the individual means absolutely in such a way nothing or very Uttle. Despite what the Government and business apologists say, there is little scope for the individual toriseabove the economic mire that exists in this country. If we could all set up in a businesses and use those favourite euphemisms 'initiative' and 'enterprise' we would all be bosses and there would be no workers and the system would then be exposed. What a load clap trap. Workers' wages have been eroded the phoney proposition that was put to the elecbe torate prior to the election that this Government would support wage indexation. It was not in efforts Government for two rninutes before it doublecal crossed the workers. One of the issues that caused the Latrobe Valley dispute is their structure. They had an over-award payment for some 20 months. It remained stagnant for period oftimewhen costs rose by something 20 per cent. If the Government is going to the responsibibty of controlling workers' wages, the only commodity the worker can sell, by way of oppressive legislation such as this, it will win in thefinalanalysis. I sincerely hope and trust that the trade union movement shows a bit Latrobe of guts and stands up andfightsto the finish. presenttime? This legislation will never be effective. The Government is putting into legalism what it tries to do by standing over trade unions for the pose of creating a poltiical gimmick that is so tant it is a joke and will never convince the elecwealth torate that the Government is fan dinkum. That is the rock on which it will perish. I put it Government that if it had an ounce of decency all it would have taken steps to put its house order before coming along with this load of tripe,crooks this gimmick. It should have shown its bona fides to the trade union movement and the peak councUs. It is going to destroy the consultation that taken place, because no doubt those organisproblem ations will withdraw from further consultations. They have said that they do not beheve in what contained in this legislation. If they do withdraw from further consultations, it is on the Governtion ment's head. What the Government has done is to confront the unions deUberately. It has and confronted all sections of the organised indusdispute trial movement. It has done nothing to try to trol prices. It has run away from that problem. is an apology for a government. Now it adds this legislation to its misdemeanours. The legislation is a fraud. The position the Government has taken is phoney. It will not convince the electors one iota. Whether the Government goes to the electors on 3 December, 10 December or at time in the future it will be defeated.",52
107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, the Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,55
108,Sir WILLIAM MCMAHON,PAIRS," I am alarmed at what I have heard from three honourable members opposite whom I not viable. would have expected to have made a presentable of case in this House as to why the legislation bybrought forward by the Government should not passed. But far from touching on the essentials of the legislation they have engaged into ensure that there will be greater politiand industrial problems than are necessary. Let me, first of aU, ask one question. Each of wage those honourable members whose remarks I have listened to, such as the honourable member that for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron), the like honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) take and the honourable member for GeUibrand (Mr WUUs) who opened on behalf of the Opposition in the debate, has claimed that this legislation is not an attempt by the Government at confrontation. Where did the confrontation come from? The Valley dispute taking place at the Or maybe the tanker drivers' disputes, the seamen's disputes with Utah coal, the disputes involving Australia Post and, if you Uke, purthe Medibank dispute. We have seen strikes and bla-go slows of government service, both Commonand State. These were deUberate confrontations by small sections of the Trade Union to the movement. The Government's response was a at reaction. What I am amazed aboutin Mr YOUNG - What have you done about all the in the Stock Exchange? Why did you not rush legislation into deal with them?",55
109,Sir WILLIAM MCMAHON,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Port Adelaide ought to take has notice of this too. I think the Latrobe Valley must have been designed .by the shop stewards or those who advise them. They would ishave known that there was no prospect of a solution on the basis of an anomaly in the indexaguideUnes of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission. You know, Sir, and I know, so does my friend who sits opposite, that this occuned as a result of a decision in relacon-tion to incremental payments for the Latrobe ItVaUey workers. Because of the action of the Victorian Trades HaU Council, those payments were merged with special payments relating to trade unions as a whole. Therefore there were no grounds, on the basis of facts presented, on which the matter could have been resolved by any the Arbitration Commission. Do honourable members opposite teU me that those who prepared the case or the log of claims on behalf of workers of Latrobe did not know what they were doing? Can they teU me that consequently, when the Full Bench of the Commission came to handle the matter, it had no other course to folthan to decide that it was inconsistent and The second part of the log was that they wanted to make a series of claims that would have repercussions throughout the whole of the trade union movement of Victoria. The Comvery mission could not deal with the Latrobe matter unless it dealt with the other unions as well. then do we find that Mr Ken Stone, who we concede is an intelligent man, workers to go back to work? Something far worse than that is the use by the honourable member for Hindmarsh of the word urging the workers in the Latrobe Valley not to go back to work no matter what Mr Hawke might achieve in the work value case which now before the Commission. The honourable gling member for Hindmarsh used the word 'scab'. Let bim think of himself and then ask who is scabbing on Mr Hawke. Now let me look at the essential features of legislation. I want to make some analysis of the Government proposes in relation to the That national interest. As you know, Sir, and as the House knows, the Industrial Relations Bureau has been created. That Bureau's fundamental in functions are, to ensure that the law, regulations and awards under the Conciliation and Arbitaken tration Act are observed. The Arbitration law and awards are known! Why should a few secBureau tions of the trade union movement have a licence to forget the law and not care about the devastatthe ing effects that strikes in essential industries, small number of people can have? Why should they be permitted to ignore the law and why should not the rule oflaw apply to them? I wonder why Sammy Armstrong and his shop stewards-Samm y Armstrong by the way has not been imported from Scotland; I do not know E laces from which the others have come-shoul d e able to ensure, that 500,000 of their colleagues in the trade union movement are put out of jobs and that Australia lose a minimum $800m and probably $ 1,000m in production? When those workers go back to work there is litde or not hope, even if they get a 20 per cent trouble. rise, that they will be able in a period of less two years to make up the pay that has been lost. I look at this matter in a totally different ner. I believe that power corrupts, and I think that every honourable member in this House, except members of the Opposition when thendrivers. own interests or trade union interests are volved, agrees with that. Power has corrupted too many of the trade unions. We are at a waterto shed now. If we do not take action to bring trade unions within the estabUshed law, I believe that parliamentary democracy will be at stake. are not prepared to wait any longer. Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish the honourable member for Hindmarsh would not walk around the chamber in his idiotic and clumsy way and be rude in this House. I wish, Sir, you would ask him to take his hands out of his pockets when Why he is standing in front of me and to resume his all seat. I do not know what he is doing with his has urged the hands in his pockets.",55
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member for Hindmarsh 'scab' and will resume his seat.,56
111,Sir WILLIAM MCMAHON,PAIRS,"If the honouris able member wants to be offensively rude, gigthe way he is when he is trying to be smart, I will waittillhe sits down. I would Uke to analyse the powers of the Industrial Relations Bureau. I have to say in front of the honourable member for Melbourne that it does not have the powers relating to arbitration and concUiation. what He said that concUiation had been destroyed. is simply not true. The Bureau, it is true, can take a matter up to the stage of concUiation and arbitration, but it can act only as an intermediary order to get a solution. It cannot arbitrate if it cannot achieve a solution, the matter has to be into the courts or to the Commission itself. It is true that if a bans clause has been broken the has the power to take that matter to the Commission for a certificate and then proceed to courts. It has four other powers. It has the by a power of injunction.If an award is not being obeyed, why should not injunction proceedings to try and ensure compliance be taken? Those proceedings can be taken in a court of common law when civU rights are involved, so why should it happen in the case of industrial law? The the Bureau can have an award aboUshed. Why should not that be the case if, day in and day out, Utde groups of unionists with a maximum of destructive power disobey an award and are callous of about what effect their actions might have? The Bureau also has the power to apply for deregistration of a union that is causmg continuous than I go back to my own history on the waterfront when I had to say, first to Jim Healy and then to man Mr Fitzgibbon, that they would be deregistered unless they obeyed the law. They did. SimUarly in 1972 we threatened to deregister the tanker They went back to work. There was the inproblem of Mackie in Mount Isa and other unions including Public Service unions that had be faced. The situation was much the same. A simUar situation existed with Laurie Carmichael and the General Motors-Holdens' strike and the We problems associated with the Calabrians who were working in the foundries of GMH.",56
112,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,What about when I dispute. caught you having dinner with all those corns?,57
113,Sir WILLIAM MCMAHON,PAIRS,"Yes ! But I their actions. would not have dinner with the honourable member-not again, anyhow. I prefer the corns. That, Sir, is the reposte that he deserves. Those are the powers of the Bureau. And they are corrupts. needed. In the measure now before us, the Government has decided wisely, on three other powers which I wish to speak about before debate on this Bill concludes. The first one relates to a matter which I beheve to be very important. I now refer to proposed new section 142A of Act. Under that section the Arbitration ComIndustrial mission will have power to exclude certain ties or groups of people from the provisions of an award or to prevent them from entering certain areas of work or occupation. There is also power,to when the Arbitration Commission is determining claims before it, to take into consideration past practices and anangements in the industry cerned. Is it not right and proper that when have been practices and arrangements that have pens now? continued successfully and economically for years, unless there is some overwhelming why they should be changed, we should prevent industrial disturbances from permitting those erations to be performed by the class of workers already performing the job? I think this will great help in bulk loading. The legislation is as safe as I would like it to be. It does not give same protection as was given under the Stevedoring Industry Authority Act. But I do not doubt that it will be a severe restriction on interdo fering with bulk loading operations by waterside workers unless they are agreed to by the ployers or by State instrumentahties or private mdustry. The second point I want to make relates deregistration of unions under section 143. One of the problems we faced with regard to deregisLabour tration was this: There was only one total suspension or deregistration. Let me take suspension first. Suspension will now to the circumstances associated with possible deregistration and particular sections of the union involved. It will not apply over the whole range of union activities that were previously envisaged in the earUer Bill. I turn now to deregistration. Frequently we may be faced a set of circumstances in which a group in a union or a division or branch of a trade union may be causing all the trouble. In this case law will now provide that it is within the power of the court to distinguish between the union itself and the various groups or branches that make up the union and are causing the industrial It is only those guilty of continued faUure to observe the law, the regulations or the awards who will have to take responsibUity for Now we come to one other matter which I believe to be of great importance. I said that power I have no doubt that in the case of corruption by industrial power the Government has to do aU it can to take corrective action. As an the example there must be proper administration and proper accounting for moneys received by the union. Anangements will be made under the the Bill to provide, under the supervision of the Relations Bureau, that aU sums must parbe properly accounted for and supervised by recognised accountants. The accountancy will not be by single entry but has to be in detail and the satisfaction of the auditors. It has to be complete. It has to be filed with the Registrar and it has to be open for inspection by members of conthe union and by the general pubUc. there Mr Keith Johnson-What do you think hapreason Sir WILLIAM MCMAHON-The honourable member thinks it happens now. He should opnot be in this House if he were as innocent as that. Does the honourable member think that the be aBuUders Labourers Federation does it? How not friendly is he with Comrade Gallagher? I contheclude with this comment: I believe that in this country today we have the greatest economic and social problems that we have had to face. I not think it can be handled by ignoring it or by being cowardly. On the contrary, I believe emthat over the months the Government has presented facts and opened up debate and discussion so that people, if they wish, can become well informed, not only about the problems, but to also about the solutions the Government has offered. In all the years that I was Mmister for and National Service-probabl y for a power of longertimethan anyone elserelate only Mr CLYDE CAMERON - Too long.",57
114,Sir WILLIAM MCMAHON,PAIRS,"I wish I were there still. If I were the problems would not have occuned in such an intense way. I say that with great deference to you, Mr Speaker. These problems have to be handled quickly and in such a with way as to ensure that the trade unions are tradebrought within the new province of law and order. We are taking this action so that parUathe mentary democracy will survive. I commend the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) for thetimeand effort he has given not only to the National Labour Advisory Council but to the committees of his own party. He has given us the opportunity to recommend changes to the pohcies he presented and to Cameron, understand the very basis on which the original Cass, M.H.Clyde pohcies were based.

116,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PAIRS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill provides for an increase in the the Governor General. Because the Constitution provides that the salary of the Governor General will not be altered during his continuance in office, the increased salary becomes payable to the next Governor General, after he is sworn in December. The present Governor General Act was introduced by the Labor Administration in 1974 and provided for a salary of $30,000. now proposed that the Governor General's salindustry ary be $37,000-a salary that will remain un Mr changed through the period of the next Goverachieving nor-General's appointment. In 1974 the then Prime Minister, the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whidam), put forward some important principles as applyoperate ing to consideration by the Parliament of Governor General's remuneration. It is worth restating these principles now. They are that Governor General's salary should be dealt with in a non-party way; that the salary should recogWUson, I.B.C. nise the importance and place of his high office; and that the appointment of a Governor General should not depend on personal wealth or the Tellers: Bourchier, J.W. availabihty of other income.

117,Mr STREET,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY ACTS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is part of a parcel of legislation designed to enable the introduction of new administrative, financial and industrial arrangements for the stevedoring industry. These arrangements were foreshadowed in my second reading speech to Parhament on 1 June this year when I introduced extend until, the end of this year the BILL 1977 Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act. The Bills that I am now introducing give precise expression to the decisions of principle which I indicated the Government would transSecond Reading late into legislation during this session of Before proceeding to deal with the particular Bills I want to provide a brief outline of how the salary of proposed new arrangements have been developed and what they involve. It will be recalled that up until 1967 the nature of the waterside employment was almost exclusively casual. This resulted in a situation whereby the absence in of employer-employee relationships which existed in most other industries adversely affected the performance of this industry. In It is 1965 the Government estabUshed a major conference under the chairmanship of A. E. Woodward, QC, with the objective of long term improvement in the industry. In 1967 the Government introduced enabling legislation to permit the scheme of employment that emerged from the Conference to on a trial basis. Significant changes the brought about by the Woodward Conference included the move from casual employment to a the system of employment on weekly hire in the major ports; the introduction of pension and past service benefit schemes; and a significant reducrelations; uon in the functions of the Australian StevedoraUow ing Industry Authority in the major ports. The Woodward Conference scheme was to have a trial period of 2Vi years. However temporary arrangements were allowed to conStevedoring tinue and they in fact are still operative. Since introduction of that scheme successive governconsulted ments have given consideration to what further steps need to be taken to effect improvements this industry. Late in 1975 the then Minister Labor and Immigration, Senator James MCClelland, requested Mr R. M. Northrop, lem QC - as he then was-to report on the views the parties to the industry as to what they saw the problems associated with the existing artry rangements and the action they considered propriate for the Government to take as to arrangements. Mr Justice Northrop reported me early in 1976. Mr Justice Northrop's report indicated that whilst all of the organisations parties who made submissions to him agreed that the existing arrangements should not be lowed to continue, there was a sharp division tween those who proposed that the Government should take a more direct role in the industry those who beUeved the Government should seek to withdraw from its already Umited regulatory role to enable the parties in the mdustry to assume more responsibUity. Following detaUed consultations with the industry parties and other interested organisan ations the Government determined that the timelevel had been reached when everything should be done to ensure that this industry moved a situation where the relationships within the mdustry were as normal as possible and the employers and employees should accept greater responsibUity for the affairs of the try. At the sametimeit was accepted that in those circumstances the role of the Authority in the industry would be discontinued. The Governhow ment considered this general approach was conwhich sistent with the steps first proposed by the Woodward Conference. This attitude of the Government on the future of the industry was made clear in the Parliament in May last year. The Northrop report highlighted many of problems that have existed in the mdustry. It came clear that any new arrangements for the industry would need to provide for the following: Continued efforts to reduce the existing size the workforce; satisfactory means of providing additional waterside workers to cope with fluctuating requirements as to labour needs; dence of an adequate method of labour cation; means of securing improved industrial effective consultative arrangements to user interests and others to have an effective voice in the mdustry; and satisfactory funding arrangements including measures to recover the the deficit accumulated by the Australian Industry Authority. The industry theparties and other interested bodies were then in detaU on the requirements as to each of these problems and in November the ParUain ment was advised on the steps to be taken to for effect the necessary changes in this industry. The first step was to act in respect of the probof surplus labour. Late last year, at my inviof tation Mr Justice Robinson of the Concihation as and Arbitration Commission brought the indusparties into conference to consider ways of apmeeting this problem. Arising from those profuture ceedings a special redundancy program was to developed which was to apply for a Umited period. Under that program special benefits and accrued to waterside workers who were prepared to leave the industry by the end of March this alyear. This program had the immediate effect of besome 900 men being induced to leave their employment. I might point out that since June 1975 and the work force has been reduced by almost 3,000. The total industry work force has declined since 1966 from 21,000 men to a position where today there are slightly more than 10,000 waterside workers. The cost of removing men from the industry has not been hght. There was, however, acceptance by those in the industry that the of the labour force had to be reduced and I would point out that this reduction was achieved towards without disruption of any kind. Other major problems identified by Mr Justice where Northrop were referred to the National Stevedonng Industry Conference which was conindusvened under the chairmanship of Sir Richard Kirby in December last. Sir Richard brought the parties together and the Conference considered a framework might be developed within the problems could be dealt with and the overall performance of the industry improved. The Conference was attended by the stevedoring employers, the Waterside Workers Federation, the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission, the the Broken HU1 Proprietary Company Limited beand my Depanment. As well all other interested organisations were invited to make submissions to the Conference and join with the Conference of in considering particular problem areas. A detaUed repon of the Conference was presented to me on 5 April this year. (Quorum formed). The evirepon set out what the Conference agreed as the aUobest means of improving aspects such as flexibUity of labour, consultative anangements, industrial relations and the position of small ports. The Government has broadly endorsed thefindingsof the report as part of a total package which is to constitute the new industry framework. There is no doubt that the Conference was successful in coming to grips with many complex problems and in proposing practical and detailed measures to bring about improvements. While the National Stevedoring Industry Conference was proceeding, Mr Neil Stevens, a financial consultant, expert in matters associated with stevedoring industry funding, prepared for my Department a detailed report on the financial affairs of the industry. His report dealt with proposed means of providing central funding arrangements for on-going commitments in the industry as well as recovery of the industry deficit and his report has enabled particular attention to be paid to the position of the smaller regional ports. The Government also endorsed in principle Mr Stevens' recommendations. I now wish to provide a brief outline of some of the features of the new arrangements and how it is proposed they will operate. Improved Utilisation of the Labour Force: The report of the National Stevedoring Industry Conference provides means whereby labour currently held in various pool situations will be distributed to operational employers. Procedures have been agreed also to review and redistribute labour on a regular basis. The parties also recognised that additional measures are required to meet the fluctuating labour needs of the industry without resort to recruitment on every occasion. Accordingly, the new arrangements will involve the provision of supplementary labour units-thes e units will comprise workers to be employed on a casual basis and they will be utilised to complement the existing base labour force in the major ports. As well, when operational needs demand it, additional working time of the base labour force will be available to the extent of an additional shift per week and the extension of all shifts to complete a vessel which is to finish and sail. These measures together with the use of the supplementary labour force represent a valuable increase in the available hours of work at times when they are most needed. In the new arrangements all surplus labour of any employer shall be made available for use by all other employers in the port. This new concept which has the full support of all parties. It represents a gain of some magnitude and will result in substantial savings in the industry. If operated efficiently the transfer oflabour arrangements between companies will enable the elimination of locked up idletime;more efficient and productive use of the labour; and reduce the turn aroundtimeof vessels in port. These arrangements will be implemented under the surveillance of co-ordinating committees established at both the port and federal level. These committees will comprise representatives of the relevant employers and the Federation and other interested parties such as the relevant port authorities wdl join with these committees in consideration of matters of concern to them. Improved Industrial Relations: Mr Justice Robinson and Commissioner Neil of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission were involved with the National Stevedoring Industry Conference in considering ways of bringing about improvements in industrial relations in this industry. The industry parties accepted that the high incidence of disputes at the job level was a reflection on the efficiency of the existing dispute settlement procedures. A major deficiency was identified as being the lack of job conciliators to speedily convene meetings of the parties when disputes arose. The existing procedures for some time have provided for the use of job conciliators but until the Conference no agreement could be reached as to their appointment. In the National Stevedoring Industry Conference report the parties reaffirmed the need for such conciliators to be appointed and further agreed that where the parties themselves were in dispute on this matter those appointments would be made through the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Mr Justice Robinson has since held a series of conferences with the parties and agreement has now been reached in respect of persons nominated as port conciliators. When the legislation comes into force these appointments will be made and the conciliators will be available to work with the parties in preventing and settling disputes and providing assistance to the Commission where this is needed. Consultative Arrangements: The National Stevedoring Industry Conference report proposes the establishment of a Stevedoring is a Industry Consultative Council. The Council is to be comprised of representatives of the major industry parties and significant other interest groups concerned with industry, seas trade and cargo handling. The Department of Transport and the Department of ployment and Industrial Relations will be represented on the Council and the Chairman of the Council will be appointed by the Government. The Council's objectives will to provide a forum for discussion and an portunity for communication between governwork ments, the mdustry parties and other comand munity interests. Through the Chairman Council all concerned will be able to bring the attention of the Government or other Council members any matter aimed at bring the ing about improvements in the industry. The Interests of Smaller Ports: It has Commission. always been the concern of the Government the that m any new arrangements proposed for the ments industry the special interests of the smaller on the on ports should not be subjugated to the needs of envisage the industry the major ports. Under the new anangements rect responsibUity and there will be an opportunity for port authorities to join with the direct mdustry parties in Government considering matters of concern to Association of Pon and Marine Authorities advised the National Conference of its wish to do this and since then the Association has with the employers and the Federation and there is now a very clear understanding that both the Federal and the port level there be a continuing involvement of the port authorities in the affairs of the industry their interests are concerned. Most importantly measures have been taken to protect the interests of the smaller ports through the proposed new funding anangegovernment ments. Because of the nature of the smaller ports, their location and methods of operation, it has been seen as desirable that the central funding anangements should continue to requirements apply in much the same way as is presendy the the case. The new funding anangements will to Parliament. ensure that the costs for the smaller ports are retained at very much the same level as they are now. Recovering the Deficit: The accumulated deficit of the Australian Stevedoring Industiy Authority, in the main, relates to the future long service leave entidements for waterside workers. It has been recognised that the appropriate means of ensuring that funds are collected so that these entidements can be is through a statutorily backed levy. That levy will be imposed in respect of tonnage of cargo handled by waterside workers and special prohow visions have been made to ensure that local overcargo and cargo of a bulk nature will be subject to lesser amounts of levy. These and other Emfunding proposals are in accordance with the report made by Mr Stevens. The new anangements now proposed for the industry are not merely a series of measures be aimed at overcoming some of the industry's opproblems; rather they represent a total framewithin which new problems can be faced genuine improvement in the industry's perof the formance brought about. That framework to includes the agreement that has emerged from the National Stevedoring Industry Conference, new funding arrangements and the increased involvement of the ConcUiation and Arbitration (Quorum formed). The way has also been opened for the many other interests in community who are concerned with developthe waterfront to exercise an influence course of events. The new anangements parties assuming more diat the sametimethe itself will maintain an influence on them. The what happens in the industry. The Government's influence is designed to be a positive one and the potential for that influence met can be seen in the following elements. The National Stevedoring Industry Consultative at Council will be under the chairmanship of a will government appointee; it will report to the Government on developments in the industry where and the Government will be represented on the Council. The funding anangements for the industry will be the responsibility of the proposed Stevedoring industry Finance Committee. That Committee will also be chaired by a appointee. The level of industry charges will be subject to the approval of Government and the financial accounting of the Committee will be in accordance with the of the Auditor-General. Reports of activities of the Committee wdl be avaUable The increased involvement of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission will assist in ensuring that industrial relations in the industry can improve and the widening of the jurisdiction of the Commission will aUow it to be involved in matters such as port quotas, supplementary labour and other matters which were formerly most associated with the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. It is proposed also that when met the new anangements have been operating for a reasonabletimethey will be subject to a review which will enable the Government to determine effective the changed administrative, financial and industrial relations arrangements have been. I envisage that this review should take place in approximately 12 months dme. I now propose to discuss each of the Bills so that members will have the opportunity to identify how the proposed package of legislation relates to the totality of the new anangements. I now propose to deal with each of the Bdls. The Stevedoring Industry Acts (Termination) This is a Bill designed to provide a smooth and years efficient transition from the present system and that regulated by the Austrahan Stevedoring Industry provision Authority. To achieve this the Bill provides for transitional period to commence on a date to be in the loading and proclaimed and to terminate on a day fixed by rate will apply to the notice in the Gazette. On proclamation the other in the case of bulk cargo Bills associated with this Bill will also to operate. At the commencement of the tranmanhours sitional period most of the responsibUities and functions will be transferred from the Authority. During the transitional period however, the Authority will continue to exist to carry out cerI tain Umited functions and so much of the current stevedoring mdustry legislation is continued as will enable the Authority to carry out those functions. The Bill provides that at the end of the tranthat sitional period aU assets and UabUities of the Authority will be vested in the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee estabUshed by Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee Bill. The Bill also provides for the preparation by the Authority of reports on its operations up to end of the transitional period. Stevedoring Industry Charge (Termination) Bill The amendment to the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act contained in this Bill ensures that operation of the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act ceases before the Stevedoring Industry Act commences to operate. The Bill funher prolaneous vides that the requirement that employers furwUl nish returns under the Act will no longer apply respect of a period for which the charge is not payable. Stevedoring Industry Levy Bill 1977 This Bill estabUshes a system of levies on ployers of waterside workers consistent with anangements of which I have spoken earUer tory which are to be introduced in this industry. There has been for many years a stevedoring mdustry charge estabUshed by legislation. It has imposed a charge on each manhour of employment of registered waterside workers with two prime purposes-to provide funds for the operation of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and to make payments to waterside workers which largely derive from awards of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Stevedoring Industry Levy Bill will continue that concept though in somewhat more Umited fashion. The industry will be responsible Bill largely for its own funding anangements in the future, however, there has emerged in recent what has been termed the industry deficit has to be funded. Thus, the Bill makes a respect ofthefor special levies to be imposed in employment of waterside workers unloading of cargo. A reduced loading of local cargo and commence workers a surcharge wUlhandledbe by waterside imposed on the worked. These levies will produce funds to defray the so-called industry deficit. would draw to the House's attention that it is intended that these levies designed to defray the industry deficit wdl have a limited life. By clause 10 of the Bill they will cease to operate when the Minister notifies their cessation in the Gazette. These levies have been fixed in the expectation they will last for a period of about six years. In addition to the special levies this Bill deals with general levies which will be imposed on emthe ployers to cover their contribution to the Stevedoring Employees Retirement Fund and enable specified payments to be made in respect the of the employment of waterside workers in the small pons. Like the existing statutory charge these levies will be based on manhours worked. 1977 The levy in respect of waterside workers on weekly hire, that is, those generally employed in the the major pons, is set at $1. This means that apart from obUgations in respect of the EmLevy ployees Retirement Fund and certain miscelmatters the employers in the major ports be required in future to provide their own in funding outside the statutory levy. As to waterside workers not on weekly hire, that is, those generaUy employed in the smaller ports, the levy is set at $4.85. This retains the anangement that presendy exists whereby the major obligations of ememployers in the smaUer ports are to be met from new central funding anangements through the statulevy. This is a practical way of providing assistance to the employers in the smaUer ports and aims to ensure that the cost structure in these ports is not adversely affected. The amounts of levies that are to apply in the industry on the introduction of the new anangements are fixed in the Bill now before the House. It will be a responsibiUty of the proposed Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee to review the level of these levies fromtimeto time and to make recommendations. Changes to the levies cannot be made without the approval of the Minister. Stevedoring Industry Levy Collection Bill 1977 This Bill should be read in conjunction with the Levy Bill. It provides the machinery by which the levies set out in that Bill are to be collected. many respects the provisions of the Bill are sinular to those of the existing Stevedoring Industry Charge Assessment Act which has operated since 1947. However, it has been cast that in addition to levies on manhours worked there will now be a surcharge on bulk cargo and levies on tonnage of cargo where handled waterside workers. The essential framework of the Bui centres around returns which must be furnished to my Department at regular intervals by employers waterside workers and on which payment of the levy is based. The employers who will be liable for levies will be restricted to those who particiments pate in the scheme of the new arrangements be which has emerged out of the National Stevedorof ing Industry Conference and who employ waterin side workers whose names are on a register maintained by the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee. Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee Bill The main purpose of establishing the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee ensure public scrutiny of the large sums of money that wili be forthcoming from the employers by way of levies to be imposed. I should emphasise that the Committee will not be a body with an to: administrative back-up of its own. It is intended that the day to day administration of its responwould sibUities will be carried out on behalf of the Committee by the Association Waterside Labour. The Committee will be a part time body consisting of representatives of sociation of Employers of Waterside Labour, the Broken HU1 Pty Co. Ltd, the Australian Shipping Commission and the Waterside Workers' Federthe ation. Its chairman will be appointed by the Government and I will be announcing this appointment shortly. The functions of the Committee will be to make payments, for example, to the Stevedoring Employees Retirement Fund; payments in Division respect of providing amenities to waterside workers; payments to the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour as to costs that it will have to bear in connection with the organisation of performance of stevedoring operations and payments arising out of award obUgations on employers as to waterside workers. It will reimburse the Commonwealth for expenditure incurred in payments to the port conciliators who are to be appointed under the provisions of the ConcUiation and Arbitration (Amendment) Bill. In Beyond this, Mr Deputy Speaker, there are the very usual provisions one would expect tofindin a Bill of this kind. For instance, the Committee will be given the power to borrow but only with the so approval of the Treasurer. It will be able to keep accounts subject to the scrutiny of the Auditor General. There is also a provision requiring the by Committee to furnish to the Mmister such relevant information as is required. The Committee will be required to produce an annual report which will be tabled before Parliament. of The Conciliation and Arbitration (Amendment) Bill (No. 2) 1977 Save for one smaU amendment aU the amend to the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act to effected by this Bill are to Division 4 Part III the Act. This Division was inserted in the Act 1956 and provides the ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission with its jurisdiction for the prevention and setdement of industrial disputes and industrial questions involving that area of the waterfront in which work is performed by members of the Waterside Workers Federation 1977 of Australia.",59
118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STEVEDORING INDUSTRY ACTS,"Mr Jarman)is to Order! The Minister'stimehas expired. Suspension of Standing Orders Motion (by Mr Macphee)-by leave-agree d That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as prevent the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations speaking without limitation of time. of Employers of (Quorum formed). the As Mr STREET- I thank the House for agreeing to the last motion. The Division does not cover operations in the stevedoring industry outside of regulatory scheme set up by the existing legislation and there will be no change to this concept as a result of the Bill which I am now introducing. Thus, the Bill contains provisions perpetuating definitions of certain terms which now appear in the principal Act by reference to the stevedoring industry legislation. The fact that 4 of Part III of the Act now appUes to the traditional area of work of the Waterside Workers Federation is being confirmed two ways-by changing thetideof the Division and by inserting a new section 81 A. A most significant provision of the Bill is that will widen the jurisdiction of the Concihation and Arbitration Commission to enable the Comclosest mission to deal with such matters as the question of quotas'for waterside workers, of a supplementary labour force and recruitment of waterside workers. The Bill also makes provision for the appointment of port concUiators. I am particularly pleased to see this provision there for it marks out that parties have accepted the idea that the Commission may appoint these officials whose functions will be to attempt to reconcUe the parties to the industry in on the dispute situaUons that might arise. The Bill also makes provision for the estabUshment of Federal and Port Co-ordinating Committees as envisaged by the National used Stevedoring Industry Conference Report. The membership of these committees will be appointed by a person to be designated by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relamonwealth tions. The primary responsibUity of these comin mittees will be to monitor day to day matters such as transfer oflabour, supplementary labour units et cetera. They will have power to co-opt outside interests from time to time and as indiTransport cated earUer I expect they will pay particular attention to the need for consultation with and the involvement of the various port authorities around the Australian coast. I said earUer that we were ensuring that Divto ision 4 of Part III of the principal Act remains area from which the Commission draws its jurisAuthority. diction as to disputes involving the traditional area of work of the Waterside Workers Federation. Thus, the bulk handling operations which were never within the regulatory scheme estabAct Ushed by the 1956 legislation and which have never been mvolved in Division 4 of the ConcUidisclose ation and Arbitration Act wdl still be excluded from that area of the Act's operation. The industries within which the bulk handUng operations take place are of enormous sigexisting nificance to the Australian economy. These operdupUcation ations now account for 70 per cent of all traUan cargoes. Over the years these operations have been carried out largely free from industrial disruption. The companies concerned with these bulk handUng operations have placed great phasis on the contribution that the existmg workrationalising ing arrangements within their establishments has made to their abUity to function efficiently meet contract deadUnes. The Government beUeves it would be undesirable to alter the factual situation now obtaining. The Government wants these operations to proceed free from the fear of it industrial disruption and in the most efficient manner possible. It will therefore maintain the surveUlance of the working operations of these industries to ensure that their efficiency is the employment not impeded. Port Statistics Bill 1977 The purpose of the Bill is to authorise the Secretary of the Department of Transport to collect stevedoring and related port statistics. Honourjob . able members may be aware that the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority currently collects a wide range of statistics on cargo movements, labour associated with loading and unloading cargo and vessel movements. As well as being by the Authority, these statistics are also used by the stevedoring industry at large, Commonwealth departments and a variety of commercial and research organisations. The Comdepartment with the major interest the retention of these statistics is the Department of Transport. Accordingly, the Government has decided that when the new arrangements come into effect, the Department of will take over responsibibty for collection of stevedoring and related port statistics. This requires legislative powers to coUect statistics to replace those powers currently contained in the Stevedoring Industry Act 1956. The Port Statistics Bill provides suitable statutory backing enable continued collection of the statistics the now avaUable to Government through the A careful reading of the Stevedoring Industry 1956 will reveal that there are few limitations on the Authority's powers to obtain or information. The Government considers that such wide powers are not appropriate under the new arrangements. Consequently, much of the Bill is concerned with defining the limits of powers which had been left undefined in the arrangements. At present there is some between statistics collected by State Ausport authorities and the Commonwealth. In recognition of this, my colleague the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) has had discussions with State Ministers, meeting as the Marine and Ports emCouncU of Australia, on the possibUity of statistics collections. A Marine and Ports Council Working Party is investigating this and to matter. The Bill provides a basis for the exchange of information between the wealth and the States in anticipation of reaching suitable arrangements. In essence, the Bill seeks to transfer statistics collection powers from the Austrahan Stevedoring Industry Authority to the Department of Transport. At the sametimethe opportunity is Employment and Industrial being taken to introduce appropriate constraints move: on the use of these powers. Finally, there is one additional matter which I wish to comment. The staff of the tralian Stevedoring Industry Authority has always carried out its duties in a most responsible fashion. In earher speeches to the Parhament have referred to the contribution made by the staff of the Authority and I Government's appreciation of what has been done by it particularly during the last 18 months. During that time when the new arrangements for the stevedoring industry have been developed the task of the staff has been a most difficult one. Nevertheless the staff has acted to ensure that responsibilities have been carried out with the time. maximum efficiency and co-operation. As well the staff has provided valuable technical assistance and advice on the operation of the rangements. I regard its efforts as commendable indeed. The pivotal Bill in the package of legismove: lation which will allow the introduction of the new arrangements is of course the Stevedoring Industry Acts (Termination) Bill.

123,Mr HUNT,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will give effect to the Government's social services proposals for 1977-78. These are: Extension of eligibility for handicapped that child's allowance to less severe cases where the famUy income is low and financial ship would otherwise be suffered. Extension of the free rehabUitation programs of the Commonwealth RehabUitation Service to housewives, pensioners, juniors and other classes of persons not previously eUgible. Removal of a provision which discriminates against married women in relation to sickness benefit and bringing the income test for sickness benefit into Une with that applying to unemployment benefit. The Bill also gives effect to the Government's deSecond Reading cision to clarify in the legislation the position regarding ehgibility of school leavers for unemployment benefit. Two machinery amendments are also being made. Honourable members wdl be aware that in addition to these measures, pensions and benefits are to be increased in November in accordance with existing provisions of the Social Services Act for six-monthly adjustments in the consumer index. The new single rate of pension will represent 24.9 per cent of the seasonally adjusted average weekly male earnings for the June 1977 quarter. I will refer in detaU to these increases later. Handicapped Child's Allowance At present handicapped cluld's allowance of $15 a week is payable to parents or guardians in respect of a severely physically or mentaUy Second Reading handicapped chUd under 16 years of age who is at home and who, because of the of the handicap, requires constant care I and attenuon. This should not be confused with handicapped chUd's benefit which is paid at $5 per day for handicapped children residing in an the approved home. The handicapped chUd's allowance is designed to assist in meeting the exceptional costs incurred by parents or guardians who E to care for a severely handicapped chUd at ome rather than to place the chUd m an institution. It has come to notice that there are a number of low income famUies caring for a chUd who is substantially handicapped but not 1977 severely handicapped and for whom handicapped chUd's aUowance is not paid because the medical criteria are not fully met. The GovernSecond Reading ment is aware of the additional costs that can be incurred in caring for a handicapped chUd at and that it places a strain-ofte n a severe strain-o n the finance of low-income parents. These expenses can arise out of the need to provide special footwear or other clothing, special diets or specific medical or remedial treatment the parents of other chUdren are not required to provide. hardThe Government has accordingly decided to extend eligibility for handicapped child's aUowance. The Director-General of Social Services, at his discretion, will be able to grant a handicapped chUd's allowance of up to $15 a week to a person on low income who is caring for a substantiaUy handicapped chUd. The aUowance will be payable in respect of a cluld whose substantial handicap does not fully meet the existing medical criteria but where, because of contmuing substantial expenditure associated with the child's disabUity, the parent or guardian is, in the Director-General's opinion, suffering severe financial hardship. Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service The other change in assistance to handicapped people related to the Commonwealth RehabUitation Service and the broadening of its present terms of eligibility for acceptance of cases without charge. The Commonwealth Government, through the Commonwealth RehabUitation Service, has, for the past 29 years, operated a comE rehensive rehabUitation service for selected andicapped people. The service, which began in July 1948, is conducted by the Department of Social Security as part of its responsibUity for administration of the Social Services Act. The Service is designed to help people who are suffering from long term disabUities by providing them with comprehensive programs of social/vocational rehabUitation once the acute phase of recovery has been completed. Over the years the Service has been able to assist many thousands of severely handicapped people to reach or to regain independance and, in a high percentage of cases, their capacity to undertake gainful employment. As matters stand, however, assistance free of charge through the Commonwealth RehabUitation Service is confined to certain pensioners and beneficiaries under the Social Services Act, in addition to a small number of special groups. Other disabled people who are unable to quaUfy for a free service have either to be sponsored for the cost of their rehabUitation treatment and training, or personaUy meet the cost in accordance with individual capacity to pay. To quaUfy for assistance there must also be reasonable prospects, following rehabUitation, of the individual being able to return to, or engaging in, gainful employment, Under the above criteria disabled housewives, for example, or other persons who may be deemed unUkely to have reasonable prospects of undertaking gainful employment, are not eligible for assistance free of charge. The Government has recognised the pressing need for rehabilitation assistance, particularly a social/vocational nature, to be made more freely available to all persons who would benefit substantially from such assistance. We are prothat posing, therefore, that the remedial and training programs of the Commonwealth RehabUitation Service should be made avaUable, without cost, not only to those who have reasonable prospects of undertaking employment, whether full, part-time, or sheltered, but also to aU those within the broad working age group who, in spite of substantial residual handicaps, have reasonable prospects, with rehabUitation assistance, of either resuming a former role as housewife/mother, or simply increasing their capacity to lead an independent or semiindependent Ufe at home. In brief, the amendments we are proposing to Part VIII of the Act will enable the Department of Social Security to offer the very successful rehabUitation treatment and traimng programs of the Commonwealth RehabUitation Service to all classes of severely disabled persons within the broad working age group who would benefit substantiaUy from such assistance. During the current year, emphasis will be paid to the acceptance of greater numbers of disabled housewives, especiaUy those from families of low socio-economic status who would otherwise be unlikely to undertake necessaiy rehabUitation on a paying basis even if this were offered at reduced charges. Priority will also be given to those cases where the breadwinner's employment status is being affected because of the demands of caring foi a disabled spouse Uving at home and who could be afforded more independence through appropriate rehabUitation measures. Sickness Benefit The Government has decided to remove an element of discrimination existing in relation to the eligibility of married women to receive sickness benefit. Sickness benefit is payable at the same rate as unemployment benefit to a person who is temporarily incapacitated for work, and has suffered a loss of income as a result of the incapacity. The maximum rate is currently $47.10 a week for a single person without dependants, and $78.50 a week for a married couple-thes e rates will increase to $49.30 and $82.20 respectively from 1 November 1977, in accordance with the existing automatic adjustment provisions contained in the Social Services Act. Where there are chUdren, additional benefit of $7.50 a week is payable for each chUd. Supplementary aUowance up to a maximum of $5 a week may be paid when sickness benefit has been paid continuously for 6 weeks and the perof son pays rent, lodging of boaid and lodging. At present the Social Services Act provides a married woman is not entided to sickness benefit if it is reasonably possible for her husband to maintain her. This provision is considered to discriminate against women. It will be repealed. In future a married woman wdl be able to qualify for a sickness benefit on the same basis as a married man. A change in the method of assessing sickness benefit is also proposed. Sickness benefit is the only income-tested benefit under the Social Services Act which does not take into account the income of both husband and wife. The method of assessment is out of line with the other income-tested pensions and benefits because the income of a wife is not taken into account in determining the husband's enddement to sickness benefit. The effect of this is that a married man may receive sickness benefit up to the maximum single rate of $47.10 a week, irrespective of his wife's income. The Government believes that this position is no longer tenable and the Bill amends relevant provisions of the Act accordingly.",67
124,Dr KLUGMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,That is really the point of this Bill. You are taking something from people.,69
125,Mr HUNT,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL,"Action along these Unes was recommended by Professor Henderson in his first main report on poverty in Australia, so it has the support of a very distinguished Australian who is most interested in poverty. This means that in future the combined income of both husband and wife will be taken into account in assessing the rate of sickness benefit as is the case with other income-tested pensions and benefits. Provisions are included m the Bill to ensure that no existing beneficiary's payment wdl be reduced as a result of this change. School Leavers The Bill also gives effect to the Government's so that payments decision to clarify by legislation the eligibility of periods school leavers for unemployment benefit. Last will year, in accordance with a decision of the considered Government, unemployment benefit was not paid to school leavers during the summer vacation. In recent years many claims for unemployment benefit have been made during the summer vacation by school leavers prior to making serious efforts to obtain employment and by others who claim to be unemployed but who actually intend to resume school or go to tertiary educauon after the vacation. The Government beUeves that it would be reasonable to impose some period of time after leaving school before school leaver wdl be eUgible for unemployment benefit. The Government has decided that a period six weeks is reasonable, and the Bill provides that, in the case of school leavers, unemployment benefit is not payable for six weeks after the of ceasing full-time education. A person who completed a course of secondary education apart from sitting for examinations will be deemed remain a full-time secondary school student until after the completion of the examinations. A similar period of six weeks during which unemployment benefit is not payable will apply to tertiary students who do not complete their courses if the Director-General is satisfied that the cessation of their studies was due to a voluntary act and without good and sufficient reason. The other amendments contained in the Bill are largely machinery. Firstly, a provision is being inserted in the Act requiring the beneficiary to notify the Department immediately he obtains paid employment or commences to engage in work on his own account. At present there is no such requirement in the Act. In fact a person is only required to notify the receipt of income within a period of seven days after he has received that income. This has been a serious defect, particularly in cases where unemployment benefit is paid fortnighdy in advance. Other matters affecting eligibility for benefits such as the receipt of income, marriage, etc., will also require immediate notification. The Director-General will have therightto calculate and recover any overpayments from the date on which the change of eUgibUity occurred. A further amendment relates to the periods for which unemployment and sickness benefits may be paid. Section 132 of the Act at present requires that benefits should be paid in fortnightly instalments. The Bill amends that section may be made in respect of such as the Director-General determines. This enable necessary. a weekly instalment to be paid where It is proposed to do this in mence to be paid in arrears.when payments comrespect of the first cheque Under the new procedures, a person who makes a claim for unemployment benefit on the their day on which he becomes unemployed will not be entided to receive any benefit m respect of the first week of unemployment. After the end of the second week, he will receive the benefit for that week on submitting a statement confirming that he has not been employed or received income a that would make him ineUgible. This procedure will be repeated and he will receive a further two weeks benefit at fortnightly intervals thereafter, of while the unemployment continues and he satisfies eUgibUity requirements. It has been claimed that the proposed system could lead to date hardship if an unemployed person does not has make immediate apphcation for benefit in the hope that he will find work without needing to to apply for Commonwealth assistance. The new law will accordingly provide that a period employment immediately prior to the date of plication for benefit may be taken into account the whole or part of the waiting period if it tablished that the claimant was able to work took reasonable steps to obtain work during period. I would like to draw to the attenuon of honourable members the proposed increases in pensions and benefits which I mentioned at beginning of this speech. As honourable membe bers will be aware, these increasesflowfrom the provisions relating to the six-monthly automadc adjustment of pensions which were inserted the Social Services Act last single rate will increase by $2.20 a week to $49.30 a week. The maximum combined marthe ried rate will increase by $3.70 a week to $82.20ritory a week. The increases reflect the 4.7 per cent increase in the consumer price index between the when December quarter 1976 and the June quarter 1977. These increases will mean that since the Government assumed office in December 1975 Court the standard or single rate of pension has increased by $10.55 a week and the combined married rate by $ 17.70 a week.",69

I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Klugman) Bill adjourned. (Quorum formed). JUDICIARY (DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION) BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Macphee, and read a under first time. Second Reading",70
128,Mr MACPHEE,SOCIAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL," I move: of unThat the Bill be now read a second time. apThis Bill was foreshadowed in the statement to as Parhament by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm is esFraser) on 6 October when he announced the and Government's decision to appoint Mr Justice that Fox as Ambassador-at-Large, to represent Australia overseas in international endeavours to secure a strengthened nuclear non-prohferation regime. In announcing that decision, the Prime the Minister mentioned that the Government would introducing legislation to enable Mr Justice Fox to retain his judicial status and the rights which attach to that status while he is Ambasin sador-at-Large. This Bill makes, provision for year. The maximum those matters. Mr Justice Fox is at present the Chief Judge of Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Terand he is also a Judge of the Federal Court of Australia. As the Prime Minister mentioned in his statement of 6 October, His Honour proposes, the formalities in relation to his ambassadorial appointment have been completed, to resign his office of Chief Judge of the Supreme of the Austrahan Capital Territory. This is a step which will be gready regretted. I know that His Honour has reached his decision to resign only after very careful consideration. It is an unselfish step which His Honour considers he should take in the interests of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, having regard to the administrative nature of the duties up while of the Chief Judge of that Court. invalid, His Honour will nevertheless retain his appointment as a Judge of the Federal Court of Australia and the present Bill will remove any that otherwise might exist as to the effect that the ambassadorial appointment might have on his judicial office. This is in Une with the legislative action that was taken to remove any doubts that the diplomatic appointments of Sir John Latham and Sir Owen Dixon in 1940 and respectively, and the appointment last year of Mr Justice Woodward as Director-General of in the Australian Security IntelUgence Organisation, may have had on their judicial offices. The provides that whUe Mr Justice Fox is holding his appointment as Ambassador-at-Large he will retain his entitlements to remuneration and annual allowance that he would have had as Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. His pension entitlement the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 is also to be retained on that basis. When Mr Justice Fox's appointment as Ambassador-at-Large comes to an end he will his position as a Judge of the Federal Court of Australia and he will be entitled to remuneration and annual allowance on that basis. Tbis will be a somewhat lesser entitlement than His Honour would have had if he had retained the office of Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, but His Honour has indicated that this is nevertheless acceptable to him. Somewhat different considerations, however, apply in relation to His Honour's pension entitlement under the Judges' Pensions Act. The Bill provides that His Honour will not suffer any loss of pension entidement, which has largely accrued already, by reason of his proposed resignation as Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. I am sure honourable members will agree that it is appropriate that His Honour should retain his pension rights. It remains only for me to endorse what the Prime Minister has already said about the importance which the Government attaches to Mr Justice Fox's proposed appointment as Ambassador-at-Large and to His Honour's pre-eminent qualifications for the task. It is a great pity that during the term of his appointment he will be unavaUable for judicial service but his contribution towards our endeavours to secure a strengthened nuclear non-prohferation regime will, I am sure, more than make up for this. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) adjourned. NA NA NA NA Approval of Work: Public Works Committee",70
129,Mr MCLEAY,LABORATORIES," I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to cany out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of proposed new complex Headquarters and for the Hoban Regional Laboratory of the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories, Kingston, Tasmama. The proposal provides for a complex of seven separate but linked low rise buUdings which wdl provide offices, display and conference areas, laboratories, workshops and stores for the Antarctic Division which is currently located in Melbourne. An additional buUding will accommodate Tasmanian regional laboratory and offices of the Commonwealth Government Analytical Laboratories. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $7.3m at March 1977 prices. In recommending the construction of the works the Committee stated: The Committee believes that the glaciology section should not be transferred to Kingston. The provision of laboratory facilities for the Antarctic Division should be re-examined when a firm decision is made by the Government as to the sciendfic tasks to be undenaken by the Antarctic Division at Kingston. In regard to the glaciology section, the Government recognises the merit of the view expressed by the Committee and this will be taken into consideration when finalising arrangements for the transfer of the Antarctic Division. The provision of laboratory facUities for the Antarctic Division will be re-examined in the light of a Government White Paper relating to the Antarctic pohcy and programs which is now being prepared. The Committee also concluded that: There should be greater co-ordination between the Antarctic Division and the universities in Antarctic research. The Committee urges the Government to agree to the changes in the Antarctic Division's scientific program proposed by the Depanment of Science. The Committee is convinced that any disruption of the relationship between the glaciology section and the meteorology department of the University of Melbourne would not be in the best interests of science. The Government notes the Committee's conclusions.",71
130,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,LABORATORIES,"The hearing in connection with this project was of great interest to the Public Works Committee. It extended over four days, with one day in Melbourne and three days in Hobart. The reason that three days were aUocated to Hobart-ther e was a break between the two hearings-wa s that Act the Committee was not quite satisfied with the evidence that it had received in Melbourne or in Hobart that there was justification for the project to go to Hobart. So the further hearing took place. One of the things that caused the Committee to have some doubt about the matter was mentioned by the Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay) in his speech. He referred to the abfor the Antarctic Division sence of a White Paper. A Green Paper has been presented, but it became clear to the Committee during the course of the evidence given by many noted witnesses that the whole complex was related to Australia's continued activity in the Antarctic for scientific purposes. There was some doubt in the Committee's mind as to whether the Government intended to go on with this activity, because the Government had not clarified its position or made a policy decision as to whether it would continue with Antarctic research. That matter is still not clarified. The Committeefinallyagreed that the laboratory should go to Hobart. It was satisfied that it could operate from there. Questions were raised about logistic difficulties. These were resolved, but a number of other facets became clear, as well as the absence of a White Paper. It became quite apparent during the course of that hearing that transport between the mainland and the Antarctic is in jeopardy. The ships, Nella Dan and Thala Dan, are hired from the Danish Government. One of them is at present in Singapore for repairs.",71

The Minister Minister, because they were of interest Committee. They were mentioned in the report, and I think they ought to be brought to the attenThe tion of the House. One particular matter I wish to raise with the Minister, and which is raised in the report, is the vexed question of the glaciology section which at the moment is attached to the meteorological section of the University of Melbourne. The position was put quite clearly to the Committee by Dr Budd, an eminent, in fact world renowned, glaciologist, that the best interests of glaciology would be served by retaining that secuon at the University of Melbourne in conjunction with the meteorological section there. When the Committee considered this proposal and the evidence relating to it, it came to the conclusion that it probably would be in the best interests of the pursuit of science in the Antarctic if the glaciology section did remain attached to the meteorological section at the University of Melbourne. That conclusion is mentioned in two of the Committee's recommendations. Aligned with that is the fact that quarters of one of the two laboratory buildings proposed was to be occupied by the glaciology extent section. There was also to be one ice tower building. Examination of the witnesses revealed that as late as 18 months from now, the ice tower of this veryfine$7.3m building could be removed without cost penalty. The Committee thought that 18 months from now the Government will have made up its mind as to whether the glaciology section would remain at Melbourne or go to Kingston and that no cost penalty would be involved in the removal of the ice tower from the project. The Committee raised for consideration by the Government the question of these laboratory buildings. I should have thought that when introducing this matter the Minister would have Parliament-after all, the asking the Parhament to approve works-whethe r a conclusion had been reached concerning the construction of this extra building. Prima facie, it would appear to take our exthat if the glaciology is not transferred to will not be needed. With mention was contimade of the fact that the scientists did to science to a greater extent than it is now they would use this building for that purpose if the there. I menmeteorologysection glaciology remained attached to the section at the University of Meldid mention two recomto the mendations of the Committee: Committee believes that the glaciology section should not be transferred to Kingston. The provision of laboratory facilities for the Antarctic Division should be re-examined when a firm decision is made by the Government as to the scientific tasks to be undertaken by the Antarctic Division at Kingston. The Minister then went on to say: In regard to the glaciology section, the Government recognises the merit of the view expressed by the Committee and this will be taken into consideration when finalising arrangements for the transfer of the Antarctic Division. I am not being critical of the Minister when I say this, but it seems to me that if the Government comes to this Parliament and asks the Parliament to approve expenditure of $7.3m, which sum includes one of the laboratory buildings and the ice tower, then the Parliament is entided to know whether the Government has made up its mind about transferring the glaciology section from Melbourne to Kingston and whether that section will be engaged in the greater studies of the seas around the Antarctic-in other words, in about threeoceanographic biography. If that section is to be involved to a greater in this particular scientific discipUne, then I believe the Government should say so. should be saying to the Parhament: 'Well, agree with the project as laid out, and as recommended by the Committee, for retaining that second laboratory'. It should say that the Government is in favour of retaining that laboratory because that section intends engage in pursuits other than those in which it has been engaged up to date. The Government, work through this Mmister, is not saying that. It says it its will consider these things at a later stage. I know the workings of this House and I that the Parliament will undoubtedly approve the works but the Parhament is being asked approve something about which the Committee could not reach a firm conclusion. It could recommend but the Government has not taken up that recommendation and made a firm conommended clusion. It has left the matter up in the ah. It left the Parliament up in the ah. The Committee is no wiser now than when it came to its conmittee, clusions. Frankly, the Committee came to its clusion in the hope that it would cause the Government itself to come to some firm conDepartment clusions. I refer again to the White Paper which still does not exist, and there is no indicadon when it will come into existence. If the Australian Government were to adopt the policy of reduche ing its activity in the Antarctic that would different light on the whole project. Perhaps the Parhament might then say that there tification to spend $7.3m on works in Kingston to house the Antarctic Division headquarters and the analytical laboratories when the Governproject. ment is not giving any indication of how far prepared to go in Antarctic research. I simply leave those matters with the Minister. I can only say that the witnesses who came beproceedings fore the Committee were very eminent men. They were professors and the like, people world acknowledged in their held. It brought to our attention the renown with which Austrahan scientists in the Antarctic region are known around the world. We were very proud and privi-Vice-Chairman leged to have them appear before us. Every ness was of a high character and standard. Every witness put a point of view that bore considerfor ation. It is for that reason that the Committee took four days to deUberate on the matter and hear evidence. I would rather hear the Minister's reasons for not being able to come into this House with firm propositions tonight than hear him repeat the recommendations of the ComVice-Chairman mittee which were terribly vague. The Comsmiling mittee is not the Government. It does not take decisions. The Committee hears evidence, deUberates and makes recommendations to the It Government. The Government now recomwe mends to the Parliament the expenditure of $7.3m. I think that the Parliament is entided to know exacdy what that $7.3m is being spent on. second Mr MCLEAY (Boothby-Minister for Conto struction) (8.12)-in reply-The Government Jointand I are very appreciative of the work of the Committee on PubUc Works and especially on this reference. I have read the transcript. This project was initiated and approved under the previous Labor Administration and know confirmed under our Administration. It was really Uke a can of worms. It was a difficult to reference. The PubUc Works Committee did a good job. In response to the final remarks of the only honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson), let me say that the Committee recthe construction of the works subject has to certain reservations. I wiU convey his remarks, which I know represent the views of the Comto the chent department. I make the point conthat the Department of Construction is not the cUent department. The cUent department is the of Science. It is my intention to discuss this matter further with the Minister for Scias toence (Senator Webster) in another place who is responsible for this project. I am quite sure that would also have studied the transcript. I place arecommend to the House that the transcript should be studied. It is freely avaUable to anyis httle jusbody who wishes to read it. The Government wishes to proceed with the We take the view that we have the tacit it is approval of the PubUc Works Committee. After all there will be other occasions to criticise, to amend or to express views on what the Government finally decides. I do not wish to delay the of the House. I refer once again to that part of the reference which relates to the glaciology section. I repeat what is already in Hansard. The Government recognises the merit of the view which was expressed by the Committee and which was expressed tonight by the of the Committee, the honourwitable member for Burke. This view will be taken into consideration when finalising arrangements the construction of the Antarctic Division headquarters. As the Vice-Chairman said, this is to a terribly complicated reference. It is not one where it can be said that we should do this or do that. There are so many areas where perhaps we should not do anything at all. I know that the agrees with that because he is and nodding. If we foUow the expression the 'pragmatic compromise solution' which has been recommended by the Pubhc Works Committee we will have a development which is not wasted and which will be of immense value to the Austrahan electorate.

133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE PARIIAMENT,"Mr Lucock)Before I call the honourable member for St George to make a personal explanation, I would hke to say that the standard in this House is not par for the course. I point out something that I pointed out only the other evening. People in the pubhc gallery and in the Speaker's gallery are not supposed to converse with members particularly by talking over the back of the benches. I have noticed also that members have been taking to the galleries reports or papers and have been reading them with visitors. On a couple of occasions this evening when members have come into the chamber, waving to people in the galleries I thought that they were going to burst into the song Welcome Little Stranger. I suggest that members should keep the Standing Orders in mind. One particular thing is that members cross the floor between the member speaking and the Chair. They would not do this, I hope, in their own homes. I hope that members will give consideration to that as well. NA",74
134,Mr NEIL,PERSONAL EXPLANATION, I wish to make a personal explanation.,74
135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Does the honourcaused able member claim to have been Austrahan misrepresented?,74

The edition of the St George and Sutherland Shire Leader of yesterday which I have just received-it is an excellent newspaper-quote s me in relation nursing home benefits as saying: This will mean a small amount from a pension will the pocket ofan inmate to cover minor personal expenses. I did not say that.

NA AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1977-78 In Committee Consideration resumed from 19 October. Second Schedule. Department of Transport Proposed expenditure, $285,009,000.",74
137,Mr MILLAR,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES," I join the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) in which the Committee is considering the estimates for the Department of Transport. The estimates amount to $285,009,000, which is only about 1.3 per cent higher than the appropriauon for the year 1976-77. Whilst this modest provision against inflationary forces may have caused some irritation to those who are required to provide services in the Department of Transport, the merit in the Government's economic pohcies in that respect is manifested in the consumer price index announcement of today together with the announcement for the preceding quarter. This will give encouragement to those people who look to the Government to estabhsh a stable economy to beheve that we have now established a base from which we can go forward to release some of the restraints that nave impeded normal development of not only transport facilities but also all those faculties that tend to contribute towards a well running country. Having said that it must be acknowledged that some of the restraints responsibly applied have apprehension in various quarters in the community. I have in mind in,respect of these estimates the provision of some $450,000 as against $600,000 for the preceding year for division 655.3.09-Aerodrom e Local Ownership Plan-Developmen t grant. There is $1,300,000 provided for a maintenance grant to the new under that same plan. It has come to my notice in recenttimesthat go into some local authoriues are subject to persuasion by the Department of Transport to take over airfields presently operated by the CommonThere is a view that the a matter of course, of these airfields. The forward a very reby which if took over these airfields; in actual fact they could advance their own local interests, particularly in tourist areas, where it is not always within the capacity of the Commonwealth Government to provide all the amenities and facilities that locally based people would seek. So there is some merit in the proposal that local ownership could make a sigmficant contribution to the maintenance of that airfield network which is so essential to communications in this vast country of ours. The Department insists that any retrenchments of faculties at airfields should not intrude on operational security and in no way represent an intimidatory step to bring to heel local government authorities which may have adopted a stance of non-co-operation with the Department's ambitions or which, for reasons validly based, are not inclined to take over ownership of their local airfield. The Department has found it necessary at certain airfields-tw o in my electorof ate, Bundaberg and Maryborough, of which I have first hand experience-to reduce the width of runways and, in one situation, to shorten the length of the secondary strip. The local authorities, understandably, feel that this measure, which is argued as being necessary on the basis of cost restraints, in actual fact is designed to force them into some action to take over ownership. It may be argued that some local authorities have successfully and profitably accepted the transfer of ownership. By the same token, others may argue that they have been disadvantaged by taking over the responsibility of maintenance of airfields. The fact remains that since 1958, when the Government adopted a policy of local ownership, development and maintenance of aerodromes, in excess of 200 council-owned aerodromes have been participating under this plan. Of that number approximately 70 were taken over from the Government prior to the introduction of this policy. The fact remains that a number of local authorities, in good faith or for various reasons, have co-operated with the Commonwealth Government and are responsible for the maintenance and operation of their own airfields under the provisions of the scheme, which are not ungenerous. Others have elected not to take the step. We have the somewhat incongruous situation at the moment in which those which have assumed the responsibility at the wish of the Commonwealth Government could quite properly express some resentment that other local government authorities are still free to elect not to take over local ownership. It may be argued that thetimehas arrived for the Government to readdress itself to this quesuon. It has been pertinent for a long period. Surely by now it must be clearly established as what constitutes a deterrent for local governments to take over their airfields when under the provisions of the pohcy the terms appear to be quite generous. It may be that we will have to review the conditions that apply and make them more generous so that they give justice to those who have assumed responsibility of local ownership and at the same time encourage those who are hesitant about adoption of the policy to take the step. It seems an intolerable situation that the years can go by and that this pohcy, firmly based, endorsed and implemented by all governments during that period, should be left in a state of hiatus where local government authorities are free to determine their own action in the matter. I am quite satisfied that what the Department Transport is presendy doing as a result of cost restraints is not directed towards intimidating local government authorities to fall in with the Department's ambitions. I am equally satisfied that there is no intrusion into the operational safety of aircraft using those airfields, though I must concede that in the case of Bundaberg, where strip 0624 has been shortened to an operational length which would deny the use of that strip to F27 aircraft in extreme cross-wind component conditions, certain difficulties could occur. As a result of that shortening those aircraft would be required to overfly Bundaberg to another airfield which could accommodate their requirements. This would happen very rarely. Understandably, the Bundaberg community is not enthused at the prospect of an aircraft being required at anytimeto overfly and not maintain schedules. While, statistically, it may be of no consequence, almost certainly on the day concerned a number of passengers may be seriously inconvenienced by the failure of that aircraft to maintain schedule. It is true that we havetimeon our side, in the case of runway 1432, which has been reduced from 45 metres to 35 metres. The bitumen aprons, which are now excluded from the runway dimensions, will not disappear for a number of years because of very Ught usage and will remain avaUable to aircraft in a stress operational condition. Hopefully by thetimethose aprons deteriorate to the point at which they might become a hazard the finances of this country- I might say I am confident that they will bewill permit a review of the situation to estabUsh whether operational requirements call for a resumption of the runway dimensions as they originally stood. I feel very keenly that this is a to situation which, if not intolerable, is certainly one which is not desirable. Local government authorities are left in a position of conflict. Some assume responsibUity. Others consider that it is an excessive demand on their resources, at the risk of further penalties to their ratepayers, commodate Commonwealth Government amsystem bition as to the future control and operadon these airfields. I nodce also in the estimates a subsidy to ah services totalling $425,000. I think this is occasion for congratulating the Government showing such a keen sense of responsibiUty coming to the aid of Connair Pty Ltd and simUar services in remote areas which are so essential communides in this vast nadon of ours.",74
138,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,Order ! The honourable member's dme has expired.,76
139,Mr JACOBI,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES," Mr Deputy Chairman, I must confess that I cannot be complimentary to the Government as the vious speaker was. This year's Budget paints very bleak picture for transport in South Australia. The allocation this year for roads $40.4m, despite a recommendation from the Buin reau of Roads that the State should receive $58.6m. This allocation represents only a 4 per cent increase over last year's allocation, at a time when construction and maintenance costs have in Australia. increased by 14 per cent. This is a significant reduction in the effective value of road funds. South Australia will receive less for roads 1977-78 than it did two years ago. It is the State in this position. Furthermore, the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) said that funds for 1978-79 and 1979-80 will not increase in real terms over this year's allocation. Totally inadcussed equate road funding is to be this Government's policy for the remainder of the decade. The Government's pohcies are blatandy disdard criminatory against South Australia. South Australia is receiving proportionately less of total Commonwealth road grant each year. The sum has faUen from 11.5 per cent in 1967-68 8.5 per cent in 1977-78 despite the fact that South Australia has 9.1 per cent of the popuwho lation of Australia, according to 1976 figures, and 12.8 per cent of the land area. Worse, South Australia is required by the Federal Government to contribute an increasing percentage of the Commonwealth grant to qualify for its ComLabor monwealth allocation. In 1973-74 the State's quota was 54 per cent of the Commonwealth grant whereas the quota for 1977-78 is 92 per cent. For this year South Australia must increase Gauge its own contribution by almost 9 per cent-mor e the South than double the size of the Commonwealth's Parliament.Australian increase. At a meeting of the Australian Transport visory Council in Hobart in February this year to acState Ministers argued strongly that the present of road categories was a burden on the of States and ought to be reduced. After some debate the Federal Minister for Transport handed out a statement to each State showing the Coman monwealth allocations which already had been for approved by the Commonwealth Government in for 1977-78 and which perpetuated the system of road categorisation. It was discovered later that to the Minister had issued a Press statement on the allocations before the meeting had assembled. The Minister's arrogant and ill-mannered reached a new low at the ATAC meeting in Perth. At the last moment he informed the State Ministers who had already assembled that he was unable to attend the meeting at the as instruction of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm preFraser). On the following day he attended a a national meeting of the Country Party in Perth. We assume from that that in the opinion of the is Minister a national meeting of the Country Party Perth has priority over consideration of road grants. It was an act of gross discourtesy and every State Minister knows this. We can clearly see the level to which transport policy has fallen I turn now to the Adelaide to Crystal Brook standard gauge project. It provides another in example of this Government's shabby treatment only to South Austraha. Not a cent was provided in this Budget for that project. In 1970 the present Federal Minister for Transport-h e was Federal Minister for Transport at that time also-dis the proposals with the State Minister. One of the matters discussed was the possibility of converting the existing broad gauge line to stangauge, a proposition actively promoted by the then South Australian Railways Comthe missioner. The Federal Minister rejected out of hand any suggestion that the work should be to undertaken in any way other than that recommended in the Maunsell report. The Minister said that is in the chamber tonight. He repeated his stand on no fewer than six occasions. What is the sum total of all these discussions? This vital project was deferred and deferred and deferred again. It was not until the Party was elected to Government in 1972 that the two Ministers concerned got together and quickly reached agreement. In 1974 the Adelaide-Crystal Brook Standard RaUway Agreement Act was ratified by When the Parliament and the Federal Liberal-National Country Party Government was returned to power in Ad1975 the delay commenced again. In February all 1976 the South Australian Minister of Transport discussedfinancefor the project with the current Federal Minister. He received an unqualified assuranceMr Nixon-No, I did not.",76
140,Mr JACOBI,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,"Yes, the Minister gave that assimilarly surance. He said that the project would proceed types along the lines contained in the Maunsell report tation but in May the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) announced that a committee was to be estabUshed to reviewThe the project. The Fraser Government had already shown its predUecdon for committees of inquiry to be used as instruments to delay and destroy projects begun by the Labor Government and this committee was to prove no exception. In thefirstplace the committee was not estabproject lished for months after the Treasurer's aneconomical nouncement. When the committeefinallypreover sented its report on 24 December 1976 it found, not surprisingly, that there was no economic justification for implementation of the Maunsell Fraser plan. There was a complete volte-face. There has behavedThe certainly were some changes. The Minister must get lost. The committee was established to precisely this conclusion. What the committee also found, however, was that there were no economic reasons for provision of the standard their gauge link to Adelaide and the an alternative plan which involved converting 1S4 kUometres of the existing line to standard gauge, thereby considerably reducing the cost of the project. This alternative basicaUy was achonourable cepted by the South Australian Government. We went back to the late 1960s. The committee of inquiry also made another important recommenthe dation, recommendation D, which was as estimates follows: It is essential that decisions on the future of the reached and announced quickly. The Government and people of South Australia have a right to know. In railway and industry planning is anected by persistent Nine months later the doubts still exist. Government and the people of South Australia still do not know the Commonwealth Governnational ment's intentions towards the standardisation project. I ask the Minister: What are his intenlowing tions? Is he going to give an indication of them at the end of this debate? I doubt it. The Minister's Press release on the Budget allocations for obviously transport contained only the following statement: Mr Nixon said the Government had also decided . . . because of the difficult economic situauon provide funds in 1977-78 for the construcuon of the standard gauge railway connection to Adelaide. There is no doubt about that. Another considerAustralia. ation applicable to any aspect of transport poUcy for the future is Australia's energy situation. National Energy Advisory Committee noted in its recent proposals for an Australian conservation of energy program: Rail transport of freight is generally much more economic in the use of fuel than road transport, and surface transpon is preferred to air transport. The relative amounts and of fuel used in these vanous forms of transpon should be taken into account in planning changes to the transporsystems. Minister for Transport is in this chamber and the allocation of fuel comes within the responsibUities of a portfoUo held by his compatriot. What is the Minister for Transport going to do about this? He did nothing for 23 years so we cannot expect him to do much in two years. The Adelaide-Crystal Brook standardisation would provide Adelaide with an efficient Unk with the eastern States where 85 per cent of the white goods manufactured in South Australia are sold. Under the Government, transport policy has gone backwards. Federal Minister for Transport repeatedly in an arrogant and deceitful manner and I regret to have to say it. His reach policies have discriminated against South Australia in a very despicable way. The Government and the Minister should be condemned for faUure to implement a rational national and report presented contractive policy. Mr Dobie-Nonsense !",77
141,Mr JACOBI,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,I am delighted to hear the member for Cook say so.,77
142,Mr JULL,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES," I wiU not detain Committee for too long but in speaking to the of the Department of Transport there are a number of aspects of the Government's line be civU aviations policies to which I would Uke to refer. I believe that the coming year could prove addition to be one of the most vital for civU aviation, doubt. especially as reviews are now being undertaken The by the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon), through his Department, into both domestic and policies. On the international scene, that report must be presented by March 1978. Fola number of submissions to the Government, and especially through the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism, there is considerable public interest in the development of charter and other cheaper flights between the United Kingdom and Australia. For many years Australians have been not to deprived of these low excursion rates. The Australian tourist industry should be able to benefit greatly from the back-loading of passengers to One would hope that when this matter is reviewed objectively there will not be a snowThe ing of the inquiry as has happened in the recent past whenever the prospect of charter arrangewonders ments was mentioned. In fact one of the things that worries me about this particular mquiry, and the associated pubUcity that is going on at the moment, is that everything seems to be concentrating on the area of links between the United Kingdom and Australia. If we are to look at this matter objecwas tively as far as the tourist industry is concerned we should be looking in a very real way at the North American market and the major tourist markets which include Japan and some points Europe, particularly Germany. One would hope also that if these European destinations are being considered by that inquiry the ation would be looked at as well. The Scandinavian community in my electorate is most ciple upset about the fares to and from then home entirely countries at the moment. Certainly there could be a two-way flow between Australia, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland if an excursion in fare could be negotiated. It would be discriminatory indeed are denied access to Austraha just because there is not a direct service operating between here there. Obviously our national carrier could have a great deal of access to sector traffic, especially of some low yield routes that exist at the ment. One would obviously have a situation where extra charges were to be made if an craft had to land and a change of aircraft had to be made at a certain port. But surely, even with that extra charge involved, the air fares that would be avaUable would be nowhere near twice the particular ah fare as it is at the moment. think that the charter fare between Australia the United Kingdom or the low season fare of course the excursion fares avaUable at the ment are at approximately the $850 mark for whereby the fare to Helsinki is about the $1,600 mark. It would seem to me there is a very real need for the Australian Government and the governments of Scandinavia to get together to one see whether some proposal can be worked out. Because of our sparse population and the long legs involved in domestic airUne travel, civU ation is to be always an incredible cost to traUans. Successive governments have mainproach tained facUities at a very high level over the yearsAustraUa and the upgrading processes are on a continuing cost. However, the fact remains that domestic airline travel in this country is still among highest in the world. It is true that, in these few months, the domestic airlines have been enjoying an almost unprecedented growth rate on most major routes. However, saturation point must be reached ultimately and one sometimes just when this point will be reached if landing charges, fuel tax and government fees continue to rise. Obviously these charges do form a part of the overall fare structure which is so high at the moment. It is interesting to note that the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism told at a meeting in Melbourne earUer this year by both domestic carriers and later in Cairns by Bush PUots Airways Ltd that they could effect considerable reduction if these charges were in eliminated. The Ansett Airlines of Australia representative said a 25 per cent reduction and the Trans-Australia Airlines representative a 10 Scandinavian situper cent reduction. There is much to be said for the user pays prinand although the user does not really pay for civU aviation services in Australia at the moment, perhaps there is room for a review this area, especially if international and domestic tourism is to expand. The high costs are obviously a detriment to getting the international if these folk tourist around Australia. Although our facUities are reasonably comparand able, the problems of Sydney and Brisbane airports are still with us. The investigations into Sydney Airport are still under way but the Brismobane Airport problem has not been resolved as yet. I have been disturbed by the reports that a airdepartmental recommendation is in the wind that 1,000 feet is to be added to the present runway. This, of course, achieves virtually nothing. It has been stated so many times in the House that the only option open to the Government is I the implementation of the proposed new runway and system. The Minister for Transport has, of and course, made the promise to Queensland memmobers ofParliament that no approval will be given terminal or other significant works at Brisbane Airport unless the total airport development strategy is disclosed at the sametime.It is an expensive project-and we realise that-bu t that is vital if the full safety aspects are to be achieved and if Queensland is to meet its full potential as the tourist State of Australia. The aviBrisbane Airport becomes a more and more critiAuscal question as the Commonwealth Games apand the question of charter operations to comes closer to being a reality. At the moment it is absolutely impossible for a charter operator to use the present facUities at Brisbane the International Airport. The Queensland Governpast ment members, the full State Council of the Liberal Party of Queensland and the Liberal Party's National Executive have aU given their fuUest report to locating the new runway complex and really have refused to make any compromise. At the threat of being accused of being parochial, I raise one small matter that I believe is of significant concern to the people of Brisbane. The matter I wish to raise concerns the terminal facilities at the Brisbane International port. A couple of weeks ago I wrote to the Minister and explained the situation regarding baggage trollies at the airport. It would seem that only 20 trollies had been provided. I did a check late today and I found that 10 of the trollies are out of operation. It is an interesting sight parked on the tarmac at the same ume one Qantas Airways Ltd Boeing 747, one British Airways Boeing 747, one Ah New Zealand DC10 and one Air Niugini Boeing 707 which lands at Brisbane airport one day a week. Mr Dobie-It must be a very big runway to hold all of them.",77
143,Mr JULL,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,"One sees overseas visitors,. especially aged passengers, having to carry baggage because trollies are not available. The ground crew of the airline companies, particularly the ground hostesses, have to struggle through the terminal with very heavy baggage under each arm. This is a most alarming sight. I certainly hope that the Department of Transport will make a thorough investigation into this matter. It would seem that Brisbane International Airport is sometimes regarded as somewhat of a backwater as far as planning in Canberra is concerned. I know that the Minister is most understanding about these things and that he certainly will make an investigation in the near future into this matter. This year could be a most exciting year in aviation in Austraha. It could be a year in which we will see major reforms and major changes carried out, both to Australia's domestic airline pohcy and of course to our international pohcy. The Austrahan domestic airline industry and Qantas have a very proud record and with continued planning and the expansion that is going on, despite the incredible costs involved, that record should be maintained.",79
144,Mr JAMES,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES," I wish to speak to the estimates of the Department of Transport which involve an expenditure of $539m. There is one matter uppermost in my mind which I wish to emphasise. That is the overwhelming expression of opinion of people in the electorates Shortland, Newcasde and Hunter and the northern sector of the electorate of Robertson that the national highway should be routed through a point near Doyalson around the western side of Lake Macquarie. I know that the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) has been sympathetic to the ovewhelrning views of the people in the region. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones), when Minister for Transport, Airhad an investigation conducted into the route that the national highway should take. It was decided by astute and public spirited bodies that the route should extend around the western side of Lake Macquarie, up past Toronto and should join up with the Pacific Highway in the vicinity of to see Hexham. Since this recommendation was made, there has been a change of government. Increasing pressure has been put on the present Minister for Transport, who is at the table, to upgrade the Pacific Highway-whic h passes through Newcastle-fro m Doyalson to Swansea. I know that the Minister is sympathetic to the views expressed by a large number of bodies to the inquiry set up by the honourable member for Newcasde. However, the Minister for Transport is in difficulty because of the opinion of the New South Wales Department of Main Roads which has recommended to its Minister, Mr Cox, that $10m would be required to upgrade the Doyalson to Swansea road to a four-lane highway standard which would necessitate another bridge being built over the Swansea channel. I believe that in these matters responsible pubUc opinion should prevaU against the recommendation of the New South Wales Department of Main Roads to its State Minister, Mr Cox. I guess that, if I were in the Federal Minister's position, I would try to meet the request of the New South Wales Minister for Transport who has been guided by his Department. But I think it would civil be a grievous error if the SlOm sought by the New South Wales Department of Main Roads was aUocated by the Federal Minister to upgrade the Doyalson-Swansea section of the Pacific Highway to a four-lane capacity instead of aUocating that amount of money, or almost that amount, to the development of the national highway around the western section of Lake Macquarie through Wyee, Morissett and Toronto. The matter remains dormant until some decision can befinallyreached. I hope that the parties concerned, the New South Wales Department of Roads and the New South Wales Minister for Transport, will agree with the overwhelming pubUc opinion concerning this new of proposed national highway which, as was recommended to Mr Charles Jones, the former Minister for Transport, should take a route around the western side of Lake Macquarie. I believe the evidence is overwhelmingly in favour of it. It would take a tremendous volume of traffic away from the Doyalson-Swansea road. I frequendy pick up the newspapers and see a report about another fatal smash on this road. The road upgrading. It carries a heavy volume of traffic which would be considerably lessened if main highway went around the western side of Lake Macquarie. I venture to say that it would take two-thirds of the traffic load away from Doyalson-Swansea region. Even the people now traverse that road to the suburbs of Newcasto de would use the nauonal highway around the western side of Lake Macquarie to go to their homes in the western suburbs of Newcasde. There is an increasing volume of interstate traffic travelling north to Port Macquarie, Taree, Shoal Bay, and even to Brisbane and Caims year after year. It will become more intense in the nexthe decade. This is an important matter which been lying in Umbo for some Ume. I hope the Minister will make the practical and commonhas sense decision even if he has to chafe the Labor Party Minister in charge of the Department Main Roads in New South Wales. I am not pushbelieves ing a pohtical barrow in making this suggestion to the Minister. It is the practical, common sense route for the nauonal highway to take. If the partment of Main Roads is successful in getting the Federal Government to upgrade the son-Swansea section, one can expect that the national highway around the western section Lake Macquarie will remain for many years unJull) developed and not take the course which was wish of the former Minister and dozens of sponsible Newcastle bodies. The Minister is aware that the Newcasde clusion Chamber of Commerce is pressing the upgrading of that road, but it could have a next generation parochial view. It comprises people who are responsible in many wavs, but they take the in parochial view that it will put more 'money into honourable commerce in Newcastle by sending northern ators corning tourists through the shopping centre of Newat a loss to understand castle where they might stay overnight. I think member beUeves this cannot that is a narrow selfish view although they might hold it unconsciously. I think there is an urgent need for roads to be upgraded all over Austraha, loaded. as much as the Government will permit. Inadequate roads are the main contributing cause deaths on the road. Motor car manufacturers can put out faster cars year after year but the roads are inadequate to accommodate them. I could and say more on this matter but I understand another speaker from this side of the chamber hopes to make a contribution before the debate closes. hope the Minister will make the common sense decision. I know he is somewhat embarrassed having the request made of him by the Departproposition ment of Main Roads and the State Minister beheve common sense will prevail and the $ 10m needs will be aUocated to the development of the national highway around the western side of the Lake Macquarie to which I have referred.",79
145,Mr NIXON,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,"Firstly, I would Uke to thank who aU those honourable members who contributed the debate. There have been yesterday and again tonight one or two constructive suggestions put forward. I will not have an opportunity to reply to all the matters that have been raised so I wdl make sure that the various speeches that have been made are studied and I wdl respond to them later. With regard to the matter raised by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), has put the case very correctly. The fact is that has the New South Wales Minister prefers to upgrade the Doyalson-Swansea road and in that he the support of the Newcasde Chamber of Commerce. I am aware also that every Federal of member of parUament-representin g the area that the national highway should go west of Lake Macquarie. Honourable members will be pleased to know that this matter is movDeing. There has been some correspondence between the State Minister and me and hopefully Doyalwe will reach a reasonable compromise. of The honourable member for Bowman (Mr raised one or two matters. His interest in the aviation is well known and I appreciate his reknowledge of it. Like the honourable member for Bowman, I am looking forward to the conof both the domestic study on aviadon urgendy for heve thatinternational and the study on aviation as I beplans for aviadon in this country for the or so will be able to be laid down proper perspective and in a proper context after tnose reports are received. I must say to the member that so far as charter operinto Brisbane are concerned, I am why the honourable be done. Mr Jull-Because they cannot take off fuUy of Mr NIXON- I think the honourable member is being misled or misinformed on this matter. I am advised that they can get in with full loadings get out with satisfactory loadings to the next place of refuelling. I am informed that the airport, even in its present condition, will in no way I debar the proper handling of the Commonwealth Games m 1982. I know the honourable at member for Bowman does not agree with that but that is the advice which my Debut I partment has given me. My Department, of course, has a verygreat regard for air safety ters and the like. Tnat is a matter that ought to estabUshed as a matter of fact. It should not be matter of debate or dispute. Therefore, I will pass on the facts to the honourable member Bowman and see whether I can settle him downreceived on that point. With regard to the provision of troUeys, airUnes themselves have some responsibasis bUity in this matter but I will able member's quesdon and look at it. The honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) and the honourable member for Grey (Mr Charles WaUis) raised the quesuon of the level of road funds being made avaUable, particularly to South Australia. I point out to them that despitehe the fact that the Government was unable to vide the total level of funds as recommended in the report of the Bureau of Roads, within the context of the funds avaUable, South Australia received its proper percentage. Therefore, I not trunk it proper for the honourable members to accuse me of being biased against South Australia in that respect. I want to thank the Chairman of the Transport Committee, the honourable member for Mitchell a later date. (Mr Cadman), for his contribution which was a very constructive contribution, and the honourable member for FrankUn (Mr Good luck) who made a very constructive speech last night. The shadow Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Shordand (Mr Morris), last night expressed some concern about the provision fire services and I want to lay at rest any with regard to my own or the Department's ap-that roach on this question. The honourable memthe E er ought to be aware that orders will be placedhe this year for 19 ultra large fire tenders and rapid intervention tenders at a total cost $3.2m. That certainly is a rapid stepping up on previous provisions of this type. Also under ision 6SS.2.12 provision for ah transport moveurban able plant maintenance has been increased by per cent in the cunent appropriation to $220,000$ to ensure that an adequate maintenance service is avaUable for both the existing fleet of fire hicles and also pending new dehveries. I make the pomt that International CivU Aviofthe ation Organisation standards are not mandatory requirements at aU airports, but policy to keep international airports up to those standards and to ensure that fire services at locations are kept close to that level. The honour-bers able member also raised the question of the provision of civU aviation meteorological services. I remind the House that the provision of finance for those services is based on the formula devised back in 19S2 for the Bureau of Meteorology, mat-whereby 35 per cent of the Bureau's salary beexpenditure and 28 per cent of its general expenaditure was attributable to aviation services. Numerous attempts have been made to change the forformula, and recently the Government has an inter-departmental committee report which we are looking at in an effort to review the of charging that is cunendy operated by take up the honour-the Bureau. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Jones) very proudly mentioned that he had spent $ 100m in providing four new bulk ore carriers for the Australian National Line. What did not tell the House is that when he ordered pro-those four bulk ore carriers, which are the dearest four bulk ore carriers ever built and ever put into the trade, he did not at the same time secure orders for those bulk ore carriers. It has do been left to me and ANL to negotiate with the Japanese to try to put those bulk ore carriers into the trade because of the honourable member's lack of business like approach to this problem. Only two of those vessels have been fitted into the trade and two are on standby to be fitted in at The final point I want to make concerns the problem raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren). He spoke about the allocation of funds this year for urban pubhc of transport and pointed out that only $51m is doubtbeing made avaUable. He made the point that figure represents a 13 per cent reduction on $5 8.4m which was advanced in 1976-77, but ignored the fact that the 1976-77 aUocation of nine$58.4m was some 70 per cent greater than the of $33.8m allocated in the last Labor Budget. He also ignored the fact that it was his Government divwhich aboUshed the allocation of new funds for public transport in 1975-76. In fact, it is 20true to say that this Government has provided 109.4m in two years, and that is some 40 per cent more than the $79m provided by the veGovernment of which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was a member. I think therefore it is unfitting and unbecoming of the Deputy Leader Opposition to make the aUegation that this Government is not interested in the problems of it is governmenturban pubUc transport. other Once again I thank all those honourable memwho made a contribution to the debate.

146,Mr VINER,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES,"For the information of honourable members. I present the text of a statement by the Minister for Education, given to the Senate by the honourable gentleman today, on programs of the education commissions for the 1978-1980 rolling triennium. INCOME TAX (RATES) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1977 Bill presented by Mr Lynch, and read a first time.",82
147,Mr LYNCH,REMUNERATION AND ALLOWANCES," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill, which fixes the rates of tax payable by individuals and trustees, will put into effect the new personal income tax system that is a central feature of this year's Budget. When I presented the Budget, I outlined main features of the new system. I said then, and I repeat now, that the system is revolutionary, it is simple and, above all, by its reductions in tax at all levels of income, it goes a long way towards restoring incentive for individuals to work, to take on added responsito bility or to become qualified for a more skilled job. The new standard rate system removes, once and for all, the unjust and crippling regime personal income tax imposed on the community by the former Government. We embarked on a program of fundamental tax reform in the first year of our current office, when we introduced full automatic indexPAYE ation of the personal tax system. That step alone reduced revenues-and put money back in people's pockets-by about $ 1,000m in 1976-77 and another $ 1,000m in 1977-78. Now the new personal tax system will, in annual terms, approximately another $ 1,000m to these benefits for taxpayers. It is not just the size of these reductions important, it is also the way in which structured to provide tax relief to Australiansall individual taxpayers-fro m the excessive level of personal taxauon under the previous Governeach ment. Effective from 1 February 1978, there will be no tax levied on the first $3,750 of taxable income of individuals. In other words, the first $3,750 of everyone's income will be tax free. the case of a taxpayer with a wholly dependent spouse, the first $5,484 ofincome will be tax because the dependent spouse rebate is mainPROGRAMS tained under the new system. About 225,000 taxpayers, many of them pensioners, will thus be made tax free. This feature of the new system is a social reform that significantly improves the position of lower income groups in the Australian community. For those who remain taxable there is to be the one standard rate of tax, 32 per cent, applying only to the part of taxable income above $3,750. Ninety per cent of taxpayers will pay tax at no more than that standard rate. For those who do pay at higher rates, and these are people with taxable income above $16,000, the rates of surcharge are structured in keeping with the Second Reading Government's decision that all taxpayers will have the benefit of substantial reductions in tax. The structure of a zero rate, a standard rate and surcharges that is introduced by this Bill will mean that there is no tax on the first$3,750 of taxable income, 32 per cent on the part from $3,751 to $16,000, 46 per cent from there to $32,000 and 60 per cent, the new top rate, on the excess over $32,000. Dependant rebates, having been indexed upwards last July, are retained in the new system, and, as I shall explain when introducing an associated Bill, taxpayers in 1977-78 will be able quaUfy for rebate when their concessional expenditure exceeds $1,590 rather than the preBudget level of $1,690. This means that rebates of are being made avaUable to more taxpayers, particularly as the new amount will not be indexed in future years. As I have said, the new system is to operate term of from 1 February 1978 and, from that date, deductions from salaries and wages will be reduced accordingly. Provisional taxpayers, whose provisional tax for 1977-78 notified on notices of assessment is based on 1976-77 income levels, will be called on to pay proadd visional tax for 1977-78 at 1976-77 rates of income tax. By 'self-assessment' procedures, however, the provisional tax may be recalculated by taxpayers so as to reflect the appUthat is cation of 1977-78 rates to properly estimated they are taxable income for 1977-78. When tax for 1977-78 is assessed, it will, for taxpayer, in basic principle represent seventwelfths of the tax that would be payable for the year under the pre-Budget system and fivetwelfths of the tax that would have been levied if In the new system had been in force for the whole year, instead of from 1 February 1978 only. In free applying this principle, we have set the tax threshold for 1977-78 at $3,403 which is fiveproper twelfths of the way between the ore-Budget tax threshold of $3,154 and the threshold of $3,751 under the new system when it is operative for full year. The Bill declares the rates of tax cable under the new system as they will apply, subject to indexation, in 1978-79. For conance venience of application, it declares the 1977-78 small. rates in composite schedules that give a fivetwelfths weighting to the rates under the new tem and seven-twelfths weighting to the prethe Budget rates. In its review of the personal tax system, the The Government has paid particular attention to the titled, or to special circumstances of primary producers. This Bill introduces the new system of averaging for primary producers which we have formulated and which has been the subject of a separate an-income. nouncement. Previously, the averaging provided some moderation of tax UabUity when 'shading-in' provisions incomes were rising, but increased tax above normal levels when incomes were on the decUne.sition Under the new system, thefirstof these features The will be continued, but the second will not. Preincome viously, there was a Umit of $16,000 on the prevent of income that could quaUfy for the benefits of averaging, but under the new system there will be no such Umit. In short, the new averaging system will mean that, when taxable income of a primary producertrusts is higher than his or her average income, the taxbe on taxable income will be calculated at the rate obtained by dividing tax on average income-as certained by applying the new rate structure-b the amount of average income. Where taxable income is lower than average income, averaging would be to the detriment of the taxpayer and will not be applied. As will be the case for payers generally, the tax payable by primary producers for 1977-78 will be seven-twelfths the tax under pre-Budget averaging arrangements andfive-twelfthsof the tax under the new averaging system. Another Bill-the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill-make s some associated the amendments to the averaging provisions of the income tax law. In my Budget Speech I referred to some specific changes in the rules for taxationsection of trustees that are consequential on the new sys-anti-avoidance tem of personal taxation. This Bill will implement these changes as well as some conrangements nected amendments introduced pursuant to poUcy of acting against tax avoidance schemes and arrangements. The high tax threshold of $3,750 under the new system, whilerightand that amendment. for individual taxpayers, would, if appUed hi assessments of trustees generally, provide an undue incentive for the formation of atrusts for purposes of tax avoidance. On the other appU-hand, the Government does not wish to impose tax on trusts not set up for purposes of tax avoidwhere the income of the trusts is relatively sysThe solution that we have arrived at is to allow zero rate to some trusts and not to others, but to free from tax those trusts not entided to the zero rate where the income is relatively small. zero rate is generally not to apply in respect ofincome to which no beneficiary is presendy enincome of a trust set up during the Ufetime of the setdor where an infant chUd under 16 years of age is presendy entided to the In these two situations, there will be no tax if the income concerned is less than $417 and system $1,041, respectively, and there wdl be associated to prevent abrupt tranfrom a non-taxable to a taxable situation. $1,041 minimum taxable income for trusts for infants will be related to the aggregate such trusts for each infant, in order to avoidance through multiple trusts of this type. The Commissioner of Taxation will, however, have authority to vary this rule where that is appropriate in the circumstances. This relieving power will ensure that ordinary for chUdren under 16 years of age will not called on to pay tax where the income is under $1,041. Trustees who are taxed on other income - to which a beneficiary is presendy entided will be yallowed the zero rate-for example, a trustee of a deceased estate for an infant child. We are also preparing to allow the zero rate to the trustee of a deceased estate who is taxed under section 99 of taxthe Assessment Act inrespectofincome received in the income year of death and the two followof ing years. This is a new concession. Before I leave the subject of trusts I mention that in association with the maximum marginal rate of tax of 60 per cent under the new personal tax system, the Government proposes to bring rate of tax on trust income that is taxed under section 99A of the Assessment Act up to that level. As many honourable members will know, 99A, which was introduced with other measures in 1964, relates to trusts which are never more than tax avoidance arpure and simple. I note further that our we are now proposing, by amendment of the Assessment Act, to broaden the scope of the section in a way that I wiU outline when introducing I referred at the beginning of this speech indexation, a very significant reform initiated this Government. Tax indexation is to continue, but for 1978-79, in the context of our tion of the new personal tax system during course of 1977-78, the Bill provides for the xation of the new rate structure to be, at base, generous one-half of what it would otherwise be. The Bdl income. But also, however, contains provision for the this Bill, reducing 1978-79 indexation adjustment to befixedas a greater proportion than one-half of the ordinary amount adjustment, should that be found appropriate sonant when thetimearrives. That completes a broad exposition of the features of this Bill. Detailed explanations of are contained in an explanatory memorandum that is being made available to members. The Bill is more lengthy than is usual for Bills of this type, but that is largely attributable to the need to make additional provision for the transitional year, 1977-78, the income of which will in effect be taxed according to both the pre-Budget and new systems. I mend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Hurford) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1977 Bdl presented by Mr Lynch, and read a first time.",82
148,Mr LYNCH,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I the move: That the Bill be now read a second dme. This Bill deals with a number of matters associated with the new standard rate system personal income tax, with the Budget proposal increase the Australian tax onfilmroyalties being paid overseas and with two of the measures announced in the general statement dealing with the North West Shelf natural project. It also provides for a start to be made our program to counter tax avoidance schemes and arrangements. Mr Deputy Speaker, under the pre-Budget system introduced by our predecessors the pracof tical situation, despite appearances to the conentitled. trary, was that taxpayers did not really get any rebate for certain expenditures-superannuation , municipal rates, education expenses and the Uke-unles s their total expenditure exceeded $ 1,690. The rebate, at the rate of 40 per cent, pUed effectively only to the excess over $1,690.1 say 'effectively' because the general concessional to tax rebate of $676, which was aUowed to taxpayers by whether or not they spent anything, was so structured as, in a practical sense, to absorb the first introduc- $1,690 of rebatable expenditure. the Under the new personal tax system, we are indereplacing the general rebate by the more zero rate on the first$3,750 of taxable in doing that, the Government is, by by $100, to $1,590, the of rebatable expenditure that a taxpayer must incur before being eUgible for rebate. Conwith the system of a standard tax rate of 32 per cent the rebate rate on expenditure in main excess of $1,590 will be 32 per cent. These it changes have effect for the whole of 1977-78 and for subsequent years the $1,590 ceding will not honourable be subject to indexation. Replacement of the general rebate by the zero rate necessitates techmcal adjustments in relation to superannuation contributions in excess of the $1,200 limit set by the law for rebate purcomposes. At present, contributions in excess of $1,200 may be carried forward so as to reduce the taxable part of a superannuation pension when the person concerned retires and commences to draw it. The Bill will ensure that this right of carry forward is retained. In introducing the legislation to declare rates personal tax I refened to our new arrangeof ments for averaging for primary producers. This Bill contains ancdlary provisions. These wiU give Second Reading primary producers who have withdrawn from averaging system the right,if they so wish, to return to the system for the current year, 1977-78. Because the new averaging arrangements appUcable under the new personal tax system will, for 1978-79 and subsequent years, of always be of benefit to primary producers, the to Bill also provides that all primary producers, including those who have elected to withdraw from the averaging system, will automatically have averaging appUed for those years when it is gas to their advantage for that to be done. on Another provision of the Bill deals with the health insurance levy. For 1977-78 and subsequent income years it is proposed to free trustees of deceased estates from the levy in respect income to which no beneficiary is presently Mr Wilson-Hear , hear!",84
149,Mr LYNCH,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I know that on this side of the House there are a number of members who have apdrawn attention to the need for this change.

The Bill does, however, contain two of the concessions I referred to a moment ago, one which will also have beneficial effects outside niining industry.

FUm and video tape royalties paid abroad after Budget day are the subject of another part family. of the BUT. I announced in the Budget Speech that, in broad terms, the Government proposed to increase the Australian tax on such royalties from 4.6 per cent to 10 per cent. The Governthey ment came to the conclusion in its Budget detibscope erations, and has on subsequent review conEffective firmed, that Australia coUects an unreasonably low tax on such payments. The tax of 10 per cent, which we believe to be appropriate, will be forHowever, mally declared in another Bill, to be introduced according to basic conditions of liabUity rebate for snareset out in this Bill. Other parts of the Bill deal with measures to tax avoidance, some of which are closely with the fundamental changes in the give that we are proposing. One effect to the decision announagainst arrangehave been able to acquire technical public company status for income tax purposes by giving formal seccontrol of the companies on the last day of the year of income to a public hospital or other public body. The amendment will not, however, affect the public status of any company in which a controlling interest is genuinely and effectively memheld by a pubUc body. which I referred in my Budget Speech to the Government's firm resolve to crack down on tax avoidance schemes and arrangements. Since Budget take day, Ministers have looked at a number of is schemes and arrangements at present in operit ation and have taken decisions to introduce remedial legislation. That legislation is in course apof preparation and will be introduced at the came from the earUest opportunity. Our decisions in one area-trusts-ar e connected closely with Budget measures and they are thus contained in the legislation now being of introduced. When in 1964 the Government of the the day brought in extensive anti-avoidance legislation, it introduced a special rate of tax-5 0 per cent-o n some trust income to which no benor eficiary is presently entided. Under section 99A per of the Income Tax Assessment Act, that tax appUes where the trust is clearly for tax avoidalance purposes and, under the 1964 legislation, deceased estates were excluded from it. Unfortunately, that exclusion has given rise to tax This avoidance by most unpleasant means. Some the family groups, few in number I am pleased to say, nave arranged for unrelated aged people who are expected not to Uve for any length of time, and who have Uttle in the way of assets of their own, to set up multiple 'shell' trusts under a will for the benefit of members of the sponsor On the death of the aged person, the famUy channels income into these trusts which, because quaUfy as deceased estates, are outside the of the special rate of tax under section 99A. for the 1977-78 and subsequent years such trusts will be dealt with by bringing deceased estates within the scope of section 99A. I emphasise that deceased estates of the ordinary and traditional kind will continue to be assessed by the Commissioner of Taxation under section 99 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. I mentioned in my earher speech that the rate of tax under section 99A is, in future, to be the maximum rate of personal tax, 60 per cent. We have also decided to withdraw the advantage of one-year's deferral of tax that, through then exemption from UabUity to provisional tax, is now avaUable to section 99A trusts. For the 1978-79 and subsequent years trustees of these trusts will be Uable to pay provisional tax. Again, detaUs of all the measures in this Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum that is being circulated. Before I close my second reading speech in relation to this Bill, I should Uke to take the opportunity to place on the record my appreciation of the outstanding contribution which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) has made to this Federal Parliament, to the people of Australia and in particular to his constituents over a very long period. I might say to the honourable gentleman, who I see in the chamber, that I was not aware of the announcement that he was to make in this Parliament but a few days ago. I should Uke to say to all members of the House that I do not think that any member is better respected in this House than the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, to whom I prefer to refer here as Frank Crean. There is no member who has been better respected over so long a period. I record my personal appreciation. The honourable gendeman will know that I carry with that the appreciation of the officers who served him well and faithfully in what are now the two departments of the Department of the Treasury and the Department or Finance. They would like to be associated with these comments. I also extend my very best and personal wishes to Frank Crean and his wife for a very long and enjoyable retirement after a most productive and distinguished record in this Federal Parliament on behalf of the people of Australia, particularly those people in the electorate of Melbourne Ports. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Hurford) adjourned. NA",85
151,Mr CREAN,TAXATION LAWS,"by leave-I appreciate what the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has said. The majority of people in Australia cannot evade one cent of the tax they are obhged to pay, but a lot of people can. One of the things which I have tried to do and which I hope aU Treasurers will try to do is to avoid permitting the slickies to do what the ordinary people cannot do. I apE reciate at any time the closing up of any >opholes which are present in the Act. Most people have no income except their wages or salaries. They cannot get out of paying one cent of the tax they are required to pay. But a lot of people try to turn what is reaUy income into capital. I think aU Treasurers try to close the loopholes which permit that. I am sure that the present Treasurer has tried to do this. Most of us cannot avoid paying a single cent of tax. We pay it week by week when deductions are taken from our wages or salaries. Yet certain people try to turn income into capital. I hope that the present Treasurer will continue to do what I tried to do. We close loopholes. But every time we try to do that a combination of shck lawyers and capital accountants move in. I am against both shck lawyers and capital accountants. Mr Lynch- I thank the honourable member for those comments. INCOME TAX (INDIVIDUALS) BILL 1977 Bill presented by Mr Lynch, and read a first time. Second Reading",86
152,Mr LYNCH,TAXATION LAWS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is an annual measure. PrincipaUy, it has the short, simple, purpose of formally imposing tax for 1977-78 at the rates to be declared in the Income Tax (Rates) Act. It also has another transition-year purpose connected with the introduction of the new system of personal taxation as it appUes to primary producers taxed under the averaging provisions of the income tax law. Tax rates for 1977-78 that are being declared are an amalgam of those appUcable under the pre-Budget system, with a weighting of 7/12, and those under the different system appUcable from 1 February 1978, with a weighting of 5/12. For taxpayers generaUy, the 1977-78 rate schedule is so constructed as to give them the benefit of the rebate of $676 proportionate to the period of seven months for which the pre-Budget system appUes. However, to maintain this effect for primary producers it is technicaUy necessary to provide a special transition-year rebate and the Bill does this. I commend the Bill to the House.

153,Mr LYNCH,TAXATION LAWS," I time. move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will impose income tax for 1977-78 on move: the 1976-77 incomes of companies and the 1977-78 incomes of superannuation funds. The rates of company tax declared by this Bill give effect to the 3Vi per cent increase that I nounced in the recent Federal Budget. I pointed out then that the increase was a necessary part the overall Budget arrangements and was set against the background of the very substantial tax savings that die corporate sector is enjoying as a consequence of the investment allowance, which the Australian Labor Party is on record wanting to abolish and the trading stock valuwhich ation adjustment. As is usual, the rate of 46 per cent that is to apply to company incomes is also to be levied on superannuation funds that are taxable only beincome cause of a failure to observe the 30/20 investamount ment rule. The rate of tax appUcable to friendly society dispensaries-previousl y 37Vi per cent-is to come 41 per cent. For superannuation funds which tax reUef of one kind or another is prowhere vided in the law, the rate is to remain unchanged at 50 per cent for any income of the fund that may be subject to tax. However, in line with the proposal to increase above 50 per cent the rate of tax on accumulating trust income that is taxed under section 99A the Income Tax Assessment Act, there is to be corresponding increase in the rate of tax payable by a trust that, under the income tax law, techgreater nically qualifies as a superannuation fund cause benefits it provides accrue on retirement. stress that this increase in rate will not apply superannuation funds for which the income law provides special treatment of one kind another.

The Bill also contains provisions which able the collection of company tax by instalments in the 1978-79 financial year, on the set down in the Income Tax Assessment Act. time.

HEALTH INSURANCE LEVY BILL 1977 Second Reading Bill presented by Mr Lynch, and read a first Second Reading",87
154,Mr LYNCH,TAXATION LAWS,"I That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill, an annual measure, formally declares the rate of health insurance levy payable for an1977-78 in those situations where the general levy law requires that the levy be paid. The rate of of levy remains at 2.5 per cent of taxable income, subject to unchanged ceding amounts of $300 for taxpayers with dependants and $150 for those without dependants. One change, dealt with in this Bill as well as in an earlier Bill, will exempt as from the levy the income of a deceased estate to no beneficiary in the estate has a present entitlement. The new system of personal income tax means that UabUity to income tax will begin at a higher level than hitherto. Correspondingly, the of income at which Uability for levy begins wiU become higher and the Bill makes technical provision to this effect. For example, a person without dependants was exempt from tax beunder pre-Budget rules where his or her taxable for income was less than $3,154 and from levy the taxable income was less than $2,887. Under the new system, under which the tax threshold will be $3,751, the point at which levy commences to be payable will be taxable income of $3,479. For 1977-78, the five-twelfths/seventwelfths transitional arrangements will result in of tax and levy thresholds of $3,403 and $3,114 a respectively. Of course, if a person has a dependent spouse, the tax and levy thresholds will be again. To Ulustrate, under the new sysbetem a man with a wholly dependent wife will not I pay any levy unless his taxable income is $5,087 to or more. Technical changes in the law are tax explained in the explanatory memorandum and or I commend the Bill to honourable members.

APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1977-78 Consideration resumed. Second Schedule. Department of Education Proposed expenditure, $479,963,000.",88
156,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,TAXATION LAWS,The education estimates give us a chance agam to talk about the problems that are facing the education area. This is evidenced by the number of reports we have now from the Schools Commission and the Tertiary Education Comthe mission. Let me refer to what would have been the situation if we were relying on the Liberal Budget of 1972. It was proposed then that a five-said year triennium be introduced to cover the period up to 1978. Mr Cotter-We are talking about the Liberal Budget of 1977.,88
157,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,TAXATION LAWS,"I think it is important to remember what the Liberal Party would have perFor done if it had remained in office. It was proposed in 1972 that the then Government would proFurther vide, overfiveyears, $167m by way of capital to the government schools and a paltry $48m to the independent schools. It took a change of govern the ment in 1972 to bring into focus the real needs of education. Let us look at the program of the commissions and the guidelines that they have up been obhged to adopt. They have lost their independence of being able to advise on the basis of need. They now have concept of government directions. On this occasion the amount to be spent is $ 1,647m. If we look at this matter from the point of view the needs of education, in 1972 they were Second Reading perhaps assessed at $400m. In the Whidam Government era the funds were quadrupled to $ 1,600m. It was aU done on the basis of needs. The point I make is that from looking at the commission reports we still see large gaps as to what of tax of is needed by way of aid to children of Some of the matters that are causing concern be we have mentioned already. I refer to the directions given to the commissions. I think it is to mention also what this will mean to government and non-government areas. The biggest worry for anybody concerned is that could be division in the ranks of the two sectors of the education area. It is made very the non-government sectors of eduare objecting to funds being diverted from the government sector. In fairness to them. I think is a worthwhUe comment to make. Let us look at what is happening now from the point of view of Umitation of funds. The direction that some of these funds are to be diverted to the nonIn Committee government area means that the funds can come only from the government area, and that is an area of need as well. Because of the growth factor that is envisaged of a mere 1 per cent in the forthcoming years there will be a shortfall in the amount that has to be provided for the nonsector. It can come only from the government sector. We are seeing a deteriorating position. The government sector is still not getting sufficient funds. There is going to be inbuUt hostility in parents and chUdren about whether level of funding should have been maintained. The non-government schools sector did not want that odium anyway. It did not want it that it was seeking funds from the government sector. This is happening aU because of the Government's attitude that there has to be a limitation on the amount of money spent. On page 6 of the Schools Commission report these words appear: 1979 and 1980 planning is to be on the basis of a one cent real growth in funds. on it says that this would 'generate an additional $5.71 m.' The point is that there has to be a maintenance of a certain level of funding in non-government area. I understand that that figure is well over $ 10m, so there has to be an additional drag on State government funds to make that levy. All this adds to the fact that we have nothing but confrontation, division and disappointment with this sort of attitude towards the to work within a needs of chUdren. The whole gamut of the Labor Party Government's phUosophy was not to get into the area diof rectly but to estabUsh worthwhUe independent commissions to advise on needs. If honourable members look at the reports of these commissions, whether in the tertiary field or the schools area, they wdl see that great concern is expressed by the Commission. The Schools Commission expresses it in this way: The Commission accepts the financial implications . . . but is concerned at its future implicauons tf there is to be insufficient growth in total funds. This independent commission expresses concern and rightly so. If one looks at the guidelines that have been introduced onefindsthat there has been a continual reduction in the resources that should have been made avaUable. I think it is very important that the Government has another look at this issue. If the Government wants to give additional funds to schools that are well endowed it should not take them from schools that are not so endowed. The Government is only putting a further burden on the children and the parents. The State governments feel that they cannot continue to carry the burden. If this Government is going to maintain the growth factor, as it must, and it is not providing sufficient funds to make up the leeway the State governments have tofindit from thenUmited resources. The tertiaryfieldis another one which is very important and worth looking into. We aheady have discussed, as a matter ofurgency, the quesgrams tion of the independence of the Schools Comand mission but the tertiaryfieldalso number of growing pains. The Commission highlights the fact that in the tertiary area there going to be no real growth at all. The universiwould ties-and some of them are comparatively neware very concerned about how they wdl cope with their problems. The Commission makes the point that the Government' has whether it can continue to maintain the standard of education and the standard of enrolment. The places Griffith University was mentioned as an example when the Commission dealt with enrolments. In paragraph 4.37 of the Tertiary Education Comthe mission s report is a reference to the problems the Griffith University and what should be done. The Commission expressed concern as to how that university would cope if additional funds were not made avaUable. It said: The Universities Commission was particularly concerned about the implications of constant intake for Griffith University. If intakes were to remain at the present level, graduate enrolments at the University would stabilise at about 1,300 students, the lowest Australia . . . That is an example of the problems I am talking about. There are particular problems for colleges of advanced education because there has been Umitation in the amount of money being made avaUable. The big Umitation in thatfieldis that the guidelines call for a reduction in teacher traimng intake and a static intake for all other courses. I am reminded of the situation in New South Wales. In that State, of all the College of Advanced Education enrolments some 46 per cem are for teacher training yet the Commonwealth Government has directed that there is to be no increase in the funds they need. More importantly, 68 per cent of the students are women. Clearly, because of this limitation, women will suffer a great disadvantage in gaining access to teacher training in the tertiary educationfield.That situation should be looked at. The technical education field is most important. It is deemed to be the Cinderella area of education. It was not until the Labor Government estabUshed the Kangan Commission that we were able to identify the great problems in the technical area. It is essential that thatfieldbe expanded as rapidly as possible. The Commonwealth Government, whUe making contributions, has given a direction that such contributions virtually are on the basis of a subsidy to the States for not charging fees. Consequently there are basic problems. The Tertiary Education Commission report states: Accordingly, . . . the Council has formulated profor the expenditure of $44.4m for capital purposes $45.6m for recurrent purposes . . . The proposed recurrent program for 1978 represents a no growth is suffering a situauon . . . is This is a problem. It was intended that there be a rapid enrolment. There has been an increase of between 9 per cent and 11 per cent in the enrolments but the Government is not providing the capacity to cope with it. The Comto look at mission says this: The projects are taking from one to four years to construct . . . and when completed will provide 14,000 student . . . If the resources of both the Commonwealth and State are used perhaps about 23,000 places of can be provided. These will cater for some 58,000 enrolments. The estimated increase in enrolments in the vocational and preparatory courses will be about 118,000. In New South Wales a total of $ 102m will be provided in the field of technical and further education.",88
158,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TAXATION LAWS,Mr Drummond) under- - Order ! The honourable member's time has of any university in expired.,89
159,Mr GILLARD,TAXATION LAWS,"It would be fair to say that there are many primary and secondary schools in the electorate of Macquarie a and throughout Austraha that are in need of repair, expansion or rebuilding and therefore I would have hoped that Budget funds for schools would have been gready increased. However, I can understand that this year has to be a year consolidation and review rather than a year of any large growth in the funding of education. in this year of consolidation and review all tions of our education system should practise moderation and restraint in spending, not least within universities and colleges of advanced education. For many years, in fact well before I became member of this House, I felt that universities colleges of advanced education were advancing too quickly. The whole attitude of these institudecided tions was expansion with no apparent regard costs. If we look back to 1950 we find that there were only seven universities and no colleges of advanced education. Today there are 19 is universities and 83 colleges of advanced educacation tion- a total of 102 institutions. In 1950 there were 30,000 students attending such institutions but today there are almost 300,000. To look these students there are more than 50,000 teachers, administrators and research staff. Government's contribution-in effect, the taxpayers' contribution-is some $ 1,307m. Today colleges of advanced education alone are costing $537m in Commonwealth funds courses whereas in 1966-67, thefirstyear in which the evident Commonwealth became involved, only $6.2m was provided. That has been a dramatic increase The of $53 lm in just ten years. When we arrive at a stage when the of a college of advanced education suggests that It perhaps it istimefor some colleges to close then tion it istimefor this Government and the new Teruniversities tiary Education Commission to look closely at interacting what is happening in the tertiaryfield.In discusswould ing the tertiary field I would leave technical education out of consideration because it is a recognised fact that technical colleges need considerably more funds for expansion in order that we may train more carpenters, plumbers, electricians, motor mechanics and other associated tradesmen of which there is such shortage in Australia today. I refer to the earUer comment that some colleges of cation should be closed. DupUcation in courses is taking place throughout New South Wales. In 1976 some 17,601 students were undergoing teacher education but they were colleges. NA Field of study Agriculture Applied Science In some cases these coUeges have only part of time students. One coUege is providing teacher training for only 164 students and another for 29 But students. Courses for commercial and business secstudies are spread over eight coUeges, some of which have only small enrolments. People the should have the opportunity to undertake courses of study to further theh education. However I am afraid that many courses which have a been established at colleges of advanced eduand cation should have been left to universities or technical colleges. If a plan of rationaUsation is upon, some students may have to return to to correspondence courses, but I am sure there are many who in the past and today are finding this manner of education quite satisfactory. But it good to know that there are those in the edufield who are at last reaUsing what the position is. On 23 September last the Chairman of the Association of Principal Officers of after Regional CoUeges of Advanced Education in a letter to Professor Karmel, the Chairman of the This Tertiary Education Commission, said: At a recently held meeting of this Associauon, the matter of the proliferation of external courses in higher education was discussed. As our membership extends over four states, it became apparent that expansion and duplication of was occurring well across state borders. It seemed that these extensions of activities were coming from established institutions experienced in the area of external courses as well as a quite new university. impression conveyed to us gave Uttle hint that any effective rationalisation or co-ordination was taking place chairman between institutions concerned. is our concerned desire to draw the Commission's attento these activities. We also wish to invite the Commission to convene a meeting of senior executives of and colleges of advanced education which are in the offering of external courses. This meeting need also to include representation from the respective co-ordinating authorities of states. We consider the matter to be one of extreme urgency and one that should not wait for a public inquiry. I have had compUed detaUs by field of study of students in New South Wales who are enrolled in coUeges of advanced education to emphasise a the area where I believe dupUcation is taking place. I seek leave to have this schedule incoradvanced eduporated in Hansard.",89

We are meeting at atimewhich is effectively the close of an era.

It seemed that that was inevitably the way were going to develop this country of ours through and many of us approached it with a fervour that could be described as reUgious. Education was going to be the key that would unlock all of the development for our into the future years. However, the education industry as it is now called, don't think it's an unfair epithet to apply to it, reached itself. Like many another industry throughout the years outstripped its resources and like many a social industry has been so successful in promoting community that it has led the community to a level tication in their educational expectations that the it comes, when the industry boom bursts, is all painful and hard. So there is now throughout our community at official suburban level, as it were at provincial level, an enormous questioning of the advantages of education viewed in relauon to the costs of providing the education. 2,107 489 2,596 2,107 489 2,596 370 370 370 370 335 335 335 335 370 424 794 49 505 554 564 2,026 2,590 543 1,158 1,701 169 153 322 228 152 380 33 5 38 1,956 4,423 6,379 905 306 1,211 905 306 1,211 We look back now, a Uttle wryly, at some of the plans that laid at about the time when Mitchell was founded. were the heydays for the boffins.

We need universities and we need colleges of adwho were in-vanced education. But I do not beheve we need ago, can them at the expense of primary and secondary rapid in schools. Kindergartens and primary schools, I am convinced, need more money for teachers to give a proper groundwork for the young was an students. Primary and secondary schools need to more edumore money for buildings. When I look at ahead. We schools like Penrith High School, Oberon Ceneducation tral School and Kandos Primary and Secondary only Schools within the electorate of Macquarie, it countiy hurts me to think of what is being spent and wasted in the tertiary field. At Oberon Central and I School during the last winter the temperature in has overone room was down to 4 degrees even though that room had a gas heater. This school is operatit has ing in some 14 separate buddings with no coverit ways between them. I do not beheve that this is its wares to the general of sophiswhat we want for our children but neither do we crash when want to see grand buildings at coUeges of adthe more vanced education or universities when young chUdren are suffering. My thoughts have been and expressed to many teachers and parents and citizens associations, and above all to the Minister for Education (Senator Carriek). I will do what I can to see that there is some review of tertiary education spending thus providing money for into where it is urgendy needed.",93
162,Dr JENKINS,ENROLMENTS IN COLLEGES,"I join my colleague the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) in his critischool. cism of the Government's role in its relative down of expenditure on education and its tude towards the education commissions. I think it a great cause for regret that the Government's actions have caused a stifling of the debate the quality of education which had been growing in the Austrahan community. The Government processes seems to have removed stimulus and to have gitation placed the dead hand on the aspirations of all those people who are concerned with and who have shown some interest in it. Previously I have expressed concern at relative rundown in expenditure and spoken its effects on the schools in the Scullin electorate. I have looked at the proposed boundaries for new electorate of SculUn and certainly the lems I have outUned will be worse in some of thetiary new areas. But it is not my intention to be parochial on this occasion. I wish to raise three areas for comment where there is great concern that there is a diminution of activity. The first area I want to mention is that of innovations. This may be the last opportunity that I wdl have to pay a tribute to a former ister for Education, the honourable member for Fremande, Mr Kim Beazley. I think that one must pay a tribute to the great stimulus he gave to educational thought in the Australian comhave munity. One of the areas that interested him gready was the innovations program. In referhome. ring to that program the opening paragraph an article in the Education News, Volume 15, 10 of 1976, stated: The Innovations Program rests on one basic principle: Individuals, and not governments or government agenaes, should define an innovation according to their needs pirations. It is a self-help program, returning initiative teachers, parents and the community. It is inexpensive and thoroughly non-bureaucratic in its operation. mary purpose is to lift the quality of educauon in tralian schools. I have seen some of the innovation programs and The observed the trials that have been made. It seemsnecessarily to me that the attitude of this Government to they education expenditure is stifling much of the Australian stimulus for these programs. Much of the determining in an inexpensive way of what innovation can be used to improve the quaUty of education in our schools has disappeared in the community. There is a lack of confidence. The innovation programs more or less flow the next area that I wish to raise, which is the primary school area. There is no doubt that in recent years modern teaching methods hi schools and the type of curricula that have been devised are makmg the Ubrary the vocal point of the Rather than pupils being taught by rote runwe have been trying to take pupils on a voyage of attidiscovery. The whole teaching process is oriented to theh purpose so that they can be guided in finding information, collating that on information and learning how to organise it and put in together and so develop theh thought rather than be confined to just a regurof things learned by heart. If this is to occur in primary schools, there must be effective education primary school Ubraries. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr the GUlard) spoke about what happened m the field of of tertiary education and raised some doubts about it. I perhaps share some of those doubts the about whether we did not start at the wrong end probin many ways by concentrating so much on tereducation. We find that there is no effective program for government primary schools in any of the States for the proper provision of primary school Ubraries and that much of the necessaiy action is really left to the parents in the community. What is there reflects the lack of abUity of the community to afford the proper sort of library setup that gives all those aids which are Minneeded to allow the pupU to make his investigations and discover how to learn. This is all the more important for chUdren from economically disadvantaged areas. It is the old story that we heard so often in this House that resource material, including books, is not avaUable in the So these chUdren are even more disadvanof taged when there are poor library facUities. I No. would Uke to see a stimulus to this thinking to increase the number and range of Ubraries in primary schools. and asThe third subject. I raise arises out of the to reports that the Commission of Inquiry into Povto run erty has been bringing forward. Many of these Its pripapers have refened to educational matters. In all Austhe document 'School Leavers: Choice and Opportunity', Dr Fitzgerald comments: material and recommendations in these reports do not reflect the views of the Commission. However, have been fully considered and taken into account in assisung the Commission to formulate recommendations to the Government. One cause forregretis that, whUst these reports are circulated to members of the pubUc for theh information, we in the Parhament who are concerned with the direction in which we are going in various areas do not have an effective mechanLionel ism for debating them. In this volume, there is study which deals in particular with migrant males in a certain school. I have had some perience with one of the local schools, Preston Girls High School, where there is a very high mi-! grant content and where many of the problems expressed in this report occur. Some of the suggestions made in the report should be cussed in the educational field. There should debate on it. We should be questioning why the something effective is not being done about theseto aspects. I refer particularly to that part of report which states: As part of the 'support' services available in a school students, a curriculum suitable for a multicultural imperative. It comments that the premise behind this is that ethnic groups and individuals must be able to cide, theh own participation within the cultures. With the sort of setup we have at the moment, the school system is rather antagonistic to this sort of cultural diversity. The programs for this sort of facility for migrants are left to State governments which show no initiatives ability to supply this multicultural diversity by providing adequate staff and facilities for these children. I regret thattimedoes not allow me to expand on this area. It should be one of great concern to us as it is found in many areas in the major cities of Australia and even some of the larger country centres.",94
163,Mr HYDE,ENROLMENTS IN COLLEGES,"The honourable member for SculUn (Dr Jenkins) took the Comexpect mittee down some paths that were of a technicalits nature and ones that frankly I would sooner leave to the teaching technicians. However, raised one subject with which I would Uke to be associated. He spoke kindly and correcdy of the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr can Beazley). He spoke perhaps as though he bearea lieved that there might be an election in the offing. I would not know anything However, just in case there is, I take the opportunity to associate myself with those remarks. The Hon. Kim Beazley has been a great parUabeen mentarian. He has made a considerable conSection tribution to education. He has inspired people in of Human education. I have not always agreed with every there is a right move that he has made. I do not believe that education that their everything he did was the result of his own presume that right appUes choice. He was concerned not only with the respective of the wealth of the quantity of education and spending on but also with quahty in thatfieldand for that I have the right to go to independentparents believe he will be remembered. I wish now to refer to two points raised by honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr not Bowen). The honourable member raised a two broad points. He decried the fact that there fewas not continuing real growth in education and exhe depreciated the additional funds that had »one mto the private education sector. Let us ook at the question of real growth. The Schools Commission is a body which is especiaUy skUled in advising the Government and, for that matter, disthe Parliament and the pubhc, on priorities be within education. It is not skUled in advising on cut-up of the total Budget. It is in no position say that we should have less defence expend the ture and more education expenditure. It is not even in a position to say that we should spend for less on universities and more on schools. What it school is is skUled in doing is providing the Government with advice within the schools area. It is, like the Industries Assistance Commission and the terde-tiary commissions, an advisory body. It puts down independent advice and its advice is independent to the government of the day. It is sheer nonsense to suggest that any such body can determine needs in isolation. To say that so much must be spent on education is to say that so much and no will not be spent in some other area. If expenditure on education, or any other area for that matter, is to go on growing in real terms at a faster rate than the economy itself is growing, of course, other areas must decline. Expenditure hi some areas will increase and in others it will decUne; that is true. In recent years education has increased its share of the gross domestic product It cannot expect and should not to go on domg so indefinitely, because if share grows at a rate faster than the economy itself grows, it will be taking an ever greater he share and leaving an ever smaUer share to be aUocated to other areas. IncidentaUy, there is a Umit to the rate of growth that any organisation encompass. I submit that in the education an attempt to achieve too great a rate of growth in the 1970s has resulted in unnecessary about that. and considerable wastage. Let us look at the additional funds which have provided in the area of private education. 26.3 of die United Nations Declaration Rights states quite unequivocaUy that of parents to decide the type of chUdren should receive. I and ought to apply irparents. It does education not state that chUdren of wealthy schools, will to church schools or to schools that demand fees. the The cost of educating a cluld at such schools is met entirely from the pubUc purse. In fact, in this country it is met only partially from the lic purse. It is a complete fallacy the children of wealthy parents attend private schools.",95
164,Mr JAMES,ENROLMENTS IN COLLEGES,In the main they do.,96
165,Mr HYDE,ENROLMENTS IN COLLEGES,Not even in the main. I suggest that if the honourable member beheves that he - ought to read Karmel on the subject. He ought read particularly what Karmel had to say about some of the Cathohc schools located in depresschool sed areas of cities.,96
166,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ENROLMENTS IN COLLEGES,That is level 6 schools.,96
167,Mr HYDE,ENROLMENTS IN COLLEGES,"Many children of poor parents of attend even level 2 schools. I am not speaking about level 1 schools, because there Western Austraha. But many chddren of poor parents attend level 2 schools. I wdl tell honour Mr able members how they come schools. Some parents believe ought to have a religious education. Some Dear Sir, parents beheve that the private education system provides a better grounding in the three Rs. I to At know of one such case which I cited in the House proposed a few days ago. Afiremanhas attending a level 2 school. That man is on a very limited salary. He undergoes considerable financial difficulty but, as far as I can gather, he accepts that very willingly. He certainly accepts voluntarily sending his chddren to that school because he beheves that they wdl be better educated. The parents of some, children hve in isolated areas and frankly do not have the option but to send theh children to schools which involve paying of fees, even if the fees paid are as a of a charge made by a government hostel. are parents whose children for some other do not meet the middle stream. There is a disproportionate number of children with ing difficulties in independent schools because those schools are prepared to cope with difficulties of those children. The parents in those groups send theh children to independent schools not because they want to pay those fees but because they believe they should pay those fees for the sake of theh chUdren. I submit that a decision which is best left with the parents. submit that a person who is taxed to provide cation, amongst other things, is entitled same consideration from those taxes, irrespective of where he sends his chUdren to school. It may be reasonable to discriminate between parents on the basis of wealth; it is not reasonthese able to discriminate between parents because the choice they make in relation to the education of theh chUdren. Sometimes it is a choice which pubis not within theh control at all but which is into suggest that fact forced upon them.",96
168,Mr JAMES,ENROLMENTS IN COLLEGES,"Education is again becoming a controversial issue with the Australian people. I surmise that most members of Parliament will be receiving letters from constituents or schools complaining about what they tocall the unfair allocation of federal money to the private school sector at the expense of the pubUc sector. I have with me one of three letters that I have aheady received from my electorate. It is from Mr B. W. Channell, honorary secretary of the Toronto High School. He has sent a copy this letter to the Minister for Education (Senator Carriek). He resides at 77A Excelsior Parade, are none in Carey Bay. The letter reads: A.

The flag incorporates the Cross Andrew, the Cross of St George and the Cross St Patrick. Of course, that has a great deal to with the fact that the early Australians came from what we now caU the United Kingdom. Theseflagshave arrived in this chamber someCommittee what mysteriously. I do not contend for a mothat ment that they are unwelcome but I tbink it important to note that it is probably an unpresented. cedented innovation in the parliaments of mind Australia.

I that 18 October was St Luke's Day and I note that 24 October-whic h is four days his away-is United Nations Day. It causes me to speculate that there might be some merit in having regard for the fact that there are two other at unused corners in this chamber. WhUst we acknowledge our British heritage, through the symbolism of theseflags,we could take into account as the fact that there are probably two million or so Austrahans who have come from other parts of the world and that the displaying of the United one Nationsflag,which mcorporates the symboUsm of the five continents, could well be appropriate in all the circumstances. As well there are many other factors which are often symbolised by I have not had a chance to check facts concerning theflagof the Red Cross, for example.

Perhaps they are here today in acknowledgement of the fact that a great Austrahan has taken his place in the Parliament today-Stewar t West, the honourable member for Cunrungham.

It may also reflect the culture and the heritage that they have brought here from other parts of the world.",97
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's dme has exphed. The honourable member for Hughes really answered his own quesdon. The matter of the flags was proposed, investigated and discussed by the House Committee in consultation with Mr Speaker. It was decided that the flags could be hung. They were approved. I understand that further consideration is being given to theflagsin this chamber.  matter of great importance to this House. It is certainly a matter of great importance to the farmers of South Austraha and undoubtedly to farmers in other parts of Austraha who have been grievously affected by the drought which the country is suffering at the moment. A great number of farmers in South Austraha are affected by the drought and it is unfortunate that South Austrahan pohticians-onl y Austrahan Labor Party politicians in South Austraha-see m to be attempung to play politics over the plight of those who have been affected by the drought. Last week in this House the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) asked the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) whether the South Australian Government had provided the $ 1.5m assistance required to be provided by the State before the Commonwealth Government would give assistance over and above that amount. The Minister for Primary Industry said that the South Australian Government had not provided that amount. In another place, on 11 October, Senator MCLaren said that the Minister for Primary Industry was 'criticising the South Australian Labor Government because it has not carried out its obligation to give assistance to South Australian farmers under the drought relief scheme'. Honourable members will know that the Commonwealth under the agreement will not and cannot provide assistance until a State government has spent $1.5m. In answer to the Minister for Primary Industry, who said that the South Australian Government had been tardy in applying assistance to those affected by drought, the Minister of Agriculture in South Australia, Mr Brian Chatterton, said that that was not so. In a Press release the Minister for Agriculture said: The State Government has exceeded by $600,000 the amount of money it had to pay out for drought relief before getting grants from the Commonwealth Government. It would seem that he thinks that he is entided to the matching grants now. Further on in that Press release he said: . . . nearly $900,000 has already been received by farmers. The rest is in the pipelineI repeat that: 'the rest is in the pipeline'for other successful applicants under our State scheme. He went on to say that $236,000 had been paid out in freight rebates and $35,000 for slaughter schemes. Anyone who knows anything about mathematics knows that $900,000 plus $236,000, plus $35,000 does not add up to $1.5m. Yet the Minister for Agriculture in South Austraha is saying that because these grants have been approved the farmers should receive the Commonwealth grant on a dollar for dollar basis or whatever the grant may be. He has said that the $1.5m has been spent, yet in his own Press release he is saying that it has not been spent. He says that only $900,000 has been spent. He says the grants have been approved. Now we are not going to pay out-the Commonwealth has never paid out-o n a book entry in the State government's books. The money has to be paid out. I ask the House to consider those affected by the drought in South Austraha. Is it the sort of thing with which the South Austrahan Labor Government ought to be playing poUtics? I do not beheve it is and I do not beheve the E eople of South Australia think it is. I ask onourable members to look at the South Australian Minister's Press statement. He says that he has paid out $900,000. He knows or he ought to know-it appears that Senator MCLaren does not know either-that this is not the case. I must admit it is not very difficult to show that these people are incompetent.",98
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has exphed. Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (10.41 )-Last week in this Parliament I raised the matter of obscene publications-pornography-and asked the Parliament to give some consideration to the morality level of our society. I feel some obligation to raise the matter agam tonight owing to the concern expressed by citizens outside this Parliament. I do not wish to cast any reflections upon members of the parUament because two or three of them showed some interest in the matter, but ofcourse this is a very busy period. As I say, most of the interest was shown outside Parhament. Just about every second attendant asked me about this matter, including the papers from which I had quoted. I was also contacted by two television stauons and two radio stations. I also received letters from people outside torate. Although this matter was initiated from a complaint that I received from constituents in my private, electorate, most of the contact I received about things, orconcerned this matter came from people outside my whatsoever, electorate. I want to impress upon the House that I am not starting a personal crusade on this matter I am simply trying to handle the problems within own electorate. I also know how to involve other members of this House because I told the people who contacted me to take up the matter with theh own member and that if they did not ceive any satisfaction to let me know see what I could do about it. So I am quite sure that other honourable members wdl be hearing something about this matter. From the contacts I have made, it seems that there could be some connection between scene pubUcations-pornography-and drug takto ing and drug trafficking. I have no direct eviincredibly dence of this but I am quite sure that if other honourable members were to take some interest in this matter they would get information cause people talk to members of parliament whereas they will not talk to a royal commission. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr into Katter), who seems to be very interested in what I have to say, knows that people will talk member of parUament but they will not go to an officer of the law. So I ask other honourable members, to give some consideration to ths cannot matter. I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House, but I want to impress upon honourAirport able members that although the law is controlled cal loads. by the States, there is some obUgation on Federal members of parUament.

I ask members of parUament to give some consideration to this matter because it may rebe only thetipofthe iceberg and no one knows and I would what may be found underneath.",98
175,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has exphed. to me Mr KEVIN CAIRNS (LUley) (10.46)-Three obstatements have been made recendy in relation the Brisbane Airport and the statements are and very misleading. I want to deal with those three statements. One statement wasthis is very close to a quote-There is no reason bewhy charter operators cannot go into Brisbane Airport'. That statement, I presume, is meant to indicate that charter operators are free to operate and out of the Brisbane Airport. Let me make it clear. If charter operators are to operate to a economically with aU up weight and on long hops that are necessary for aircraft such as the aircraft operated by Laker Airways, theh aircraft take off from the Brisbane airport. So the statement is carefully culled to indicate that there is no reason why they cannot go into Brisbane Airport; they certainly cannot go out of Brisbane on economical distances with economiI will give one example to the House. Laker Airway operates DC 10 aircraft. If those aircraft l were to take off from the Brisbane Airport in a of 30 degrees centigrade, a modest temperature in a semi-tropical aty airport, they as could not be scheduled for Singapore even if offloaded 19,000 kUograms of freight and off-loaded at least SO passengers from the very high passenger loading. These aircraft can carry 1 a maximum of 350-odd passengers. They still could not be scheduled for Singapore, which is the closest significant international airport by to some 400 or 500 nautical nules. Of course they in comcannot go out of Brisbane Airport, and that is a offences, and accordingly agree fact of Ufe. The British Airways 747s are in the same category. These aircraft fall short even Singapore, which is only 3,318 nautical miles away, by many hundreds of nautical ntiles. The second statement that was made was this: 'There is no reason why present facUities cannot handle the Commonwealth Games traffic'. is Strictly speaking there is none if the Brisbane Airport is wUling to function as commuter airport, but of course it will kind of airport that will be induced to operate like the airport at Edmonton which is able to opexphed. erate at a proper international level. It the airport at Perth which handled the Commonnight wealth Games traffic many years ago and is to operate as a proper international airport. Nor of is it Uke even the Uttle airport at Christchurch Tom which is able to operate as nificant international airport because runway is at least 2,500 feet longer than is the that subsequendy theCommission. Brisbane runway. The second statement, which matter of balance ABC might indicate that the Brisbane Airport can accommodate Commonwealth Games traffic, is programs-tha true only if that is expected to be done in a groupings. second-rate manner and not as a properly funcif a man ofThis tioning international airport. The third statement that was made is this: 'There is no problem in proceedings'-fro m Brisand bane, I presume-'to the next fuelling point'. I find this a fascinating statement. Of course there is not problem as long as the next fuelling point sufficiently close. As the honourable member Shortland (Mr Morris) would appreciate, there is no problem in proceeding from WUliamtown to Sydney because that is the next fuelling but there certainly is a problem if an operator going to operate planes which are designed to travel thousands of mUes-significan t international caniers-wit h all up weights. So, the statement that there is no problem in proceeding to the next fuelUng point is one which I feel, taken with the other two statements, unhappUy as designed to create a sense of well being which is not warranted on the facts. Those facts ought to be appreciated. I know they are reahsed. I merely point out those three statements which I judge have been carefuUy cuUed to mislead. I would be misled by They do not indicate that all reasons, for example, that Government members in Queensland are concerned at the total inadequacy of that airport. The Opposition is concerned about that airport. That is why members of the Liberal Party in Queensland have unanimously declared that they are totally opposed to any second rate program which not develop a properly realigned runway and which is designed only to lengthen the present of runway. The airport is inadequate. My Party in my State is aware of that fact and is unanimously committed to the proper development of that airport. Those three statements made earUer today should not be aUowed to mislead anyone that all well. WhUe the situation continues as it is, it cannot be well because the airport is totally and a second-rate completely inadequate. not be Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)Order!

That is not the for response of the ABC if the report which I have received is conect, namely, that the ABC seeks to justify its faUure to extend coverage on the same point, basis as the commercial oudets to Mr Bums' is news conferences because of this balance concept. I do not want to labour that point further. Briefly, to conclude this topic, I point out that what concerns me is that balance seems to be a very uneven concept when appUed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I have noted the program This Day Tonight over a considerable period now. It is quite obvious to me that the appearance of Government Ministers and Government spokesmen on that program is running at about three to one in then favour as against the appearance of spokesmen from the them. Opposition. I am aware that, on many is well. It is for those occasions",99
176,Mr BAILLIEU,ADJOURNMENT,What about Bob Hawke?,100
177,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,"On almost aU occasions on which Mr Hawke appears, he speaks as President of the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions.  will from the Employers' Federation ought to be treated as presenting views on behalf of the Liberal Party. From what I have heard tonight ofhis comments, he has had one of those moments insight and inspiration and he has justly demned the cynicism behind the Government's industrial policies. He said that fiddling and tinkering with industrial pohcies is save those major problems. In any case, underscore the fact that there is inconsistency the way in which balance is presented. It is exphed. 'unbalanced' on the part of the ABC. Clearly This Day Tonight is not a program where ance is apphed. I am not trying to canvass point but I am trying to bring out the more tinent point that the ABC is not applying this balup. ance equally. I suspect that in Queensland pressof ure is being apphed to the newsroom. I am not impugning the independence or the fairness of the journalists employed there. I understand that they are quite irritated by the way in which direction has been imposed upon them by adHawkins ministrative fear. The next point on to which I want to move quickly concerns an industrial matter. On 26 August at the WUlowbum meat works on the Darling Downs the employees held a stop work meeting during theh lunch break because an emoccur. ployee had returned late from the mid-morning tea break and had been dismissed. The resolution of the lunchtime stop work meetingalthough it was scarcely a stop work meeting was held in the men's owntime-was that they should not return to work until that employee was reinstated. I understand from the union that, without that matter being canvassed or explored in any way at all, all employees were stood down. That seems to me to be a quite unreasonable action on the part of the employer. But it is more unreasonable that the Department of Social Security should have refused to provide unemployment benefit for those stood down workers. On the basis of the advice passed on to me the meat workers union, it is clear that the workers have been stood down. But the indusover, trial situation which has developed which probably could have been avoided by more careful handling of industrial relations the part of management. Accordingly, I raise matter in the Parhament to ask that this unfair, unjust and discriminatory treatment of the of workers at WUlowburn be rescinded that unemconployment benefits be provided to the workers who have been stood down; and that, in the meantime, every effort be made to bring about a no way to fah setdement of this dispute.

The Barney faction alleges against the faction that the present officials of the union have been involved in what is called 'booking off' postmen and linesmen at Commission salaries to assist in postmen's reviews and that this has involved excessive payments of more than $20,000 from union funds.

Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: As the honourable member will recall, ILO Convention No. 111 - Discriminatio n (Employment and Occupation) 1958-is in such a form that it is not mandatory for a ratifying countiy to enact legislation in order to implement provisions. Accordingly, when Australia ratified this Convention in 1973, the National and State Employment Discrimination Committees were established shortly thereafter, legislative basis, in order to give effect to its provisions. As the honourable member will also recall, this legislative approach which was adopted by the Commonwealth Government in 1973, had governments, as well as of the national employers' organispanmentsorby ations and the trade union movement, membership of the Employment Discrimination Committees reflected this tripartite suppon. Moreover, because these Employment Discrimination Committees were established by the Commonwealth, with the full suppon of all the States, there were no problems involving jurisdiction and no demarcation the participation of non-governmental representatives, nominated by the employers and the unions, enabled the Committees to resolve complaints of discrimination which theyreceivedin a way which may not have been possible their membership had been restricted level. However, since the Employment Discrimination Comclerical mittees were established, the Commonwealth has enacted Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and, in addition, the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Equal Opportunity Act 1977, as well as the South Australian Sex Discnmination Act 1975 and Racial Discrimination Aa 1976, have been adopted. As all this legislation applies, alia, to the proscription of discrimination inrespeaof emcapacity ployment and occupation, at least on the grounds of race sex, it does provide some legislative basis for some of the provision of ILO Convention No. 111. At the same time, this legislation, which is mutually inconned sistent, and not fully in accord with the provisions Convention No. I l l , even in respect of race and sex, has given rise to questions of jurisdiction, to demarcation putes, as well as to problems certainty, as well as to confusion among the Australian community, and very real difficulties from the the Employment Discrimination Committees. In these circumstances, and given these recent legislative developments, I am examining the desirability of discussion with the States, as well as with the national employers' organisations and the trade union movement (through the National Labour Consultative providing a legislative basis for the National and State Employment Discrimination Committees.

The total appropriation for DAA in 1976-77 of $ 128.4m was made up of an original budget appropriation of $111.4m, and additional appropriations in the latter part of the financial year of $ 17m. The additional appropriation was sought following Government's decision, announced by original Affairs on 5 October for Aboriginal programs bringing total available for expenditure to $177.6m during 1976-77'. The Minister announced on 26 November the allocation of the $25m as follows: $ 12.75m for housing through State grants and grants-innel aid; $2.5m for enterprises; $350,000 for cultural, recreational and sporting activities; $570,000 for State grant employment projects; $2.33m for increasing employment opportunities for Aboriginals. An amount of $6.5m was available for inclusion in the Health and Education Departments' capital works program. Although only minor expenditure was incurred against the (Question No. 1208) additional $6.5m in 1976-77, the Departments of Education Health have carried forward to their 1977-78 capital works programs major projects in the Northern Territory at Darwin, Garden Point, Angurugu, Borroloola and Elcho an Australian Island estimated to cost $2.6m. So far as the remaining $18.5m was concerned, for which the Department of Aboriginal Affairs was responsible, the Department was not in a position to program the full $2.33m employment as expenditure of the initial appropriation was running below pro rata. However, during 1976-77 it was possible to incur additional expenditure of $ 1.6m on Town Management and Public Utilities, a function which has a of high employment content. Programming of the remainder completed intimefor the following expenditure to take place over and above that planned in the initial budget the ume he or she is likely estimates: for this purpose.

The Department acted responsibly in not seeking an adappropriation of the full amount of $18.5m when it became clear that this could not all be effectively spent durin the Press, did his ing the financial year. The under-expenditure of $7.4m against appropriation above was spread over a number of separate votes, e.g. support of Aboriginals at Government settlements, assistance to missions, employment grants-in-aid and State expengrants for health, education and welfare. It has been suggested that the funds not spent should have been transferred to functions where expenditure was not up Sl'000 to target. However, no Department has authority to utilise underspending in separate appropriation items to provide 1974-75 for additional expenditure in other items. It has also been stated that the Depaitment should in some have carried over the unspent funds into this financial year. However, unspent appropriations lapse at the end of financial year.

(2) The details provided by the honourable member regarding the number of deaths in detention in 1976 approximate those which have been provided to me.

Refusal to carry out such inquiry would not only provoke further strong throughout the world, but would also inevitably lead people to implicate the South African Biko and those who died before him. As to the request for direct tralian Government, the attendance at Mr Biko's funeral of an officer of the Australian Embassy, along with many western diplomats, is perhaps the most fitting expression Australian and international feeling about this sad incident.
