I call the member for Braddon, I advise House that a general cognate debate be allowed covering the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2003Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2003-2004. rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20 January the Prime Minister carried out a not just a diversionary tactic but a divisive in those schools and, by implication, students and attack on the so-called valueless systems in values. He charged that our schools are filled curriculum is charged with political correctness. Ray Martin asked the Prime Minister: divisive comments about public education? to why I thought an increasing number of people were and I gave some of the reasons. I didn't make a and what are the values missing from government NA Well, you know, people come to me and say all sorts have time on this programme to go through all of week. Ray Martin asked: It looks like you've thrown a bit The Prime Minister replied: No, no. I never throw crackers and step away. I mean that I'm stepping away from what I said. Ray Martin then asked: What's antiseptic mean? The Prime Minister said, ‘Well, you know' But don't you seriously think that The Prime Minister replied that he did not have own time to find out what the Prime Minister ness in the curriculum and by the provision looked for proof.

He called the reporters in and said, from the fact university places are not available making education divisive and using it as agenda. Of course, on cue, came the Prime Minister's anything dealing with so-called values in public sland popped in with some really edifying comments free, hostile or, at best, apathetic to Australian this stage, the member for Gippsland was the was the member for Warringah-the boxing say that the member for Herbert rushed in Lightfoot rushed in, as he does, to protect bly be harassing his presence or his views. But it did cause division, not just in the something the Prime Minister is used to, but caused division because enlightened persons Pearce and Macquarie came out and basically public schools are valueless is the same as nonsense. They at least were prepared So it was not just the superannuation meeting that saw divisions in the Liberal Party caucus this comment on public education by the those members of the coalition who were prepared sense by the Prime Minister and of things. And I mentioned some of them. I don't them and I'll develop some of the things during the of a cracker and then stepped away. ... what I said I meant. Don't think for a minute and on it went.

I is very important is that you provide evidence the Prime Minister said anything since? Not a to substantiate the disgraceful charges that he report what they say.'

Of course, the member for Gippthat education in public schools is valueheritage and values-whatever that meant. At acting federal education minister. Then there monk-but you would expect that. I am sad to with his unsubstantiated comments and Senator the Prime Minister from anyone who might possicommunity but also in his own party. That is not we have seen examples of it more recently. It such as the members for Adelaide, Hindmarsh, said, ‘This is arrant nonsense.' To claim that saying that private schools are valueless-arrant to stand up publicly and say so. or the Clarke report on veteran entitlements room coming to the fore; the same applied to Prime Minister. I acknowledge the comments by to stand up to the statements of arrant nonthose other members. I mentioned. NA I thought it was best reflected by the cartoonists-as January 2004 there was a cartoon which I know describe it. It showed our Prime Minister federal government nation-building project.' there is a little sign on the other side of the vided country'. That is exactly what those comments comments not substantiated by evidence. It was not just me who was disgusted by lia-even principals of private schools-thought had brought about. I attended a number of Prime Minister's comments featured at those the comments. I would like to quote from an schools in my electorate of Braddon-and a I felt that tonight, of all nights, I couldn't let think that the schools that have produced the wonderful way sub-standard or without values. Fancy having to have this discussion in the they believed the Prime Minister If that is the casethat is, to bring about division and diversionI thought I would take the time tonight to explain sonal relationships we have at (our school) and The Prime Minister was asked several times: ues don't exist in our public schools that you swer.

Secondly, this concern we model not just our arts curriculum ment and the planet, surely the most beautiful and are concerned with morality-what is good and what morality of how people should be treated and treat others. He goes on to say, fourthly: We are concerned with educational excellence, not comes from our deeply held views that teachers make are concerned, in State schools with equality. He says that at their school: … alongside the students you will meet tonightand it was a night of excellence, I would remind youwith TE scores as good as any in the country, you homeless students, students with mental illness and poor, students who are rich, students who are black whose cultural values are the ones we must follow is their wont.

They were needlessly hurtful, silly those comments. Many people throughout Austrawhat a worthless debate the Prime Minister school excellence ceremonies and of course the ceremonies. People were disgusted and hurt by address at an evening of excellence at one of the very good school at that. The principal said: their comments go unanswered or our students and parents young people we will see tonight are in any first place. The principal went on to analyse why made those comments and said: the values that I think underlie the academic and perask the question ‘if not these values, then which?' ‘What values are you talking about?

Of course he did not anand they relate closely to Howard Gardner's view of truth that gave us ‘children overboard', ‘weapons of how we determine what is false or misleading and, we are concerned with beauty and it is from but our deep concern and empathy for the environfragile of things that we have in our care.
