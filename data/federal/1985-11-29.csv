2,Mr SPEAKER,PROCEEDINGS,"Yesterday I informed the House that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's broadcast of proceedings would be relayed into members' rooms for two days by means of the House monitoring system. Some of the commercial broadcasting organisations which make use of the House monitoring system to enable the recording of excerpts of proceedings have advised that the procedure adopted yesterday has made this task difficult. Consequently, the House monitoring system will today carry a clean feed of proceedings. NA",15
3,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Yesterday the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) raised a matter of privilege in connection with an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 28 November relating to the report of the Select Committee on Aircraft Noise. The article in question purports to reveal a knowledge of recommendations of and argument by the Select Committee, the report of which has since been presented to the House. Standing order 340 provides: The evidence taken by any Select Committee of the House and documents presented to and proceedings and reports of such Committee, which have not been reported to the House, shall not, unless authorized by the House, be disclosed or published by any Member of such Committee, or by any other person. It has long been held that the publication or disclosure of reports prior to their presentation to the House constitutes a breach of privilege or contempt-I refer to House of Representatives Practice pages 660-1 and to May, 20th edition, pages 153-4. On its face, the report gives the impression that the author had prior knowledge of recommendations of the Committee. It is quite impossible, however, for me to reach any conclusion on whether or not this was the case, nor would it be proper for me to do so. I am required rather to decide whether, on the information available to me, there is prima facie evidence of a breach of privilege or contempt. Since the newspaper report was published and the matter raised by the honourable member, the report of the Committee has been tabled in the House. However, the fact of the tabling does not alter the gravamen of the complaint raised by the honourable member. Having considered the complaint and the newspaper report, I am prepared to allow precedence to a motion in respect of the matter if the House wishes to proceed further.",15
4,Mr BURR,PRIVILEGE,"by leave- Mr Speaker, I do not intend to move a motion to have this matter referred to the Privileges Committee. However, I think I should take the opportunity to remind all members of the House that in fact it is a breach of privilege and it is also irresponsible of memb.:rs of any committee, whether it be the Select Committee on Aircraft Noise or any other parliamentary committee, to disclose information that may be contained in a parliamentary report before it is tabled in this House. I think it is also opportune to remind members of the Press that it is also a breach of privilege on their part to publish any matter contained in a parliamentary report before it is tabled. In this case undue concern may well have been raised among residents living adjacent to Sydney AirportÂ· about relaxation of curfews in that area. A proper reading of the report may have dispelled concerns that may have been raised by those residents. I do not intend to pursue this matter any further, but all members of the House and all members of the Press Gallery should be reminded of the fact that early or premature disclosure before reports are tabled is a breach of privilege and also grossly irresponsible.

5,Mr MCGAURAN,AYES,"It is along the lines of that raised by the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr), In this morning's Press, specifically the Kent, L. Keogh, L. J.

8,Mr WEST,CONSTRUCTION OF CANBERRA MAIL,"1 JIlove: . That, in accordance with the. provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and' on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of Canberra Mail Centre, Fyshwick. Australia Post requires new accommodation for the Canberra Mail Centre to unite mail handling and vehicle operations on one site. The new buildings will be located at Canberra Avenue, Fyshwick, Australian Capital Territory. The proposal involves the construction of a single storey mail processing area, with a three-storey section accommodating administration, amenities and plant. A detached single storey building will be provided as a motor vehicle service centre. Hardstanding will be provided to cater for mail vehicles and parking for staff and visitors. The proposed work will cost $7.52m at August 1985 prices. I would like to thank the Public Works Committee for its prompt consideration of the proposal. If the House agrees to support this motion, planning can proceed in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee. I commend the motion to the l-Iouse.",16
9,Mr BEALE,CONSTRUCTION OF CANBERRA MAIL,"The Opposition is concerned about what it sees as mismanagement not only by the Government but also by the Department of Housing and Construction. As far as the Government is concerned, we have had in recent days the Bicentennial fiasco, yesterday the issue surrounding the Australian Institute of Sport and last night the extraordinary validation of fees discussion. Now we have in front of us the report of the Auditor-General on the efficiency audit",17
10,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTRUCTION OF CANBERRA MAIL,"Order! I trust that the honourable member for Deakin will get to the motion before the Chair very quickly. The motion is with n;gard to the construction ,of the Canberra Mail Centre, Fyshwick, and is not an invitation for open debate.",17
11,Mr BEALE,CONSTRUCTION OF CANBERRA MAIL,"Mr Speaker, in discussing the whole question of the mail centre at Fyshwick we have to ascertain whether the Department is competent to carry out the organisation and management of the work.",17
12,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTRUCTION OF CANBERRA MAIL,"Of that particular work. Mr West- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: The honourable member is canvassing your ruling.",17
13,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTRUCTION OF CANBERRA MAIL,I am well aware of that. I ask the Minister to be patient. I was going to point out to the honourable member that he may not debate in the generality. The motion concenlS the Canberra Mail Centre at Fyshwick. I suggest that he proceed to deal with that and relate 'his remarks to it.,17
14,Mr BEALE,CONSTRUCTION OF CANBERRA MAIL,"We urge the Department to arrange the construction of the Canberra Mail Centre in such a way as to avoid repetition of the extraordinary events at the Redfern Mail Exchange. The audit report to which I referred says, amongst other things: Audit can find no authoritative material in the Department that could be used, as a reference for officers making decisions in these cases. If the Department, in its construction of the Canberra Mail Centre, can do no better than that we are going to have trouble. We also ask the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr West) to avoid another situation such as that which occurred at Rushcutters Bay with the infamous all-on overtime procedures. This audit report also says: Â· . . Audit suggested that a tighter accountability and more formalised controls over variations should be introduced in the interests 01 the Department. If the Department of Housing and Construction arranges the construction of the Canberra Mail Centre in that fashion it will be a disaster. The report' also says: Â· . . a comprehensive set of instructions should be prepared for the guidance of project clerks . . . We enjoin the Minister to ensure that in the construction of the Canberra Mail Centre we do not have a repetition of the kinds of things to which this audit report refers. The report goes on: Audit . . . considers that improvement and rectification may have been effected more quickly if portion of progress payments had been earlier withheld. Mr Hand- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I refer to your earlier ruling on the relevance of the report that the honourable member is using.",17
15,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTRUCTION OF CANBERRA MAIL,"I do not know whether the honourable member for Melbourne has been listening to a different debate from the one to which I have been listening, but the honourable, member for Deakin has been completely in order within that ruling.",17
16,Mr BEALE,CONSTRUCTION OF CANBERRA MAIL,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. For the benefit of the honourable member for Melbourne, I remind the House that we are talking about the construction of the Canberra Mail Centre and whether the Department is competent to organise and operate that construction project. The report continues: Â· . . Audit recommended that consideration be given to its application to all major contracts being administered by the Department. The Department accepted the recommendation, but it does not give high priority to the development work involved. In relation to the Canberra Mail Centre, it is clear that the Department has to give high priority to the development work involved. The report sta tes: The Department agreed that there were problems. In the construction of the Canberra Mail Centre, the Department must ensure that its procedures do not allow repetition of the kinds of difficulties that arose, for example, at the Australian Defence Force Academy. In that regard, the financial statement to 30 June 1984Motion (by Mr West) put: That the question be now put. The House divided. (Mr SPEAKER - Hon. Harry Jenkins) Ayes Noes Majority NA Baldwin. P. J.

Kent. L Keogh. L J.",17
17,Mr MOORE,PAIRS,"The Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Bill proposes assistance by way of subsidy on the manufacture of grain harvesters and parts which, if imported, would be classisfied to item 84.25.9 of the CusLindsay, E. J. MCHugh, J. toms tariff. The proposal is for a two-part subsidy scheme: Firstly, a subsidy at a rate of 12.5 Maher. M. J. Martin, S. P. per cent of ex-factory selling prices where the registered producers of complete machines whose value added in production is not less than 40 per cent of ex-factory selling prices and, secondly, a subsidy at 25 per cent of value added for another manufacturer of grain harvesters and parts classified to sub-item 84.25.9 of the CusPrice. L R. S. Punch, G. F. toms tariff. These arrangements, which arise out of the Industries Assistance Commission's findings, provide for assistance equivalent to a 15 per cent tariff, The two-part scheme is to ensure that no manufacturer will be disadvantaged unTheophanous, A. C. Tkkner, R. E. der the scheme. Uren. T. West, S. J. The subsidy, which was originally to be effective from 1 January 1986, will now be payable Wright. K. W. Young, M. J. from 21 August 1985. The alteration to the effective date arises as a result of the November selling season, Failure to implement the proposal NA prior to the selling season would have disadvantaged local manufacturers and grain growers, The alteration to the date has also necessitated a special subsidy on those goods cleared for home consumption before 21 August and sold on or after that date. This has particular application to the South Australian company, Horwood Bagshaw Ltd. In a telex that company stated: . The proposed Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and. Equipment) Bill 1985 in its present form substantially disadvantages Horwood Bagshaw's local manufacturing activities in thi- regard because the proposed bounty level for more than half its planned 198$-86 production will be substantially less than the assistance presently provided by way of tariff. That is in conflict with the statement. The telex continues: For example, Horwood Bagshaw is the sole local producer of self-propelled harvesters i.e. HB model 2140 SP. Under section 13 of the proposed Bill, Horwood Bagshaw's production of this machine, which represents approximately 50 per cent total production in 1985-86, would not qualify as it has insufficient value added as defined by section 7. A similar situation may exist in relation to our model HB 2141 PTO. Under the original terms of the lAC's recommendations, Horwood Bagshaw could have expected to receive $6,554 for the production of our SP2140 machine. The Bill now proposes that this should be only $4,946, based on 25 per cent of value added . . . because the machine does not incorporate a minimum of 40 per cent value added. Should .Horwood Bagshaw's SP2140 machine be assisted by the provisions of section 13 . . . and not section 14, then it could have expected to receive $8,630 per machine. This would then have been in line with the average duty paid on imported machines during 1985. Complementary to this Bill is provision for duty free entry of goods classified to 84.25.9. Presumably, legislation will be introduced to implement this change in due course. Let me remind the House why this Bill is necessary. In 1983 the Government introduced a 15 per cent tariff on imported grain harvesters. These imports supply about 70 per cent of the market. The Australian Wheat growers Federation submitted to the Government that this duty would add costs to grain growers of about $14m per year. The Government requested the lAC to examine the Australian Wheat growers Federation's submission. The lAC reasserted its view that a 15 per cent tariff was the approriate form of assistance. The Government accepted this advice. However, following pressure from the Opposition and the rural community, the Government in its second BudgetÂ· announced that it would remove this duty and replace it with a bounty. This Bill gives effect to that decision. Clearly, this is a cynical attempt to buy votes in the rural sector at the time of the South Australian State election. The Opposition supports the Bill because it believes that the subsidy will in part alleviate some of the cost pressures facing agriculture. We support the principle encompassed in this Bill. We do not support the other exercise of the Government.",18
18,Mr SIMMONS,NOES,"I do not want to take up much of the time of the House this morning but I do wish to support the initiative of the Government in this decision to replace the tariff on imported harvesters with an equivalent bounty on local production, effective from 2 I August 1985. Of course, honourable members would be aware that the tariff on grain harvesters that applied previously had raised the costs of farmers, who now face, of course, declining returns on world markets. Over the period of the last couple of years honourable members would be only too well aware of the concerns on both sides of the House with regard to the policies of the European Community and, of course, in latter days the prospect of a trade war in regard to the United States export enhancement program. I certainly cannot let this opportunity go by without responding to the rather unfortunate comment by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore). He suggested, to use his words, that this was some sort of cynical attempt to buy votes for the South Australian election. As you would be perfectly weI! aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. Honourable members would recall that over the last few months there have been continuing discussions between members of the Government and peak bodies in the rural sector, principally the National Farmers Federation; so much so that following the concerns expressed outside this House on 1 July this year, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in conjunction with Australia's greatest Minister for Primary Industry, undertook to bring down a package to do something to assist the rising costs that people in the rural sector were facing. Of course, part of that response was this decision to replace tariffs on harvesters with a system of bounties. Of course, the measure was not in total isolation, but was in conjunction also with the decision to rebate full diesel excise. the other decision, of course, was that the Government should take steps to ensure that assistance arrangements for the pro-. duction of agricultural chemicals do not also impose undue costs on agricultural users. I have spoken in the past on the whole question of whether we should have bounties or tariffs. My general view is-and I repeat it for. the benefit of honourable members who are interested in this debate-that where possible should proceed down this track. This legislafriend tion-the subsidy for grain harvesters and equipBrumby) ment-is an admirable step. It is a decision, course, that has a revenue cost to the 0"" ment; but most significantly it has a great impact primary producers. In recent days people who represent rural and provincial seats, I sure, would nave seen large scale advertisements in their local Press by people who are involved in 'the retailing of grain harvesters, bringing the attention of their customers the benefits this decision. I have seen advertisements in newspapers suggesting that there has been downward reduction in costs of up to $8,000 or $9,000 per harvester. So this decision is particuto larly welcome. It is also particularly welcome for another reason. Honourable members would recall that the initial decision was to apply this part of the Government's budgetary measures from 1 Janunow. ary 1986. As the Minister for Science and Minthis ister Assisting the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Mr Barry Jones), who is at the table, noted in his second reading speech, prior to 21 August 1985 a substantial number of grain harvesters were imported for sale in the current season. Most of those harof vesters have yet to be sold, with the result importers would therefore have been faced with the prospect of having to sell duty paid machines in the 1985 season in competition with other harvesters which would be duty free, or with locally produced machines on which the subsidy under the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipthe ment) Bill would have become payable. Obthe viously, honourable members would appreciate that this would have seriously disadvantaged suppliers because it is a fiercely competitive maris ket, not only because of world factors but also because of the cost pressures that local rural producers are facing. I certainly support the initiatives of the ernment that this measure represents. It reprepaddocks, sents a positive package for the rural sector. I said at the outset, it should not be seen in total isolation, but as part of a package to do somewhich thing about costs to the rural sector, something of which all honourable members should be conthe scious. If they - re not conscious of should be, because despite the decline in the percentage of export income earned from prilike mary industry over the last few years, honouraunits ble members should not forget that agricultural exports from Australia still contribute about per cent of our export wealth. So anything that we can do to encourage local farmers to be we competitive, to enable them to compete-as my the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr said yesterday in his comments on anof other Bill-in a world market that is unfortuGovernnately corrupted by subsidised pncmg arrangements throughout the world, should be welcomed by the farming community and by am this House. I commend the Bill to the House.",19
19,Mr ANDREW,NOES,"This is a bipartisan debate on the Subsidy (Grain Harto vesters) and Equipment Bill this morning. I supof port the Bill, as the honourable member for local Ryan (Mr Moore) has done. However, I remind a the House that while we sit here in air conditioned comfort reflecting on what we think ought happen to the grain harvest industry in Australia there are, right now, people in harvesters taking off the crop that will ensure Australia's economic future. It is too easy to forget that there are people in the middle of harvesting right This Bill is being brought into the House, debate is occurring, in the middle of Australia's grain harvest. Those farmers who are listening to this debate and who are sitting in their tractors or their self-propelled headers making their way around paddocks might well be asking themselves quite reasonably how much the grain which is rattling into the bin they that are taking off for themselves and how much they are taking off to pay off inflated government. Mr Barry Jones-I hope they are not listening to us; they might lose concentration.",20
20,Mr ANDREW,NOES,"That is a fair comment from Minister. Sometimes I am tempted to make same observation. Nonetheless, I make the valid observation that every farmer might well some ask himself how many bushels of what ever he harvesting he is harvesting simply to discharge the increasing costs he faces as a result of being on the land. I make the plea to the"" House this 'morning to be aware of the fact that there are Govmany farmers who are making their way around not in those air conditioned shiny new As monsters that so many honourable members opposite see in agricultural shows, but in headers need replacement and which they cannot afford to replace either because of the cost of header or the falling farm income which is it, they the reality of agriculture today. The agricultural industry consumes something 2,000 down to 1,500 new grain harvester a year. These fall into two categories. The smaller harvesters are power take-off driven and 40 tractor pulled; the larger of them are self-propelled headers, with their own capacity to move cost around the paddock independent of any other mobile unit. Most of the power take-off driven units used in Australia in fact are manufactured in Australia. By volume these power take-off units make up about 30 per cent of the market. The difficulty I have with the legislation before the House is that it has been conceived and has arrived in the House in such haste. The honourable member for Ryan has already referred to the fact that the legislation currently before the House allows grain harvesters, and the bounty to be applied to grain harvesters, to fall into two categories. The first is for those harvesters which are overseas produced and assembled here in Australia. It is considered that the value added category of these will be less than 40 per cent. Therefore, the bounty available under this legislation will be paid at 25 per cent of the cost of the assembly of these machines. The second category-the category I suspect most occupies the concern of both sides of the House-is the area of local manufacturing. People who are locally manufacturing harvesters are anticipated, as a result of the Industries Assistance Commission review, to have a proportion of that harvester which is over 40 per cent value added. These harvesters which fall into the over 40 per cent value added category will attract a bounty of 12t per cent ex-factory price. I make particular reference to these because one of the major manufacturers in Australia in fact has a large assembly plant in my electorate. I refer to Horwood Bagshaw Ltd which assembles harvesters, as the honourable member for Ryan said, at Mannum in my electorate. In fact, that company at its Mannum plant employs 257 people. Therefore, the Bill before the House does not affect only the farmers of Australia it does not affect only the equally important farm labourers of Australia, some of the few people left productively working in this nation; the Bill also affects 257 people who are employed at the Horwood Bagshaw factory in Mannum and the many other additional employees of Horwood Bagshaw in the city of Adelaide. Mr Downer-Twelve hundred.",20
21,Mr ANDREW,NOES,"The honourable member for Mayo has interjected to remind me that according to his statistics there are in fact 1,200 employees of Horwood Bagshaw involved in assembly and sales in the city of Adelaide. Some concerns felt by Horwood Bagshaw have been expressed by the honourable member for Ryan. I think it is fair to say that the Opposition trusts that negotiations currently in hand between the Government and the Opposition will, in the other House, result in an outcome that is even more satisfactory from the point of view of the assembler in my electorate. Honourable members might ask why I think further negotiations are necessary. I think it is fair to observe that among the local manufacturers some concern is being expressed that it will be increasingly difficult for them to maintain their 40 per cent content as the devaluation of the Australian dollar forces up the prices of the imports they use in assembling their local machines; hence the discussion that we are anticipating will occur between the Government and the Opposition when this Bill is introduced into the other House. It is to be hoped that the Government can come to some further sensible agreement. As has been made quite obvious this morning, the Opposition welcomes, as does the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), the move from tariff assistance to bounty assistance. This industry was protected by a 15 per cent tariff. That tariff cost the grain growers of Australia-the grain growers, if you please; no one else-$14m, as has been calculated by the National Farmers Federation. It is as a result of the move from the tariff to the bounty that this legislation is before the House today. The legislation has had a chequered passage which reflects the incapacity of the Government to understand what in fact happens down on the farm. The legislation was first proposed to be introduced effective as from I January 1986 when, to all intents and purposes, the harvest would be over. It is true that some people would still have crops to harvest but they would not be about to buy a header in order to complete the harvest. Therefore, having come to terms with that, I would have thought, conspicuously obvious fact, the Government then said: 'We will make this legislation effective from 21 August 1985, Budget night'. Of course, this meant that no consideration was taken of the equally conspicuously obvious fact that header manufacturers in Australia and header importers in Australia had stocks in hand that would have been disadvantaged against anything produced or imported post 21 August 1985. So back we go again. It is the further changes, which in fact have been made to accommodate the stock in hand, that promoted the legislation before the House today. I have been concerned that it has taken so long for us to develop what ought to have been a conspicuously simple policy in the grain harvester area. Government members come into the House and berate the Opposition-they pour derision on the Opposition-for what they declare is the Opposition's absence of policies. The real pressure for policies exists in the Government. Honourable members opposite are the people who have the numbers; they make the decisions. However, after these seven years it took the agricultural policy of the Australian Labor Party to be first announced and three years after being in government we still find ourselves having to debate the legislation currently before the House within crude time restraints. The honourable member for Calare has commended the Government for its move from tariff protection to bounty protection. All members opposite join in and echo that commendation. However, we cannot sit down in this debate without drawing the Government's attention to the fact that farmers across Australia are currently disadvantaged. Farmers across' Australia are currently the squeaky wheels of the Australian community; They are squeaky wheels not because they need more grease but because the burden they are asked to carry, the load that is on the cart, is all too heavy. The honourable member for Cal are has said: 'This Bill is part of reducing the burden that farmers carry'. In opposition we welcome that move. However, it is but a small part of reducing the total burden which right now the farmers around Australia are carrying and which, I am sorry to say, t/ley are carrying as a result of the policies introduced by this Government. The Government simply cannot manage an economy in a manner which results in a falling Australian dollar and consequent rising interest rates and not recognise the enormous burden that those interest rates put on Australian farmers. We welcome this legislation but a great deal more needs to be done to relieve the load that is being carried by Australian farmers on behalf of the rest of the community. It is true that this package helps in some small way to reduce part of that load. However, a great deal more needs to be done to address the whole question of wage fixation and economic policy in this nation if we are in any way to assist the farmers of Australia.",21
22,Mr COBB,NOES,"We are talking today about the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Bill 1985. Like previous speakers on both sides of the House, I welcome the general thrust of this legislation. The Bill proposes assistance by way of subsidy on grain harvesters and certain parts of grain harvesters produced in Australia replace the tariff which has been in existence since 1973. As the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) said, no doubt the wheat growers of Australia will welcome this move because wheat has shown very low profitability in Australia in recent years. In round figures, the growers are getting of the order of $IS0 a tonne. When they take out their costsÂ· of carting by rail monopolies, et cetera, they are getting back only something in excess of $90 a tonne, and then they have to take out their own costs. They certainly need yields of six, eight or more bags per acre before they start to break evt)n, let alone make a profit. The original tariff was introduced in 1973 following an Industries Assistance Commission review of assistance to the grain harvester industry. It automatically came in as a tariff and the coalition Government in power at the time said that it would revoke that and change it to a bounty. Unfortunately it made one grave mistake and called an election that year and did not have a chance to implement that legislation. We pointed out to the incoming Government, the 'present Government, that it should be' switched to a bounty. It saw merit in the case and said that it would look at it. Unfortunately it has taken 2+ years for it to bring in the legislation. In the meantime it has cost the grain growers of this nation of the order of $14m a year, so'since 1983 it has cost in total in excess of $30m. Of course, this is not the only measure to which the Government has applied similar principles. The diesel levy rebate was removed. It has now been restored, I am pleased to say. But that cost the grain growers and farmers of this country in eXcess of $SSm. ' Mr Andrew-That was not refunded.",22
23,Mr COBB,NOES,"No, it was not refunded or backdated. It was just put on in the Budget. In other words, the Government restored something that it had taken away and made a hero of itself. Nevertheless, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced in the Budget of 20 August that the tariff would be removed and replaced by a bounty. Even though this announcement was belated, we still welcome it. A IS per cent tariff may not sound much to people. who have not thought about it but, with the price of grain harvesters today, it is quite a substantial amount of money. A farmer may have to fork out in the order of $100,000 for a new harvester and a IS per cent tariff means that he will have to pay that another $IS,OOO, which"" is probably more than he is making in a year. So it is a very substantial cost to the farming industry today. I see that the Government is bringing in the subsidy on grain harvesters produced in Australia in two stages. The explanatory notes say that the Government will pay: (i) 12.5 per cent of the sales value of the harvester if the value added to the harvester by the manufacturer is not less than 40 per cent . . . (ii) in any other casein other words, less than 40 per centan amount equal to 25 per cent of the value added by the manuFacturer. Unfortunately, we have not had sufficient notice that this Bill was to be introduced so that we could study it and comment more fully. I would be grateful if the Minister for Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Mr Barry Jones) in summing up would elaborate on his reasons for that. Mr Andrew-And the short notice.",22
24,Mr COBB,NOES,"That is right, and the short notice. It is a pity that we did not have more time to fully debate the legislation here and consider it beforehand so that our contribution could be greater. I would like to qualify my statements endorsing switching tariff to bounty by saying that all protection is bad because it misallocates resources and moves resources in Australia from efficient industries to inefficient ones. If protection is put on by tariff, by quota or by a local content scheme or whatever, the user has to pay. This has been the case for the grain growers in Australia to date. One might ask: Why should the user of the protected goods pay? It is quite an illogical thing to do. If the Government wants to protect an industry, which is, of course, its right, I believe all should share equally. That is why particularly the coalition here today supports the protection being given by way of bounty. Protection, in' whatever shape or form, is eventually a cost to the consumers of this country and it is interesting to note that projected costs for 1984-85 will run into a consumer tax equivalent of just under $13,OOOm, which is quite horrific. In the textile, clothing and footwear and motor vehicle industries alone the estimate for 1984-85 is just under $5,OOOm. The tariff is costing tens of thousands of dollars; the subsidy to the assemblers of the harvesters manufactured in Australia is running into tens of thousands of dollars. It has been one of the most inefficient industries as far as protection goes. The sooner we get it switched to bounty the better. I welcome, as I say, switching it to bounty because it reduces the cost to the grain growers and switches it to all Australians. I see that this present legislation will remain in force until 31 December 1990 and sometime before that it will be reviewed by the lAC. Hopefully it will not be switched back to tariff again and certainly I do not believe that it will if the coalition is in power. I also see that a special subsidy is to be paid on imported harvesters, and previous speakers have referred to this. Prior to the Treasurer's announcement on 21 August in the Budget, a number of grain harvesters would have been imported for sale and tariff would have beep_ paid on them. These harvesters have been sitting on the lot and most of them have yet to be sold. Harvesters brought in after that date do not have that 15 per cent tariff penalty and, therefore, in a very cost competitive wcii1dfor machinery salesmen there is probably no way that these machines can be sold. It has been causing a considerable amount of distress, I know, amongst machinery salesmen in my electorate. I am delighted to see that the Government has considered this and is going to waive the tariff on those. I note that the Minister says in his second reading speech: This would have seriously disadvantaged some suppliers in a fiercely competitive market, already depressed because of other domestic and world factors. We all know what those factors are and why machinery sales are depressed. Interest rates, of course, are at the highest level in real terms that we have seen in this country for over half a century and interest rates are very important for farmers who buy headers because none can afford to pay cash outright. Some have' brought harvesters at rates of 12, 13 or 14 per cent and have had finance from banks, and every time they go down to their mail box they find that interest rates have leapt another half a per cent; and some are now paying 19, 20 or 21 per cent. Mr Nehl-Disgraceful!",23
25,Mr COBB,NOES,"It is disgraceful. They have also been hit by fuel costs-that is a factor in depressing sales-not to mention the other costs. For example, the grain handling authority in New South Wales has all but crippled the wheat industry in that State. Nevertheless, I see that subsidies will now be available in respect of domestic sales of imported grain harvesters cleared for home consumption before 21 August this year and sold on or after that date. I also welcome the fact that the subsidies will be extended to parts for grain harvesters that fall within the classification. The subsidy will be equivalent to the net duty paid on the subsidised harvesters or equivalent. One other factor I will mention which is depressing sales is the capital gains tax that will apply to people who purchase harvesters on lease and then buyout the lease at the end of, say, four ye-rs. When they trade in thatharvester later they will find that they in higher than the amount of the lease on the harvester and will have to pay capital ga,ins tax on that paper capital gain. I think the Government would do well to look at .that related matter also, to help reduce costs for the grain growers of this country. In conclusion, I would just like to comment that protection that farmers receive overall is only a fraction of what the manufacturing industry in this country receives. It is only about a quarter of it. We pay high tariffs on hay making equipment of something like 15 per cent, on tillage equipment at a similar level, on seeders and ploughs at a similar level, something equivalent to 30 per cent on fully formulated chemicals that are bought in Australia and on four-wheel drive vehicles, tariffs ranging from 25 per cent to 57! per cent. The small amount of assistance that farmers get is nothing like what the rest of the Australian community gets. I note that the subsidy arrangements in this Bill will involve costs of approximately $5.65m in the coming year and of the order of $3.75 per year thereafter during the life of the scheme. The total costs, including revenue forgone as a result of the related tariff change, will be approximately $9.75m this financial year and about $12m annually thereafter. Nevertheless, bearing in mind the qualifying statements that I have made on this Bill, I welcome the legislation the Government has brought in, as belated as it is.",23
26,Mr SNOW,NOES,"I wish to speak on the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Bill 1985. A few moments ago the Minister for Science (Mr Barry Jones), who is handling this measure in the House, asked me whether I was going to give the House the benefit of my advice on this matter. I assure him that all the advice I can give really comes from him and his colleague in the Senate. It is very difficult to devise uniform and equitable arrangegrain ments forÂ· an industry which has patterns of production and cost structures which vary widely from producer to producer. Hence the adoption today of a two-part scheme which should reduce the cost of grain harvesters to farmers whilst maintaining assistance to local producers by means of a subsidy rather than a tariff. The Industries Assistance Commission considered the effect of the present tariff in its report 'Grain Harvesters and Parts (Bounty Arrangements)' which was made on 28 October 1985. It stated: The direct effect bf the present tariff arrangernents is to raise the landed cost of imported grain harvesters get a tradeand certain parts. . . . The indirect effect of these tariff arrangements is to allow local manufacturers of goods competing against dutiable imports to raise their prices. The extent of this increase is difficult to quantify, but a reasonable first approximation. is that their output prices are increa,sed by 13.5 per cent. . . . However, local manufacturers are also penalised in that the prices of many of the inputs which they I!se are raised as a result of tariff assistance. Consequently, the Commission generally uses an estimate of the effective rate of assistance when it discusses the effects of the assistance structure on production activities. This measure attempts to quantify the net effects of the tariff structure on the productive activity under reference, taking into account both the subsidy effect on output and the tax effect on inputs. The Commission went on to conclude: . . . that removal of the. duty' on grain haryesters and parts has the potential to result in significantly different effects for the three industry segments. . . . the extent' of these differences will also be influenced by the form of the offsetting, bounty to be introduced. It went on to indicate a preferred option after discussing a number of the options in relation to the introduction of a bounty. It said: A specific rate bounty would be administratively cumbersome. An ad valorem output bounty would favour assembly operations relative to major local production. A value added bounty would favour one local producer against another and reduce assistance' to assembly operations. that The Commission said further: . . .' if the tariff is to be removedas we are doing here-Â· on both grain harvesters and parts falling within' tariff item 84.25.9, the Commission's preferred option would be the provision of two different forms of bounty-one to major local producers of <;omple(e grain harvesters and another to other local producers of g!lods under reference as discussed above in section 3.3.4 The Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced in the 1985-86 Budget as one of the important initiatives to assist the 'rural sector that tariffs on harvesters w-reto be replaced by a subsidy on local production. It asked the Industries Assistance Commission to advise on the assIstance level and conditions that should apply over the next five years, cbnsistent with the .level of assistance accorded producers by' way of tariff. The Commission has come up with that report and I believe that the Government has correcUy-and I am delighted to see bipartisan' support for the Government's decision-come up 'with the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equip-e-t) Bill 1985, which I am pleased to support.",24
27,Mr DOWNER,NOES,"Iamgoing to take only five minutes to make a couple of points about the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Bill 1985. I do not want to speak too repetitively on points that have been made by other members speaking in this debate. Like my colleagues and, indeed, honourable members opposite,' certainly do support this Bill and I am glad to see the Government moving once more away from dependence on tariffs to provide industry assistance through the 'method of bounty, although, of course, we do not ,want to get ourselves into the position where we are continually providing assistance of one form or another to' industries which may not have any long term chance of survival. I do riot think that is riecessarily the case here. I do want to reiterate some of the points made by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) in relation to Horwood Bagshaw Ltd whose manufacturing operations are based in the town of Mannum in the electorate of Wakefield. Many of its employees live in my electorate in the town of Murray Bridge. In a message that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) sent to the Managing Director of Horwood Bagshaw on 3 September the Prime Minister pointed out: . . .' the Governmen't'g!lve !In undert!lking th!lt Joc!ll producers will receive equiv!llent to th!lt presently t!lriff on imported m!lchines'. That seemed a reasonable statement at the time, but as the honourable member for Wakefield has pointed out, the way this legislation has been drafted-I susPect it has been overhastily drafted and not really carefully enough considered-it does, in, fact, discriminate against Horwood Bradshaw in a way that it does not discriminate against other manufacturers. The Bill provides that a bounty will be given if the value added in production is riot less than 40 per cent of ex-factory selling prices. In the case of Horwood Bagshaw, 50 per cent of its production is of it product known as the PTO 1070. That does qualify Jor the bounty, but 50 per cent of. its production is of a machine known as theSP 2140. Production of this particular machine has oniy approxhnately 30 per cent value added or perhaps slightly more. The,effect of the Bill 'as it' is ,currently drafted is that Horwood Bagshaw will' not' i,eceive the bounty that it had anticipated and, indeed, which the South Australian Government had anticipated because it is paying the company an interim subsidy until this Bill finally comes into effect. That is clearly going to impose a very substantial burden on Horwood Bagshaw. I. do not think the Government would want to place much a burden on that company bearing in mind the difficulties it would clearly create, not just for the profitability of the firm-it has struggled over a number of years to return to profitability from a loss of nearly $6m in 1982-83 to a profit this financial year announced today of $775,000but for the employees, some of whom live in my electorate. The effect of this drafting error-I believe it is an error-on this company is going to be a 43 per cent reduction in the assistance accorded to it: I hope very much that the Government will reconsider this drafting error-I,reiterate that I see it as a drafting error-in order to fulfil the commitment that the Prime Minister made to Horwood Bagshaw back in September and that it will not breach that commitment. In the last two minutes that are available to me, I should like to make a couple of other points about this Bill. Principally, this Bill was foreshadowed in the Budget as, if one likes, a sop to the rural sector in response to demonstrations by members of the National Farmers Federation and the strong pressure that the Federal Opposition has placed on the Government to try to do something to help a very hard hit rural level of !lssist!lnce !It le!lst !lccorded by the 15 per cent sector. Although I support the BiII very strongly, ' I believe it represents far too little far too late. At the same time as introducing a minor change in assistance to help grain growers, the Government is being quite hypocritical in introducing two forms of pernicious taxation, namely, the capital gains tax and the quarantining of farm losses, which discriminate against the rural sector. It is also worth pointing out that the level of fuel excises has increased by some 56.5 per cent since the Hawke Government took office and that has seriously disadvantaged farmers, particularly as the diesel fuel rebate was reduced for two years. Also, of course, primary producers are being hit very hard by the record level of interest rateS. So, in the face of these major problems-interest rates, fuel costs and the taxation burden-this legislation is nothing more than a sop to primary producers. However, in saying that, I believe it is a constructive measure. Should the Government amend, the drafting error that it has made and which discriminates against Horwood Bagshaw, I will give this Bill my full support.",25
28,Mr BARRY JONES,NOES,"Lalor-Minister for Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce) (11.17)in reply-I want to reply very briskly to the points that have been made by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), although! would be just as happy to tell him over a cup of coffee. On the question of the complaints of Horwood Bagshaw Ltd, the Industries Assistance Commission suggested an eligibility threshold for the ad valorem output bounty of 30 per cent of 110 per cent of the manufacturer's cost to make. This is a reference point for the purpose of calculation or substitute for ex-factory selling price. This was in response to strong representations from the industry, including Horwood Bagshaw. It was decided that ex-factory selling price would be a more appropriate basis for all calculations, being somewhat higher generally than 110 per cent of cost to make. This required an upward adjustment in the minimum value added from 30 per cent to 40 per cent to maintain the relativities between the two parts of the composite scheme. The scheme, of course, is designed to cater for the industry as a whole and maintain the assistance structure as nearly as possible. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) raised a number of points. The measure was announced in the Budget and the terms and conditions were referred to the lAC for advice on the details. That process took longer than expected, hence the reason for the delay in the introduction of the Bill. I am sure that no one would wish to argue against its speedy introduction and passage so that farmers can obtain the benefits quickly. Various speakers raised points about the operative date for this new subsidy scheme. As I said, the Bill honours the Government's Budget commitment to reduce farm costs and as a Budget measure the operative date was the day after the Budget was presented. Nevertheless, the Government has dealt in an equitable manner with the problem of unsold stocks of harvesters on hand at the date of transition. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) made a point about the effects on devaluation on local content. Clause 13 (1) provides for a minimum value addes rate of other than 40 per cent to be prescribed by regulation. This gives the Government the necessary flexibility to adjust the eligibility threshold for the ad valorem output subsidy. As the honourable member would recognise, it is not possible to apply a benefit that is specific to an area, even if an area is as highly disadvantaged as the electorate of Wakefield might be because of the Mr Moore-Because of the member.",26
29,Mr BARRY JONES,NOES,"Not because of the member, of course, as the honourable member for Ryan rather ungenerously suggests, but because of the nature of the industry structure.

30,Mr BARRY JONES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Lalor-Minister for Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce) (11.21)I move: Customs Tariff Proposals No. 14 1985. The Customs Tariff proposals that I have just tabled propose an alteration to the Customs Tariff Act 1982 to remove the Customs duty on grain harvesters. The operative date of the proposals is 21 August 1985. The change being introduced by the proposals is a complementary measure to the Subsidy (Grain Harvesters and Equipment) Bill 1985 that has just been agreed to by the House. It removes the 15 per cent general tariff rate on grain harvesters and will enable claims for the refund of the Customs duty paid on grain harvesters entered for home consumption on and from 21 August 1985 to be lodged with collectors of Customs. I commend the proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Moore) adjourned. CHILD CARE AMENDMENT BILL 1985 Consideration resumed from 28 November. Second Reading",26
31,Mr HOWE,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"1 mOVe: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill aims to achieve a fairer basis for funding child care centres.' This Government has demonstrated a major commitment to the provision of child care in Australia. Since we were elected there has been significant gr.owth in child care services. The number of places for 'full day care has increased from 37,580 in June 1982 to 63,535 in June 1985-an increasc of about 70 per cent. Expenditure on children's services has increased from $65m in 1982-83 to an expected $143m in 1985-86. This rate of growth has been much faster than in other comparable programs and far in excess of economic growth. Notwithstanding our record of achievement, we were not satisfied with the level of community access, to quality child care services. As a result, in Deq:mber 1984 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)' announced this Government's commitment to the provision of a further 20,000 child care places over the next three years. It was a good time to reassess funding mechanisms. The Child Care Act had been operating for over 10 years. S,ervice providers and children'sservices organisations had found inequities in parts of the Act, particularly in the complex formula governing operational subsidy. There was also concern about the costs associated with maintaining child care centres. There were few, if any, incentives for service providers to keep costs down. Higher costs were subsidised by higher government fee relief subsidies; and insufficient contribution was being made by families with higher incomes. Equity was a major concern in two senses. Firstly the Government was concerned that despite the large growth over the last two years the program still only reached about 7.5 per cent of pre-school age children. We believed that higher recurrent costs would make it difficult to continue to expand the program beyond the additional 20,000 places we were ,committed to. Secondly, we were concerned to ensure that child care centres received funding on a consistent basis. Under the cumint funding system this is not the case. ' The Government decided to revi-w the subsidy arrangements for full day care services. This review was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the context of the May economic statement. Any review likely to come up with valuable long term administrative and policy change had to get to the' roots of the problem. So the Government set a target of $30m savings that it would like to achieve in a full year. But to be consistent with the Government's priorities, these savings had to be found responsibly and within basic principles .that reflected the need to maintain standards and quality of care and to maintain affordable child care particu(' larly for low and moderate .income earners. We were not prepared to surrender'these fundamental principles. . A comprehensive examination of child care funding was carried out and it became dear that it was not possible to achieve savings of more than about $lOm in a full year, without breaching the principles that had been set., I make no apology for that. The Government's purpose was to ensure that its commitment to the expansion of the child care places could be achieved, reaching as many people as possible, at a responsible cost. The changes to the subsidy arrangements provided by this Bill will ensure that the essential characteristics of quality services will be maintained and that services will be accessible to families, particularly those on low incomes and with special needs. These changes are aimed at the long term future of the program. The Government believes they established a sound base for the expansion of the program in the next three years and beyond. Overview of Children's Services Before describing these changes I want to take this opportunity to review achievement under the children's services program and to set the direction in which this Government will be tak'ing the program. When the Child Care Act was introdllced there were about 50 non-profit centres in this country. Today there are 'in excess of 800 and abou,t 300 of these have been approved for funding by this Government since 1983. Under the children's services program, but outside the Child Care Act, other services were funded to meet the child care needs of parents, particularly of working parents. Some 260 family day care schemes have been established, over 50 by this Government. Last year the Government put the funding of family day care on a firmer basis by increasing the operational subsidy by 20 per cent and introducing an additional part time ,allowance of $3 a, child. Expenditure on family day care has increased from $15m in 1982-83 to an expected $40m in 1985-86. There are 432 outside school hours care services, over 160 established by this Government. The Government regards out of school hours care as essential if child care provision is to respond to the needs of working parents. Last year the Government increased funding for these services by an average of 25 per cent. Other services have developed under the ,umbrella of the children's services program. These include special services to meet the needs of children who because of background, disability or where they live do not have ready access to standard child care. There are special services for Aboriginal and disabled children and children of ethnic origin and for those who live in remote and isolated areas. We are also intent on facilitating the access of Aboriginal, migrant and disabled children to centre-based care and family day care and special grants are available for this purpose. It is essential that child care is affordable low and moderate income earners. The Government's commitment to making child care affordable is evidenced by the new fee relief system introduced in July 1984. This reform meant that families eligible under a national income test pay the same fees at the same income level. There are special provisions that ensure child care is _allordable for families who have more than one child in care. Under the new arrangements fee relief will be extended and simplified to ensure that child care remains affordable. This means we are targeting a larger proportion of funds to meet income related need while continuing to subsidise all families through operational assistance .. So that new services are distributed equitably and are located where they are most needed,the Government last year introduced a planning model and established consultative machinery in each State. For the first time there is a rational basis for the planning and establishment of new places. There is also for the first time a long term commitment by the Government. We will establish 20,000 new places over the next. three years. This is currently estimated to cost $107m. Over the last 10 years a number of innovative programs developed under the children's services program. The family support services scheme began in 1978 to stimulate the provision of services for families with dependent children. The family support services scheme continues to be administered by the Office of Child Care, but it is now a separate program with its own budget allocation. Another important initiative was the youth services scheme, which is now part of the supported accommodation assistance program. The children's services program therefore had a broad focus at a time when there were no other suitable auspices to advance important policy initiatives. With the establishment of other more targeted services, it is no longer necessary for the children's services program to take initiatives across such a broad range. Accordingly we have been reassessing and focusing the objectives and direction of the program. The children's services program will continue to provide funding to nonprofit services that advance the developmental, social, emotional and intellectual needs of children while their parents are working, training for work or actively seeking work. The provision of an additional 16,000 full day care places gives added emphasis to this objective, as does the provision of an additional 4,500 out of school hours care places. We will also be responding to for the needs of women at home and the provision of an additional 3,000 occasional care places reinforces this commitment. We will continue to ensure that all services are available to Aboriginal, disabled and migrant children and that as appropriate, specific culturally relevant services are established for these groups. The Changes Since coming to office we have taken significant steps towards achieving rationality and equity in the program. The changes which are the subject of this Bill take this process further. They will mainly impact on centre based day care and will take effect from the beginning of April 1986. Operational Subsidy Currently operational subsidies average $30 a week and benefit all families irrespective of income. For example, families using child care centres who now pay the full price pay an average of $55 a week for full time careeven though the actual cost of care is on average $85 a week. The current system is complex and leads to inequities, including market disparities in operational subsidies between centres. Another important concern is that small reductions in the number of children can lead to a big reduction in salary subsidies. Under the new operational subsidy arrangements set out in clause 3 of the Bill, centres will get a subsidy of $16 a week for each approved place for children under three and $11 a week for each approved place for children aged three or more. This recognises the special needs of younger children and the higher costs of caring for them. These subsidies will be for services that operate for at least 8 hours and up to 10 hours a day and for at least 48 weeks a year. Additional grants will be provided to centres that are approved to operate for more than 10 hours. Current levels of operational subsidy will be reduced by about half, resulting in an average increase of $15 in a centre's full time fee to a new average of $70 a week. This does not mean that most users will pay this much more as the fee relief changes will ensure that full increases in fees will only be met by those families with higher incomes. The subsidy will be adjusted from time to time to reflect cost of living and wage increases. It will also be paid in a,dvance in order to alleviate cash flow problems. ImpactÂ· on Families The impact of the changes in operational subsidy will be reduced by changes in the fee relief system. These changes, while not requiring legislation, are an integral part of the new funding package. Higher costs resulting from the overall reduction in operational subsidy will largely be offset by greater fee relief subsidies for low and moderate income earners and by moderately increased feÂ·es to be paid by high income earners. In other words the balance of the Commonwealth's overall contribution to care has been redesigned to give in-reasing emphasis to income related need. Under section 12A of the Child Care Act the Commonwealth provides funds to centres so that families on low to moderate incomes pay reduced fees. These arrangements will be extended and simplified to ensure that child care remains affordable. Under the new fee relief system: The minimum fee will be increased by 5c an hour or $2 a week for full time care, that is, 40 hours a week; families with one child in care, whose incomes mean they pay more than the minimum fee, will pay 15c extra in fees for each extra dollar they earn above an assessed family income of $225 a week, until they are liable to pay the full fee. Previously the 15c rate applied only to families with an assessed family income of less than $467 a week; above that they paid 30c extra for each dollar earned; special arrangements for large families are also improved. The rate will be a uniform 20c for families with two or more children in care. The previous rate was 40c when assessed family income exceeded $467 a week; fee relief will not be offered for that part of a centre's fee in excess of $80 a week. This measure is an incentive to contain costs as centres will have to consider the additional burden on families if they want to charge a higher fee; and additional assistance-special fee relief-will continue, at the discretion of the centre, to families in exceptional circumstances. Special transitional assistance will be available in the first year only, to ensure that no family has to pay more than $25 a week more and to encourage centres to charge no more than $85 a week. Impact on Child Care Centres The combination of the new operational subsidy and other changes ensures the viability of centres. They will still be expected and able to operate on break-even budgets. The measures are designed to make administration much more simple for both the management committees of centres and the Government. This will save costs and centres will have a better idea of how much subsidy they will get each year. Impact on Women The Government's child care policy including the proposed changes is consistent with the Government's equal opportunity and affirmativeaction initiatives. The continuation and improvement of the fee relief system limits work force disincentives and the 20,000 place commitment will result in increased access to child care. Impact on Quality The Government remains committed to providing quality care that promotes the developmental, social, emotional and intellectual needs of the child. It is for this reason that the Government has continued to provide a substantial operational subsidy irrespective of income and to provide higher subsidy for under three-yearolds in recognition of their need for a higher staff-child ratio. It is the responsibility of State governments to regulate child care and license child care centres, and services funded by the Commonwealth have to comply with State government regulations. However, the Government is. actively committed to funding and promoting quality child care. It is important that the Government is well informed on trends in quality and that funded services have access to professional advice and assistance on matters pertaining to programming, play activities, developmental needs of children and so on. For this reason I have asked the Australian Early Childhood Association to advise me on quality issues and to strengthen and extend their current role in providing advice and assistance to funded services. Capital, equipment and establishment grants provided under the Child Care Act will . be continued and are a further indication of this Government's commitment to quality care. Financial Impact The measures provided in this Bill are expected to reduce the Government's subsidies to the children's services program by $2.6m in 198586 and $1O.2min a full year. The additional administrative costs of implementing these measUres are estimated to be $0.46m in both 1985-86 and 1986-87. Child Care Objectives I have set out today not only to explain the purpose of this Bill but also to provide honourable members with a broader understanding of the background to the children's services program lind the reasons for the Government's decision to change the way in which subsidies for centres are provided: I have touched on some of the essential characteristics of the program to which the Government is committed, Finally, I intend to outline the objectives of the children's services program in order to ensure that - ltere are advantages and understanding of the framework in which funding decisions are made. The Government's primary objective is to ensure that parents and children have access to quality children's services that are appropriate to their needs regardless of their income level, cultural background, disability or geographical location. Within this broad objective the Government's priorities are towards providing n?n-profit services that: Promote the developmental, social, emotional and intellectual needs of children without substituting for the care they receive from their parents; are consistent with the Government's policies of equal opportunity and affirmative action, and are predominantly directed towards ,meeting the needs of children of working parents or parents who are undertaking vocational training to enter the work force; encourage parent participation management; are accessible for low and moderate income earners; focus on under school age children but also provide older children with care out of school hours and during school holidays; support parents at home with young children; assist those with special needs such as inal, migrant and disabled children and children in remote and isolated parts of Australia; and ' are accessible to, the general community. The measures in this Bill represent a fundamental redesign of child care funding' arrangements. The new structure blends the objectives of equity, quality and affordabilityas well as simplifying the administration of the program. In addition sensible cost controls are now contained in the structure. The program is well placed to expand and respond to contemporary child care needs. I commend the. Bill to the Senate.  Care Amendment Bill has been rushed into this House in the closing stages of this parliamentary session. ,Unfortunately ,even the normal courtesy of distributing, a second reading speech was not undertaken by this Government. It is, clearly in chaos. It has no control over the parliamentary program, as indeed it has no control over its own policy-making program. Mr Hand--.;If you got off your backsides in the other House we would be home by now.  ment members to want to be running from the only public forum we have in this country. Democracy is a bit harsh for members of the Government; they want to run from the House. This Bill introduces new funding arrangements for Commonwealth subsi<;lised 'long day child care centres. By way of background it is interesting to note that in November 1984 there were an estimated 2.9 million children under 12 years of age, 358,000 of whom were using formal child care, and 41 per cent of those were receiving from 10 to 19 hours of child care weekly. Around 864,000 received informal child care. Commonwealth funds provide assistance, for some 63,129 equivalent full time places for children under five years of age in 832 child care centres and 262 family day care schemes. The main changes proposed by this legislation in include, firstly, an alteration to the basis of subsidy. At present the subsidy is related to staff costs. The new subsidy will be determined on the number of approved child, care places in an institution. The Bill will also enable the payment of a basic subsidy in respect of each approved place, with a slightly higher subsidy for children under three years of age. The Bill provides for an increase in the means tested minimum fee, Aborigwhich is paid by 58 per cent of users. That minimum fee will increase from $10 to $12 a week. The withdrawal of the income tested subsidy, called a fee relief subsidy, will have effect at a lower weeklY income as a result of this legislation, but"" the rate of withdrawal will be Summary halved. This legislation will also establish a top fee of $80 a week after the basic subsidy for centres with subsidised places. What, then, is the impact of the legislation? In the May statement this year it Was iJromised that the savings arising from this legislation would be $30m. Now we are being told that the overall savings in a full year will be $1O.2m. This dramatically highlights the confusion and lack of policy direction of this Government. Government decisions are announced on the run without proper consultation and planning. The Government has a total lack of long term goals or visions for Australia. As a result, it is constantly making decisions such as this one-decisions made under pressure, reacting to the latest crisis instead of being on a well planned path to a considered and publicly supported objective. It is little wonder that our dollar has been devalued and interest rates are going through the roof when the Government shows day after day a total lack of long term policy making. The result is stupid announcementsMr Hand-What about talking about the Bill instead of the dollar? Don't you understand it?  of the honourable member for Melbourne. I understand that he is under a lot of pressure in his electorate in relation to this move and he will do anything to try to hide the facts relating to this Bill. The result of the Government's action Mr Hand- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order Mr Hand-I just want to point out that I can take anything that you dish out.",26
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS,Mr Mountford)I ask the honourable member for Melbourne to make his point of order.  frivolous point of order. Mr Hand-It is not; I have not made it yet. If you just sit down and stop behaving like a school prefect I will get on with it. My point of order is that the honourable member for Barker accused me of hiding the facts. I find that offensive. I have never tried to hide the facts on any issue.,31
33,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"There is no point of order.  just shows the concern that the Government has in relation to this legislation. Initially a $30m cut was announced; we are now discussing a $lOm cut. As a result of the Government's failure to establish long term policy goals stupid announcements are made without consideration of all the factors which should have been under consideration originally, and when those factors are brought to light by public reaction the Government backs and fills and tries to cover its tracks. ' Let me make it quite clear that the Opposition is firmly committed to reducing the size of government and reducing government expenditure, but we really wonder about the priorities of the Australian Labor Party when in this instance it is taking $lOm out of the area of child care support, an area in which we would have expected the Labor Party, if it matched its promises and rhetoric with action, to provide more assistance. But talk is cheap for the Labor Party, as we found out from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Promises before the last election that there would be no capital gains tax have not been met and legislation is now being introduced imposing a capital gains tax. He promised before the last election-and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) promised it this year-that interest rates would go down. Pt;ople with commercial loans, housing loans and mortgages who now have to pay much higher interest rates will understand that the people in the Labor Party are not men of their word. The point I make in relation to this $lOm cut in funding for child care centres and child care assistance is that, while we would like to reduce, and in power would reduce, government expenditure, we really wonder about this Government's priorities. For example, last year it was prepared to spend over $lm publicising Medicare. It spent $1 m just before the last election telling the people what a great thing Medicare was. As I understand it, Medicare is compulsory. People in Australia do not have a choice' whether or not to purchase Medicare; they are compulsorily part of Medicare and are required to pay a levy. But that did not stop the Government spending $lm of taxpayers' funds in saying what a terrific thing Medicare was, when it was something in which consumers had no choice. I just wonder whether that $lm would not have been better spent in the provision of child care assistance instead of in trying to convince the public that what it had to do was in fact a good thing. Only last night we heard in this place about extravagant and wasteful expenditure in the Australian Institute of Sport. How can the Government justify the Executive Director of that Institute spending $7,000 on a desk?",31
34,Mr HOWE,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The honourable member for Barker referred to the shortage of time, yet he is directing his remarks to matters which have no relationship whatever to the Bill before the - House. I ask you to confine him to the Bill.",31
35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Mr Mountford)I draw the attention of the honourable member for Barker to the need to restrict his remarks to the parameters of the Bill.  ister is obviously concerned about the electoral impact of this Bill and feels that he is under pressure, quite rightly. Secondly, I did not at any stage express a concern about time limits; I talked about the Government's inability to administer the parliamentary program properly. We are not trying to rush out of this House and close the Parliament down, it is the Government.",32
36,Mr HOWE,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Oh, come on.  in error. He misrepresented what I said and I am entitled to correct the error. The Opposition's concern in relation to this legislation is that, while the Government is prepared to spend money on public relations campaigns to try to shore up its own credibility, it is not prepared to continue to fund child care centres at the existing rate. In other words, it is taking money from the child care centres to fund its own promotion programs, as it spent $Im on the Medicare promotion program. It is wasting taxpayers' money as, for example, in the expenditure of $7,000 on a desk for the Executive Director of the Australian Institute of Sport. Only last night we had a report from auditors regarding wasteful expenditure under this Government within the Australian Institute of Sport. Let me raise one question for the Government. It has announced an extra $280m for university funding. How did it set the priority between university funding and child care funding? What if the Government had spent $270m extra on university funding and maintained the existing expenditure on child care assistance? The point I make is that the priorities set by this Government are not consistent with the statements it has made and its professed concerns in the area of child care, families and equal opportunity for women. The result of the legislation is that the universal subsidy per child care place will be reduced from about $30 to $16 for children under three years of age, or $11 for children three years and over. The average increase in fee will be about $14 a week and the effective rate of Commonwealth subsidy will be halved. The viability of some centres established as a result of Commonwealth policy initiatives will be threatened as a result of this legislation and a particular concern-this is why the honourable member for Melbourne is squirming-is being expressed by the Municipal Association of Victoria, which is threatening not to open new centres because it considers the new arrangements to be a breach of the Commonwealth Government's previous offer. This is a classic and dramatic example of the Government's total failure to consult these organisations properly before rushing ihto such decisions. It is a matter of particular importance to Victoria. I am sure that the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who will follow me in speaking in this debate on behalf of the Opposition, will go into more detail in relation to that matter of real concern. Access to high quality child care is one critical factor in achieving equal employment opportunity for women, especially those who need to work. because of economic pressure. Yet the Government's action will increase the cost, particularly for middle income families. It is worth bearing in mind that the cost of long day care exceeds that of attendance at the most expensive private day school. The hypocrisy of the ALP's actions in relation to child care and in this measure really highlights the inconsistency in its proclaimed espousal of equal employment opportunities. Our policy emphasises provision of quality child care. The Government has promised that . some 20,000 new child care places will be established by 1987. These will still provide for only about 7 per cent of Australian children potentially able to use the services. More Australian children still will use commercial child care, more will use informal care, including backyard arrangements, and more will have no access to child care. It is for these reasons that our policy, which was presented before the last election, provided for tax relief for child care expenses. It is appropriate to assist low income families by way of child care subsidy. However, there are many income earning families who will be assisted by that proposal for tax deductibility. Our policy is to provide real assistance to the thousands of families who are disadvantaged under the current tax system. It is quite clear that the current tax system discriminates against single income families in particular. We will assist those families by introducing taxation relief through income splitting arrangements for such families. For that reason I move: That all words after, 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (a) expresses its concern that the Bill may place at risk the standards of provision of child care, and (b) is of the opinion that, in order to meet the child care needs of the community, complementary measures are necessary, including taxation relief for child care expenses and income splitting for families'.",32
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS,Mr Mountford)Is the amendment seconded? Mr MCGauran-1 second the amendment.,33
38,Ms MAYER,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"1 will not waste any time on the farrago of nonsense which we have just heard from the honourable member  ever to do with the Child Care Amendment Bill. Simply because nobody had given him a copy of the second reading speech made by the Minister for Community Services (Senator Grimes) in the other place, the honourable member could not read the Bill and find out what it was about, so we had this mish-mash of total nonsense which is what we have come to expect from the honourable member. I will not waste any more time on that. I think that the interesting thing about the child care debate is that there has been considerable discussion about whether quality of care will be maintained under the new funding arrangements. The Government is absolutely firmly committed to quality of care and does provide the highest quality child care that is available. I have received a number of letters which have said that people want to send their children to government funded child care centres because they provide higher quality care than is provided in the private commercial area. I agree with that; that seems to be reasonable. However, there is a difficulty with the Municipal Association of Victoria. I think that this is the second time that the MA V has had a go at the Commonwealth Government in an endeavour to demonstrate that it is a powerful and iill important organisation. Once again, the MAV has got it totally wrong. On the first occasion this year, it tried to get local government to ask for something which would have given it less rather than greater funding. On this occasion, the MAVis in the business of reducing accessibility to child care. That really is getting a bit beyond a joke. Headlines such as 'Child care centre will not open' have appeared in a local newspaper. I ask the House: Who is being used as ammunition in this war between the MA V and the Commonwealth Government? It is the children and the parents who would be using and benefiting from those centres. What is it that the local councils say they want? They want a full time director-co-ordinator appointed for every centre, regardless of size, they want $18m worth of full time director-coordinators. Think about what that would do to child care funding. They want a 100 per cent coverage for 100 per cent of sick leave entitlements. Nobody budgets for that kind of coverage of sick leave entitlements because it is very unlikely that everybody on a staff will use the total of his or her accumulated sick leave entitlements in any given year. At the moment, 50 per cent of coverage for accumulated sick leave entitlements is part of the anf!ual Budget and that has certainly been satisfactory. Making child care more expensive to support is another way of reducing accessibility to child care. The local councils want a guaranteed minimum level of support-straight into the maximum inefficiency area. The Commonwealth Government does not fund child care centres in low need areas. Everyone of them is placed in a high need area giving a high rate of usage. They want coverage against possible fluctuation. It is my opinion that good and sensible planning will make sure that there is not a high level of fluctuation in attendance at any child care centre. That is something which the local councils can do something about, seeing they claim such a high level of local knowledge. It seems to me that, given that a centre is placed in a high use area and that good planning will provide a mix of places which will give steady usage, to provide a guaranteed minimum level of support is simply to provide guaranteed funding for inefficient and bad planning, and should a centre eventually be in an area in which the demography has changed it is probably sensible to shift the centre. Those three matters, out of a long list of nonsense which the MAV is claiming, are preventing people from using child care centres into which the Commonwealth Government has put a considerable amount of money, as did the local councils when they sponsored organisations. If we gave into demands such as those we would have deficit funded centres, an open hole down which taxpayers'money would disappear, many fewer centres and instead of child care becoming more accessible it would become less accessible. I ask that the parents demand that their local councils open those centres, stop fiddling around with nonsense that would raise the cost of child care right over the country, and stop using children and their parents as ammunition in their foolish war.",33
39,Mr REITH,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The Child Care Am!!ndment Bill incorporates Labor's $lOm worth of cuts to child care centres throughout Australia. The Bill has been rushed in here today following a big fight in Caucus. Presumably the Minister for Community Services (Senator Grimes) got rolled in the Cabinet. The legislation illustrates graphically ernment is in. I think that it also illustrates graphically how poorly it sets its priorities. The provision of child care facilities has become a growing responsibility of governments over the past few years. The Liberal Party supports government funding essentially to enable parents to have the opportunity to undertake paid employment. In most cases, it is a matter of need and necessity and not choice. For example, contrary to the Government's claims about rich and elitist non-government schools, many parents and particularly mothers, with children at non-government schools have to work to provide what they consider to be the best possible education for their children. The Liberal Party's approach to funding was one of its main election commitments in 1984 and remains a major plank in our policy. We will provide taxation relief by way of rebate for parents wishing to use child care facilities. view is that. taxation relief places the spending power in the hands of the individuals. Allied to our policy for child care tax relief, it is tant to point out that we have a policy provide income splitting for families. We strongly support the institution of the family our return to government this will be a major focus of our attention. Whilst we support the general concept of in government expenditure, this measure really shows how wrong the Government's priorities are. This Government has been responsible for throwing money away-taxpayers' money, I child might add-with gay abandon. Mr Deputy tain Speaker, the list of examples of government waste is as long as your arm. It has spent $8m public funding for election expenses. It gave extra politicians, as if we did not have enough of them in this place. That costs us $18m a year. Of course, the alterations on the hill to the Parliament House cost about $40m. Jobs for boys has been raised to a new art form. Do $5,500. honourable members remember the Australian Bicentennial Authority? The Government paid out $500,000Mr MiIton- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a Victoria point of order. I came to listen to a debate child care. Instead, we are hearing a litany accusations which has nothing to do with child care. I ask you to ask the honourable member to keep to the subject of the debate.",34
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS,I realise the honourable member is discussing matters that are perhaps part of the wider issues. I ask him to come to the points relating to the what a mess this Govspecific Bill.,34
41,Mr REITH,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"The fact is-I know it is hard for the Government to face the facts-that its priorities are wrong. I am simply listing just a few-and there is a very long list-examples of government waste. If it had attacked the waste in the sort of areas that I have highlighted, this measure would not be before the House today. I turn to another aspect of this matter which particularly concerns me. The Shire of Cranbourne is a municipality in my electorate, on the outskirts of Melbourne, which has a rapidly growing population. To reflect this, it was one of the 42 communities in Victoria to attract government support for a new child care centre. The council received notification in August 1984 that it would receive $175,000 for capital works for a child care centre. It put in $25,000 of its ratepayers' money. It provided the land upon which the building is nearly completed, the land Our being worth $35,000 to $40,000. The council expects to be in a position to open the centre early next year. The draft operating costs, which imporsquare up with the costs of already existing to centres, show a total expenditure of about $192,000, of which approximately $160,000 will and upon be taken up by salaries. As a result of. the measure that is before the House today, the council resolved last week that cuts it will not open the centre until the Commonwealth reviews its latest decision and provides more significant financial support. Who can blame it? It undertook this project to provide a care centre for its municipality under cerground rules that had been set by the Government. Of course, mid-stream, just prior to the on centre being opened, the Government has us changed the ground rules. The financial effect for the ratepayers of the Shire of Cranbourne is that the subsidy has been cut by $38,000. That new is a lot of money. To add insult to injury, the the national wage case has increased its costs by As I understand it, the situation is reflected in 31 of the 42 new centres which were announced in August 1984. I further understand that in about 1,000 child care centre places are on now in jeopardy. The Government has changed of the rules midstream and it really makes a mockery of the Government's concern to provide child care facilities. But it is worse than that, because it has led the council up the garden path. It gave firm commitments about recurrent funding and it has now left the council holding the baby. It has all been done without any consultation. It follows what is now a very common occurrence, which is that the Government passes responsibilities to local government, but refuses to come up with the goods for ongoing support. For councils, this will be no surprise. In the May economic statement the Gov;ernment chopped into their funding yet again when it abandoned the principle that local governments should receive 2 per cent of personal income tax receipts. Following the usual pattern, there was no discussion. For many people in my electorate, this will be the last straw. It will obviously put in jeopardy the 20,000 child care places that the Government promised in the last election and will be yet another in a growing list of broken promises.",34
42,Mr STAPLES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"While many people in society, often typified by those opposite, see non-parental, non-maternal child care as an attack on their rigid nuclear family model, the 'keep them barefoot and pregnant' approach, the majority see high quality child care in the provision of family day care, full day or occasional day child care as an integral part of the needs of parents today. While the Opposition generally supports the Child Care Amendment Bill, there is no need whatsoever for this Government or the people of Australia to accept the rubbish that the Opposition has put today in regard to the quality of child care as outlined in this legislation. The record of the Hawke Labor Government on child care, as in many other areas, speaks for itself. The chicken could have done better than the contribution of the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter). In fact, I would not be surprised to see him replaced by the chicken if he does not beef up his act a bit after his contribution to the debate. In the last year of the Liberal-National Party Government it spent $65m on child care. That amount came out of the biggest Budget in real terms and the biggest deficit in real terms that this country has ever seen. Let us compare that measly $65m with the record of the Hawke Labor Government. Today's Opposition will see-and those in the community who make a lot of noise will see-the Government's contribution to real, high quality, high quantity child care. Honourable members should remember that just $65m was spent in the last year of the Liberal-National Party Government, those members of the present Opposition who cry now. In the Hawke Labor Government's first Budget in 1983-84, $80m was spent. Last year $123m was spent-a 53 per cent increase in 12 months. This year, 1985-86, 'the figure is $133m. For those who can multiply by two-there might be one in the Opposition's ranks who can-that is effectively a doubling in 33 months, an average growth of 28 per cent per annum over that period. So much for the assertions made by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and the honourable member for Barker that this Bill concerns a $10m cut. It does not concern a $lOm cut; it concerns spending $133m this year. In regard to the figures for long day care places, in June 1982, when the previous Government was running the show, there were 37,580 places: In June 1985 the figure was 63,535, an increase of 70 per cent. That is the record. That is what we are talking about and that is what members of the Opposition cannot come to grips with. Furthermore, this Government has a commitment to provide 20,000 new, effective full time child care places by 1988. In 1982 only 4 per cent of the nought to four-year-old age cohort was covered. Now we are covering 7+ per cent. That is the increase. By 1988 the figure will be up to 10 per cent. While not all parents need access to child care, whether it be occasional, short or long day care, the bare fact is that even with this record escalation in the provision of child care services under this Government, more than 90 per cent of children in Australia in that nought to four-year-old age cohort do not have access to high quality child care. The problem today is this: How do we get the best value for our money to maintain that quality and to increase rapidly the quantity of child care? In answer to that question, this Government has put this legislation before the Parliament today. The honourable member for Chisholm (Ms Mayer) quite capably, as usual, outlined some of the measures taken to ensure that quality keeps pace with quantity. Under the current system, with the Government providing most of its funding by way of operational subsidy for child care centres, there is virtually no incentive for centres realistically to restrain their operational costs. According to what the councils are putting forward, through the Municipal Association of Victoria, they would not accept open-ended funding in their budgets. But that is what they are trying to ram down the throat of this Government. The Opposition would not accept open-ended funding, but that is what it is trying to ram down the throat of this Government. We will not cop it. We want restraint in expenditure while at the same time putting more places on the ground and maintaining quality. The funding for child care comes in three parts: Operational subsidy, paid by the Government; fees paid by the parents, and fee relief, paid by this Government as well. Unfortunately since new guidelines were released month most people have concentrated on the reduction in operational subsidy without doing the more difficult assessment of changes to the fee relief structure. I have not got much time in which to speak; so in the time. I have left I want to make a which has been raised by honourable members opposite. There has been a lot of consultation with the community over a very long period. The child care community knows-it should know and should respect-what this Government has done for child care. I would like to hear a bit more about it from the MA V, from the Opposition and from the community as well. Those people listening to the broadcast today and those people who read the Hansard should be aware of the way in which honourable members on this side are concerned about child I refer to the honourable member for Chisholm, who spoke before, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Hand), the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles), the honourable member for Aston (Mr Saunderson), the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Milton), the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Maher), the honourable member for Lindsay (Mr Free) and the hon()urable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), they have fought to develop consultation in the community in order to bring that consultation to the Government. Those honourable members will not have the opportunity to speak here today because of the wasteful speeches of honourable members opposite such as the honourable member for Barker and the honourable member for Flinders. What a sham! They have not been out there working through the guidelines. We have been working through the community. We have consulted with people in the community. We consulted with the MAV and put its recommendations to the Government. The Government's record on child care speaks for itself. We have never backed down from child care. We will not back down in the future. This legislation proves that.",35

45,Mr GRIFFITHS,CRIME AUTHORITY,On behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Crime care. Authority I present the first report of the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.,36
46,Mr GRIFFITHS,CRIME AUTHORITY,"by leave-Before I go to the substantive part of my comments I wish to raiSe very briefly a couple of matters in relation to a matter of privilege referred to by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) this morning. He raised a matter of privilege in relation to some publicity surrounding this report. He indicated that a report in the Age newspaper had adverted to material which had been leaked from Government Committee members. I have had a look at that Age report and it suggests no such thing. Of course, it indicates only that the sources of the leak were Committee members. This report of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority is the Committee's first since it began effective operations in March this year. Regrettably, the Committee must report to the Parliament that it is unable to fulfil its statutory duty because it does not have-and has been unable to obtain from the National Crime Authority-sufficient information of substance to serve as a basis for the monitoring and review role vested in it by this Parliament. This situation has arisen because of a fundamental difference of view between the Authority and the Committee as to the Authority's obligation to provide information which the Committee believes necessary to carry out its statutory duty. I should emphasise that while the Committee has been active in a number of areas falling within its charter, the subject matter. of this first report raises a threshold problem which is of such fundamental significance that it requires immediate attention. The Committee intends to report on its other activities in due course: However, it is unable to discharge its statutory duty effectively until this threshold problem has been resolved. The Committee was established under the National Crime Authority Act 1984 as a result of an amendment inserted in the Act during the Committee stage of the debate in the Senate. The original proposal for such a parliamentary committee was put by Mr Frank Costigan, QC, during evidence he gave before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs inquiring into the National Crime Authority Bill. I would like, at this point,Â· to pay tribute to my fellow Committee members and in particular Senator Alan Missen, the Deputy Chairman, for the totally bipartisan way in which they have performed their duties. Given the politically sensitive nature of the Committee's responsibilities and the pecular difficulties which the Committee has faced in its first year of operation, the spirit of co-operation and good will which has prevailed is particularly noteworthy. Also I take this opportunity to thank the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) now, of course, shadow Attorney-General, for his significant contribution to the Committee's operations prior to his resignation. I might add that at least on the part of Government members of the Committee, we wish him a long and fruitful career as shadow Attorney-General. I also thank Mr Chris Fogarty, the Secretary to the Committee, and Miss Nanette Williams for the significant assistance which they have been able to provide to date. At the first meeting the Committee had with the Authority I suggested that the relationship between the two bodies was likely to be characterised by an element of 'creative tension'. In using this term I was conscious of the potential difficulties inherent in the legislation and indeed in the very nature of the task assigned to this Committee. As with some other legislation, the section of this Act which sets out the duties of the Committee is open to different legal interpretations. As events quickly proved, I was not wrong about the likelihood of an element of tension between the Committee and the Authority. It has arisen precisely because the Authority and the Committee, as I predicted, have taken different views as to the nature of the Committtee's duties under the Act. It remains to be seen whether the role of creativity will be such as to resolve our problem. The Committee's role is unique, as it is the only instance of a parliamentary committee specifically established to act as a watchdog over one statutory authority. This is perhaps a recognition of the seriousness of the issues raised by the need to combat organised crime in this country. These issues require a balancing of the community interest in reducing the grave social and economic effects resulting from organised crime with all the resources it can muster and, of course, a balancing of the protection of individual civil liberties. The unique nature of the Committee's role-and the consequent lack of precedent-has made the Committee's task more than usually difficult. However, throughout what has been a difficult period of operations, the Committee has been fully conscious that it possesses the full range of powers available to a parliamentary committee. The most important of these-the power to send for persons, papers and records-is encompassed within the identical resolutions passed by both Houses at the time of the Committee's establishment. The Committee's role is consistent with the long-established tradition in our parliamentary system of requiring executive and bureaucratic accountability to the Parliament. Parliament has made a judgment that a joint parliamentary committee is the appropriate body, presumably with the necessary time and resources, to provide detailed oversight of the National Crime Authority. It can only be presumed that the traditional avenue of ministerial accountability was not, by itself, considered adequateto provide detailed supervision of the Authority's operations, particularly having regard to the complex and sensitive issues involved in those operations and the need to ensure that they are properly dealt with. As the Committee's report relates, evidence of a divergence of view between the Committee and the Authority as to the nature of our relationship and as to the extent of the Committee's powers to seek information was apparent from our first meeting, when the Authority resisted attempts by the Committee to obtain detailed information about the transition from the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union to the Authority. This resistance foreshadowed a general reluctance on the part of the Authority, based upon itsÂ· interpretation of section 55 and upon its view of its obligations under section 51-the secrecy provision-of the Act, to provide the sort of detailed information about its operations which the Committee regards as necessary if it is to monitor the Authority's operations effectively. When this clear difference of view emerged it was agreed that the Committee should prepare guidelines for the future conduct of proceedings between the Authority and the Committee. At about this time the Committee had concluded that, in the light of the disagreement about the Committee's right to seek detailed information on the transition from the Costigan Royal Commission, it should seek counsel's opinion on that issue and upon the broader question of the Committee's powers. This opinion, provided by Mr C. M. Maxwell and summarised in the Committee's report, served as the basis of the Committee's proposed guidelines. . In summary form, counsel's view is that there is to be implied from the Act a duty or power to inquire vested in the Committee. This implicatioll is reinforced by a study of the resolutions passed by both Houses relating to the powers and proceedings of the Committee. Among other things; these resolutions specifically empower the Committee to send for persons, papers and records, which is the traditional power of the Parliament to coerce the giving of information as part of its investigative functions. This interpretation is supplemented by paragraph (q) of the resolution, which directs the Committee in carrying out its duties to 'ensure that the operational methods and results of investigation of law enforcement agencies as far. as possible be protected from disclosure where that would be against the public interest'. This carries a clear implication that the Parliament contemplated that the Committee would be seeking and obtaining from the Authority information relating in some detail to the performance of its functions including any particular decisions made by the Authority in relation to investigation of particular matters. Dealing with sub-section 55 (2) of the Act, which seeks to prohibit the Committee from investigating a matter relating to relevant criminal activity or reconsidering the findings of the Authority in r-lation to a particular investigation, counsel suggests that its purpose was to ensure that the Committee did not usurp or duplicate the Authority's functions. The Authority's role il) to investigate; the Committee's role is to mqnitor and review the way in which .the Authority discharges the function of investigation. The purpose of the prohibition is to prevent the Committee from making its own judgments as to what the findings in relation to a particular investigationÂ· should be. However, this does not mean that the Committee cannot inquire of the Authority what its findings were in relation to a particular investigation and seek to discover the process whereby those findings were arrived at. Counsel suggests the Committee would step beyond its legitimate role if it called for the detailed evidence which served as the basis of the Authority's findings or if it reconsidered what findings it should have reached. Another point of difference which arose at the outset and which, I suggest, epitomises the Authority's view of the relationship between it and the Committee is the question of whether there should be a Hansard record of proceedings between the Authority and the Committee. At first, the Committee acquiesced in the Authority's resistance to the presence of Hansard on grounds of security. However, it soon became apparent to the Committee that a verbatim record was essential and, moreover, the Committee is firmly of the view that a Hansard record is a fundamental element of any parliamentary proceeding. I should point out, at this stage;. that the Authoriti has subsequently agreed, albeit reluctantly, to the presence of Hansard during Committee proceedings. However, on the fundamental issue of interpretation of the Committee's right to seek additional information to fulfil its statutory duties there has been no meeting of minds. At a meeting on 15 August, where discussion of the issue came to a head, it became apparent that there is a clear delineation of view between the Committee and the Authority on two separate-although interconnected-issues. One is the legal question of the extent to which, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the Authority can be required to provide information to enable the Committee to carry out its statutory duty to monitor and review. The second is the perception of the nature of the relationship between a parliamentary committee, vested with all the traditional powers attaching to such committees, and a creature of the Parliament made subject by statute to the scrutiny of that committee. At those discussions Mr Justice Stewart, armed with an opinion from the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department in support of the Authority's view, informed the Committee that the Authority believed that it could not properly reveal information to the Committee relating to any relevant criminal activity; that is, any information about any of its investigations. The secrecy provision in section 51 of the Act, which prevents members of the Authority from divulging information, except for the purposes of the Act, is seen by Mr Justice Stewart as conflicting with the right of the Committee to obtain information. Because of the Authority's view of the limits placed on the amount of information it may divulge to the Committee, it has formed the view that to go beyond those limits would place it in breach of section 51. The Committee does not doubt the genuine nature of the Authority's perception that to divulge information beyond the limits established by its interpretation of sub-section 55 (2) would put it in breach of the Act's secrecy provision. The Committee is also fully aware of the security implications which may arise from dissemination of information held by the Authority. Nevertheless it is apparent that this Committee cannot fulfil the duty which the Parliament intended without considerably more information than has been formally provided to date. The interpretation of the Committee's powers to which the Authority is committed effectively means that the Committee cannot discharge the duties vested in it by the Parliament. The Committee accordingly decided that it must report this impasse to the Parliament in order to seek an amendment to the legislation that will ensure that the Committee is properly equipped to undertake the task intended by Parliament. In the Committee's view-and the report contains a recommendation to this effectthe National Crime Authority Act should be amended to make it clear that the Committee has a right of access to the full range of information held by the Authority so as to enable the Committee to monitor and review the Authority's operations effectively. The purpose of the Committee's recommendation is to seek from the Parliament explicit statutory recognition of, or the removal of any statutory impediment to, the exercise of the full powers of inquiry vested in a parliamentary committee. The Committee is fully aware of the delicate nature of the issues involved and of the consequent need to ensure that the concerns of the Authority regarding security, personal reputations and safety are respected. However, I wish to stress the Committee's view that it must be the final arbiter of the extent to which information permissible within the terms of an amendment to the legislation along the li-es proposed in the Committee's recommendation ought properly to be provided. In this context the Committee sees as its own responsibility the adoption of procedures consistent with these objectives. Moreover, the Committee wishes to emphasise that powers granted under an amendment of the type proposed would be seen by the Committee as reserve powers and would be used judiciously. The Committee's recommendation seeks an amendment to the Act specifically to provide that the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority should have the power to do such things and make such inquiries as it thinks necessary for the proper performance of its duties. The amendment would further provide-this is a very important proposal-that where information sought by the Committee is of such a nature that its disclosure to members of the public would prejudice the safety or reputation of persons or the operation of law enforcement agencies it should be made the subject of a separate report to the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Committee. This latter proposal is modelled on the arrangements in subsection 59 (3) of the Act dealing with the provision of information by the Authority to the Inter-Governmental Committee. The Committee does not make this recommendation lightly. It has given the issues discussed in the report long and serious consideration and has concluded that, unless a recommendation of the sort proposed is forthcoming, there is no point in retaining a parliamentary committee to act as a watchdog over the National Crime Authority. The issue at stake in this report is whether the Parliament is going to assert its right to monitor and review one of its creatures-that is, the National Crime Authority-or whether, for a range of reasons, including a degree of bureaucratic resistance, it will relinquish that role in favour of the traditional model of ministerial accountability alone. I know that there is much business before the House. I shall conclude by bringing to the attention of the Parliament one final matter of concern to the Committee. As part of this process, the Committee has been gratified by the ready co-operation it has received from all States and the Northern Territory, with one exception, that exception-this will come as no surprise tO,many honourable members-being the Premier of Queensland, who, for whatever obscure reason, refused to make the Queensland Police Commissioner available to discuss with the Committee the question of organised crime in his State and the broader issue of co-operation between States and the National Crime Authority. Having regard to the serious level of organised crime in this country and especially to the threat posed to young people by trafficking in narcotics, the Committee finds it inexplicable that any person in high office would refuse to co-operate in the fight against organised crime. I thank the House.",36
47,Mr MCGAURAN,CRIME AUTHORITY,"by leave-As a member of the National Crime Authority Committee I endorse the report tabled by the Chairman, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths). However, I very much regret his concluding remarks which sought in one way or another to leave this Parliament or anyone who might be listening to the broadcast with the impression that Queensland may not be as active in the fight against organised crime as other States. Indeed, I am advised that the Queensland Police Force has two full time officers with the National Crime Authority. It has extremely good relations with the National Crime Authority. Moreover, a recent conference held as late as Monday of this week conducted by the National Crime Authority in Brisbane resulted in Mr Willey, one of the executive officers, moving a public vote of thanks to Commissioner Lewis of the Queensland Police Force. In that vote of thanks he thanked him for his continued assistance. I understand that Police Commissioner Lewis has extended to members of the National Crime Authority a standing invitation to meet with him at their convenience whenever in Brisbane. I wish to correct those last remarks of the Chairman of the National Crime Authority Committee. The fact that Queensland has not made its Commissioner available to the National Crime Authority Committee for the purpose of background information on the trends and the state of organised crime in this country is a matter for a sovereign State. For the Chairman of the Committee in almost his final sentence to leave the issue hanging in the air was in my view quite improper. I simply conclude by saying that all of us well understand the concerns of the National Crime Authority when dealing with a parliamentary committee. After all, the 10 members on the Committee have at least three staff each, so that is 30 staff, and there are then the staff who assist. the Committee. Therefore, we can understand its concern. It is necessary for the Committee to build up a trust with the National Crime Authority. ' This is an areaÂ·of great interest because in the last few days the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States of America, for instance, has publicly proclaimed its concern about the C-mgress Committee overseeing its operations arid it expressed the view that that Committee",40
48,Mr GRIFFITHS,CRIME AUTHORITY,The CIA.,40
49,Mr MCGAURAN,CRIME AUTHORITY,"And the Cential Intelligence Agency. I thought the FBI also had expressed its concern. The CIA said that the Congress Committee had allowed a great deal of information to slip away. I agree with the report tabled' by the Chairman. There is a formula which can be worked out, which is that on matters of great sensitivity, the Chairman and the DeputY,Chairman ought to be briefed. We have to weigh the concerns of the Crime Authority against the need for parliamentary democracy to reign supreme. I accept the advice of;one police commissioner to the Committee. He said that certainly there are some risks with giving information to the elected representatives but that the principle of the supremacy of the parliament is worth that risk. If information should leak from that Committee, political sanctions must apply and it is for the Parliament to take action. The leaking of that information, however tragic that may be, is nowhere near as tragic as the lessening of the supremacy of parliament. NA AUTHORITIES AMENDMENT BILL 1985 Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Second Reading",40
50,Mr YOUNG,PUBLIC SERVICE AND STATUTORY,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Public Service and Statutory Authorities Amendment Bill 1985 has two principal objects. Firstly, it amends the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act to include inefficiency and loss of essential qualifications as grounds upon which redeployment and retirement action can be taken in relation to staff covered by that Act. This amendment is the result of a review of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act in which the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Council of Professional Associations have participated. Under the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act staff can be redeployed or retired where their services cannot reasonably be used because they are surplus to the requirements of their department or authority or are incapable of .performing their duties as a result of physical or mental incapacity. The Government believes it essential to have an effective but fair system forÂ· dealing with staff who are inefficient or who have lost essential qualifications. Equally, it believes that sub-paragraph 7 (l) (b) (iii) is too broad and imprecise and that a topic so fundamental as the grounds upon which Commonwealth employees can be redeployed or retired should be spelt out in legislation rathe.r than being left to regulations. Accordingly, this legislation repeals sub-paragraph 7 (I) (b) (iii) and specifically inserts ficiency and loss of essential qualifications into the Act as additional grounds for redeployment and retirement. The second principal object of the Bill is to introduce new employment provisions into the Public Service Act. The existing provisions in the Public Service Act have been used to engage staff for several quite different purposes including the engagement of short term and fixed term temporary assistants, the engagement of industrial staff on a continuing basis and the engagement of local staff by Australian missions overseas. The new scheme set out in the Bill will create four separate categories of employeescontinuing employees, short term employees, fixed term employees and overseas employees. By separating out these categories, the Bill enables more appropriate 'engagement and tenure arrangements to apply to each. The provisions seek to balance the need to give departments greater flexibility in day to day operations while ensuring proper central coordination and control to protect the integrity of the new scheme. A special section is inserted into the Public Service Act to facilitate the engagement of staff under the Government's youth traineeship scheme, and other government schemes designed to enable persons to gain skill-, qualifications, aptitudes and experience in order, to equip them to participate in the Australian work force. As part of the Public Service reforms, the responsibility for human resources budgeting became the responsibility of the Department of Finance. Following this change, it is no longer appropriate for the Public Service Board's approval to be required in relation to consultants engaged by various statutory authorities. Accordingly, the Bill removes the requirement for the Board to approve consultancy arrangements under the various Acts set out in the SchedUle to the. Bill. The Bill also contains a number of minor technical amendments to the Public Service Act, the Long Service Leave Act and other legislation. Details of these are set out in the explanatory memorandum. There are no identifiable costs associated with the amendments made by the Bill. The revised employment provisions are designed to ensure that the tenure and other benefits obtained by employees are commensurate with the service they are engaged to provide. The amendments to the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act are expected to improve long term efficiency of the Public Service. inef- The Government proposes to move an amendment relating to departmental annual reports.",40
51,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PUBLIC SERVICE AND STATUTORY,"I understand that it is the wish of the House to debate this Bill forthwith. That being so, I will allow that course to be followed.",41
52,Mr CONNOLLY,PUBLIC SERVICE AND STATUTORY,"The Opposition has studied the proposals contained in the Public Service and Statutory Authorities Amendment Bill 1985. I am rather disappointed that the Special Minister of State (Mr Young) was not able to provide me with a copy of his second reading speech. Apparently there are no copies available, in the chamber.",41
53,Mr YOUNG,PUBLIC SERVICE AND STATUTORY,I just got it myself.,41
54,Mr CONNOLLY,PUBLIC SERVICE AND STATUTORY,"That makes it slightly difficult. As the Minister is well aware, it is proposed that the Government will move an amendment to the legislation leading out of the decision in another place to incorporate significant changes to section 10 of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act relating to the provision of annual reports. I 'do not know whether the Minister referred to that in his remarks, but I have with me, if he would like it, a copy of the Government's proposed amendments to this legislation. As has been the practice since the introduction of the fairly major legislative reforms to the Public Service introduced by the Government in 1983, the Opposition has seen fit to support the thrust of those proposed amendments because we believe they are consistent with the overall improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness of the Public Service. We have taken every opportunity to emphasise our strong belief in the need to maintain an apolitical Public Service, one which people can enter with the objective of having a career, a Service which they can be proud of and in which they can give the very best service possible to the Australian people and above all a Service that can attract the best quality Australians available to government. I use the term 'government' there in a generic sense. This legislation is introduced to remove, a number of anomalies which resulted from the reforms of the Public Service introduced in 1984. Those reforms gave the Public Service Board a somewhat different status in terms of the responsibilities it previously had and they tended to put more emphasis on departmental management and departmental secretaries in particular having greater control over the administration of personnel matters. Again, as I have said, that is quite consistent with our approach that one should try to develop at all possible opportunities a philosophy based on letting the managers manage. The new legislation reduces further the Board's involvement in the appointment and termination of non-officer classifications who were not covered by the earlier reforms. These non-officer classifications would include, for example, consultants, technical and industrial personnel under various awards and so forth. But none of these people are defined as officers under the Act. An officer under the Public Service Act, of course, is effectively a career person in the various egories employed within departments. It is proposed that people who come under the new classifications which are included in this legislation will be appointed by secretaries to departments without reference to the Board. The legislation really has three principal objectives. First, the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act contained a number of grounds upon which public servants could be redeployed or, on occasions, retired from the Public Service. This proposed amendment, which we support, contains additional grounds-namely, inefficiency and loss of essential qualifications. Under the CE(RR) Act, staff can be redeployed or retired where their services cannot reasonably be used because they are surÂ· plus to their department's or authority's requirements or are incapable of performing their duties as a result of physical or mental incapacity. As I have pointed out, the Bill extends the grounds for redeployment or retirement, to inefficiency, loss of essential qualifications or for any other reason. In other words, it is proposed that senior management be given substantially greater powers than it had previously over the allocation of personnel in terms of their efficiency and effectiveness. Where it is not possible to redeploy an employee, the secretary to a department will be required, under these provisions, to take account of factors such as the nature and duration of the employee's past service, the length of prospective service if he or she stayed in a department and the extent to which retraining or rehabilitation would enable duties to be performed as an alternative to compulsory retirement. I think those provisions are adequate. It means that a person just cannot be dismissed merely on the whim of senior management of a department which should take into account whether in fact that person still has some capacity to offer to either the Department or the Public Service as a whole. The second objective of the legislation is, as I said earlier, to revise the arrangements applying to the engagement of employees, not officers, under the Public Service Act by establishing four separate categories-that is, continuing, short term, fixed term and overseas employees. It was found necessary to redefine what had previously been known as exempt or temporary employees-mainly staff recruited for part time or temporary work or industrial categories. None of these were previously covered by the Public Service Act and their status under the CE(RR) cat- Act was therefore ambiguous. This resulted in a successful High Court challenge against the Commonwealth in the case lannou v. Fowell' which involved the Special Broadcasting Service. As a result of that it was quite clear that the legislation had to be amended. There are currently some 21,000 personnel in the Commonwealth Public Service who are not covered by the full provisions of the Public Service Act and a further 7,000 temporary employees, some of whom in fact do have tenure. The Bill contains a range of definitions in respect of the four new employee categories. It also contains some significant changes in relation to equal opportunity and industrial democracy. Specifically, the objective is to extend to the Naval Defence Act and the Supply and Development Act ptovisions in earlier - gislation which for technical reasons had not been applied to those categories. The Opposition is of the view that this matter should be subject to amendment and I am pleased to see that . apparently the Government, on the basis of the amendments given to me by the Special Minister of State, is accepting that proposal. We have no objection to the extension of the equal opportunity and industrial democracy provisions to civilian personnel under the Naval Defence Act or the Supply and Development Act. However, we were concerned that the legislation was a little open-ended in its present form because in the event of war, civil emergency and so forth there seemed to bl; a potential limitation on the capacity of personnel under those Acts, and therefore working in a quasi defence role, in fact to come under a greater degree of discipline. However, our, concern has been accepted by the Government in the other place and therefore that matter rests. I should' also take the opportunity to. emphasise the concern of the Opposition about allegations that the equal opportunity legislation has been used in such a way that females alone may now apply for positions as acting heads of schools in the Australian Capital Territory. Not unreasonably, the male teacher fraternity feels that it has been unfairly discriminated against. The Opposition has always taken a view that while on the one hand it certainly suppotts the concept of equal opportunities, whether it be for females, Aborigines, migrants or any other groups in' the work force, and it certainly sees that there is a case, for us to do what we can to ensure that management does its best to encourage females or other groups in the community to feel, as does the mainstream work force, that they have access to the full range of opportunities, on the other hand we do not solve our problems by creating what can be seen as discrimination against others. If the situation in the Australian Capital Territory is as reported, it is notunreasonable to make the point that male teachers have every reason to feel they are being discriminated against if they are prohibited from taking positions as acting heads of schools simply because they are males. Surely the issue: must be that the best person available for the job should fill that position. One of the essential ingredients of the Public Service in recent years has been the application of the merit principle. If we are to have a merit principle based on sex, clearly we will have very major problems in a community such as Australia. I think the Government should be prepared to put its somewhat controversial views to one side and try to live. with the reality that male teachers are just as entitled to promotion as are female teachers. While a case can be argued that very few female teachers have become heads of departments, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), who is in the chamber, knows as I do as a result of our involvement with the 202nd report of the Public Accounts' Committee that the situation has improved quite significantly over the last three or four years. Hopefully we will. see a continuing improvement. However, this objective will not be achieved if the work force is divided on the grounds of sex and people are made to perceive that they are not being given opportunities simply because they are males. The Minister has not noted' that the Government intends to move the amendment. I take it that he proposes to do so at the Committee stage. I wish to finalise my observations by making two points. Proposed new section 82AD proposes that guidelines should be provided by the Public Service Board for the provision of opportunities for appointments under certain categories. The difficulty as I see it is that there is a weakness under these proposals in that positions will not be advertised. Therefore, I am concerned that the merit principle may not apply. I do not intend to move an amendment in this area because, as I said, there is a problem in giving flexibility to senior management. But I think it is equally important that people in the community should know that these part time jobs are available in the Public Service. Therefore, there is a need to develop a mechanism, whether it be through normal media advertising arrangements or otherwise, to ensure that at least once a year people are made aware that positions are available and that they can apply for them. The second observation I make is in relation to the employment of fixed term employees. In my opinion there is a contradiction in the legislation in the definition of fixed term employees who, as I stated, may be appointed by the secretary to a department with the approval of the Public Service Board to perform duties involving a project or task with a fixed duration. Such appointments may be made if the required skills are not present in the Public Service and the appointee will not be required on the completion of the project. In other words, the distinct impression from that definition is that it is for a specific period. Unfortunately, proposed section 82AE does not state that. What it says is that a departmental head may appoint a person for a period not exceeding five years. But there is also provision for a further extension of five years without reference to the Public Service Board. Frankly, it is absurd to suggest that a part time person can have a job for 10 years, especially in categories where they will not be available for promotion or in most cases for the fringe benefits, of which honourable members, including the Special Minister of State (Mr Young) ,are well aware. That area requires further examination. In the Committee stage in due course I may refer to other questions relating to equal opportunity and industrial democracy, but on that point I would emphasise that the Opposition is happy to support the legislation in its present form, but we will not support the Government's proposal to amend section 10 relating to secretaries and annual reports. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. The Bill.",41
55,Mr YOUNG,PUBLIC SERVICE AND STATUTORY,"by leave-I move: (I) Clause 9, page 3, line 27, omit paragraph (a). (2) Clause 10, page 4, lines 15 to 42, omit proposed sub-section 25 (7), insert the following sub-section: '(7) A report prepared under sub-section (6) be in accordance with guidelines from time to time approved by the Prime Minister and presented to the Parliament'. (3) Clause 10, page 4, add at the end of the clause the following proposed sub-section: '(9) In sub-clause (6). ""Department"" means a Department referred to in paragraph (a) of the definition of ""Department"" in sub-section 7 (1)'. I am pleased that the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), had been circulated with the amendments. They have been redrafted in deference to the amendments put up by the Australian Democrats, as I understand, in the Senate. The Government is moving an amendment which accepts the general principles of the Australian Democrats amendment passed by the Senate, that is, that departments be required to report annually to the Parliament, but hopefully we have redrafted it in a more acceptable form. Our amendment retains proposed sub-clauses 25 (6) and (8) of the Democrats amendment, that is, the obligation of the secretary to a department to prepare an annual report and the obligation upon the Minister responsible for a department to table such a report in the Parliament within 15 sitting days. We are deleting the long list of detailed contents included in proposed sub-clause 25 (7) and replacing it by a requirement that such a report be in accordance with guidelines approved by the Prime Minister and tabled in the Parliament. This gives aÂ· statutory basis to present practice. It thus puts a statutory obligation on the Executive to report to the Parliament while at the same time allowing flexibility in developing the guidelines over time to meet the Parliament's information needs. We are inserting a new sub-clause 25 (9) to make it clear that the annual report requirement applies only to departments of state or ministerial departments, not those statutory authorities such as the Ombudsman which are deemed to be departments for the purpose of the Public Service Act and which already, in most if not all cases, are subject to annual reporting requirements in the Acts setting them up. I hope that the clarification contained in the redrafting of the Government's amendments will meet with In Committee the Opposition's support.",44
56,Mr CONNOLLY,PUBLIC SERVICE AND STATUTORY,"Unfortunately, the Opposition is not able to support the proposed reversal of the situation which the Special Minister of State (Mr Young) has emphasised. I would emphasise that in the Australian Labor Party's policy for the 1983 election shall there was a considerable section to the effect that it wanted to introduce in this House a Bill to establish an annual report procedure. I do not know why the Government is so coy about this matter because it is contained in Labor's policy statement. I put to the Minister two simple propositions. First, if the Government is prepared to support a private member's Bill which could have unanimous support within the chamber containing elements supported and agreed to by both sides, that would be an alternative worthy of serious consideration. All I am stating is that it happens to be the common policy of both the Government and the Opposition that there be in place an adequate mechanism by which departments will make annual reports to the Parliament. There are in place, now, through the Acts I nterpretation Act provisions, arrangements by which statutory authorities must make annual reports to the Parliament, but for some odd reason they do not yet apply to departments. The provision, which both the amendment as well as the existing legislation as it has come to us from another place specifies without doubt, is that the secretary to a department shall as soon as practicable after 30 June in each year prepare and furnish to the Minister administering the department a report on the operation of the department during the year that ended 30 June. I am pleased that the Government has not seriously contemplated removing that provision because that would be gross and totally contrary to government policy. However, one goes to the substance of the amendment. I am now told the position-very late in the piece, I would add, having had absolutely no discussions with the appropriate Minister in another place because at no stage has he ever wanted to talk to me about these matters.",44
57,Mr YOUNG,PUBLIC SERVICE AND STATUTORY,He did.,45
58,Mr CONNOLLY,PUBLIC SERVICE AND STATUTORY,"I am sorry, but I have had no discussions with the Minister at any stage since I have taken over responsibility on these matters. The point is that the Government apparently has in place a number of reforms that we will have to examine in due course on their merits. I hope that they are satisfactory, though I doubt many of them will be. The point is that I am unaware of those reforms because nobody has ever bothered to discuss the matter with me. In light of that, and with the support of the Australian Democrats, we have gone ahead and put in place a set of amendments which are essentially based on the Carrick provisions contained in the existing guidelines. There are no regulations in this chamber relating to annual reports. There is only a set of guidelines which I understand are currently being reviewed. The proposal contained in our amendments, supported in another place by the Democrats as well as by the Opposition parties, simply requires that, among other things, revenue arid expenditure of departments, including expenditure and revenue arising from trading activities or cost recovery activities during the year be reported upon in a form giving a true and fair impression of the activities of that department. In other words, it is just not good enough to say one prepares estimates of expenditure and puts forward supplementary documentation in terms of the Budget debate, but rather that in the annual report there should be a statement at the back-a comparative document which people could read and understand-as to where the funds which have been allocated by the Parliament to that department are going. It is not just a document for the Parliament. It is supposed to be a document for the community to be able to read andÂ· understand. In addition, we recommended the implementation and operation of industrial democracy plans in departments should be contained. That is not very profound. Again, it is Labor Party policy. I find difficulty in understanding why the Government is now asking for that to be removed. We went on to suggest that the number of officers in each classification employed in departments during the year should be noted. The argument is that there are too many classifications, and it is all too hard. One of the weaknesses in public administration in this countryand I am sure that the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) will agree with me-is that for too long the Parliament has allowed itself to be confused by a bureaucratic tendency to give out as little information as possible. In view of the other amendments contained in this Bill relating to those new four or five categories of non-permanent officers, there is a very good reason why the Parliament should know whether departments are building up an unfair or unreasonable balance between career officers and noncareer officers within the department. If one is to wait on the Public Service Board to come up with the evidence, one might wait for a long time. Under new arrangements introduced by this Government it is the Department of Finance that now controls personnel budgeting, not the Public Service Board. Essentially, it is up to departments which are supposed to have a degree of independence to be able to put in their annual reports this essential information which is relevant to the manner in which they have conducted their activities. In addition there is another provision that seeks to find out under what conditions people who were previously employed by departments have been dismissed. Again, that is not unreasonable because the record in recent years, if one accepts a Public Service Board report, is extraordinary. I think that last year three people were dismissed from the Public Service for either inefficiency or other somewhat gross activities.",45
59,Mr YOUNG,PUBLIC SERVICE AND STATUTORY,Three?,45
60,Mr CONNOLLY,PUBLIC SERVICE AND STATUTORY,"Yes, three. It is incredible. I think that we need to know on a departmental basis precisely how management handles its personnel structure. In addition, we have suggested that the number of persons engaged by secretaries as consultants during the year be reported upon, and that their qualifications and experience and the purpose for which they are engaged be mentioned. The only argument against that I have heard is that nobody can define what a consultant is. All I can say is that that is rather odd. I am sure that with the enormous amount of brainpower in the Public Service Board and elsewhere, it is possible to define what a consultant ought to be. If one cannot define what a consultant ought to be, why on earth are we arguing about these four categories which are now going into legislation in this Bill? One of those categories is meant to cover the question of consultants. Because of the time restraints I do not want to hold up the chamber, but if the chamber wishes to divide on this-it is our intention to do so-I want it to be quite clearly understood that we are prepared to discuss these issues if the Minister wishes to make the time available to me. But at this stage I see no case which has been adequately presented as to why the original provisions in this amendment should not be carried by the chamber as they were in the other place. After all, the objective is to give the electorate and the community at large more information as to the stewardship of departmental management. Amendments agreed to. Bill reported, with amendments; report-by leave-adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Young)-by leaveread a thirdÂ· time. .",45

AUSTRALIA: ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT",46
66,Mr LINDSAY,CONTEMPT OF COURT,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is it correct that a leading New York firm of analysts has upgraded its economic assessment of Australia?,46
67,Mr HAWKE,CONTEMPT OF COURT,"I thank the honourable member for his perceptive and relevant question. As the leadership of the Opposition is involved in the analysis that has been undertaken by this overseas firm, it is appropriate that I should refer to the fact that this Leader of the Opposition has fast acquired a reputation for doing nothing more than trying to talk his country down. This is not new; it goes l?ack to the time of the election campaign in February of 1983. I remind members of this House that on 10 February 1983, in invoking international judgments about this country, Mr Howard had this to say: I believe that if theythe Australian Labor Party's economic policiesare implemented in Australia our international economic reputation will be affected and, so far from instilling that private sector business confidence which in theory everybody agrees is necessary, I believe it would have the opposite effect. That is the bloke who is now the Leader of the Opposition, speaking in February of 1983. He was saying that there was going to be an international judgment about Australia if this great Party's economic policies were applied. Of course, he was wrong in February 1983 because with the implementation of our economic policies we gradually pulled this country out of the ecogive nomic morass into which his mismanagement placed it. But of course he was not satisfied with that. Having been wrong in February of he continued to try to talk down the economy of this country. At the beginning of 1984 Economic growth will peter out by the end of 1984. again! We are now in 1985, and still he has done nothing but be the whingeing Johnny of the Australian political scene. He has got to the pathetic stage now where, in an interview of with Steketee of the Sydney Morning Herald, as he is on all sides by those who are seeking to dethrone him, he actually says: 'Look, my leadership will be saved by an economic recession next year'. Whingeing Johnny Howard is trying to talk his country down. I am here to tell whingeing Johnny Howard that he will not get his hoped for recession. It is true that the New York risk analysis firm of Frost and Sullivan yesterday upgraded its investment rating of Australia. The firm gives Australia the highest possible rating when assessing the risk facing people transferring money into a country. Australia has been upgraded from B to AI since the last report in December 1984, putting it alongside the United States, Hong Kong and Holland in the 85 countries surveyed. Australia's rating as a political risk for direct investors and as a reliable customer for United States exporters has also risen. It is interesting to note that the Leader of the Opposition gets a mention but, as one would imagine, not a very honourable mention. The report notes: The economy is growing at a modest rate and the Opposition lacks strong leadership. Right again! The firm's director of research, Dr Coplin, is quoted as saying-Mr SiDclair- Why don't you make a statement? Standing Orders say you cannot read your speeches. You can't give an answer without reading. You shouldn't have to read it at all.",46
68,Mr HAWKE,CONTEMPT OF COURT,"One can understand why honourable members opposite do not want to hear it. They do not like it at all, and it is not surprising. But this is what he had to say-",47
69,Mr SPEAKER,CONTEMPT OF COURT,Order! I suggest that the Prime Minister wait for a moment. I realise that everybody is rather tired this afternoon.,47
70,Mr HAWKE,CONTEMPT OF COURT,"We might as well wait, because they never use Question Time at any rate. He had this to say: There was a fear that the Labor Party would be inflationary, nationalistic and restrictive towards business. It is pretty clear now that Hawke and the Labor Government are fairly positive towards international business. I have to overcome my modesty to say that he went on: We also think he is a competent leader. The report concluded: We see Australia as a low risk country. The facts are simple, and they are clear: The international community is making the same judgment about this country as the Australian people are making about it, and that is that this is a good government faced by an Opposition which is without principles, without policies and without leadership and which increasingly is becoming a pathetic irrelevancy. NA",47
71,Mr IAN CAMERON,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION,"I direct a question to the Attorney-General's assistant, whoever that may be. Is it a fact, as reported in the Press, that the Government intends to amend the Bill of Rights Bill in the Senate and infringe States' rights to attempt to enforce Federal laws on State redistributions? If so, will the Senate be included in the Government's desire for one vote one value, as a senator in New South Wales requires 281,000 votes, in Queensland 176,000 votes and in Tasmania only 20,000 votes?",47

73,Mr KENT,FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the explosion of a 50kiloton yield nuclear device on Mururoa Atoll yesterday? Is he aware that this is the largest but not the only explosion since May? Has the Minister seen the map in the latest French Embassy information bulletin which shows Mururoa Atoll as standing in the middle of nowhere, completely disregarding the existence of almost every South Pacific island and nation?",47
74,Mr SPEAKER,FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTS,Order! The honourable member should come to the point of his question.,47
75,Mr KENT,FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTS,"'--Does the Minister agree with me that if nuclear tests are as safe as the French want us to believe, they should carry them out under the Eiffel Tower?",47
76,Mr HAYDEN,FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTS,"I am aware that there have been two recent tests, the most recent of 50 kilotons. I am also aware that there has been an estimated aggregate yield of about 250 kilotons in the course of this year. What must be recognised is that it is reasonable to assume that there is a finite limit to the punishment Mururoa Atoll can absorb. For this reason alone, France should conduct its tests on its home territory and not ask others to assume this risk. This is particularly so if, as the French claim, the tests are conducted in absolutely safe conditions. Office of National Assessments technical assessments show that the geological strata in parts of France are such that the tests could ee conducted there. It is wrong, as the French have claimed on some occasions, that a scientific assessment of Mururoa Atoll in 1983 established that the testing program was not damaging to the environment. In fact, the study did not give those tests a long term environmental bill of health. The Economist magazine, scarcely a radical publication, in October wrote that the French only bred distrust when they ignored the critical parts of the report of these scientists dicated them completely. In respect of the other part of the question the honourable member asked, I think it would be unfortunate if it were decided, if I can say with good humour, to - est a nuclear weapon under the Eiffel Tower. I believe 1989 is the centenary of the construction of the Eiffel Tower. While I am not aware of the purpose for which the map to which the honourable member referred was drafted, what is more important are the boundaries of the nUclear free zone of the South Pacific, the subject of a treaty which was concluded at the last meeting of the South Pacific Forum countries; The program was initiated, sustained and brought to a successful conclusion by the energies and the commitment of the Prime Minister, and we look forward to that treaty being signed and ratified by member countries of this region and hope that the nuclear powers become depositories to the treaty. FORWARD ESTIMATES: PRIMARY NA",47
77,Mr IAN ROBINSON,INDUSTRY,"I direct a question to the Minister for Primary Industry. Do the Forward Estimates released by the Department of Finance show a cut in funding to the Primary Industry portfolio next financial year of 12.7 cent? What functions of the Department of Primary Industry will be cut back to achieve this result? Has the Government already decided that fertiliser payments will be reduced or abolished during the 1986-87 financial year, despite the tabling only yesterday of the Industries Assistance Commission report on fertilisers?",48
78,Mr KERIN,INDUSTRY,"The publication of Forward Estimates by the Department of Finance and the general approach of this Government to Budgetmaking should not be confused by trying to make deductions such as the honourable member has made. The decision by the Government on the lAC report on fertilisers will be considered by the Government at the appropriate time. I point out that that item appears under the portfolio of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. So even that conclusion is based on total factual error and a large degree of ignorance, and that part of the question is hardly worth an answer. NA",48
79,Mr CHARLES,DISCLOSURE OF PUBLIC FUNDING,My question is directed to the Special Minister of State. It concerns the question of public funding. I ask: Are all gifts under the Act governing public funding liable to and claimed it vinpublic disclosure?,48
80,Mr YOUNG,DISCLOSURE OF PUBLIC FUNDING,"No, not all gifts are to be made public. Section 304 (5) (a) (i) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act provides that a gift to a so party made on the condition that it be used for a purpose other than a purpose related to a Commonwealth election is exempt from all the disclosure requirements provided the party 'has used, or will use, the gift accordingly'. All parties have been advised by the Australian Electoral Commission via its handbook and other means, such as telephone calls and discussions, over the past 20 months or so that only those gifts specifically designated by the donor for a non-Commonwealth election purpose are exempt from the disclosure requirements. This matter has been raised with me. I have not had the document authenticated, but someone is purporting to use the name of the Leader of the Opposition in sending out a letter. It is headed 'John Howard, Leader of the Opposition, House of Representatives, Parliament, House'. I do not know whether it is from him but I want to refer to what is in it to see whether-",48
81,Mr HODGMAN,DISCLOSURE OF PUBLIC FUNDING,If it is not authenticated you shouldn't.,48
82,Mr YOUNG,DISCLOSURE OF PUBLIC FUNDING,"I want to see whether it is not important to authenticate it. It is important to per point out to the House whether the information given in this letter is accurate according to the Act, and I will do that for honourable members. It is an appeal letter which purports to go out from the Liberal Party in Melbourne to, I suppose, business people and others who might be interested in supporting the Party. Labor members of parliament have received it. The last page is headed 'The Liberal Party of Australia, Victorian Division, Challenge Fund, ,Robert Menzies House, 104 Exhibition Street, Melbourne 3000'. It goes through a whole range of things. It says the Party needs some support because, according to the person who signed this letter, it is opposed to the capital gains tax and has a commitment, as soon as Mr Howard becomes Prime Minister, to repeal it. It should be well entrenched by then. I do not think the next generation of Australians will be that worried about it. The letter goes on to say: But there is one ingredient needed to avoid thisyour support now and whenever appropriate, until the electors make their decision. The nation will suffer if the Liberal Party is ill prepared to mount a strong election challenge. That's why I've enclosed a Liberal Challenge Fund contribution slip, and that's why I'm now asking for an investment in the future in the form of a gift to this fund of $30, $\00 or more if you can. I realise . . . the time may not be intirely suitable to ask for your contribution. I take it from the Leader of the Opposition that he knows something about it. I suggest to him that it might not be the most appropriate time. What I would do if I were he and sending out a letter like this would be to wait until July 1987, when those people who are paying 60c in the dollar now will get their massive tax cuts, bringing their payments down to 48c in the dollar, and those paying 46c in the dollar will have their payments reduced to 40c in the dollar. There will be a lot more money in the community for political donations. He goes on: But there's no other way the Liberal Party can mount a strong campaign, other than with your generous support. There is a bit of 'mirror, mirror on the wall' on the back page: To help the Liberal Party gauge public attitude in the area of taxation and industrial relations could you please answer these two questions . . . (I) Should the Liberal Party toughen further its stance on militant trade unions? Mirror, mirror on the wall. The second question is: Will the introduction of the Labor Government's Capital Gains Tax affect you and your family? At least it explains why the coalition has no policies; it is waiting for an answer to its campaign letter. As soon as it gets in it will be able to say: 'Well, 4,000 voted yes and 2,500 voted no'. The important feature of the answer is that alongside where people were to put their name, their company address and so forth and the amount of the donation, it says: Gifts to the Liberal Party Challenge Fund will not be subject to the disclosure requirements of either Federal or State legislation. According to information I have received from the Australian Electoral Commission: The appeal letter and the contribution slip in question do not, in the Commission's view, satisfy the requirements for exemption from disclosure under sectionI referred to it earlierThe purpose of the Liberal Challenge Fund appears to be to mount an electoral challenge . . . at the Commonwealth and State levels. Therefore, any gifts forwarded to the party in response to this appeal are, in the Commission's view, disclosable contrary to the advice given to potential donors on the contribution slip. NA",48
83,Mr NA BROWN,SUPERANNUATION,"Talking about other people's correspondence, I ask the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations whether he has seen the telex from Mr Hodgson, the Federal Secretary of the Transport Workers Union of Australia, which says with respect to superannuation that the union will implement immediate action against those companies which do not finalise an agreement in writing to participate in the fund by 13 December 1985. Will the Minister give the clearest possible condemnation of that sort of industrial blackmail? Will he now concede that the prices and incomes accord was expressed to give an open invitation to any union, especially the Transport Workers Union, to bludgeon its way to a successful superannuation deal?",49
84,Mr WILLIS,SUPERANNUATION,"Yes, I have seen the correspondence to which the honourable member referred. The fact is that the Transport Workers Union has been made well aware of the Government's view of this matter. Some two weeks ago it was told quite clearly by me that the Government could not support industrial action in respect of a superannuation scheme and would not support any superannuation scheme coming into existence prior to the conclusion of the productivity case and not in accordance with that productivity case unless there were special and isolated circumstances, and any such circumstances would have to have regard to the national wage fixing principles, particularly principle 11 which refers to negligible cost. Those elements have been known by the Transport Workers Union for some time. The situation is that that union has been having some consultations with companies. Today I met with the Australian Road Transport Federation. I understand that the position of the companies is in line with that of the Government; that is, they will await the special and isolated circumstances clarification from the union. When they receive that they will be able to make some decision about how they view the claim. That is also the position of the Government at this stage. In regard to the latter part of the honourable member's question, let me say that the prices and incomes accord in no way opens the door for the kind of action which he put forward in his question. It most certainly does not give an invitation to industrial action. The Prime Minister and I made it quite clear yesterday that the Government does not support industrial action in regard to superannuation; there is no need for such industrial action. The fact is that has been agreed by the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions as to how superannuation should be extended in the community. That strategy involves a productivity case and arguing in that productivity case for a particular outcome and for that outcome to be taken in the way of superannuation-both extension and improvement. That is an agreed position to which we are committed and which we will pursue. It is a very responsible position. It is in no way economically irresponsible. It means that the distribution of productivity gains to employees, which has not occurred for some years, will occur in a way which will be taken by way of superannuation and extended over a two-year period. The implementation of that productivity case outcome over a two-year period would be absolutely unique in the annals of arbitration in this country. At the same time to rope in the superannuation area, which has always run quite free of wages policy in this country, is also a major achievement in terms of wages policy and economic control in this country. Those matters should be thoroughly understood by those people who are being critical at present. The Government is gaining control of a major on-cost which, under the previous Government, was in no way controlled and operated totaIly outside of wages policy. I. should say to the House that during the penod of the Fraser Government not only did we see an explosion of wages at various times parti-ularly in 1982 when there was a 17 pe; cent Increase, but also we saw a continual expansion of superannuation with the proportion of the work force which received superannuation moving from 32 per cent to 45 per cent. An addi-ional 800,000 employees received superannuatIOn. That occurred totally outside any form of wages policy. That type of thing is coming to an end. Wages policy is going to encompass supe-annuation in a way which is totally economically responsible and which will mean that the distribution of productivity gains to employees occurs in that way instead of by way of a wage increase. That is a thoroughly commendable outcome and demonstrates, once again, the great importance to this nation of the prices and incomes accord. NA  vise the House whether a biosynthetic human growth hormone is being developed in Australia? Can he advise when it will be available and will it be significantly cheaper than the product cura strategy rently being imported from Sweden?",49
85,Dr BLEWETT,HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE,"Since difficulties arose with natural human growth hormone at the beginning of this year, the Government has sought both a replacement from overseas and the development of a substitute here in Australia. As I informed the House some three weeks ago, the Government has achieved access to a biosynthetic substitute from Sweden which will be made available next month to those in the program. However, as I pointed out to the House, that biosynthetic substitute costs about 10 times as much as the natural growth hormone. Therefore, we are very interested in developing an Australian substitute. I am not able to be precise at this moment, but we hope that an Australian substitute will be available during 1986 at a considerably cheaper cost. NA",50
86,Mr MILES,PROCESSED VEGETABLES,"I direct my question to the Minister for Primary Industry. In view of the severe overseas competition experienced by the vegetable processors and farmers of northern Tasmania who produce approximately 70 per cent of Australia's processed vegetables, what steps are being taken to limit export advantages by New Zealand in line with the normal understanding of a free trade agreement? When will these steps be taken? Will these steps be taken in time to prevent an efficient industry being undermined by one heavily subsidised from another country?",50
87,Mr KERIN,PROCESSED VEGETABLES,"I did not quite hear part of the honourable gentlemen's question. I understand he was referring to the closer economic relations agreement which this Government negotiated. The differences between our two countries in terms of that agreement relate to getting a neutral position with respect to protection and subsidisation. The things that we cannot take into account are relative exchange rate variations. That was never in the agreement and it is impossible, of course, to put it into any movement to free trade. This Government takes the view that we cannot very well lecture the world, as did the previous Government, about the evils of protection and subsidisation and what that does to agricultural trade, yet at the same time not come to an accommodation with New Zealand on fair, unsubsidised trade between the two countries. We are trying to get between our two countries a basis whereby any subsidisation, any assistance for identical industries, is phased out on the same level, the same rate. In cases where real problems are growing up with respect to industries on both sides of the Tasman, this Government has found, as did the previous Government-it put in place the joint arrangement on dairy products-that industry consultations are a far better way to try to solve the problem. At present the exchange rate variation between our two countries is very favouris able to us. One of the big problems, of course, is that there is identical ownership of firms both sides of the Tasman, and this poses real problems. In respect of vegetables, particularly in regard to the firm of Watties and the amount of money that it is expending at present by of export promotion, the Minister for Trade and I took up that matter with the New Zealand ministerial delegation when it was here recently. The Ministers said that they would give it attenAustralian tion, as they would the other element that causing trouble-that is, export-import licensing, the so-called EALs, which are exclusive lian licences. The Minister for Trade and I are giving both those matters the closest attention. But I think many of the problems are purely commercial and purely in terms of comparative advantage rather than subsidisation. SOUTH AUSTRALIA: COUNTRY NA",50

99,Unknown,DOCTORS,Opposition members interjecting,51
100,Dr BLEWETT,DOCTORS,"Mr Speaker, the Opposition obviously sensitive about such a question. In ' answer to the honourable member, in the most on unlikely event of Mr Olsen having to honour this promise-as is the case in regard to most of his other promises-the doctors would have to be paid from the South Australian public purse. way If Mr Olsen wished to spend this money, he would be free to do so. If he wanted to give a windfall income gain to country doctors, he would have to pay for it out of the South public purse. My own view would be is that this amount of money could be spent much more wisely and sensibly on other South AustraAustralian health services. The responsibility for paying doctors for services delivered to public patients in public hospitals has always been a State responsibility. Varying States have paid varying fees for those services. However, for many years, all States have discounted the schedule fee for the obvious reason that all of the doctors' supporting services provided in the hospital are paid for already by by the taxpayer. For example, the public hospital does the billing and accounting procedures. For all those reasons, every State has discounted the schedule fee in its payment to hospital doctors. would I also point out that the offer made by Dr Cornwall, the present, and no doubt the continuing, Minister for Health in South Australia, to pay 90 per cent of the schedule fee, is the most offer made by any State government to hospital doctors in any State in Australia.

In view of the appalling experience which many elderly Australians have had with the curtilage provisions of the iniquitous assets test, will the Treasurer inform the House what is the area of curtilage which the Government defines as reasonable for the purpose of exempting a taxpayer's 'principal residence and reasoncurtilage' from the application of the capital gains tax, as stated on page 10 of the Treasurer's statement on the reform of the Australian taxasystem'? If it has not yet been defined, when will the Treasurer advise the people of Australia on this important, indeed vital, detail of his package?",51
103,Mr KEATING,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,"The honourable member asked when these details will be announced. They will be announced in due time when the Government brings in the legislation for the capital gains tax, which will be next year. It may well suit the Government to provide some of the details earlier, but if not, vided when the legislation is introduced. NA",52
104,Dr KLUGMAN,FEE FOR SERVICE MEDICAL SCHEME,"Has the Minister for Health seen the alleged statement by Professor Penington that a government funded fee for service medical scheme is likely to lead to a huge and unacceptable transfer of money from taxpayers to medical practitioner-?

Will he expedite moves to increase the proportion of medical services paid for by alternative methods, such as health maintenance organisations, salaries and sessional fees?",52
105,Dr BLEWETT,FEE FOR SERVICE MEDICAL SCHEME,"Professor Penington did me the courtesy of sending me a copy of his speech before he delivered it. I must say that I found his comments on acquired immune deficiency syndrome sensible, non-alarmist and cautionary. I have, of course, some disagreement with other parts of his speech. But the most important of those disagreements is with his suggestion that this Government may lack the strength to tackle overservicing by doctors. TOURISM PROMOTION: JAPAN",52
106,Mr JULL,FEE FOR SERVICE MEDICAL SCHEME,"The Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism will be aware that the Australian Tourist Commission's annual report shows that the biggest percentage increase in tourists coming to Australia is from Japan. While acknowledging the success of the Hogan campaign in the United States and the money involved, is it a fact that funds for tourism promotion in Japan have been reduced this year, despite this great potential? Has the Minister also stated that apart from funding problems, Australia does not have the accommodation to handle any more Japanese visitors, despite occupancy rates on the Gold Coast and in Cairns being at 60 per cent?

111,Mr JOHN BROWN,FEE FOR SERVICE MEDICAL SCHEME,"This is quite an important question; I would like to be able to answer it. The increase in tourism from Japan is exactly as the honourable member described it. That increase is despite several difficulties. Firstly, I refer to the difficulty in getting more aeroplane seats between Australia and Japan. I guess it is fair to note that the Minister for Aviation has approved some charter flights into Cairns by All Nippon Airways. Of course, there are difficulties in getting the Japanese Government to agree to increase flights to and from Japan. There are other inherent difficulties in coping with Japanese tourism and the expectations of Japanese tourists. I think probably it is realistic to relate the instance of the increase in Japanese tourism to Europe 20 years ago. When the Japanese started to go to Europe in large numbers they were disappointed to find that the accommodation was not up to scratch, there were difficulties in obtaining Japanese-speaking guides; in fact, there were all sorts of inherent difficulties that made life difficult for non-English speaking tourists. We are very concerned that as this increase in tourism from Japan continues-it has increased by 50 per cent this year-we will be able to cope with the expectations of these tourists. It is pleasing to note the huge increase in investment in Australia by Japanese interests in the provision of hotels. Of course, in Queensland we now have two hotels financed on the Gold Coast by Japanese interests. We now have three hotels in Sydney being financed by Japanese interests. All around Australia there are hotels being set up especially to cater for Japanese visitors. . As I understand the Iwasaki project on the Queensland coast at Yeppoon, it is to open in March. I had a visit from Mr Iwasaki this week. He has given me an unequivocal assurance that the first 100 rooms will open in March, and that the number will be increased as the year goes on. I would have liked to be able to tell the honourable member for Fadden that our proposed program of advertisements featuring Paul Hogan in Japan this year had gone ahead. However, we were advised not to advertise. It appears that although Hogan will be just as successful in Japan as he was in the United States the great increase in the number of Japanese who will want to come to Australia as a result of those advertisements will meim that those Japanese will have great difficulty in finding plane seats. This year there has been an increase of 83 per cent in the number of plane seats available on flights between Australia and Japan. However, it is still not enough to cope with the expectations of people who will. want to come. I think it is a fairly healthy comment on tourism in Australia that we have a market in Japan ready to exploit but are not yet able to do so. I hope that we can exploit that within the progress of the next h-o years. To answer the honourable member's original question, there will be a large i.ncrease in the funds available for the promotion of tourism from Japan; secondly, there will be more plane seats available and, by that time, the infrastructure will be in place in Australia to cope with those Japanese tourists to make their stay very enjoyable. Finally, I must mention that the presidents of the 14 largest Japanese travel agencies have been in Australia in the last month as guests of the Australian Tourist Commission. They have had a tour from Perth to Cairns. I had a meeting with them in Sydney. I must say they were absolutely delighted, first of all with the attitude expressed to them-not on any official basisby people working in hotels, restaurants and shops which they visited unofficially, in terms of welcoming Japanese visits. I think that is a manifestation of Australia's welcome towards Japanese. Fortunately, the xenophobia we had seems to have disappeared. They were welcomed with open arms. Those people went home very satisfied that in fact Australia is the coming destination for Japanese tourists. I can assure honourable members that we will be doing all we can to see that the huge market up there awaiting exploitation will in fact be treated in that way. NA",52
112,Ms MCHUGH,NELLA DAN,Can the Minister for Science inform the House on the progress that. the vessel Icebird is making to free the Nella Dim?,53
113,Mr BARRY JONES,NELLA DAN,"The latest information we have is of 12.30 today. The Nella Dan has been entrapped since 23 October-now 37 days. The Nella Dan has 67 crew and expeditioners on board. One Danish crew member died as 'a result of an accident on 20 October. The situation now is that the Icebird which, of course, is a much bigger ship, with much superior ice breaking capacity than the Nella Dan, is steaming in the direction of the Nella Dan at about half speed-at about seven nautical miles an hour. The Nella Dan has been trying to chip its way out of the ice and at one stage was proceeding at a rate of 100 metres a day. This was at a very heavy fuel cost. The Nella Dan is now 30 tonnes of fuel light on what it needs to get back. Therefore, it will be necessary to transfer fuel in very difficult seas from the lcebird to the Nella Dan. The Icebird is due to reach the lO-kilometre wide iceflow where the Nella Dan is trapped in Amundsen Bay some time tomorrow morning eastern summer time. The Icebird is currently 120 nautical miles north of Nella Dan's position. It is currently moving through the pack ice at about half speed, that is, at about 7 knots. At present the Nella Dan is stationary with its engines off to conserve fuel. There has been a blizzard there for the last 48 hours, with easterly winds. The winds have closed up the pack ice and Dr Knowles Kerry, the leader of the expedition, cannot see open water or leads from the ship. It will be necessary to use helicopters from Icebird in order to direct the Nella Dan. The Nella Dan is an amazing ship. We have had the Nella Dan for over 25 seasons. There is no question that in all the history of polar exploration the Nella Dan has the most amazing record. It has been a very worrying period. I am sure that honourable members would want me to pass on our relief and good wishes to Captain Aarne Sorenson and Dr Knowles Kerry, the leader of the expedition. NA NA",53
114,Mr WILLIS,INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,For the information of honourable members. I present the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations annual report for 1984-85. The report also incorporates the anual report of the National Director of the Commonwealth Employment Service. NA NA,53
115,Mr WILLIS,ORGANISATION INSTRUMENTS,"For the inrmation of honourable members. I present the xt of the following International Labour Organisation instruments, together with a text of a statement relating to these instruments: Convention 142, concerning vocational guidance and vocational training and the development of human resources; Convention 150, concerning labour administration, role functions and organisation; and recommendation 169, concerning employment policy. Motion (by Mr Young) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",54
116,Mr NA BROWN,ORGANISATION INSTRUMENTS," The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis) has tabled a statement in support of the ratification of the two International Labour Organisation conventions. The Minister spoke glowingly in his statement which he tabled today about Convention 150 which calls for what is referred to as a c070rdinated system of labour administration which is based on consultation, co-operation and negotiation between public authorities and the most representative organisations of employers and of workers. In the course of that he gives another hurrah for the prices and incomes accord. It is quite obvious from reading the statement and from looking at the history of the Government that so far as the prices and incomes accord is concerned both the Government and, in particular, the Minister know nothing about consultation, co-operation and negotiation on industrial matters. It is a complete sham to pretend that it is interested in any of this. What it is really inter- Brown, John ested in is not so much the consultation, cooperation and negotiation which the International Labour Organisation talks about, but what it is interested in really and what it actively promotes is to allow the trade union movement to manipulate events and bludgeon concessions out of employers to the long term detriment of this country. There can be no real negotiationand it is negotiation that the ILO conventions talk about-when the Government gives the game away by entering into the accord in the first place. It was, we say, an abandonment of all national responsibility for the Government to give away the September national wage case in advance, to give away the April 1986 national wage case in advance, and to give away the productivity case as in fact it has done. So, it is not interested in negotiations. It is interested in fixes and it is interested in rigging to get concessions for the unions which, frankly, this country cannot afÂ· ford. But we believe that its most shameful failure to live up to this lofty principle of negotiation, which is espoused by the International Labour Organisation and which is said to be promoted by the Minister today, is its disgraceful performance over superannuation which we have seen over the last few days. The Government, instead of setting up a framework for negotiation, which the ILO speaks of so far as superannuation is concerned, is setting up a framework for some new generation of Jimmy Hoffas who are going to get control over millions of dollars of assets in this country, millions of dollars of funds which workers themselves are entitled to and which will, of course, be used to advance the interests of the unions. In fact, the Government is allowing at least three things to happen. First, it is allowing and in fact encouraging some trade. unions to get their hands on millions of dollars. Motion (by Mr Young) put: That the question be now put. The House divided. (Mr SPEAKER - Hon. Harry Jenkins) Ayes 76 Noes 46 Majority 30 NA Baldwin. P. J. Jones, Barry Beazley. K. C. Keating, P. J.

I wish however to inform Honourable Members that in May 1984 the Government considered the Development Plan for the Parliamentary Zone and decided that it provided a suitable basis for submission to the relevant Parliamentary Committees for approval of proposals for the Mall, Watergate and lake foreshore, access roads and lighting under the Parliament Act 1974 and the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910. As appropriate opportunities arise the Mall area has been considered as a suitable location for buildings of national or governmental significance having appropriate architectural merit. The Development Plan has been refined and further developed by the NCDC to incorporate the proposed national Archive and Exposition, various Bicentennial commemoration proposals and associated roadworks. The NCDC will shortly be bringing forward a revised Development Plan for the Parliamentary Zone for the Government's consideration as a prelude to submission to the relevant Parliamentary Committees for their consideration and report to the Parliament. Arrangements will also be made to ensure that, as the Joint Committee on the ACT has requested, all Members and Senators have an opportunity to examine the proposals.

138,Dr BLEWETT,MEDICARE BENEFITS REVIEW,For the information of honourable members. I present the first report of the Medicare Benefits Review Committee. I seek leave of the House to make a brief statement. Leave granted.,58
139,Dr BLEWETT,MEDICARE BENEFITS REVIEW,"Honourable members will recall that on 13 July 1984 I announced the establishment of the Medicare Benefits Review Committee, chaired by Her Honour Judge Robyn Layton. The Committee also included Dr David Formby and Dr George Repin representing the Australian Medical Association, Dr Brian Shea representing the States and Territories and Dr Ron Wells and Dr John Donovan who shared representation from the Commonwealth Department of Health. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Committee for the considerable time spent and diligence displayed in preparing this comprehensive report. The first report of the Review Committee addresses item 2 of the terms of reference and deals with matters relating to the content, format, and structure of the medical benefits schedule. The report was submitted to me by the Chairperson of the Committee, Judge Layton, on November 7 this year, with a request that it be tabled and distributed as soon as possible. I have accepted this suggestion as many recommendations of the Committee are of importance to the general community and the medical profession. The full recommendations of the Medicare Benefits Review Committee will be considered by the Government following the receipt of the Committee's second report, which is expected to be finalised in the first half of 1986. Many of the 67 recommendations contained in this report have significant financial implications, which will require consideration in the 1986 Budget process. This will have to take account of the continuing need for reasonable restraint in government expenditures. To this end the implementation of some recommendations outlined in the report is likely to be dependent on other offsetting reductions in medical benefits expenditure. However, I can indicate to the House that those recommendations concerned with improving and streamlining administrative procedures will receive a high priority. For example, recommendations 14, 15, 16 and 17 deal with the system of referral of patients to medical specialists. The early implementation of these recommendations will benefit both patients and medical practitioners. Recommendation 26 concerning financial assistance to rural Australians for travel and accommodation costs incurred while seeking in-vitro fertilisation treatment at IVF centres in capital cities has already been implemented by my department. Financial assistance is currently provided to patients in these circumstances through the isolated patients travel and accommodation assistance scheme IPTAAS. I am also sympathic to the recommendations of the Committee on improving the format and structure of the medical benefits schedule book. My department is engaging a printing consultant to advise on these recommendations. The Medicare Benefits Review Committee is now proceeding with its second report which addresses item I of the terms of reference, that is, consideration of the extension of the Medicare arrangements to provide benefits for certain paramedical services. Following receipt of that report, the Government will be in a position to consider in detail the total package' of recommendations. I commend the first report of the Medicare Benefits Review Committee to honourable members.  ister for Health (Dr Blewett) said. that the Medicare Benefits Review Committee was set up in July 1984. The Minister had hoped that he would get a report from the Committee which would give him some justificatiQn to cut funding for medical benefits. The report in fact does not provide him with that support. Rather, it proposes a number of changes to the structure of the medical benefits schedule which, according to the Minister, will have significant financial implications. As a result of the Government's policy to encourage universal bulk billing, there has been an explosion in the cost of health care delivery in this country and, in particular, in medical benefits. The Budget indicates that this year medical benefits expenditure will increase by over 11 per cent and will involve an expenditure of some $2,250m. The forward estimates indicate that next year the rate of growth in expenditure will increase further to 14.8 per cent. The increase this September quarter compared with the previous September quarter was 16 per cent. So we can see that the rate of growth of expenditure on medical benefits has been very great under this Government's Medicare package. The very great degree of growth in medical benefits expenditure has meant that the Government has had to cut expenditure in other areas. It has had to cut public hospital funding to the great disadvantage of all of those who are now reliant on Medicare and have to join a queue to get into public hospitals. The Opposition is concerned about the way in which the Government will implement the propositions contained in the report. The Government is concerned about the significant financial implications of the report. The Minister said that the Government would have to take account of the continuing need for reasonable restraint in government expenditure. He went on to say that the Government will be looking at other offsetting reductions in medical benefits expenditure. Only this weekend members of the Press started to pick up the Government's concern, based on the forward estimates, about the growingexpenditure on medical benefits. It was suggested at the weekend that the Government may well reconsider the option which was presented by Senator Walsh in the lead up to this year's Budget-that is, a reduction in the 85 per cent payment for items on the medical benefits schedule. In other words, it was suggested that there be a further reduction by the Government in payments for services rendered by doctors from 85 per cent to Senator Walsh's proposal of, I think, 75 per cent. It is quite clear that that is one of the issues that are now under consideration by the Minister for Health, and that is of real concern to us, the medical profession and Australians generally. At Question Time today we heard about the concern that is being expressed by South Australian country doctors who are very worried about the cuts they have suffered in their salaries as a result of Medicare. They now have to take 85 per cent of the cost of items on the medical benefits, schedule instead of 100 per cent which they used to get. This has happened bel;ause people have given up private insurance as they were encouraged to do by the Minister for Health under his Medicare arrangements. Dr Blewett now comes into this place and says: 'Why should they not take a 15 per cent cut in their salaries? We expect them to do so under Medicare and if John Olsen, the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, is going to reimburse them for that cut In their salaries, he should not come to the Fede91l Government for the money to pay for that reimbursement.' This is a classical example of the Minister's socialist ideas. He believes that people such as doctors ought to take cuts in salaries for doing the work that they have always undertaken. He sees no reason why they should not have a cut in salary. In fact, he would prefer that they l;>e employed by the Government on a salary. Obviously the continuing growth in medical benefits expenditure is of concern to the Govern- Medicare. ment which is going to look at ways in which that expenditure can be reduced. The Opposition, the Australian public and especially, of course, ti}e medical profession, believe that an 85 per cent cut in the reimbursement rate is totally unreasonable if the Government is going to maintain Medicare and not allow people to take out gap insurance. Such an arrangement will not be acceptable to the Australian community or the Opposition. The Government has to look at alternatives to the current Medicare arrangements. We will get a satisfactory health delivery system in this country only if a fundamental review of Medicare is undertaken. It is quite clear that the hospital system is on the verge of collapse. There is now more industrial strife in the hospital system and amongst the medical profession than there ever has been. Nurses are on strike and are resigning. Medical practitioners in New South Wales are threatening to once again withdraw their services. All of this has occurred as a result of Medicare; there is no other cause for the problems within the health profession at the moment. Those problems will continue and in fact will grow unless fundamental changes are made to Medicare. The people being disadvantaged by these problems are those seeking medical attention, especially welfare recipients, pensioners and others who cannot get into public hospital beds because of the queues that are being generated under Medicare. In view of time constraints, I will draw my speech to a conclusion. However, a number of very serious concerns have been raised by the report of a committee appointed by the Minister himself. Page 221 of the report points up the inconsistencies of the approach by the Government and the Minister to the medical benefits schedule. The report states: The committee considers that the Government leaves itself open to accusations that its policy on Medicare benefit payments lacks consistency. It certainly does lack consistency. The Minister has been totally inconsistent in the application of the medical benefits schedule and the extension of the schedule to a number of medical benefits items. However, I will not go into detail on that. I highlight the fact that the report criticises the Minister's carriage of his portfolio. It is a matter of real concern to the Opposition that this Government is not implementing a policy which ensures the provision of adequate health services to all Australians. We believe that there should be fundamental changes to NA",58
140,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Taxation: Private Health Insurance To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Humble Petition of the undersigned Citizens of Australia respectfully sayeth: That we the undersigned are totally opposed to any taxation change which involves a tax on Health Fund contributions, health charges or benefits; That we are already required to pay a I percent levy to partly finance the Medicare scheme and that we would regard any further taxation of our health insurance arrangements as unfair and unreasonable; That therefore we urge the Government to ensure that there is no taxation on illness and no special taxation on those who seek to insure themselves against the cost of 'private health care. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Ewen Cameron, Mr Dobie, Mr Ruddock and Mr Shipton. Petitions received. National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Humble Petition of the undersigned Citizens of Australia showeth that whereas: 1. They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag. 2. They are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely: (a) The Union Jack, itself the creation of three Christian Crosses, represents the Nationa's historical origin and the source of its language and law; (b) The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its geographical location on this planet Earth; (c) The large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901. 3. They know the Flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war. 4. They recall that millions of native-born Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism. 5. They are certain that any change to the Flag will produce division in the Australian community. Your petitioners therefore pray that your honourable House will: Propose and pass a motion that ""the existing Australian National Flag be changed only with the approval of the Nation as expressed in a Referendum"". And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Ewen Cameron, Mr Hawker and Mr Shipton. Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: 1. THAT the overwhelming majority of Australians are completely satisfied with the existing Australian National Flag. 2. THAT we are totally opposed to any change in the Australian National /lag as provided in Section (3) of the Flags Act, unless such proposed change is first voted on by the people of Australia and passed by a majority of voters in a majority of States. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Fife. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the Australian /lag symbolises the continuity between Australia's past, its present and the future; That the presence of the Union Jack on the /lag represents not subservience to Britain, but a reminder of our inheritance of the fruits of hundreds of years of struggle for individual liberty against the forces of tyranny and oppression; Nonetheless recognises the rights of Australians should they wish as a people to change the design of their /lag. Your petitioners humbly pray that no change be made to the Australian /lag except with the consent of the people in a referendum. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Ruddock. Petition received. Taxation: Small Businesses To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: Introduction of any additional capital gains taxes, wealth taxes or death duties is opposed on the grounds that: they adversely affect the small and medium size businesses in Australia, destroying incentive and discouraging investment in this important area of the economy; the Australian economy, and employment in particular, is heavily reliant on growth in small businesses; any capital gains that might result when owners of small businesses finally sell the business are not ""windfall gains"" but the result of many hard years of work and sacrifice, with very little being taken out of the business by way of salaries so that the maximum amount of money can be ploughed back into the business to create growth and jobs; the owners of small businesses often depend on a National Flag capital gain-which are simply deferred salarieswhen they eventually sell their business to sustain them in retirement; Your Petitioners request that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, will protect the rights of private enterprise and reject any inequitable additionaltaxes. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Cadman and Mr Ewen Cameron. Petitions received. Discrimination against Women To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled: The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That whereas the Commonwealth of Australia ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of National Flag Discrimination against Women in 1983, the Government of Victoria is passing the Planning (Brothels) Act 1984 is in breach of Article 6 of the Convention which says that ""States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women"". That the Victorian Planning (Brothels) Act 1984 provides legal authority to brothel operators to traffic in and exploit the prostitution of women and to live off the earnings of prostitutes. That whereas the Federal Minister for Health has counselled citizens to shun promiscuity (The Australian 26.1.85) because of the serious and sometimes fatal health hazards, the operations of legalised brothels encourages promiscuity and the spread of diseases, including AIDS. Your petitioners therefore pray: That the Government of Australia having ratified the UN Convention on Women remain consistent in its obligations to uphold the Articles of the Convention and request the Victorian Government to immediately repeal the Planning (Brothels) Act 1984. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Halverson and Mr Hawker. Petitions received. International Year for Repairing the Earth To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.

Propose to the United Nations General Assembly that 1989 be declared INTERNATIONAL YEAR FOR REPAIRING THE EARTH. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Miles and Mr Tickner. Petitions received. International Year for Repairing the Earth To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of concerned Australian citizens respectfully points out: That, for our survival, an effective World peace Initiative needs to established which will work towards mutual understanding, world disarmament, economic well-being for all and full employment. This Initiative will help to ensure a sustainable society conserving natural resources, and revitalising soils essential for growing a plentiful and healthy food supply and tree cover.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Blunt. Petition received. Identity Cards To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Petition of the undersigned shows: That the proposed introduction of compulsory identification (ID) cards should be reconsidered and rejected because the system: (a) is not a cost-effective method of reducing tax evasion and social security fraud and, to the contrary, in the form proposed will facilitate such for use in revitalising evasion and fraud; (b) will constitute an unwarranted infringement of individual privacy by the aggregation of a wide variety of personal information of a private nature; (c) will cause a further large and costly growth in the bureaucracy and burden on the taxpayer; and (d) cannot be guaranteed against misuse for purposes other than for which their introduction is stated to be intended and in fact provide the opportunity for blackmail and other forms of misuse. And your petitioners humbly pray that the problems which identification cards are intended to reduce should be attacked by other, more effective and less obnoxious methods. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Burr. Petition received. Technical and Further Education Participation and Equity Program To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the Technical and Further Education Participation and Equity Programme established as the centrepiece for national youth policy, addresses the educational, social and employment needs of twenty-two thousand unemployed Australian youth. The intended 50% funding cuts will directly affect at least ten thousand already disadvantaged young people, denying them access to further education and potential employment. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: (I) That the decisiol]. to cut the Participation and Equity Programme funding be reversed. (2) That the Participation and Equity Programme be guaranteed funding for 1987, and beyond. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Drummond. Petition received.

The proposed consumption tax could lead to a further rise of """"c. per litre; and 4. The high cost of petrol discriminates against country residents who rely on their cars for essential communication and transport. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government honour the commitment given by the Prime Minister during the 1983 election campaign to reduce petrol prices by 3c. per litre. Further we strongly urge the Government to adopt a petrol pricing policy which does not cause unnecessary rises in the cost of petro\. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Hawker. Petition received.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That in the light of the Labor Government's failure to act to correct the many anomalies in the Assets Test on pensions brought to its notice, the Labor Government's legislation should be repealed before it has an unduly unfair impact on pensioners.

Whereas opinion polls and statements of representative groups, Members of Parliament and respected individuals show clearly that the Commonwealth Government has no mandate from the citizens of the Commonwealth to act in this manner. Whereas the present Government claims to be totally opposed to apartheid (separate development) in South Africa but is handing over Ayers Rock to an Aboriginal Council in support of a policy of apartheid (separate development) which has been shown to be detrimental to the Aboriginal people of Australia. Whereas it is pursuing this policy making it a crime for most white and many Aboriginals to enter, without permit, large areas of the Commonwealth designated apartheid (i.e., set aside for separate development), trary to our democratic traditions and experience of freedom of movement for citizens of all racial origins within Australia.

Whereas opinion polls and statements of representative groups, Members of Parliament and respected individuals show clearly that the Commonwealth Government had no mandate from the citizens of the Commonwealth to act in such a disgraceful manner.

We believe as a matter of faith and judgment that the proposed legislation is anti-God and its implementation will result in attacks on the Christian church and the promotion of a State religion based on secular humanism; 2. That there is no need for legislation of this kind since the principles of freedom are already enshrined in Common Law and that it will cause more problems than it seeks to solve; 3. That there is a potential threat to our national security through making treaties of this kind with foreign nations, many of which do not share common heritage and do not practice many of the principles that they have covenanted to uphold; 4.

Taxation: Entertainment Expenses To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Federal Division of Fisher respectfully showeth that: The total disallowance by the Hawke Labor Government of tax deductability for entertainment and hospitality expenses will unfairly penalise Australian business .and cost thousands of jobs for young and unskilled people.

145,Mr BRUMBY,PUBLICATIONS COMMITTEE,"I present the sixth report from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies of the report have been circulated to honourable members in the chamber. Report-by leave-adopted. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1985 Bill presented by Mr Hurford, and read a first time. Second Reading",67
146,Mr HURFORD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Adelaide-Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (3.25)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will modify amendments of the water UNIONS conservation and conveyance provisions of the income tax law proposed by the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1985. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1985 was passed by this House last week and has been transmitted to another place. That Bill contains measures to put in place some of the proposals announced in the 19 September 1985 statement on reform of the Australian taxation system, one of which was to replace, with write-off over five years, the immediate income tax deductibility of capital expenditure incurred by primary producers on conserving or conveying water. After further consideration, and as a result of consultations with the Australian Democrats, the Government has decided that, such expenditure, where incurred under a contract entered into after 19 September 1985, should instead be deductible in three equal annual instalments, the first in the year in which the expenditure is incurred and a further instalment in each of the next two years. The revenue forgone as a consequence of this change is estimated at $5m in 1986-87 and $7m in 1987-88. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Carlton) adjourned. SALES TAX (EXEMPrIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) AMENDMENT BILL 1985 Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration in Committee of the Whole House forthwith. In Committee Consideration of Senate's amendments. Senate's amendments(I) Page I, clause 2, line 13, leave out 'Section', insert 'Sections 2A and'. (2) Page 2, before clause 3, insert the following new clause: '2A. After section 6AA of the principal Act the following section is inserted: Goods incorporating solar panels, &c. ""6AB. Notwithstanding anything contained in any Sales Tax Assessment Act, sales tax is not payable upon so much of the sale value under any SaleS Tax Assessment Act of goods in which are incorporated goods covered by sub-item (I) of item 153 in the First Schedule as is equal to the amount which would have been the sale value of the first-mentioned goods under that Act if the transaction,act or operation in relation to which the first-mentioned sale value arose had been a transaction, act or operation in relation to the second-mentioned goods only"".'. (3) Page 8, Schedule 2, leave out clause 35. (4) Page 9, Schedule 2, clause 44, add at the end of proposed sub-item 3(3) "" but not including books marketed exclusively or principally for use in schools, colleges or universities'. (5) Page 9, Schedule 2, clause 47, leave out proposed sub-item 12(1), insert the following sub-item: '12(I) Water heating and hot water storage ment, being goods of a kind installed as fixtures in domestic premises, but not including goods covered by sub-item (I) of item 153 in the First Schedule;'.",67
147,Mr HURFORD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Adelaide-Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (3.27)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. These amendments were moved on behalf of the Government in another place. Following further consideration of the tax reform package, including consultations with the Australian Democrats, the Government has agreed to make two changes to the sales tax measures contained in this Bill. Under those changes, solar panels for domestic hot water systems and school atlases are to continue to be exempt from sales tax. The most important of the other amendments will provide a sales tax exemption in respect of satellite earth stations designed to receive the homestead and community broadcasting satellite service that is to be transmitted by the Aussat satellite. This service will enable many Australians living in country areas to enjoy, for the first time, television and radio services long taken for granted by city dwellers. The Government's intention in introducing this exemption is to make earth stations available at affordable prices to individuals and communities. The exemption will not however be available to persons acquiring earth stations for business use. A possible unintended effect of the Bill will be corrected by an amendment that clarifies that raw nuts and seeds of a kind used as food ingredients will not be subject to sales tax as savoury snacks. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) foreshadowed this amendment in a Press release on 21 October 1985. Other amendments will make minor drafting changes to the Bill. Under the sales tax law manufacturers are generally not liable to pay tax on their aids to manufacture. This exemption will be extended under the amendments to retailers who manufacture taxable savoury. snacks on their retail premises. The Bill as introduced would have had the unintended effect of exempting bicarbonate of soda marketed for non-culinary uses. A further amendment will ensure that bicarbonate of soda marketed for such uses, mainly as a swimming pool chemical, will continue to be subject to sales tax.

I commend the amendments to the Committee.",68
148,Mr CARLTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"On behalf of the Opposition I put forward the strongest possible objection to the way in which the Government is dealing with these amendments. There has been plenty of time since 19 September for the Government to make the necessary alterations to carry out its grubby talks with the Australian Democrats. Backroom deals have been made hurriedly in this last week and now, on the very last afternoon of the Parliament, there is simply no time for the Opposition to consider these matters. I have only just this minute seen these provisions. We have had no chance to look at them properly. The whole thing is an absolute disgrace. We have had plenty of time since 19 September for the legislation to be considered and for any negotiations that the Government wanted to enter into with anybody, be it the Australian Democrats or whoever, to be finalised. As far as we can see, these\ amendments are not the ones which we would seek to oppose. They do not acknowledge certai- nonsenses in the original provisions but, frankly, we are not in a position to consider these in detail or adequately. We believe that it is an absolute disgrace that they were brought in in this way without adequate notice and are being rammed through Parliament in a most unseemly way. These matters have been gone through in the Senate but, as I say, as a result of this back room dealing with the Democrats, and as it is part of an overall deal, there are many aspects about which we have the greatest concern. We do not in this chamber oppose the provisions changing the sales tax laws. We understand, insofar as we have been able to examine these measures, that the ameliorations that are made may well be satisfactory, but at the same time we make the strongest protest at the way in which the whole matter has been handled by the Government.

149,Mr HURFORD,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"Adelaide-Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (3.35)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. I regret that copies of the sales tax laws documents were not delivered a little earlier to the shadow Minister's office but, unfortunately, believing that he would have been apprised of it all because the matters had arisen in the Senate, the matter was overlooked. It will not be on future occasions. I presume that he is a little miffed because he did not get a copy of what I am about to say. I hope it will not happen again. These amendments which were moved on behalf of the Government in another place are related to the amendment of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1985 that was agreed to in relation to aids to manufacture used by manufacturers of savoury snacks on retail premises. They will ensure that retailers who manufacture savoury snacks on retail premises will be able to obtain aids to manufacture free of sales tax by quoting their sales tax certificate numbers. I commimd the amendments to the Committee.",69

151,Mr CARLTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"The Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No.2) modifies amendments of the conservation and conveyance provisions of the income tax law proposed in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4). The Bill was passed last week by the House and transmitted to the Senate. This particular provision was to replace with write-offs over five years the immediate income tax deductibility of capital expenditure incurred by primary producers in conserving or conveying water. The Opposition opposed the clause in the Bill giving effect to this provision because we believed that it was totally counter-productive to remove the complete write-off of water conservation or conveyance measures implemented by private enterprise, in effect on behalf of the nation. In a number of cases throughout the country works which would otherwise be required at public expense could be carried out by private enterprise with a suitable tax deduction. My colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) made this clear, as did other speakers. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) in particular had an interest in this in relation to the River Murray, where the public costs of carrying out the necessary works are substantially increased without these taxation deductions being available to landowners. What the Government has done as part of its grubby little deal with the Australian Democrats is modify its proposals and replace its proposed five year write-off with a three-year write-off. Of course, the Opposition is not going to object to that amelioration of circumstances but I would like to make it absolutely clear",69
152,Mr LLOYD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,It is a poor second best.,69
153,Mr CARLTON,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"It is a very poor second best, as my friend the honourable member for Murray has pointed out, to our proposal to reave the existing provisions in place. That would havbeen the best way of dealing with it. We will not oppose this measure but we certainly make it quite clear that we opposed the original measure. I point out that the total concessions given as a result of the tax deal done with the Australian Democrats, of which so much has been made by the Democrats and the Treasurer (Mr Keating), amounted to a miserable $7m out of the $800m additional income or revenue expected next year from the proposals. In the year beyond that, when $1.4 billion extra revenue is to be gained by the measures, the total concessions allowed will be less than $50m. One of the concessions that have been quantified is the concession on water conservation. The revenue forgone as a result of this change is estimated at $5m in 1986if, 87 and $7m in 1987-88. But the total concessions got by the Democrats in their much vaunted humbling, they thought, of the Government, amounted to less than $50m out of $1.4 billion.",69

158,Mr ANDREW,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I am very conscious of the time and will speak only briefly, but I must rise to highlight the absurdity of the amendments before the House and to support the comments made by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton). Clearly, the Opposition has no objection to this minor improvement in the situation, but the truth is that the original proposal brought in by the Fraser Government ought still to be in place. As the honourable member for Mackellar has said, the original proposal encouraged people to be water conservationists. This surely ought to be the damental thrust of what any government is about.",70
159,Mr LLOYD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"They should have supported our retention, shouldn't they?",70
160,Mr ANDREW,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Precisely. What we have before us today is a mere sop to the Australian Democrats and not even a mere sop to the very people who will be affected by the amendrnents that the Government originally proposed. We have here a proposal whereby, in order to placate the Democrats and some of the affected fruit growers, the Govenlment has said: 'We were going to break your arm but we are feeling benevolent, so we will break your wrist instead'. Frankly, Australia's water conveyances and the quality of Australia's water would be far better instead of breaking anything, we left everything intact and allowed growers to make their own provision for better water conveyancing and water distribution in the irrigation areas of this nation.",70

There is really nothing to answer. As I said in my second reading speech, a change has been decided by the Government in its dealings with the Australian Democrats and now the Income Tax.

The purpose of this Bill is to extend the period of operation of the amendments to the standard of proof which were passed by the Parliament funin May this year. The Bill will extend the period of operation for a further six months from 6 December 1985. The need for the introduction of this legislation arises from the obstruction and intransigence of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats in the Senate in relation to the Veterans' Entitlements Bill. The Government greatly regrets that it is being placed in the position where it is necessary to introduce this legislation. Without it, the previous standard of proof which applied to determining pension claims would again apply. This could have the effect of requiring that nearly all pensions claims must be accepted. This is a situation which the Government, the Opposition and the veteran community have regarded as unacceptable. I commend the Bill to the House.",70
163,Mr SINCLAIR,REPATRIATION LEGISLATION,"by leaveUnfortunately, the shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs has not been able to get back to the House at this hour and therefore I rise on his behalf. The Opposition does not accept the proposal of the Government. As we understand the position, the Government has accepted the amendments relating to the definition of allied veterans and the matter relating to acquired immune deficiency syndrome and therefore only one narrow part of the proposal is outstanding. In those circumstances the Opposition does not accept that it is proper for there to be a sixmonth extension to the Repatriation Legislation Amendment Act. We believe that it would be preferable for these matters to be resolved. The nature of the hiatus in veterans' entitlements is not one that can be happily condoned. Many people are uncertain in many areas relating to Government changes. Uncertainty is as bad as the consequences of adverse legislation and in this area we think it would be far preferable if the matter could be resolved. We therefore oppose the extension of six months and it is our intention that the matters be further discussed in the Senate between the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Gietzelt) and the shadow representatives. I hope it is possible to reconcile the differences between them.",71
164,Mr HOLDING,REPATRIATION LEGISLATION,"in reply-I have heard the comments of the Leader of the National Party (Mr Sinclair). The fact is that problems have arisen in the Senate as a result of the Opposition's position and the amendments that were passed.

166,Mr BARRY JONES,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"Lalor-Minist-r for Science and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce) (3.54)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends the Pipeline Authority Act 1973 in accordance with .heads of agreement negotiated recently by the Commonwealth with the Australian Gas Light Co - AGL-in relation to haulage of gas on the Moomba-Sydney pipeline, construction of a northern lateral pipeline to Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow and related matters. For some years the Commonwealth has been attempting to renegotiate the principal contract between the Pipeline Authority-TPAand AGL-the 1974 haulage agreement-to overcome its lack of provision for recovery by the Pipeline Authority of unanticipated losses. These losses result from the Australian Gas Light CO.'s past and continuing inability to market gas at the levels it had nominated in the schedules to the agreement. At the end of 1984, the losses stood at $59m. Because of the structure of the agreement, this is an un serviced debt which by ,the end of the contract period, 31 December 2006, would exceed $l,OOOm and, depending on what assumptions are made about inflation, interest rates and volumes taken, could reach $2,OOOm in dollars of the day. Despite extensive negotiations and exchanges between the Commonwealth, AGL and the New South Wales Government for over seven years, and especially since April 1983, no real progress was made until late last year. But a settlement has now been reached between the three parties under which AGL and the New South Wales Government can receive the benefits they seek, while the Commonwealth will achieve full recovery by 2006 of all past and future costs of construction and operation of the Moomba-Sydney trunk pipeline, the existing lateral pipelines to Wagga Wagga and Canberra, and the proposed lateral to Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow. A revised formula for haulage tariffs over the next 20 years will-without increasing the real costs to New South Wales consumers-enable the Commonwealth to recover all of its past and future costs, provide compressors required along the trunk pipeline and extend a lateral pipeline to Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow. After 2006, haulage tariffs will cover costs of service, which costs will include a profit component. Extension of natural gas supplies to Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow will be a most important outcome of the new arrangements. Construction of the $35m pipeline from Young to the three cities will employ a substantial work force, both directly and indirectly, and should result in a major industrial expansion in this important area of Australia. Natural gas supply will offer security to existing industries and opportunities for establishment of new undertakings. As part of the new agreement, AGL will assume control of existing gas undertakings in the three cities and embark on a $20m expansion and refurbishing program of supply facilities. Rights and conditions of employees of existing undertakings will be fully protected. The retail price of gas to households in each centre will be no more than 10 per cent above that in Sydney and will be uniform throughout the supply area. When these arrangements come into force on 1 January 1988, it is expected that future increases in the haulage tariff will never exceed increases in the consumer price index and will most probably be considerably lower. It is necessary that in future TPA and AGL work together co-operatively on the task of carrying gas to New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory consumers. Both parties need to use their best endeavours to ensure that gas is carried safely, economically and without supply failure, and that a viable natural gas market is maintained. To assist towards this objective, the Commonwealth has agreed to AGL's participation in the decision making of the Pipeline Authority by having a representative on the Authority. The amendments to section 6 of the Act will permit this to be done. The appointment of an AGL nominee will permit closer co-operation and mutual support in the planning and operational activities of the two bodies, each of which has much to offer by way of experience and expertise, not only in pipeline operations but also in other aspects of the natural gas industry. TPA and AGL already have a close commercial relationship through what is virtually a sole supplier-sole purchaser situation. Like other part time members of the Authority, the AGL nominee will of course be bound by all of the provisions of the Act affecting such members including the conflict of interest provisions of section 9. The proposed amendment to section 15 removes the present requirement for the passage of specific legislation before construction of any new pipeline can be undertaken by the Authority. This amendment is sought for the following reasons: (a) Section 15 appears to require prior legislative approval for such essential elements of pipeline construction as route surveys, plan preparation and property and easement surveys, but also calls for inclusion in the enabling Bill of a detailed description of the pipeline route-which cannot be adequately prepared without some survey having been undertaken. The present provisions inhibit preparatory works of the kinds mentioned, and also such necessary preliminaries as stockpile site preparation and site office establishment. (b) This difficulty will be enhanced when there is a heavy legislative program. (c) All of the requirements of section 15 are applicable when any new pipeline, no matter how short, is proposed. (d) Separately from the provisions of this Act, there are adequate financial controls over the Authority through the need for ministerial approval for contracts involving expenditure exceeding $500,000-section 29-as well as Treasurer's approval for larger off-budget borrowings. (e) The Authority's accounts are subject to the Auditor-General's and Senate Estimates committee scrutiny, which, as honourable members know, can be acute. (f) Technical matters are properly the responsibility of the Authority which Parliament has established for that very purpose, and which possesses the necessary expertise. It is considered unnecessary and inappropriate for the Parliament to consider such matters as detailed descriptions of proposed pipeline routes and the limits of deviation, as is required by section 15 at present. Passage of the amendment to section 15 will permit the Authority to initiate preliminary work on the lateral pipeline project, including the ordering of pipe, valves and associated equipment to ensure timely commencement of construction, and so meet the construction target date of late 1987 for supply of natural gqS to Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow. Industrial and domestic consumers and local government authorities throughout the central west area-as well as the State Government-are all anxious to ensure that this target date is met. Legislative provision for nomination of an AGL representative on the Pipeline Authority, and early commencement of the lateral pipeline to Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow, are essential Commonwealth contributions towards a renegotiation of the 1974 haulage agreement from which the Commonwealth stands to gain substantial financial benefits. I commend the Bill to honourable members.",72
167,Mr LLOYD,PIPELINE AUTHORITY AMENDMENT,"by leave-The Pipeline Authority Amendment Bill represents the clear difference between the philosophies of this Labor Government and the coalition parties. On the one hand, the Government, through the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Gareth Evans, seeks to implement the old Rex Connor line of the 1970s in having the Government control and own the farm. The Bill itself is a project of the Rex Connor era. It was following this Connor experience that the previous coalition Government amended the Pipeline Authority Act to require legislative approval of pipeline construction proposals. On the other hand, the Opposition believes that the Pipeline Authority would be better operated through private enterprise. We also believe that the Authority should be subject to full parliamentary review. The statutory requirement to report to Parliament should remain. The amending Bill removes pipeline construction proposals from prior legislative approval. The Authority's accounts scrutiny, by the Auditor-General and Senate Estimates committee, does not provide any safeguard against ministerial approval, and divorcement from that legislative approval. This amendment to remove pipeline construction proposals from parliamentary authorisation would remove potentially significant financial outlays from prior parliamentary scrutiny and veto. The accumulated losses of $59m at the end of 1984, due to the Australian Gas Light Company's past and continuing inability to market gas at the levels it had nominated in the schedules, should be concern enough of the Authority's inability to perform. The fact that under the agreement, this loss by the year ended 31 December, 2006, would exceed $1,OOOm is frightening in itself and evidence of the failure of government enterprise to perform. The Opposition is concerned by the Government's refusal to recognise the potential benefits from the privatisation of the Pipeline Authority. The Minister claims the revised pricing formula will allow the Commonwealth to recover past and future costs by the year 2006, and future price increases will never exceed increases in the consumer price index and will most probably be considerably lower. However, he qualifies this claim with the words, 'it is expected'. On the performance of this Government, the Opposition has considerable doubt that the expectation will be realised. Consumers may rightly claim compensation if this commitment cannot be fulfilled. The end result may well be a considerable drain on government revenue. The sucCess of the agreement depends on factors that are absolutely critical, such as the infla1986, tion rate, interest rates, costs, sales and currency valuation. The Australian Gas Light Co. is given a security of supply at a low price for 20-odd years in advance and, in fact, could have its expectation of greater profits realised under the agreement. It is disquieting to understand that the Minister, Senator Evans, is renewing the Whitlam years philosophy of Federal Government's ownership and control of resources. More recent decisions of the Government on cash bonus bidding, resource rental royalties, sanctions against uranium mining, further regulation, export controls and increased taxes, are all evidence of a Minister who wants to control all resource development, including gas pipelines and electricity generation. Consumers or taxpayers, or both, invariably pay the cost of Government interference in an area where it has no responsibility. Such is the case in regard to TP A. Recovery of the past losses of $59m is evidence of higher tariffs to customers or a recovery from the tax purse in the future. The Opposition feels that this will be the inevitable result of the new arrangement. Future governments could well look into this arrangement, with opportunities to allow private ownership, restricted through the participation by the AGL representative. Unfortunately, it may limit the choice in private ownership to AGL alone. Madam Deputy Speaker, the Opposition's decision to oppose this Bill was fully outlined in the Semite by Senator Durack and it is not intended to repeat all those reasons here. I am sure honourable members will be pleased to hear that. We have no confidence in the claims made by the Minister. Honourable members opposite will be equally pleased to hear that. Only the passage of time will confirm that lack of confidence. The Opposition opposes the amendments and the Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Barry Jones) read a third time. NA NA",73
168,Mr YOUNG,PROCEEDINGS,"by leave-I move: That this House authorises the broadcasting and rebroadcasting on Australian radio and television stations of a sound record of excerpts of its proceedings during subject to the conditions determined for this purpose by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings. Honourable members might not have heard as much of the broadcasting as have people outside this place. But those of us who have had the occasion to hear it, think it is a successful way of communicating with the public. By the broadcasting of direct excerpts of parliamentary proceedings people are able to hear outstanding speeches by members such as the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). Townsville has never had such a great member as the member who now represents it. Some of his contributions this year have been nothing short of outstanding. It is a pleasure to visit his electorate in Townsville and to see what he has done. 1 was there recently for the opening of the massive new Commonwealth Centre. 1 must say that I am looking forward to going back there. 1 commend the motion to the House.",74
169,Mr SINCLAIR,PROCEEDINGS,"1 think it is most regrettable that the Leader of the House (Mr Young) has introduced sordid politics into this discussion this afternoon. He referred to one of the lesser lights from Queensland who is rarely heard in this place. There are other members of this Parliament-I find it hard to reflect on all of those-from the Liberal and National parties who have made an outstanding contribution. The Opposition does not oppose the passage of this motion. We think that the use of parliamentary debate by way of excerpts on the media has been beneficial. Most of us see some anomalies in the degree to which, in regard to the presentation of television images, we see and hear words used which supposedly relate to a film taken on another occasion. The film may have been taken when the member was talking about an entirely different event. But 1 think things are improving. The process of using excerpts has worked out well. 1 commend the practice that you, Mr Speaker, introduced of monitoring the degree to which there is some balance in the use of those excerpts. It is a practice which enables people at least to hear some extracts of proceedings of this place instead of listening only to the proceedings of the House of Commons in Lon. don. Frankly, that seemed to me to be an anomalous process. It is for that reason that I think this is a very worthwhile development. However, Mr Speaker, as I mentioned to you the other night, I trust that the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings will consider the matter to which you referred and allow the adjournment debate to be similarly broadcast, as are other parts of this Parliament's proceedings. When that happens it will be to. the benefit of most of the electorate. Often those adjournment debates are very relevant to the concerns of individual Australians. I think it would be far better if an opportunity were provided for those excerpts to be similarly broadcast, as is the case in regard to other parts of the day's proceedings. Of course, they can be used as excerpts. But I think it would be better if they were broadcast in the normal way. The Opposition does not oppose this measure. Question resolved in the affirmative.

170,Mr HAWKE,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I take this opportunity to thank all those who have served this House during the year. Although I had the opportunity to thank many of them at a function in the courtyard last night there are perhaps a couple of. special references which should be made here, and which I would like to make, at this point. I give special thanks to Alan Browning in his first session as Clerk of the House. He has, as we all expected and knew he would, performed his duties with great distinction. I thank Lyn Symons who has completed her first session as the first female Sergeant-atArms of this House. Again, to you, Lyn, go our congratulations and our thanks. Mr Speaker, I mention also Miss Phoebe Stoney, a Hansard reporter, who has just set a new Australian shorthand speed record. Our congratulations go to her. Finally, in mentioning particular people, our thanks go to our friend Mr Greg Rule, who is retiring after 21 years as an attendant to members of the House. ' Also I would like to give special thanks to the Press Gallery, the members of which I believe have had a rich and fertile year; although not always an easy one. For example, I know they suffered considerable privation and, in some cases, severe sunburn to cover the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the Bahamas. However, with the fortitude we have come to associate with this intrepid band, they soldiered ACCOUNTS on through the rigours of the Bahamas. As some of those members of the Press Gallery go off to prepare their end of term reports on Ministers I would like to get in first and say that although their reporting has been up and down during the year they seem to have got on to the right track in the last few days. Mr Speaker, may I conclude by extending to you, to all honourable members and to all those who serve and who are associated with this House and to all their families our best wishes for Christmas and for what will certainly be a prosperous New Year.",75
171,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in extending thanks to those many people who make the Parliament work- Mr Speaker, to you, and to the Clerks and to the various attendants and officers of the House who are unfailingly polite and courteous, often under severely strained conditions. I take the opportunity, as the Prime Minister did, of wishing all of them and all members of the House a very relaxing Christmas holiday and an opportunity, as one does at Christmas time, to spend a little more time with one's family than the rigours of parliamentary life normally enable many of us to do. I hope that all members of the. House have that opportunity and as a consequence their enthusiasm for the life is renewed over that holiday period. I also would like to say something about the contribution of the Press Gallery. I think the Prime Minister is right when he says that members of the Press Gallery have had their ups and downs. They have not always got it right; they were wrong on one or two very celebrated occasions during the year. However, 1 will not be uncharitable about that. They do contribute to the working of the system and however much on occasions we might individually take issue with their respective judgments they do contribute. I am looking forward to the opportunity that a team drawn from mer.lbers and affiliates of the Opposition-with some appropriate ringin to match the Prime Minister's ring-in---'-will provide to join the Press Gallery in a game of cricket early in the New Year. Very warmly and sincerely, Mr Speaker, to you and to all your colleagues and to my friends on both sides of the House, 1 hope all of you have a very happy and enjoyable Christmas and that it is a time-whatever one's views are on religious beliefs-of reflection, a time to spend with family and a time to renew associations with old friends.",75
172,Mr SINCLAIR,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"1 join in the ""remarks made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). There are many who serve this place whose faces we see but whose names are not necessarily recorded. Because they have not all been mentioned, I mention a few of them in addition to extending, on behalf of myself and my Party, best wishes to all the members of this place. Alan Browning, Lyn Barlin and those who sit at this table have been mentioned. I pay particular tribute to Alan. It has been an interesting year for him. Assuming the mantle of Clerk of the House is a very senior responsibility within the Westminster system. 1 congratulate you, Alan, on the way in which you have exercised your functions. To you, Lyn, and to all the others of the team at the table, we are all indebted. Without you, I am afraid this place could really develop into mayhem-which view I do not doubt you, Mr Speaker, on occasions would more than endorse. There are, however, outside this place a number of people to whom I want to refer. There is, of course, the Principal Parliamentary Reporter, Mr J. M. Campbell. We have in both Mr Campbell and his staff quite outstanding talents. The Prime Minister mentioned Miss Phoebe Stoney. I do not know whether many people in Australia realise that she set an Australian hand record at a speed of an incredible 280 words per minute. It is a pace which few people, I think, would set in their normal speech. It is a record which I think is to be commended, and not just because she was able to achieve it. The fact that she was able to do so must make one apprehensive in case any of the words that are said by mistake in this place are thought not to have been recorded. Quite obviously, with standards of that speed there is little chance of any word being mistaken. I turn to the head librarian and members of the staff of the Department of the Parliamentary Library. I think all of us have been indebted to Mr MACLean and those who work in the various sections of the Library. In opposition, I have found particularly notable the way in which those in the different sections of the Library can provide an enormously worthwhile input into areas where in government one is able to turn to departments. I know that I have found staff working in the defence section of tremendous value. They have an ability both to aggregate material and to pursue inquiries in a way which is beneficial to the working of the Parliament. Therefore, I commend Mr MACLean and each of those in the Library. I pay tribute to the Principal Attendant, Mr Neville Gathercole,and to all attendants. The Prime Minister referred to Mr Greg Rule, who is retiring after 21 years as a parliamentary attendant. To Greg we wish a long life and, for him and his family, good health as he goes about his task away from the occasional mayhem that is this place. To all the attendants, we thank you for the role you play. I extend my thanks also to the police who sit up in the gallery, who move around the Parliament, and who are an enormously important part of the security of the establishment. I extend thanks to the Bills and Papers Office, to the Dining Room, to Carol and Jan and all those who play an important role there, to the Member's Bar and to Bob and his other colleagues whom we all know so well. My thanks go to the drivers, to those outside this place who service our respective parties, to our respective secretariats and, of course to our staff, who render an enormous contribution 1:0 our cause and without whom we would be in a hopeless state. There have been some observations made about members of the Press Gallery. I do not know whether all of us necessarily see the media in the same light at times. We do depend on them shorthowever, and much as this particular forum is seen by them as a fishbowl, I assure them that we, on occasions, look at them in not a dissimilar light. We look at their movements and their actions and interactions and wonder whether they are for real. Many in the community conthe tribute to the well-being of the Parliament. I thanks from all of us and wish them well for the Christmas season. In thinking of one person to whom the Prime Minister made reference, Lyn worthwhile to mention a story that was told to me; it might appeal to Mick in his Irish way. is the story of two lunatics who came into this place and sat up in the gallery",76
173,Mr YOUNG,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,Only two?,77
174,Mr SINCLAIR,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Only two; the rest of them sit here. They watched happily as members booed and shouted and carried on. They felt more and more at home, particularly in ways that prevail, Mr Speaker, on occasions during Question Time. They felt even more at home when Ms Symons led one 9f the members away after you decided you would give in your ire, Mr Speaker, and to expel him from service of the House. Suddenly the bells began to ring and members began to mill around, as we are apt to in the course of divisions, and one lunatic turned to the other and said: 'Ah, one them has escaped'. I thought this might be alternative: We are all about to escape, and that vein we all look forward to a rather relaxed Christmas and New Year period. I wish all members of this place, and all those who have made this Parliament such a worthwhile venue in its way, all the best. For all that we are appalled at some aspects of the Government's management of the economy, there is nonethethe less a bonhomie that exists that is worthwhile. We all know each other to a degree as individParty uals and in that respect I believe the Westminsstory ter system has much to commend it and that is certainly something that deserves to endure. wish all members a happy family Christmas and a change of government in the New Year.",77
175,Mr YOUNG,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"1 conclude the remarks by going on. joining with the earlier speakers in wishing the best to you, Mr Speaker, the Clerks, Hansard, the staff of the parliamentary dining room, people down at the post office and everyone who works in the House to assist us so greatly. As some people would know, Leader of the by House is not the most popular of jobs from time to time during the year. But someone has to do it because, if someone was not doing this we would get only one Bill a year through the place; people would keep speaking. It has been an interesting year. For the first time in 35 years we have had an increase in the number of members of parliament. I think that members on the Procedure Committee would say agree that we have not really come to grips with the use of the House after the increase in the number of members. Those who were elected at the last election certainly brought some characSymons, I think it ters with them. I think we have had a very good year. The It Government has finished on top, as we expected, and looks like having a long reign in office. Mr Speaker, I take the opportunity of extending to . you, to all the members of the staff around Parliament House, to the people in Canberra who put up with us from one year's end to the other and to all those who give us great assistance in this place all the best for Christmas and the rather raucous the New Year.",77
176,Mr SPEAKER,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Order! This is one of the few occasions when the Speaker gets a chance to say to a few words more than 'Order'. I thank the honourable members who have spoken for the good wishes they have conveyed. Of course, 1 reciprocate them. I will convey the good wishes of all members to the staff of all the parliamenof tary departments. I will do as I have done for an the past two years at the end of the year and in perambulate the departments and see all the employees and convey the good wishes to them. I would like to convey my thanks to the Clerks and their staff, particularly Alan Browning, who has taken over from Doug Blake and has settled in. We are fast getting a very good rapport. I also must mention that there has been change with our first female Sergeant-atArms. I thought that the Leader of the National of Australia was going to tell a different about one Opposition member who was it suspended and who threatened to struggle when I the Sergeant-at-Arms was going to remove him from the House. We have also had' the first female attendants in the chamber this year. So, believe that there is some affirmative action I would like to thank Mrs Child, the Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker, and the the temporary chairmen. I do not think the House realises how well served members are. People forget that this chair has to be occupied someone to allow the proceedings to go on. I think you would all agree that that process has been smoothly carried out. I thank Mrs Child job, for having taken that under control. I would like to thank my personal staff-and I will not mention them by name-;-who serve the members well in the contact they have with them. They certainly give me a loyalty, devotion and service that I appreciate very much, as do those in my electorate office. Some honourable members might like to know that my senior private secretary, Mr Morrie Adamson, is retiring on 6 January. Morrie has been around this Parliament for a very long time. SQme of the older members who have served on committees will well remember the contact they have had with him in the committee system. I first struck him on the Wildlife COnservation Committee. He has been a good friend and servant to honourable members and he has done a mighty job for this Parliament. I am sorry to lose him, and I wish him well in his retirement. Mention has been made of the media. So far, I have no complaint except for the occasional matters of privilege that I have to rule on, but they are outside my control. Some advances have been made. We have allowed filming which backs the news services, and the televising of the Budget speeches. We now allow excerpts of proceedings to be broadcast, and I believe that the media have shown a great degree of responsibility in using these tools that we have given them to give better exposure of the Parliament. I guess that it is no secret that I am not particularly satisfied with behaviour in the House. I hope that the Standing Committee on Procedure will give us some assistance in the recommendations that it will bring forth and that there will be more guidance to honourable members, and even more guidance to the Speaker, who often has to decide whether in applying the sanction the very business of the day may not go on. That is one of the difficult decisions that I have to face. I thank members of the House for the trust they have shown in me in the number of them who come into my office to ask for advice on parliamentary matters and respect the fact that I preserve their. confidences. I also thank honourable members on both sides of the House for the friendship that they show to my wife and me. We appreciate that very much. Since I am talking about families, may I convey to all honourable members and their families and to all rnembers of staff and their families the seasonal greetings. Question resolved in the affirmative. VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS BILL 1985 Message received from the Senate acquainting the House that the Senate presses its requests for amendments to the Bill. Ordered that the consideration of the message be made an order of the day for the next sitting. House adjourned at 4.29 p.m., until Tuesday, 11 February 1986, at 2 p.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed to this day. NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 29 November 1985: Acts Interpretation Act-Statements relating to extension of specified period for presentation of periodic report-Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, report for 1984-85. The following answers to questions were circulated: (Question No. 1691)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the National Times of 30 March 1984, where it is claimed that a strategic basis paper endorsed by Cabinet states that Australia, along with the United States of America and the Philippines, has a commitment to Thailand under the Manila Treaty and that in the event of a major attack by Vietnam, Thailand would, as well as looking to China to exert counter-pressure on Vietnam, call on the United States of America and other Manila Treaty nations, including Australia for assistance. (2) What is the attitude of the Australian Government to its commitments to Thailand under the Manila treaty and does the Government endorse the reported view in the strategic basis paper that Australia should avoid creating an expectation by Thailand of an Australian military commitment.",77
177,Mr HAYDEN,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) The Manila Treaty remains in legal force. As a party to the Treaty Australia, along with the other Treaty members including Thailand, has certain commitments under Article IV of the Treaty. However, since the dissolution of South-East Asia Treaty Organisation in 1977, there have been no joint consultative or any other activities carried out under the aegis of the Treaty. The Government is keeping Australia's continuing adherence to the Treaty under review. Air Defence and Anti-Ballistic Missile (Question No. 1692)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Has his attention been drawn to reports that, with technological improvements in air defence systems, the distinctions between air defence and anti-ballistic missile systems will be so blurred as to be meaningless; if so, is there any substance in the claims. MrHayden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government is aware of such reports. The Government cannot foresee future technological developments. It is the Government's impression that at the present time the distinction between even the most advanced air defence missile systems and anti-ballistic missile systems-particularly for defence against strategic ballistic missiles-remains valid. NA Manila Treaty Buildup of Soviet Nuclear Weapons in Asia Pacific Region (Question No. 1693)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Is he able to say whether the buildup of Soviet nuclear weapons in the Asia-Pacific region has reached the stage where the nuclea- balance in the region has shifted in favour of the Soviet Union, as reported by the 1983 Annual Report of United States Defence Secretary Casper Weinberger.",79
178,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Neither in Soviet Military Power 1983 nor Secretary Weinberger's Annual Report to Congress for Fiscal Year 1984 dated I February 1983, have the precise words attributed to him in the question been identified. The qualitative and quantitative buildup in Soviet forces, nuclear and conventional, in the Asian Pacific region over the past decade has resulted in a greatly increased Soviet capability in the region. The Government has not however formed the view that this process has reached the point where the balance of forces in the region has shifted in favour of the Soviet Union. Cambodia (Question No. 1694)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is he able to say whether (a) Khmer Rouge members who still follow Pol Pot are welcomed back by the Heng Samrin puppet regime and (b) this regime publicly stated that Khmer Rouge members are free to resume their lives after a brief period of political indoctrination. Systems (2) Is he also able to say whether non communists or non Khmer Rouge followers do not receive such a welcome in Vietnamese controlled Kampuchea.",79
179,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) Various recent public statements issued by the Heng Samrin administration have stated that, under the so-called six point clemency policy, supporters of Pol Pot (and the other Cambodian resistance groups) can return to Cambodia where they will be granted full citizenship rights of the People's Republic of Kampuchea. Under this policy it is claimed that those who wish to take part inÂ· agricultural production will have their own plots of land as do other peasants. It is also stated that suitable jobs will be provided to those returnees who wish to do their share in national defence and construction activities. (b) Yes. In a public statement on 16 August 1985, Hun Sen, Prime Minister of the Heng Samrin administration, stated that rank and file supporters of Pol Pot 'should be re-educated to become good citizens useful to society' in Cambodia. (2) According to statements issued by the Heng Samrin administration, the six point clemency policy applies to the followers of non-Khmer Rouge and Khmer Rouge resistance groups. Vietnamese Settlement in Cambodia  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is he able to say whether the Heng Samrin puppet regime documents instruct officials to assist Vietnamese, both former residents and new immigrants, in any way possible and to consult with the Vietnamese settlers. (2) Is he also able to say whether (a) Vietnamese soldiers serving in Kampuchea are encouraged to settle in the country and marry Khmer women and that those who do so are to receive Kampuchean citizenship and (b) Vietnamese immigrants are also given extraterritorial status.",79
180,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) In a document issued in October 1982 by the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, local authorities are called on to give assistance to former residents who have returned, and to create conditions for them to settle down to a normal life. The local authorities are also asked to create conditions allowing Vietnamese who have come to Cambodia since December 1978 to stay in the country and work, providing they are engaged in occupations which contribute to the rehabilitation and development of the economy, and maintain good relations with the local people. The Thai press reported in March 1983 that a directive from the Kampuchean Revolutionary People's Party called on authorities to co-ordinate with Vietnamese advisers on matters concerning Vietnamese residents. (2) (a) There has been no confirmation of the claim that Vietnamese soldiers serving in Cambodia are encouraged to settle there and marry Khmer women. (b) There is no evidence to support claims that Vietnamese in Cambodia receive extraterritorial status. Heng Samrin Administration  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Did he state in March 1985 that the Heng Samrin administration is improving its administration and acceptability all the time; if so, does he currently hold this view and what evidence is there to justify it.",80
181,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I did .state on 9 March 1985, in a press conference in Bangkok-and again in slightly different terms on 13 March following my return to Australia from a visit to several South East Asian countries-that the Heng Samrin administration is improving its administration and acceptability all the time. In my statement of 9 March, I also noted that the question of the improvememt in the administration and acceptability of the Heng Samrin administration was one of relativity, that is, it was 'fairly dreadful by the standards we prefer but it's much superior to what it was'. The Department of Foreign Affairs continues to monitor closely conditions inside Cambodia. At present there is no major evidence available to us which would alter (Question No. 1695) the general assessment contained in my statement of 9 March concerning the improvement in the administration and acceptability of the Heng Samrin administration. This assessment is based on evidence from a number of sources, including media reports and the accounts of people who go into Cambodia on behalf of non-governmental agencies and multilateral agencies, and others, including some members of a Joint Australian Parliamentary Delegation which visited Cambodia in 1984. Vietnamese Settlement in Cambodia (Question No. 1698)  . Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is he able to say whether Vietnamese citizens settling throughout Kampuchea are abetted and encouraged by Hanoi; if so, what is the estimated number of Vietnamese nationals who have settled in Kampuchea in the last four years. (2) Has his attention been drawn to a statement by Willibald Pahr, the former Austrian Foreign Minister and Chairman of the International Conference on Kampuchea, which estimated the minimum number of Vietnamese immigrants as 500,000.",80
182,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Claims that Vietnam is attempting to colonise Cambodia date at least from Vietnam's intervention in the overthrow of the Pol Pot regime in December 1978. There has historically been considerable settlement from southern Vietnam in Cambodia. The Australian Government has been unable to find sufficient evidence to support the proposition that Vietnam is pursuing a deliberate policy of migration to Cambodia or of changing the ethnic balance there. The Government accepts that some movement of ethnic Vietnamese into Cambodia has taken place in recent years. Many would appear to be Vietnamese who had (Question No. 1696) been resident in Cambodia prior to the Pol Pot years. Cambodia had a Vietnamese minority which numbered about 500,000 before the exoduses of the 1970s. Our current assessment is that there are about 300,000 Vietnamese residents in Cambodia. (2) Yes, it was one of a number of estimates. Kampuchea (Question No. 1699)  A.ffairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Does Vietnam's invasion and occupation of Kampuchea violate the United Nations Charter? (2) Has Vietnam signed the Charter? (3) Does Vietnam's occupation threaten the system of colleqive security embodied in the United Nations Charter? (4) What action has the Government taken through its membership of the United Nations Security Council to seek Vietnam's withdrawal from Kampuchea? Mr Hayden - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Ever since the invasion of Kampuchea by Vietnam in 1979 Australia has repeatedly condemned Vietnam's invasion and occupation of Kampuchea. Australia has consistently stated that Vietnam's continued occupation constitutes a breach of internationally accepted principles and poses dangers to the peace and stability of the region. (2) No, Vietnam is not an original signatory of the United Nations Charter. Vietnam acceded to the Charter in 1977 when it joined the United Nations. (3) Although the United Nations Charter embodies a system of collective security, these provisions have never been implemented. (4) During Australia's current term on the United Nations Security Council, the issue of Kampuchea has not come before the Council. Staffing Levels: Department of Foreign Affairs (Question No. 1700)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: How many officers of his Department, in Canberra, are working in (a) the disarmament and nuclear division and (b) in (i) the South-east Asian/Pacific Division, (ii) Europe, (iii) the Americas and (iv) the North Asia Divisio.ns. Mr Hayden - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Department's functions relating to disarmament and nuclear policy are carried out within the Executive, Policy Planning, Defence and Nuclear DiviSalaries and Allowances for Ambassador (including locally engaged and Ambassador's domestic staff) . Other overseas costs, from the Appropriations Office-Rentals, Utilities, Motor Vehicles, Furniture and Fittings Travel costs International Year of Peace (Question No. 1702)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) What sum has been budgeted for expenditure related to the International Year of Peace. (2) How is this sum to be allocated. sion. There are 77 staff, including policy advising, clerical and keyboard staff in this Division, of whom 28 work on disarmament and nuclear policy matters. These staff include the Special Disarmament Adviser, the Disarmament and Arms Control Branch, Peace and Disarmament Branch (including the International Year of Peace Secretariat) and Nuclear Policy Branch. (b) (i) In the South East Asia and Pacific Division there are 35 staff, including policy advising, clerical and keyboard. (b) (ii), (iii) and (iv). The Europe, Americas and North Asia Division has 29 staff, including 7 in Americas Branch, 9 in Europe Branch and II in North Asia Branch. Ambassador for Disarmament and Staff (Question No. 1701)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: What has been the cost to the Government of maintaining the Ambassador for Disarmament and his staff since his appointment?",80
183,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Ambassador for Disarmament is supported directly in his Disarmament and .Arms Control related duties by one Foreign Affairs Officer Class 4, one Foreign Affairs Officer Class I and a Steno-Secretary. All are normally based in Geneva but move annually between Geneva and New York to attend meetings of the General Assembly. The Ambassador also has a locally engaged driver based permanently in Geneva. It is not possible to provide a precise total of the costs of maintaining the Ambassador for Disarmament and his direct support staff since expenditure on items such as repairs and maintenance, communications, pool transport and office requisites used by them is a charge against the common services of the Australian Missions in Geneva and New York. There is no separate budget as such for the Ambassador for Disarmament and his staff and the total cost of their maintenance is therefore greater than the total of readily identifiable costs, detailed below. 1983-84 1984-85 1985-86 $ $ and Geneva based support staff 222,427 355,895 386,222 of the Overseas Property 322,813 260,366 271,723 41,784 50,000 545,240 658,045 707,945 (3) How many people employed by his Department are involved in servicing, even in part, activities related to the International Year of Peace.",81
184,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) For the 1985-86 financial year the sum of $2,007,000 has been budgeted for expenditure related to the I nternational Year of Peace. (2) This sum is to be allocated as follows: (a) Advertising and publicity $700,000, (b) Government programs $600,000; (c) Non-government programs $500,000; (d) Administration $207,000 (3) In addition to Mrs Stella Cornelius, the Director of IYP programs who is employed on a consultancy basis, five people are engaged full time in activities related to the International Year of Peace in the Department of Foreign Affairs. This includes two officers seconded from other Government departments, so that the number of officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs working full time on the International Year of Peace is three. Five other officers of the Department are partly engaged in International Year of Peace activities A number of other Departmental officers, including communications and other support staff, the Senior Foreign Affairs representatives in each State capital and certain officers in diplomatic missions abroad also have some involvement in International Year of Peace activities among their other duties. It is not possible to be precise about the number of officers involved in this degree since this varies from time to time. International Year of Peace: Defence Equipment Exhibition (Question No. 1703)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is it the position of the Government that there is nothing inconsistent between making proper provisions for defence and the United Nations International Year of Peace. (2) What is the Government's attitude towards the Australian Defence Exhibition scheduled for 1986.",81
185,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Secretary-General of the United Nations has described the main objectives of the International Year of Peace as: To stimulate concerted and effective action by the United Nations, its member States, intergovernmental organisations, non-government organisations, educational, cultural, academic institutions and the mass media in promoting peace, international security and co-operation on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations, and the resolution of conflict by peaceful means; to strengthen the United Nations as the principal international system devoted to the promotion and maintenance of peace: to urge member States to renew their commitment to the principles of the Charter and to implement these principles effectively; to enhance the effectiveness of the Security Council in fulfilling its primary responsibility for the nance of international peace and security, and the peaceful settlement of disputes; to increase public awareness and support for United Nations activities; to focus attention and encourage reflection on the basic requirements of peace in the contemporary world, in particular: (i) the inter-relationship of peace and development and social progress, security, national independence and justice; (ii) disarmament and the prevention of nuclear catastrophe as essential elements of peace; (iii) the exercise of human rights and freedom as an essential element of peace; (iv) the role of international co-operation, dialogue, mutual understanding and trust in the maintenance of peace with involvement of governments, parliaments and non-government organisations; (v) preparation for life in peace, a process in which education, science, culture, religion and the mass media play important roles, and which requires effective participation of various social groups, especially women, youth, elderly, war veterans and professionals. (vi) peace as 'a requirement for the satisfaction of such human needs as food, shelter, health, education, labour and the enviroment. The Government sees no inconsistency between these objectives and the making of proper provisions for the defence of Australia. Such provisions are entirely in accord with the Charter of the United Nations. (2) This part of the honourable member's question is taken to refer to the proposed Pacific Area Defence Exhibition (PAD EX) planned for next year. PADEX is a private venture designed to promote international trade in military weapons and material and such does not require the approval of the Australian Government to be held. The Government has not assisted or endorsed PADEX in any way in line with its policy of not supporting privately sponsored defence exhibitions. Decisions on a number of specific matters relating to the exhibition will be announced shortly by the Minister for Defence. Diplomatic Missions Opened Since Minch 1983 (Question No. 1704)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) What new diplomatic missions has Australia opened since March 1983? (2) What was the cost of running each post? (3) What are the current staff numbers maintained in each post? (4) What is the justification for their opening in each case?",82
186,Mr HAYDEN,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Diplomatic missions the Australian Government has opened since March 1983 are: Addis Ababa-opened mainte- December 1984; Budapest-opened October 1984; Brunei-opened March 1983; Geneva DisarmamentAmbassador appointed May 1983; Kathmandu-opened April 1984; Port Louis-opened March 1984; Riyadhopened September 1984; Shanghai-opened July 1984. (2) The costs for running each of these new posts is set out, by year, below: Brunei. Brunei. 210,185 Geneva Disarmament. Kathmandu. 16,323 Port Louis 46,315 Addis Ababa 87,294 Brunei. 262,928 130,513 Addis Ababa. Brunei. Budapest. . Geneva Disarmament. Kathmandu Port Louis Shanghai . (4) The jusification for the opening of these Australian missions overseas is set out below (a) Addis Ababa-The Australian Embassy at Addis Ababa is our first resident mission in the Horn of Africa region. Its establishment is in keeping with Australia's increasing focus on the Indian Ocean and East Africa region. The headquarters for the Organisation for African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa are located at Addis Ababa. Thus, Addis Ababa became the preferred location in the region as a mission there provides an opportunity for close contact between Australia and both these important organisations. Ethiopia's worsening drought and food distributiOJ1 problems have given added importance to an Australian presence in the country. This presence has allowed us to monitor events there closely since the mission opened in December 1984. Australia's increasing aid commitment in humanitarian and development areas in the Horn of Africa and in East Africa has required the upgrading of our representation in Addis Ababa. A Third Secretary (Development Assistance) has been appointed and will begin work in November this year. (b) BruneiThe Australian High Commission was established in Brunei in anticipation of its membership of Association of South East Asian Nations, and its independence, declared in January 1984. Our ASEAN neighbours are of great importance in determining Australia's foreign policy. As well, we accord high priority to regional Commonwealth countries, such as Brunei. These were the primary reasons for the establishment of an Australian mission in Brunei. (c) Budapest-Hungary is a significant country in East Europe. For many years, we have had a fruitful Salaries Adminis- Salaries Adminisand trative and trative overtime costs Total overtime costs Total $ $ $ $ $ $ 1982-83 Budapest. 87,372 20,705 108,077 Geneva 96,580 45,696 142,276 61,010 42,144 103,154 Kathmandu 111,341 70,570 181,911 1983-84 Port Louis 197,422 127,073 324,495 Riyadh . 137,124 101,472 238,596 48,515 258,700 Shanghai. 132,780 114,608 247,388 These figures do not includes overseas property and 26,019 23,390 49,409 capital works expenditure. 57,682 74,005 61,873 Funds for these categories are allocated to the Over15,558 seas Property Office, under the portfolio of Local Gov1984-85 ernment and Administrative Services. (3) Current numbers maintained at each post, at 30 25,951 113,245 June 1985 are as follows: 393,441 NA Locally DFA ADAB Attached engaged 2 4 3 3 2 3 2 2 3 3 l(imm) 5 3 3(trade) 7 exchange on issues such as disarmament, EastcWest relations, non-proliferation and Comecon. As well, Hungary is a model of national self management in the Warsaw Pact. Its attempts at economic. and social reform, which have brought about greater emphasis on the importance of market forces, deserve greater diplomatic support. The potential for boosting and diversifying Australian trade with Hungary had existed for a long time. Prior to the establishment 'of our Embassy in Budapest, Hungary's foreign trade exceeded one-third of its gross domestic product, and more than half of that was trade with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development nations. The early 1980's saw a closer relationship developing between Australia and Hungary. This created a heavy administrative burden on our diplomatic mission in Vienna, which was then accredited to Hungary. In the three years to February 1984, the Australian Ambassador made some twenty five trips to Hungary. As well, we were receiving constant complaints from Hungarian officials in Australia about the lengthy delays in issuing Australian visas to Hungarians on official business. Both these examples indicate a workload which required the establishment of a resident Australian mission in Hungary. The Hungarian Government had maintained an Embassy in Canberra for many years prior to 1984. This factor and the large Hungarian community in Australia provided further impetus for the establishment of an Australian mission in Hungary. (d) Geneva Disarmament-Strictly speaking, the appointment of an Ambassador for Disarmament in May 1983 did not require establishment of a new mission. It simply led to an increase of two in the staffing level at the Australian Embassy in Geneva, with the post providing common services. Australia's increasingly active participation in disarmament and arms control efforts reflects the Government's strong commitment to balanced and verifiable arms control and disarmament measures both nuclear and conventional. Our Government's contribution to disarmament has been enhanced significantly by the appointment of an Ambassador for Disarmament. (e) Kathmandu-There were two main reasons for the establishment of a resident Australian diplomatic mission in Nepal. Firstly, there was a need to improve the efficiency of consular services for the very large number of Australians visiting Nepal which, prior to the opening of the embassy in Kathmandu, the British were conducting on our behalf. The volume of work put British consular services in Nepal under strain and there were frequent requests by the British that we rectify the situation. A second reason for the establishment of a resident Australian mission in Nepal was that it would facilitate the administration of the Australian aid program to Nepal. (f) Pori Louis-The reasons which led us to establish an Australian mission in Port Louis are strategic, political and economic. The Australian Government recognises the strategic importance of peace and stability in the Indian Ocean, and it recognises the need for Australia to strengthen its relations and promote its views amongst the Indian Ocean Island States. The newly established mission in Port Louis is therefore dually accredited in the Comores and the Seychelles. Accreditation in Madagascar has been sought. The mission provides a central focus for the conduct of the broad range of Australian interests in the Indian Ocean. Of all the Indian Ocean states, it is Mauritius that has established a close economic relationship with Australia. In 1983-4 Australian exports to Mauritius equalled total Australian exports to black African nations. As well, the Government of Mauritius established a diplomatic mission in Australia in 1977, and was becoming increasingly concerned that we had not reciprocated and established a resident mission in Port Louis. Prior to its establishment, the High Commissioner in Dar Es Salaam was accredited to Mauritius pending agreement from the Madagascar Government for the transfer of accreditation to Port Louis. Our High Commission in Tanzania remains responsible for Australia's relations with Madagascar. As well, a large Mauritian community in Australia made the establishment of an Australian diplomatic presence in Port Louis even more important. (g) Riyadh-The Australian Embassy in Riyadh was relocated from Jeddah due to Saudi Government policy 1979 Australia Overseas. 68 which required all missions in the country to relocate in the diplomatic quarter of Riyadh. Saudi Arabia is of great importance to Australia, by virtue of its geographical location between two important sea routes, and as an important source of oil for Australia. Since the establishment of the Australian Embassy in Jeddah, Australia has become recognised by Saudi Arabia as a reliable trading partner and is increasingly looked upon as a source of advice and training in a number of fields of economic and social development. The Embassy is primarily concerned with maintaining a healthy bilateral relationship with Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states and the Yemens, to which our Ambassador in Saudi Arabia is accredited. This means advancing our politicial and economic interests, particularly in relation to our access to future oil supplies and trade. With the transfer of our Embassy to Riyadh, the post in Jeddah became a Consulate-General, staffed solely by Department of Trade personnel. (h) Shanghai-In 1978 the Australian Government indicated its intention to open a Consulate-General in Shanghai in an Exchange of Notes. Since that time, the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan and Britian, and various non-Western nations have recognised the importance of establishing Consulates-General in Shanghai. The need to expand our representation was seen as essential for effectively representing our interests in China. The establishment of a ConsulateGeneral in Shanghai was an ideal location for both political and economic reasons. Trade opportunities between Australia and China should be maximised through the establishment of a mission in the industrial heartland. As well, Shanghai has an important political role in China. During this century political movements in Shanghai have been a major determinant of the direction of Chinese politics. Department of Foreign Affairs: Staff Increase-. 1979-1985 (Question No. 1705)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) What has been the level of increase in all categ(')ries of staff in his Department (a) overseas and (b) in Australia between 1979-1980 and 1984-1985. (2) What has been the justification for these increases.",82
187,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN BASED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) and (b) The figures for 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983-4 are taken from the Department of Foreign Affairs Annual Reports, and the figures for 1984-85 will be included in the next Annual Report due for release early next year.

Human Resource Budgeting, was introduced for all Commonwealth inoperatives, nor part time staff (71). Experts (120 in Research (23 in 1985) staff, employed by Australian (2). Overall, the total increase of staff employed by my Department over the period 1979 to. 1985 is 1.3 per cent (59). This figure is distorted somewhat by the drastic drop in ADAB's staffing figures, especially during the 1979-1983/84 period. With ADAB figures removed, the increase ,still comes to the modest figure of 2.6 per cent (109). The increases in Foreign Affairs staff levels can . be largely attributed to three factors: changing Government priorities in the formulation of foreign policy, new policy initiatives on the domestic front and large increases in workload for particular important functions of the Department. Changing government priorities in formulating foreign policy has led to the establishment of 15 new missions overseas, and closure of 7 in the period 1979 to 1985. This results in a net increase of 9 in Australia's overseas missions. Of the fifteen newly established missions, twelve required Executive Council appointments for the head mission position. Three, (Bali, Shanghai and Houston) were Consulates-General requiring appointment of the head of mission at official level, by the Secretary of the Department. This led to a direct increase in Executive Council appointments of eight. One further appointment at Executive Council level was required when our consulate at Nicosia, Cyprus was upgraded to a diplomatic mission in January 1982. This increase of II % in the Executive Council appointments reflects a reasonably constant level of increase across all streams of the Department. The FAO stream recorded an increase of 15 per cent (64) with the Consular and Administrative stream, and the Keyboards and Technical stream increasing by 11.9 per cent (108) Consular Keyboard Australian Heads Foreign & & Development Locally of Affairs Admin Technical Assistance Engaged Mission Officers Staff Staff Bureau Staff Total 68 403 901 543 458 2,128 4,501 218 684 197 452 1,551 72 186 219 283 30 2,158 2,948 72 404 903 480 482 2,158 4,499 208 686 261 429 1,584 71 189 218 278 29 2,063 2,848 71 397 904 539 458 2,063 4,432 219 696 288 383 1,586 74 192 221 270 27 1,975 2,759 74 411 917 558 410 1,975 4,345 259 674 326 349 1,608 74 195 222 294 27 1,960 2,772 74 454 896 620 376 1,9-0 4,380 272 795 330 378 1,775 77 195 214 294 30 1,975 2,785 77 467 1,009 624 408 1,975 4,560 on Secondment elsewhere (32) and those on maternity In 1984-5 a new 'system of collecting data on staff numbers, Departments. The 1984-5 figures do not include 1985) and Australian Centre for International Agricultural Development Assistance Bureau are not included. and 14.9 per cent (81) respectively. The increase in Australia-based staff is to be expected when there is such an increase in the number of missions. The impact of these increases has been largely offset by a decrease of 7 per cent (153) in locally engaged staff in the period. The location of these new missions is a reflection of the changing priorities of Australian foreign policy in the 1980's. Of the fifteen new posts opened, six are in the Pacific and Asian regions, four are in Africa. Only one post, Geneva Disarmament, has been established in West Europe. This special mission concentrates on pursuing Australia's arms control and disarmament policies particularly, but not exclusively in the multilateral field. It is indicative of a new high priority in Australia's foreign policy set by this Government. The changed priorities of the Government has led to the creation of two new branches and four new sections in the Department. A Disarmament and Arms Control Branch and a Treaties Branch was established in 1983. of As well, an International Year of Peace (IYP) Secretariat and three new Sections dealing with chemical weapons, nuclear non-proliferation and human rights, have been established. The Governments' domestic policy initiatives, EEO, industrial democracy, and FOI have all contributed to an increasing workload for the Department. The third factor which has led to some staff increases is the increased activity for certain Departmental functions. This is especially so of the communications network, which experienced a 23 per cent increase in the 1983-4 period alone, and the passports function. One of the most important, and public functions of the Department is the issue of Australian passports. As a result of the Stewart Royal Commission, forty extra positions were created, by Mr Street, when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs in December 1982 to upgrade security arrangements. Since 1982, passport applications have increased by 24 per cent. Without a' further increase in staff of 24 positions (12.5 per cent) the Department's passports processing time and workload would have been. intolerable. Levels of staff employed by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau have declined since 1979 by 10.9 per cent. As the figures revealed, the decline is the result of the previous Government's policy which gave extremely low priority to aid administration. In the period 1979 to 1983-4 the number of ADAB staff declined by 17.9 per cent. The present government has attempted to redress this decline, with an increase of 7.8 per cent in 1985. In the future, as the Jackson Committee recommendations for upgrading ADAB functions and administration are implemented, ADAB will be better equipped to administer our aid program. (Question No. 1706)  Affairs, upon notice, on 16 September 1985: Has he taken action to ensure that Australia's rapidly growing foreign debt, and the predicted further growth in that debt, will not destablise Australia's broader relations with its major trading partners, and particularly those countries in Australia's immediate region.",84
188,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN BASED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Australia's external indebtedness is the responsibility of my colleague the Treasurer. There is no question of Australia's external debt destabilising broader relations with our major trading partners or with countries in Australia's immediate region.

190,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN BASED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The .Soviet Union does not provide such information about its forces. The Government has seen unclassified testimony to this effect by two senior United States officials-Robert M.

191,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN BASED,"The answer to the honourable Program member's question is as follows: To the Government's knowledge, the Soviet Union has not made such information public. The Government has however noted press reports to this effect from usually well sourced journalists-see for example 'Russia Planning to Replace Missiles' by Walter Pincus which appeared in the International Herald Tribune on 10 May 1985.

Submarines in the Soviet Pacific Fleet (Question No. 1716)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September, 1985: Is he able to confirm that there are more than 120 Soviet Union submarines in their Pacific fleet, 31 of which are classed as 'strategic', that is, meaning they can fire nuclear weapons.",88
198,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Several authoritative Western public sources give figures For the number of submarines in the Soviet Pacific Fleet which agree closely with those quoted in the question: (a) Jane's Fighting Ships 1984-1985 lists 24 SSBN, 7 SSB and 96 other submarines; (b) Soviet Military Power 1985 lists 31 SSBN/SSB and 103 other submarines; (c) The Military Balance 1984-1985 lists 25 SSBN, 6 SSB and 102 other submarines. The Government has no reason to question the broad accuracy of these assessments: see, for example, the answer to question on notice No. 803. The terms SSBN and SSB reFer to nuclear powered ballistic missile submarines and conventionally powered ballistic niissile submarines respectively. The term tegic', in this context, has traditionally been taken as reFerring to submarines capable of launching ballistic missiles and accountable under the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks I Interim Agreement. This category of submarines comprises all modern ballistic. missile submarines operational or under construction on the date of signature of the SALT I Interim Agreement (26 May 1972) and any older submarines converted to carry new missiles after the date of signature of the Interim Agreement. For the Soviet Union (and For the United States) only SSBNs are 'strategic' submarines in the sense of being SALT-accountable: 13 older Soviet submarines carrying a total of 39 shorter-range ballistic missiles and including the SSBS assigned to the Pacific Fleet are considered to be assigned to theatre roles (Soviet Military Power, page 31). I might add that the ability to fire nuclear weapons is not limited to ballistic missile submarines alone. Other classes of submarines are also nuclear-capable: see e.g. pp 95-97 of Soviet Military Power 1985. South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone and the Australian Atomic Energy Commission  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: What effect will the signing of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty have on the operations of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and its activities at Lucas Heights, NSW and, in particular, on its storage of waste and its stock of highly enriched uranium.",89
199,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The signature by Australia on 6 August 1985 of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty will not affect the operations of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. These operations are Fully consistent with the objectives and provisions of the Treaty. Parties to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty undertake not to manufacture nuclear explosive devices and not to permit them to be tested or stationed on their territory. Peaceful nuclear activities are not proscribed by the Treaty providing these are subject to saFeguards administered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to veriFy the non-diversion of nuclear material From peaceFul activities to nuclear explosive devices. These saFeguards already apply in Australia. The provision of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty covering the dumping of radioactive wastes and other radioactive matter (Article 7) applies only to dumping at sea. It does not relate to the storage of nuclear materials (which includes highly enriched uranium) nor the disposal of radioactive wastes on land.

(2) What action, iF any, did the Government take to persuade the Government of Kiribati not to proceed with the agreement.",89
200,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The fisheries agreement between Kiribati and the Soviet Union has not been made pUblic. On 10 October 1985, Radio Kiribati carried a press release From the Kiribati Ministry For Natural Resources stating that the Soviet Union had paid the first instalment of $A672,OOO under the agreement and that licences were issued on 4 October For eight Soviet fishing vessels For the period 15 October 1984 to 14 October 1986. Other inFormation made public about the agreement is that licence Fee For one year's fishing by Soviet vessels is some $A2.4m; that the agreement allows Soviet vessels to fish in Kiribati's exclusive economic zone For 12 months; and that Kiribati has not granted the Soviet Union access to shore based Facilities on Kiribati. The Government has on various occasions made known to the Government of Kiribati that it has some concerns (Question No. 1717) over the implications of such ail. agreement. At the same time the Australian Government Fully recognises that Kiribati is a sovereign independent country and that decisions on such matters are the responsibility of its Government. Encryption of Telemetry (Question No. 1719)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is he able to confirm that the Soviet Union is ,involved in a high degree of encryption (scrambling) of its telemetry (radio signals From missile tests). (2) Does this encryption of mi-sile telemetry portend the increasing concealment and deception of all Soviet strategic programs. (3) Is this encryption in violation of existing arms control undertakings.",89
201,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Government does not dispute United States reports that the Soviet Union encrypts telemetry from its missile tests. (2) No judgment is possible on available information. (3) The Strategic Arms Limitation Talks II Treaty prohibits encryption of tele'metry where such encryption 'impedes verification of compliance' with the Treaty. The Government is not in a position to make an independent judgment but it notes the United States view that Soviet encryption practices constitute a violation of an obligation under SALT II prior to 1981 and a violation of their political commitment since 1982. The Government is not in a position to make an independent jUdgment but it notes the United States view that Soviet encryption practices constitute a violation of an obligation under Strategic Arms Limitation Talks II prior to 1981 and a violation of their political commitment since 1982. Soviet Approach to Strategic Defence  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is he able to confirm that the current Soviet strategic defence approach is to rely essentially on nuclear tipped anti-missiles whilst the United States strategic defence initiative is substantially based around exploring non-nuclear defence systems. (2) Is he able to say how the Soviet system is expected to work. (3) What steps has the Government taken to single out for criticism the Soviet strategic defence approach.",89
202,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question. is as follows: (I) The Government understands that the operational anti-ballistic missile complex centred on Moscow employs interceptor missiles with nuclear warheads. The United States Administration has stated that the strategic defence initiative will concentrate on exploring non-nuclear defensive systems. The Government also accepts that the Soviet Union is engaged in a research effort comparable in scope to the SDI. (2) No, but a broad description is provided in Soviet Militar), Power 1985, pp 46-48: (3) The Government is deeply concerned about the probable consequences of the pursuit of strategic defences for strategic stability and the prospects for tions in the nuclear arsenals. It is more concerned to see the full integrity of the ABM Treaty preserved than to support its demise through non-nuclear rather than nuclear means. The Government has stated that it endorses neither the SDI nor what it accepts to bedespite Soviet denials-a comparable Soviet program. The Government is also sharply critical of the excessive secrecy that surrounds Soviet military activities, including in the area of strategic defences. Soviet Laser Program  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is he able to say (a) when the Soviet Union commenced its high energy laser program, (b) how many major research and development facilities and test ranges in the Soviet Union do traditional anti-ballistic missile work, (c) how many scientists and engineers associated with the development of lasers for weapons are employed by the Soviet Government, and (d) what types of lasers is the Soviet Union conducting research into and whether these are important to the Soviet strategic defence effort.",90
203,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The most recent source of information available on these matters is the official United States publication, Soviet Strategic Defence Programs (October 1985). According to this source the answers are: (a) in the late 1960s (p.12) (b) one, at Sary Shagan (p.12) (c) over 10,000 scientists and engineers are involved in the USSR's laser program (p.12). It is not (Question No. 1720) specified how many of these may be employed in developing lasers for weapons. (d) the following types of lasers are thought to be considered by the Soviet Union to be promising or potentially promising for weapons applications: gas-dynamic; electric discharge; chemical; excimer; free-electron; and X-ray (p.I3). Religion in Vietnam (Question No. 1722)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is he able to state whether the Vietnamese Government, while tolerating the existence of religious groups, has consistently attempted to divide, control and reduce the Catholic, Buddhist, and Cao Dai churches, the Muslim community and other religious groups. (2) Is he also able to state how many priests and other members of religious orders are currently in 'reeducation camps' in Vietnam.",90
204,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) There is a report which claims that the Vietnamese Government tolerates the existence of religious groups and allows religious services but that it has consistently attempted to divide, control and reduce the Catholic, reduc- Buddhist, and Cao Dai churches, the Muslim community, and other religious groups. This report has not been confirmed. (2) There are reportedly over 100 priests detained in 're-education camps'. Reports on Inspection and Confiscation of Mail by Vietnamese Authorities (Question No. 1723)  (Question No. 1721) Affairs, upon notice, on 16 September 1985: (I) Is he able to say whether reports that the Vietnamese Ministry of the Interior inspects and sometimes confiscates international mail sent to Vietnam, particularly to politically suspect individuals or those of Chinese origin, are accurate. (2) What action has the Government taken to ensure that mail sent by the Vietnamese community in Australia to Vietnam is protected. (3) If no action has been taken, why not.",90
205,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Australia Post has advised that it is not aware of any evidence that the reports are accurate. (2) Australia Post has also advised that it has not received any enquiries or complaints concerning the interception or confiscation of mail for delivery in Vietnam. It has advised that Vietnam is a member of the Universal Postal Union and as such is bound by the provisions of the Acts, but that there is no explicit provision in the Acts of the UPU which guarantees the privacy of the mails. (3) Australia Post has advised that any claims that mail is being intercepted and confiscated would, following the normal procedures in such cases, be examined by it on a case-by-case basis. Vietnam's Position on Human Rights Groups (Question No. 1724)  Affairs, upon notice, on 16 September 1985: (I) Can he indicate whether Vietnam is (a) not a member of any international human rights organisation and (b) not active in attempting to ameliorate the human rights situation in other countries. (2) Does the Vietnamese Government not permit the existence in Vietnam of private groups concerned with human rights.",91
206,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) Vietnam is not a member of any international human rights organisation. However, it has signed: (i) The International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights; (ii) The International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, and (iii) The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women. (b) It is not active in attempting to ameliorate the human rights situation in other countries. (2) According to a report, the Vietnamese Government does not permit the existence in Vietnam of private groups concerned with human rights. Clandestine Departures from Vietnam (Question No. 1725)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: To be able to state whether, despite the Orderly, Departure Scheme, during 1984, refugees continued to leave Vietnam clandestinely and that Hanoi and provincial radio stations broadcast reports of executions or of lengthy jail sentences for organisers of failed escape attempts, as well as punishment dealt to others implicated.",91
207,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: During 1984, refugees continued to leave Vietnam clandestinely, although at a lower rate than past years. Hanoi and provincial radio stations have broadcast reports of executions or of lengthy jail sentences for organisers of failed escape attempts, as, well as punishments dealt to others implicated. Sanctions (Question No. 1727)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) Is it a fact that on 2 May 1985 he said: (a) he regretted the United States decision to impose an economic boycott against Nicaragua and (b) that the action was severe and unlikely to bring the Sandinistas to heel, but rather increase their resolve to withstand United States pressures. (2) If so, would sanctions have a similarly counterproductive effect on the South African Government; if not, why not.",91
208,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) Yes. (b) The United States economic embargo against Nicaragua was a unilateral action which did not receive significant international support and was not joined by any other country. As also pointed out in my statement of 2 May, the embargo was also unhelpful to the Contadora process. It was the Government's assessment that in these circumstances, the embargo was a severe step which would not succeed in bringing about changes in the attitude of the Nicaraguan Government desired by the United States. The Government's belief that the action was likely to increase the resolve of the Nicaraguan Government to resist United States pressure has in fact proved to be the case. . (2) The situation' in South Africa and the international community's response to it is not analogous to that of Nicaragua. The Government takes the view that concerted international economic and other measures are important and effective means of exerting pressure on South Africa to encourage peaceful change. This approach is in keeping with the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Nassau where the Government committed itself to encourage an effective process of change and reform in South Africa. The main elements of the Government's approach is the implementation of a range of measures to be introduced in a graduated way and the establishment of mechanisms for dialogue through a group of eminent persons. The Government does not seek to impose sanctions measures for their own sake. We seek rather to playa constructive role in developing proposals to assist the peaceful transition of South Africa to a non-racial society based on universal adult suffrage. Visit to Australia of the Foreign Minister of Nicaragua (Question No. 1728)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: What are the dates of the visit to Australia of the Foreign Minister of Nicaragua, FrMiguel D'Escoto Brockmann.",91
209,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A visit to Australia by the Nicaraguan Foreign Minister was earlier scheduled for late August this year. The visit was postponed at the request of the Nicaraguan Government and dates in November are currently under consideration. Nicaragua: Statement by United States  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Has his attention been drawn to a statement by United States National Security Affairs Advisor, Robert MCFarlane, that the link between Nicaragua and the murder of six Americans in San Salvador is very clear. (2) If so, is he also able substance to this comment.",92
210,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) The Government is unaware of the evidence upon which Mr MCFarlane based his comment. Insurgents in Nicaragua  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is he able to say whether in Nicaragua there are 16,000 armed insurgents in a nation of 3.2 million, and another 3,000 to 5,000 rebels without arms or equipment. (2) If so, do their ranks include poor peasants, small farmers, Indians, devout christians, draft resisters, and deserters from the Sandinista army. 0(3) Is he able to indicate whether the political leadership of the Democratic Resistance is made up of committed democrats, such as Arturo Cruz, Alfonso Robelo and Adolfo Calero. (4) Will the Government call on the Nicaraguan Government to establish democratic freedoms and respect for human rights.",92
211,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The figures available on the number of antiGovernment Nicaraguan Contras in Nicaragua, and in neighbouring countries, vary according to source. The Contras themselves have claimed that they have more than 16,000 men under arms. The Nicaraguan Government, on the other hand, puts their numbers at about 12,000. (2) The vast majority of Contra troops are believed to be peasants, but there are also numbers of Miskito Indians and members of other indigenous groups, and officers and men of the National Guard of former dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle. There have been reports that young men fleeing the draft in Nicaragua and deserters from the, Sandinist Popular Army have joined the Contras. Other reports allege forcible recruitment of peasants and draft evaders by Contras both in Nicaragua and among displaced Nicaraguans in neighbouring countries. Most of the Contra senior command are former members of the National Guard of Somoza. (3) 'Democratic Resistance' is a term used by the United States Government to describe the external opposition and in particular the armed insurgent groups who are collectively known as Contras. The political arm of the major Contra groups is the recently formed Unified Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO). UNO's political program includes calls for: Official national reconciliation based on amnesty and total (Question No. 1729) pardon for political and related crimes applicable to all Nicaraguans without exception; development of a democratic political and judicial system. Arturo Cruz, Alfonso Robelo and Adolfo Calero are members of the 12-man Council of UNO. All three are 'businessmen who participated to varying degrees in opposition to the regime of Anastasio Somza. to state whether there is any Before breaking with the Sandinistas in 1981, Arturo Cruz served as Director of Nicaragua's Central Bank, a member of the Governing Junta for National Reconstruction, and then as Nicaraguan Ambassador to the United States. Cruz was a presidential candidate for the Nicaraguan opposition grouping, the Coordinadora Democratica, before the group withdrew from the November 1984 elections. Alfonso Robelo founded the Nicaraguan Democratic (Question No. 1730) Movement (MDN) in 1978. The MDN later joined the Broad Opposition Front (FAO), which unsuccessfully sought to negotiate a settlement with the Somoza regime in 1978-79. Robelo served briefly on the governing Junta which initially replaced Somoza. He was leader of the political wing of the Revolutionary Democratic Alliance (ARDE), a Contra group operating from Cost Rica which split in 1984. Robelo's faction then joined the main Contra group, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN). Adolfo Calero is political head of the FDN. He was leader of the Conservative Democratic Party in Nicaragua and later became a member of the FAO. Calero left Nicaragua in 1982. The three persons mentioned all espouse democratic principles but their influence (particularly that of Cruz and Robelo) over the military arm of the UNO, which is essentially the FDN, is believed to be minimal. The military commanders of the FDN are mainly former Somoza National Guardsmen, who could not be regarded as 'committed democrats'. It is a common assessment that the formation of UNO and the presence within it of persons such as Cruz and Robelo is intended to provide some international respectability to the Contras. (4) The Government has expressed concern at the erosion of pluralism and civil liberties in Nicaragua on a number of occasions and will continue to do so where appropriate. Most recently, I said in a speech delivered to the Australian Human Rights Congress on Central America on 21, July 1985, that the human rights record of the Sandinistas' since the revolution has not been immaculate and that it would be a tragedy, after what the Nicaraguans have been through, if they trampled human rights in the rush to the barricades. At the same time, the Government has made clear that it believes the human rights record of the Nicaraguan Government to be considerably better than those of some other Central American Governments. The human rights record of the Contras is atrocious. Eastern Bloc Military Assistance to Nicaragua (Question No. 1731)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is he able to state whether there are some 3,000 Cuban military or security personnel in Nicaragua attached to the armed forces, internal security, and intelligence organisations. (2) Is he also able to state whether there are substantial numbers of Soviet, East German and Libyan military and security advisors to the Sandinista Government.",92
212,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Publicly available reports on the number of Cuban personnel acting as advisers to the Nicaraguan Armed forces and to the Nicaraguan security authorities have consistently estimated their number in the range of 2,000 to 3,000. (2) There are also reports of the presence in Nicaragua of military and security advisers from Eastern bloc cOllntries and Libya. The Nicaraguan armed forces, which have been engaged in conflict with United Statesassisted Contra insurgents, are mainly supplied by Eastern bloc countries. There has been evidence that Libya has in the past delivered arms and equipment to Nicaragua. It is highly likely that personnel from the supplying countries are engaged in installation and maintenance of this equipment and in training in its use. Nicaragua: Military Situation (Question No. 1732)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is he able to state whether (a) Soviet bloc investment in Nicaragua for the construction of nearly 40 new military facilities runs to approximately $US70m and (b) the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Bulgaria, East Germany and Cuba are building critical infrastructure facilities, at great expense, which will have important military uses. (2) Is he also able to state whether (a) the 10,000 foot runway at the Punta Huete Airfield, when completed, will be the longest military runway in Central America and (b) the Sandinista Air Force Commander has admitted that it would be a military air base, (c) when Punta Huete becomes operational it will be able to accommodate any aircraft in the Soviet bloc inventory and (d) Sandinista acquisition of jet aircraft would destabilise the regional military balance.",93
213,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I (a) and (b) various reports on Eastern bloc military assistance to Nicaragua are available to the Government, including the United States State Department/ Defense Department booklet on which these questions are based. While trends are clear, it is often difficult to be certain about details. Some earlier reports which made categorical claims about Soviet assistance were later shown to be in error. Eastern bloc assistance has been applied to a variety of purposes, the total value of which would be in excess of $US70m. The assistance includes provision of military equipment and training, civil aid and provision of civilian technical advisers. Nicaragua also receives aid From Western countries (though no longer from the United States). However, its parlous econonic situation and the ongoing conflict with the Contras has resulted in increasing reliance on the Eastern bloc. As the Nicaraguan Government considers that its national sovereignty is under threat, it is to be expected that much of the aid is channelled into military areas. Nicaragua's inFrastructural needs are great. Facilities constructed with Eastern bloc assistance could presumably be used for military purposes if necessary. 2 (a) There are other runways of this length at Goloson International Airport, Honduras, EI Salvador International Airport, General Torrijos Herrera Airport, Panama, and Santa Elena Peten Airport in Guatemala, which could be used for military purposes if required. (b) It is the Government's understanding that Punta Huete will be a military airned. The Government has not seen a text of the reported admission by the Nicaraguan Air Force Commander to this effect. (c) Yes. (d) There is considerable debate over what constitutes the 'regional military balance'. This issue is one of the sticking points in the present Contadora negotiations. The Nicaraguan army is larger and better equipped than those of any of its Central American neighbours. However, the Nicaraguan air force inventory of fixed-wing aircraft is obsolete and inferior to that of each of Honduras and EI Salvador. In addition, Nicaraguan public statements express fears of US invasion. Nicaragua's armed forces expansion is undoubtedly based partly on these fears. The Nicaraguan concept of 'balance' then is quite different to that of other Central American countries, which are unwilling to accept a situation of Nicaraguan superiority over them, individually or collectively. There could also be debate over the term 'jet aircraft', which might refer to anything from a trainer to a sophisticated high performance fighter. Any judgement about the significance of acquiring jet aircraft would obviously depend on the type and quantity of aircraft involved. The United States has indicated that it would regard the acquisition of 'sophisticated fighter aircraft' as a provocative development. The Australian Government has consistently taken the view that military action will not solve the problems of Central America. Irrespective of the various concepts of 'balance', a Central American arms race would be a wasteful diversion of resources, likely only to exacerbate tensions and to hinder the search for a peaceful, negotiated settlement. Nicaragua (Question No. 1733)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is he able to state whether the Soviet Union has provided the Nicaraguan Government with (a) tanks, (b) armoured vehicles, (c) howitzers, (d) rocket launchers, (e) helicopters, (f) anti-tank missiles, (g) trucks, (h) artillery and (i) armoured personnel vehicles. (2) If so, in what quantities, in each case.",93
214,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) Various reports on these matters are available to the Government. Two from which I can quote are United States State Department/Defense Department papers of July 1984 and March 1985, which draw in part on intelligence sources. They provide the following details of Eastern bloc (mostly Soviet) supplied equipment: (a) Tanks: Nearly 110 medium tanks (T-54/T-55), over 20 light amphibious tanks (PT-76). (b) Armoured Vehicles: approximately 200 (in addition to the above). (c) Howitzers: almost 50 152mm and I 22mm. (d) Rocket Launchers: 24x122mm. (e) Helicopters: 30, including 5-8 Mi-24/HIND-D attack helicopters. (f) Anti-tank missiles: no figures available. (The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Yearbook 1984 notes that Nicaragua has acquired unknown quantities of Soviet-made A 7-1 Snapper and AT-3 Sagger surface-to-surface guided anti-tank missiles.) (g) Trucks: at least 1,000. (h) Artillery: No reference to artillery as such. The earlier paper refers to 120 anti-aircraft guns and 700 SA-7 surface-to air missiles. (i) Armoured personnel carriers: included in (b), above. Different reports give somewhat varying figures, due to the difficulties in assessing information and the varying times at which information was collected. The Government has not seen any Soviet or Nicaraguan objection to the information reported above. Nicaraguan Armed Forces (Question No. 1734)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Is he able to state whether: (a) the Sandinista army has grown from a force of about 5,000 in 1979 to a 62,000 active duty force, with an additional 57,OOO.in the reserves and the lT1ilitia; . (b) in late 1983 the Sandinistas instituted the first draft in Nicaragua's history; and (c) Nicaragua's armed force is the largest in Central America.",94
215,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The number of Sandinista insurgents active in Nicaragua in 1979, the year of the overthrow of the Somoza regime, is not known accurately. The political membership of the Sandinista Front for National Liberation (FSLN) at the time of Somoza's overthrow is estimated to have been about 5,000. At the time of its maximum strength in 1979, Somoza's National Guard numbered approximately 10,000. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies publication The Military Balance for 1984-85, the Nicaraguan Army stood at 60,000 (48,000 regular soldiers plus 12,000 reservists on active duty). There were 48,000 (all services) in the reserves. Other reports give slightly varying figures. (b) The draft was introduced in Nicaragua on I October 1983. This was the second time in Nicaragua's history such action had been taken; the Somoza regime introduced a draft in 1973 for a two-year period. (c) According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Nicaragua's Army and reserves were larger than those of any of the other four Central American countries. However, the air forces of EI Salvador and Honduras are widely held to be superior to that of Nicaragua. Nicaragua (Question No. 1735)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Is he able to state whether: (a) since 1979, the Sandinista Government has placed under direct State control nearly half of Nicaragua's industry and 40 per cent of its agriculture. (b) the Sandinistas control all media outlets through censorship and that La Prensa, the only major opposition newspaper, is censored every day and its writers and editors, harassed; and (c) neighbourhood watch committees, informant networks, rationing of many basic necessities and enforced participation in Sandinista organisations are all used to control and intimidate the people.",94
216,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) In early 1985, an economic adviser io the Nicaraguan Government estimated that Government's participation in various sectors of the economy as follows: Agriculture 25 per cent Mining 100 per cent Construction and Energy Majority participation (Other) industry 30 per cent Expropriation has been selective. Confiscation of the property of the family of the deposed dictator, Anastasio Somoza, itself had a marked impact on the public/private sector profile. Most estimates suggest that properties and businesses owned by the Somoza family and close associates accounted for approximately 40% of the country's economic resources. (b) Media censorship has been in force in Nicaragua continuously since March 1982, when a State of Emergency was declared in response to an intensification of anti-Government Contra activity. All media outlets are subject to prior censorship, including the independent daily newspaper La Prensa. Press items on military matters are specifically prohibited, and in the case of La Prensa, articles critical of the Government have often, but not always, been censored. (c) Sandinista Defence Committees originated as neighbourhood self-defence groups during the campaign to overthrow the Somoza regime. They function as municipal authorities and their responsibilities include the distribution of ration cards, organising neighbourhood groups to attend rallies, issuing of letters of recommendation for the issue of licences, loans, business permits, involvement in mass vaccination campaigns, and patrolling of neighbourhoods at night. These functions entail a degree of social control and there exists the potential for abuse of such powers by individuals and by the Nicaraguan Government. At a recent National Congress of Sandinista Defence Committees, participants acknowledged that many abuses had occurred and adopted measures aimed at eliminating them. Aid to the Philippines  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) What was the level of development assistance to the Philippines for (a) 1979-80, (b) 1980-81, (c) 198182, (d) 1982-83, (e) 1983-84, (f) 1984-85? (2) What is the proposed level of assistance for 198586 and how is this to be allocated?",94
217,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) 1979/80. (b) 1980/81. (c) 1981/82. (d) 1982/83. (e) 1983/84. (f) 1984/85.

218,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government's support for increased Australian press representation in Jakarta has been made well known to the Indonesian Government. I have personally conveyed the Government's support for greater access (Question No. 1736) to Indonesia being given to Australian journalists, including permanent representation, on a number of the occasions on which I have met with senior members of the Indonesian Government. The current Ambassador in Jakarta, Mr Bill Morrison, has also made high level representations in this respect. The honourable member will have noted that permanent representation in Jakarta was recently granted to the Australian Financial Review by the Indonesian Government. He will also know that a representative of the Australian Associated Press has been accredited in Jakarta since mid-1983. $'000 Antarctica 7,873 11,479 (Question No. 1738)  16,707 Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: 17,762 21,076 (I) At what official level have representations been made to the Malaysian Government over its attempt ,to pursue Antarctica as part of the common heritage of mankind at the United Nations. (2) What was the outcome of these representations and what further action does the Government propose.",95
219,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable $'000 member's question is as follows: (I) The matter has been raised with the Malaysian 6,500 Government at Prime Ministerial level. I have discussed it on various occasions with my Malaysian counterpart. 1,500 There have also been regular exchanges at senior official level, particularly between our respective Permanent 360 Representatives at the United Nations. 480 (2) The Malaysian Government continues to pursue 1,960 its Antarctic initiative. Australia and other Antarctic 10,800 Treaty Parties are in close contact on this matter. They 1,649 are unanimous in their opposition to the Malaysian 641 approach and in their support for the maintenance of the existing Antarctic Treaty system. This has been 484 made clear to a range of other governments through our diplomatic missions. The matter will be considered again 1,247 at the current session of the United Nations General Assembly. The Government will continue to support 1,625 the Antarctic Treaty system, which fosters peaceful international cooperation in the Antarctic and is the best means of furthering Australian interests there. Multinational Force and Observers: Sinai  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (1) Did both the Israeli Government and the Egyptian Government make separate and formal approaches to the Australian Government to reverse its decision to .withdraw the Australian multinational peace-keeping force in the Sinai. (2) Will the Australian withdrawal be the first from the 10 nation force in the Sinai.",95
220,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. They were advised of the Government's position and that the decision was firm. (2) Yes. The Australian Government does not see its participation in any peace-keeping operation as being open-ended and believes that contribution to such forces should be shared equitably by the international community. The Government welcomes the decision of Canada to provide a replacement unit for the Australian contingent. Multinational Force and Observers: Sinai  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Did he state in 1984 that in the past he had been an articulate and active opponent of Australia's involvement in the Sinai but that he had seen both sides were committed to a settlement and the presence of a peace-keeping force would make that settlement possible. (2) If so, why has he changed his mind regarding the retention of a peace-keeping force in the Sinai; if not, why did he proceed with the withdrawal of the Australian contingent.",96
221,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) In my statement to the Parliament of 7 May 1984, in which I announced the Government's decision to agree to a limited extension of the participation of the Australian contingent on the Multinational Force and Observers, I noted that the Australian Labor Party had expressed major reservations about Australian involvement at the time it was initially mooted in 1981. My visit to the Middle East in January 1984 was particularly intended to assess the role and effectiveness of the MFO and Australian participation in it. I found that the MFO was performing its task effectively and had contributed to stability in the region; and that both Egypt and Israel appeared to be committed to peace. While there had been a settlement of one element of the Middle East problem, other aspects, in particular the Palestinian issue, remain unresolved. (2) The reasons for the Government's decision regarding Australia's contribution to the MFO were outlined in my statement of 7 May 1984. Nuclear Energy: Australian Science and Technology Council Inquiry (Question No. 1741)  Affairs, upon notice, on 25 November 1985: (I) Did the Government accept recommendation 5 of the Australian Science and Technology Council inquiry into Australia's role in the nuclear fuel cycle. (2) If so, did the Government undertake to convince nuclear suppliers, particularly the emerging suppliers, of the importance of acceptance of the recommendation. (3) Did the Government also undertake to contact the countries bilaterally. (4) If so, on what dates were the relevant countries approached.",96
222,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I and 2) Yes. The Government's response to recommendation 5 of the ASTEC inquiry, tabled in Parliament on 24 May 1985, was as follows: 'The Government accepts the recommendation. Australia will participate in international activities on supplier guidelines as a proponent of stricter controls and procedures, particularly in relation to supply to non-NPT countries. Bilaterally it will seek to convince nuclear suppliers, particularly the emerging suppliers, of the importance of acceptance of these controls for the non-proliferation regime. It will encourage broader (Question No. 1739) participation in relevant international groups considering these matters where this will enhance the groups' effectiveness. ' (3) Yes. See above. (4) The Government has approached a wide range of countries in the context of the Third Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference, and in particular in pursuing at the Conference the objective of acceptance of full-scope safeguards as a condition of supply. In addition, the Government has acted in accordance with its response to the recommendation in the NPT suppliers committee, known as the Zangger Committee, and in other nuclear supplier consultations. Bilateral contacts were made with a wide range of countries in the pursuit of Australia's full-scope safeguards initiative at the NPT Review Conference (see reply to question no. 1742). Pending the outcome of current international consideration of how more broadly bases supplier controls might be implemented, Australia has continued to encourage emerging nuclear supplier countries to adhere to the NPT. Specific approaches have been made by Australia during 1985 to India, Pakistan, Israel, South Africa, Argentina and Brazil. Australian Science and Technology Council Inquiry: Australia's Role in the Nuclear Fuel Cycle (Question No. 1742)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Did the Government accept recommendation 3 of the Australian Science and Technology Council inquiry into Australia's role into the nuclear fuel cycle. (2) If so, did the Government undertake to seek the agreement of other supplier countries to the approach recommended. (3) What other supplier countries have been contacted in execution of this undertaking and when were these countries approached.",96
223,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) Yes. In its nuclear policy statement tabled in the House on 23 May 1985 in response to the Australian Science and Technology Council Report on Australia's Role in the Nuclear Fuel Cycle, the Government stated. the following in respect of recommendation 3: 'The Government accepts this recommendation and will seek the agreement of other supplier countries to this approach. Australia's supply policies require non-nuclear weapon state customers to be members of the NPT and to have IAEA safeguards applied to all their nuclear facilities at all times. Several major suppliers, by subscribing to the Nuclear Suppliers Guidelines, require IAEA safeguards and other controls and conditions on supplied nuclear items, but do not require recipient States to be members of the NPT or to accept IAEA safeguards on all their nuclear facilities at all times. Australia does not consider this approach satisfactory. Permitting nonnuclear weapon States which have not made binding non-proliferation commitments to acquire nuclear items on less stringent conditions than countries which have made such commitments lessens the incentive to join the NPT. Australia has pressed its position in multilateral forums and in bilateral contacts with relevant countries. In addition the matter will be pursued by Australia in. the run-up to and at the 1985 NPT Review Conference.' (3) The objective set out in ASTEC recommendation 3 has been pursued over a long period, including at international meetings held prior to the tabling of the Government's response to the ASTEC Report, such as the Western suppliers' meeting held in Luxembourg in July 1984 and all three Preparatory Committee meetings (April and October 1984 and April/May 1985) held in advance of the Third NPT Review Conference (27 August-21 September 1985). At Preparatory Committee Meetings for the Review Conference, Australia also held bilateral meetings with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Yugoslavia, Egypt and Sweden. At the Review Conference itself, Australia obtained further support for its approach and this is recorded in the final document of the Conference. In addition the following bilateral consultations have been held on or including this matter during 1985: January/February-Canada, United States February/March-Japan, FRG, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands March (in Canberra)-United Kingdom and USSR May (in Canberra)-United States June-FRG, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Belgium and Spain October-Brazil Mr E. G. Whitlam: Fund Raising Activities (Question No. 1743)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is it a fact that the Australian Government official representative to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation was involved in a fund raising activity for the Australian Labor Party. (2) Did he sanction this activity; if so, why. (3) If not, what action has he ,taken to discipline the representative concerned.",97
224,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I understand that Mr E. G. Whitlam, Australia's Ambassador to UNESCO, did sign a fund raising letter for the ALP recently. I also understand that this letter was not signed under any government or embassy letterhead. (2) Mr Whitlam signed the letter in his capacity as a well known, much respected former leader of the party, not in his capacity as Australia's Ambassador to UNESCO. (3) I gavemy prior approval to Mr Whitlam with the stipulation that the letter should only go the party members, since Mr Whitlam was acting in his capacity as a party member and former leader. I understand that through error some letters in fact went to non party members. I do not intend to reprimand Mr Whitlam for this error by the Secretariat. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation: Pronouncements by Mr E. G. Whitlam (Question No. 1744)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Has the Australian Ambassador to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation in his public pronouncements on that organisation and before that organisation always reflected the views of the Australian Government; if not, (a) on what occasions and (b) what statements does the Australian Government disagree with.",97

South Pacific Regional Security Arrangements (Question No. 1746)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Has the Government announced its attitude to the proposal by the New Zealand Government for a coordinated South Pacific regional security arrangement; if so, what was its attitude.",97
227,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Australia's attitude to the New Zealand Government's recent proposal was expressed by the Prime Minister when it was considered at the South Pacific Forum meeting In Rarotonga in August this year. As indicated in his press conference following the Forum meeting, Mr Hawke stated that existing arrangements for regional defence cooperation were already working effectively and, through current Australian and New Zealand defence cooperation programs, the security concerns of the countries in the South Pacific region were already being met. Thus, rather than create new arrangements, the Australian Government felt that any additional resources that may become available would probably be better spent in adding to these existing programs. The Forum took no decision on the proposal presented by the New Zealand Prime Minister. Soviet Particle Beam Research (Question No. 1747)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is he able to say when the Soviet Union commenced its research program into the technical feasibilities of particle beam weapons in space.

237,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. Krasnoyarsk Radar and the Anti-Ballistic (Question No. 1767)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is the construction by the Soviet Union of radar facilities at Krasnoyarsk in violation of the Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty. (2) Does the new radar foreshadow a significant step towards a nationwide anti-ballistic missile capability. (3) Is he able to say whether the construction of a new radar was planned in the early 1970s which was the heyday of detente and of high rising expectations for arms control. (4) What representations has the Government made to the Soviet Union expressing their concern over the development of the radar.",100
238,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Government is aware of United States allegations that the large phased array radar currently under construction near the Soviet city of Krasnoyarsk is a violation of the ABM Treaty. There appears to be a case to answer and the Government urges the Soviet Union to take appropriate steps to respond to Western concerns and demonstrate it's compliance with this important Treaty. (2) The Government is aware of United States concerns to this effect. (3) It is not known when the radar near Krasnoyarsk was planned. The United States first detected it in 1983. (4) Representations have been made to the Soviet Union on this issue. It would not be appropriate to give details of confidential exchanges between Governments.

(2) Has the Soviet Union given any such assurance that it will honour all treaty obligations and what steps has the Australian Government taken to seek such assurances.",100
239,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. To elaborate, President Reagan said on 10 June 1985 that the United States would continue to not undercut the expired Strategic Arms Limitations Talks I agreement or the unratified SALT II agreement as long as the Soviet Union exercised equal restraint. He also said that where Soviet violations are irreversible the United States reserved the right to respond in a proportionate manner at the appropriate time. With regard to the ABM Treaty, Secretary of State Shultz said in a speech on 24 October 1985 that 'our research program is and will continue to be consistent with the ABM Treaty' and 'our SOl research program has been strucMissile Treaty tured and, as the President reaffirmed last Friday, will continue to be conducted in accordance with a restrictive interpretation of the Treaty's obligations'. (2) Yes. Since the expiry of the SALT I interim agreement on offensive weapons in 1977 and since 1981 when the Reagan Administration made clear its intention not to ratify the SALT II agreement the Soviet Union has joined the United States in a series of political commitments to refrain from actions that would undercut these agreements. In an authorative booklet, Star Wars; Dangers and Delusions (1985) it was stated that 'the USSR abides rigidly by the provisions of the permanent ABM Treaty signed in 1972'. In bilateral discussions with the Soviet Union on arms control and disarmament issues the Government has urged full compliance with the provisions of existing treaties. Devaluation of the Australian Dollar (Question No. 1769)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Has he taken any action to ensure that any additional costs of maintaining representation overseas, as a result of the devaluation of the Australian dollar, have been kept to a minimum; if so, what are the details.",100
240,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: All estimates, including increased costs as a result of the devaluation of the Australian dollar, are subjected to the most rigorous examination during the formulation of the Budget. Funding for departmental administrative expenses (Division 316/2) for 1985-86 was increased by $6,074,323 (18.7 per cent) over 1984-85 expenditure. Of this amount $5,509,391 (17.0 per cent) represented unavoidable increased funding to compensate for the devaluation of the Australian dollar. Thus the increase in funding to meet other unavoidable cost increases has been limited to $564,932 (1.7 per cent). This small increase is insufficient to cover inflationary costs and has led to an overall reduction of activity in real terms. Expenditure is continually monitored by the Central office of the Department and Heads of Mission have been reminded of their responsibility to also monitor closely all expenditure. In addition overseas posts have been advised by Departmental Circular that additional funding can only be provided in exceptional circumstances. Devaluation of the Australian Dollar (Question No. 1770)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: What increases in the cost of maintaining Australia's representation overseas has occurred in each country since January 1985 because of the devaluation of the Australian dollar.",100
241,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It is not practicable to provide, on a per country basis, the increased operational costs stemming from devaluation since January 1985. The Department of Finance has agreed to provide supplementary funding to meet increased costs of the Department of Foreign Affairs' overseas representation resulting from the devaluation of the Australian dollar. The amounts provided in 1984-85 and 1985-86 are as follows: Overseas Salaries and Allowances-Division 316/1 1,481,644 Overseas Administrative ExpensesDivision 316/2 801,100 Foreign Minister's Visits to Washington and Hanoi (Question No; 1771)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: How often has he visited (a) Washington and (b) Hanoi in his Ministerial capacity.",101
242,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) I visited Washington from 15 to 22 July 1983 for the ANZUS Council meeting and from 9 to II October this year for bilateral consultations. (b) I visited Hanoi on 29 to 30 June 1983 for bilateral consultations and from 6 to 8 March this year for bilateral consultations and discussions on Cambodia.

243,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (i) In 1984/85, $3.993m was provided in humanitarian aid through Australian non-government organisations, and through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) for Cambodians living inside Cambodia. This included $1.429m as emergency relief following floods. In addition, $100,000 was provided to the Quaker Service Council of Australia for English language training for Cambodians. (ii) A total of $1.569m in humanitarian aid was provided through the United Nations Border Relief Organisation, the International Committee of the Red Cross and UNHCR for Cambodian refugees in holding camps inside Thailand and for displaced Cambodians in the Thai/Cambodia border region. The latter included emergency relief of $200,000 following forced relocation of border camps. 1984-85 1985-86 Actual Budget All aid was provided indirectly through international $ $ or non-government organisations. Assurances on Strategic Defence 5,346,944 (Question No. 1773)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: 5,509,391 Is he able to say whether: (a) the United States has stated that (i) its purpose is to enhance deterrence and (ii) that it has pledged 2,282,744 10,856,335 that it would not deploy any anti-ballistic missile defensive system before negotiations with the Soviet Union and (b) the Soviet Union has given a similar undertaking or indication of intentions; if not, what action has the Government taken to seek such an undertaking.",101
244,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) (i) Yes. (a) (ii) Yes. The United States has also stated that this commitment, which is pursuant to ABM Treaty obligations, does not mean that the Soviet Union will have a veto over the outcome. (b) Yes, (see answer to question No. 1768). The USSR is strongly opposed to any renegotiation of the ABM Treaty. The authoritative Soviet booklet Star Wars: Dangers and Delusions, stated (p. 39): 'The USSR is not developing any space strike weapons. And it has no intention of building a 'nation-wide' missile defence system'. Cuban Representation in Vanuatu (Question No. 1774)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Is he able to indicate: (a) what the extent of Cuban representation in Vanuatu is, (b) which (i) Cuban officials have visited Vanuatu since the establishment of diplomatic relations, (ii) the status of these officials, and and (c) whether any Eastern Bloc aid has been provided to the Vanuatu Government, if so, what are the details.",102
245,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Cuba and Vanuatu established diplomatic relations on 25 July 1983. Since that time Cuba has been represented by Ambassadors accredited on a non-resident basis, at first from Tokyo and more recently from Manila; (b) (i) to (iii) The non-resident Cuban Ambassador in Tokyo visited Vanuatu for 8 days in July 1983 to present credentials and in July 1984 for 8 days to make farewell calls. The non-resident Ambassador in Manila visited Vanuatu in April 1985 for 8 days to present credentials. On that occasion she was accompanied by the Cuban Consul-General from Sydney. The Ambassador visited Vanuatu again in July/August 1985 for 4 days for Independence celebrations; (c) The Government is not aware of any Eastern Bloc aid having been provided to the Vanuatu Government. Moscow Anti-Ballistic Missile System (Question No. 1775)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Is he able to indicate whether the Soviet Union has deployed the world's only operational anti-ballistic missilesystem - around Moscow and whether this system is currently being upgraded.",102
246,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Soviet Union deploys around Moscow the world's only operational anti-ballistic missile system. Soviet Strategic Defence Programs (pp. 7-12) describes the system and the current modernisation/upgrading of the system. This deployment is in accordance with the provisions of the ABM Treaty. Deployment of Soviet Ballistic Missiles (Question No. 1776)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Is he able to indicate (a) how many major deployments of new fourth generation inter-continental ballistic missiles the Soviet Union has made since the signing of the 1972 Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty I Interim Agreement, (b) how many new Soviet ICBMs are being flight tested, (c) how many missiles and new war heads have been deployed by the Soviet Union, (d) what are the comparative figures for the United States in the same period, (e) whether the number of war heads on Soviet ballistic missiles have increased by more than 50 per cent since 1979 and (f) whether, by taking advantage of their throw-weight, the Soviet capability to destroy hard targets has increased by an even greater amount.",102
247,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (iii) the length of the visits, (a) The Soviet Union has not made such information publicly available, but United States Government publications and statements indicate that the Soviet Union has deployed a total of 818 'fourth generation' (a US term) ICBMs since the signing of the SALT I Interim Agreement in 1972, as follows: SS17 (US designation) 150 SSI8 (US designation) 308 SS19 (US designation) 360 At the same time the Soviet Union has also retired a large number of older ICBMs since the signing of the SALT I Interim Agreement. (b) The United States believes the Soviet Union has flight tested two new ICBMs, which it designated the SS-X-24 and the SS-X-25 (now redesignated the SS25). The Soviet Union denies that the SS25 is' a new ICBM and has said that it is a modernisation of an existing ICBM, the SS13. (c) It is assumed that the question relates to deployment of ballistic missiles over the period since the signing of the SALT I Interim Agreement in May 1972, when the United States estimated that the Soviet Union had a total of 1618 ICBM and 740 SLBM launchers either operational or under construction. The Statement of Data on the Numbers of Strategic Offensive Arms as of the Date of Signature of the Treaty made by the Soviet Union when signing the Salt II Treaty on 18 June 1979 indicates that the Soviet Union possessed 1398 ICBM launchers at that time, a reduction of 230 on the number of ICBM launchers either under construction or operational at the signing of Salt I, and 950 launchers of SLBMs (as permitted under the SALT I Interim Agreement), an increase of 210. The figure for ICBM launchers remains the same today. The number of SLBM launchers fluctuates from time to time as new systems are introduced and older ones retired, but remains in the vicinity of the 950 limit specified in the SALT I Interim Agreement. The number of 'fourth generation' Soviet ICBMs deployed since the signing of SALT I is given in (a) above. In addition the Government has noted recent Statements by the United States Secretary of Defense, Mr Weinberger, that the Soviet Union recently commenced deployment of the first of its 'fifth generation' ICBMs, the SS25. As the Soviet Union does not make such information available, it is not possible to be precise as to the number of new Soviet ballistic missile warheads deployed since 1972. Most authoritative Western public sources estimate that the numbers of Soviet ICBM warheads rose from around 1500 in 1972 to around 6300 today and that Soviet SLBM warheads increased over the same period from around 450 to around 2150 today. (d) In 1972 the United States had 1054 ICBMs and 656 SLBMs, compared with around 1025 ICBMs and 648 SLBMs today. In the same period United States ICBM warheads rose from around 1500 to around 2125, and SLBM warheads from around 2400 to around 5750. (e) Public sources of such information differ on this point. For example the SIPRI Yearbooks for 1980 and 1984 indicate this to be the case: but graphs which appear on pages 30 and 33 of the United States Defense Department publication 'Soviet Military Power 1985' appear to give a contrary indication. (f) Calculations of the quantity known as 'hard target kill potential' depend on a number of factors and assumptions relating to the number of attacking warheads and their estimated accuracy and explosive power. The trend since 1979 towards deployment by the Soviet Union of more accurate missiles with mUltiple warheads has significantly increased Soviet hard target kill potential: but in view of the uncertainties associated with information in the public record on the increase in the number of Soviet ballistic missile warheads since 1979 (see (e) above), it is not possible to state with certainty by how much. Soviet SS20 Ballistic Missile (Question No. 1777)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Is he able to indicate whether (a) the Soviet Union's SS20 force of intermediate range missiles is expected to expand to over 450 deployed launches by 1987 as a result of an extensive program of constructing new bases, (b) more such new bases were started in 1984 than in any previous year and (c) the foJlow on to the SS20 which carries three warheads and is designed to improve lethality, began flight testing in 1984. MrHayden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a), (b) and (c). The Soviet Union does not provide such information about its forces. The Government has noted unclassified testimony to this effect by two senior United States officials-Robert M. Gates, Chairman, National Intelligence Council, and Deputy Director for Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency and Lawrence K. Gershwin, National Intelligence Officer for Strategic Programs, National Intelligence Council-to a joint session of the Sub-Committee on Strategic and Theater Nuclear Forces of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Defense Sub-Committee of the Senate Committee on Appropriations of the United States Senate on 26 June 1985-and has no reason to question (b) and (c). In relation to (a) it would caution that this assessment was based on data available as at late June 1985. Consequently it may need to be revised in the light of developments subsequent to June 1985. Soviet Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile Force (Question No. 1778)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Is he able to indicate whether the Soviet Union's InterContinental Ballistic Missile force will have been almost entirely replaced with new systems by the mid 1990's.",102
248,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Soviet Union does not provide such information about its forces. The Government has noted unclassified testimony to this effect by two senior United States officials-Robert M. Gates, Chairman, National Intelligence Council and Deputy Director for Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, and Lawrence K.

It has no reason to question this assessment, but would point out that such long term assessments may need to be revised in the light of future developments. Individuals Meeting in Vietnam to Criticise the Government (Question No. 1779)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Is he able to say whether individuals in Vietnam are prohibited from meeting either publicly or privately to criticises or protest against Government actions or policies.",103
249,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1984 submitted to the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, United States House of Representatives by the Department of State it is stated that individuals are prohibited from meeting either publicly or privately to criticise or protest against Government actions or policies. Article 67 of the Vietnamese Constitution states: 'Citizens enjoy freedom of speech; freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of association, and freedom to demonstrate in accordance with the interests of socialism and of the people . . .' In common with other communist states there are limitations on the extent to which private citizens either individually or in groups may express their political views. As the Constitution implies. while some criticism of aspects of government policies and administration may be expressed. criticism of the fundamental economic and political principles of the State cannot be freely made. Freedom of Speech and the Press in Vietnam (Question No. 1780)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Is he able to say whether (a) the right of freedom of speech and the press exists in Vietnam and (b) independent criticism of the party and the Government is not permitted.",103

Party Appointed Block Wardens in Vietnam (Question No. 1781)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (\) Is he able to say whether the system of population surveillance by Party appointed Block Wardens. who use informants to keep track of each individual's political and economic activities. has been extended from northern Vietnam to Ho Chi Minh City and other southern cities and rural areas. (2) Is evidence available which could confirm the accuracy of reports that officials and even unofficial security wardens conduct midnight searches of houses for draft-age males in order to fulfill draft quotas. (3) What representations has the Government made to the Vietnamese Government on this matter.",104
251,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) In the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1984 submitted to the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, United States House of Representatives by the Department of State it is stated that there is a system of population surveillance by Party-appointed Block Wardens. who use informants to keep track of each individual's political and economic activities. The State Department reported that their system has been extended from northern Vietnam to Ho Chi Minh City and other southern cities and rural areas. (2) The same report states that officials and even unofficial security wardens conduct midnight searches of houses for draft-age males in order to fulfil draft quotas. The Department of Foreign Affairs has no further information to corroborate information in (I) and (2). (3) The Government has not made specific representations on these matters but it has made a number of representations to the Vietnamese Government on the issue of human rights. They were raised with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach during his visit to Australia in March, 1984. and again during my visit to Hanoi in March this year. The Australian Ambassador in Hanoi has also been engaging in an exchange on the issue of human rights with Vietnamese Justice Ministry and Foreign Affairs Ministry officials. The Government believes that its representations over the past two years to the Vietnamese authorities have left the Vietnamese Government in no doubt as to the strength of concern within Australia about the human rights situation in Vietnam. We shall continue these efforts. and we welcome the indications that Vietnam is prepared to discuss human rights issues in a constructive spirit. Prisoners in Re-Education Camps in Vietnam (Question No. 1782)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is evidence available which could confirm the accuracy of reports from refugees concerning the severity of the conditions for prisoners in the re-education camps in Vietnam. (2) Is it a fact that these reports claim that the provision of food rations is below subsistence level, that medical care is denied, that hard labour has been assigned to political prisoners and prisoners of conscience. and solitary confinement is regularly practiced. (3) How many people are believed to be held in reeducation camps. (4) Is he able to say whether ,these camps contain former officials and military officers of the Republic of Vietnam. political prisoners, chaplains and clergy and intellectuals. (5) What action has the Government taken to ascertain the accuracy of these reports. (6) What representations has the Government made to the Vietnamese Government on this matter.",104
252,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (I) It is difficult to obtain evidence which could confirm the accuracy of reports from refugees concerning the the severity of conditions for prisoners in the reeducation camps in Vietnam. as the Vietnamese authorities are yet to allow access by foreigners to these camps. (2) Yes. (3) Vietnamese authorities stated in January 1985 that there were 7,000 people in re-education camps. while estimates of over 100.000 have been made by Western diplomats. (4) There are claims that such people are held in the camps. (5) We have raised the matter of access to inmates of re-education camps for resettlement processing with the Vietnamese authorities. They have replied that this might be, permissible, and we are following this up with the Vietnamese authorities. The ICRC has made similar requests, but is also yet to be given access. (6) During my visit to Hanoi in March, 1985, I met Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Van Dong. and put forward certain proposals about the release of people in re-edu.cation camps and about these people being allowed to go to other countries, including the United States of America. Although the representations received no' substantive response, I have stated that the Government will raise the matter again with the Vietnamese authorities.

(2) Is he able to say whether former inmates of reeducation camps have reported summary executions for escape attempts and resistance to camp authorities.",104
253,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The Vietnamese Government acknowledges that some individuals whom it considered 'war criminals' were executed in the wake of the 1975 takeover. (b) Yes. (2) Yes. Crimes of a Political Nature in Vietnam (Question No. 1784)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (1) Is' he able to say whether in Vietnam, for crimes of a political nature, public security officials may apprehend and search suspects without a warrant and that such suspects may be held an indefinite period without any judicial process. (2) Is he able to say whether those suspected of political crimes may be sent to re-education camps without trial or charge. (3) What public statements has the Government made on this matter. (4) What representations has the Government made to the Vietnamese Government on the matter.",105
254,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) I understand the situation is broadly as described in the Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1984 submitted to the Committee on Human Relations, United States Senate and Committee on Foreign Affairs, United States House of Representatives by the Department of State. The report states that for crimes of a political nature, public security officials may apprehend and search suspects without a warrant and that such suspects may be held for an indefinite period without any judicial process. (2) I understand that those suspected of political crimes may be sent to 're-education camps' without trial or charge. (3) The Government has made public statements on this matter, most recently in response to a question by Mr Ruddock on 20 March 1985 (Hansard page 576). (4) Information on the Government's representations is also contained in that reply. Legal System in Vietnam (Question No. 1785)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (1) Is he able to say whether, in Vietnam, arbitrary detention without charge, trial or any form of legal proceedings under the guise of re-education has subverted the rudimentary legal system which exists. (2) Is he also able to say whether, in general, the entire legal system operates as an agency for the enforcement of regime directives and that it has no independence from political intervention.",105
255,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Detention in re-education camps has taken place without the processes of charge, trial or other legal proceedings. (2) On 27 June 1985 the winter session of the Seventh National Assembly adopted the final draft of the new penal code. It is planned that the code will take effect from 1 January 1986. In keeping with its interest in human rights matters and specifically in human rights matters in Vietnam the Government will monitor the application of the new penal code with respect to human rights criteria Abduction of People from their Houses in Vietnam (Question No. 1786)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is he able to say whether refugees arriving in Thailand in 1984 have reported incidents in Vietnam in which people dressed in civilian clothing have abducted people from their houses in the night and that the fate of those who disappeared was unknown. (2) What action has the Government taken to ascertain the accuracy of these reports. (3) What representation has the Government made to the Vietnamese Government of this matter.",105
256,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Refugees arriving in Thailand in 1984 have reported incidents in which people dressed in civilian clothing have abducted people from their houses in the night. The fate of those who disappeared is unknown. (2) The Government is concerned about the human rights situation in Vietnam. Vietnam's accession to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on 24 December 1982 is a useful basis for our contacts with Vietnam on human rights questions. The Australian Ambassador in Hanoi has been engaging in an exchange on the issue of human rights in Vietnamese Justice and Foreign Affairs Ministry officials, including attempts to ascertain the accuracy of reports on human rights violations. (3) The Government has made a number of representations to the Vietnamese Government on matters of human rights violations. Human rights issues were raised with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach during his visits to Australia in March 1984, and agains during my visit to Hanoi in March this year. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs also raised specific human rights cases with Foreign Minister Thach during his visit in May 1985. Mr E. G. Whitlam: Fund Raising Activities (Question No. 1787)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Has he advised the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party that on no future occasion will the Australian Ambassador to the United Nations Educational,Scientific and Cultural Organisation be allowed to solicit funds in Australia for party political purposes whilst holding that office; if not, why not.",105
257,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I have nothing to add to my reply to question No. 1743. South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and Regional Security (Question No. 1788)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the National Times of 30 March 1984, where it is claimed that a strategic basis paper endorsed by Cabinet states that in the broadest sense, it is in Australia's interests to encourage a sense of strategic community between ""the independent states in the area (the South Pacific) and the Australian, New Zealand and the United States allies and to support this by practical programs of cooperation in defence and security related matters. (2) How is Australia's advocacy of a South Pacific nuclear free zone of practical assistance to this goal.",106
258,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. In his Parliamentary Statement of 10 May 1984 about the publication in the National Times of purported extracts from a Defence Department Document entitled: 'The Strategic Basis of Australian Defence Policy 1983', Senator Gareth Evans made clear that such documents represent the outcome of periodic reviews designed to advise Government on how threats to Australia may arise and on the implications for our security. As the name implies the documents offer advice on the basis for defence policy and do not purport to provide a specific plan for future defence actions. (2) The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty contributes to regional security through its objective of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In particular, the provisions of the Treaty prohibiting the acquisition of nuclear explosive devices and their stationing or testing on the territory of Parties are in the security interests of the region and help to preserve the South West Pacific as a region free of superpower rivalry. These objectives are further reinforced by the draft Protocols to the Treaty which invite France, the United Kingdom and the United States to apply key provisions of the Treaty to their territories within the Zone and which invite the five nuclear weapon States to undertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against Parties to the Treaty and not to test nuclear explosive devices anywhere within the Zone. At the same time the Treaty and its draft Protocols in no way cut across Australia's obligations under the ANZUS Treaty and the broader defence relationship between Australia and the United States which, in the Government's view, continues to be fundamental to Australian security and to contribute to the stability of the region as a whole. United States of America Strategic Modernisation Program (Question No. 1789)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the National Times of 30 March 1984 where it is claimed that a strategic basis paper endorsed by Cabinet states that the Soviet Union by its own sustained efforts and aided by the relative United States neglect of the United States nuclear forces has achieved"" superiority in the critical area of inter-continental ballistic missiles and INF which is not fully compensated by United States maritime and air forces and that the ability and resolve of the United States to maintain effective strategic competition with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is of fundamental importance to Australia's security. (2) Is the report correct; if so, does he agree with the assessment, and if so, will he endorse the United States Strategic Modernisation Program; if not, why not.",106
259,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. In his Parliamentary Statement of \0 May 1984 on the publication in the National Times of purported extracts from a Defence Department document entitled 'The Strategic Basis of Australian Defence Policy 1983', Senator Evans made clear that such documents represent the outcome of periodic reviews designed to advise the Government on how threats to Australia may arise and on the implications of such threats for Australia's security. As the name implies the documents offer advice on the basis for defence policy and do not purport to provide a specific plan for future defence actions. (2) As to the general thesis of the question, the Government is of the view there is broad parity between the military power of the superpowers, although it acknowledges that significant asymmetries exist at particular levels in the forces of both sides: and ICBMs, though important, are not the sole indices of strategic nuclear power. The Government is also of the view that the need to maintain broad parity between the superpowers is of fundamental importance to all countries, including Australia. It would greatly prefer that this were done by a mutual and verifiable freeze on nuclear weapons testing production and development followed by negotiations which aim for deep cuts in the high stockpiles of nuclear weapons through equitable and verifiable arms control agreements. The immediate goal must be the most stable possible balance at the lowest possible level of nuclear weapons: the ultimate goal must remain their complete elimination. For this reason it has not endorsed the strategic modernisation programs of either superpower. Vietnamese Military Actions in Cambodia (Question No. 1790)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 20 April 1984, in which he is reported as stating that it was not unreasonable for Vietnamese forces in Kampuchea to retaliate against attack by guerillas of the ousted Khmer Rouge regime and non-communist resistance groups. (2) Is the report correct; if so, does he stm hold that view and if he does how does he justify it.",106
260,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) The honourable member is referred to the answer given by the Prime Minister to a question without notice from him on the same subject on 2 May 1984. The Government remains concerned by the destabilising ef-, fects on the South East Asia region caused by the Cambodia problem, and particularly by its toll of human suffering. We continue to believe there is an urgent need for a political rather than military solution. Soviet Union: South Pacific Fisheries (Question No. 1791)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the National Times of 30 March 1984, where it is claimed that a strategic basis paper endorsed by Cabinet states that access by the USSR, especially the establishment in the Pacific of a presence ashore, would because for concern and that the fragility of political development in fledgling states in the area would make them susceptible to further encroachment. (2) In view of the fishing agreement between Kiribati and the Soviet Union and the likelihood of another being reached with Vanuatu, does the government regard these achievements as detrimental to Australia's security.",107
261,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. In his Parliamentary statement of 10 May 1984 about the publication in the National Times of purported extracts from a Defence Department document entitled ""The Strategic Basis of Australian Defence Policy 1983"", Senator Evans made clear that such documents represent the outcome of periodic reviews designed to advise Government on how threats to Australia may arise and on the implications for our security. As the name implies the documents offer advice on the basis for defence policy and do not purport to provide a specific plan for future defence actions. (2) The Australian Government has closely followed developments in the South Pacific relating to fisheries licensing negotiations between Pacific island countries and distant water fishing nations. It understands the desire of the island countries to receive a financial return from a major renewable economic resource. Where it has deemed it appropriate, the Government has made known to the relevant parties its views on the possible implications of such developments. It cannot be said, however, that Australia's security is directly threatened by any such recent developments. ANZUS: International Democrat Union Communique (Question No. 1792)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Has his attention been drawn to the financial communique of 25 July 1985 of the second party leaders conference of the International Democrat Union where the importance of dependability within the western alliance is emphasised and grave disquiet expressed over the reneging on security obligations by regional members of ANZUS in particular by the New Zealand Government's decision to refuse entry to vessels with nuclear capabilities. (2) Can he confirm that this communique was endorsed by the leaders of the Conservative Party of the United Kingdom, the Republican Party of the Unite,d States, the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan and the Christian Democratic Party in the Federal Republic of Germany, amongst many others. Agreements (3) What is the Government's attitude to this statement.",107
262,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No, and my Department has been unable to locate this document in material available to it. (2) No. (3) See answer to (I) above. Vanuatu and Kiribati: Fisheries Agreements with the Soviet Union (Question No. 1958)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) Has the Government met with the Governments of (a) Vanuatu and (b) Kiribati on the subject of fishing agreements with the Soviet Union. (2) When did these meetings take place and who attended.",107
263,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Representatives of the Australian Government have met with representatives of the Governments of Vanuatu and Kiribati and held discussions on the subject of fishing agreements with the Soviet Union. (2) The meetings have taken place at various times and at various levels over the past year. Australian High Commissioners in Vila and Tarawa have had discussions with Ministers of the Governments of Vanuatu and Kiribati on this subject. Aid to the Philippines: Northern Samar (Question No. 1959)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) What amount had the Australian Development Assistance Bureau spent on the Northern Samar project up until the decision to withdraw Australian aid workers from the project? (2) What are the consequences of the project on the Australian withdrawal and is it likely that the work already done will fall into disrepair? (3) Will the sums saved by discontinuing the project be allocated to other aid projects in the Philippines?",107
264,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) $24.182m (2) Consequences of the withdrawal include the following: Assistance to the project will continue under the guidance and supervision of a small team of Australians based in Manila; The work of the project will be carried out by Philippine agencies, governmental and non-governmental; Every effort will be made to complete critical elements of the project before its planned completion date in December 1988; Project performance under these arrangements will be reviewed in early 1986 and decisions made about which elements of the continuing project have demonstrated that they are worthy of further support. In an effort to prevent work already done falling disrepair, assistance is being provided, as originally planned, to the Provincial Engineer's office in Northern Samar in the form of training, equipment and spare parts to establish a maintenance capability in the Province. (3) The project is not being discontinued, but any savings resulting from the reStructuring outlined in the foregoing could be allocated to other projects in the Philippines subject to those proposals meeting normal aid criteria. Aid to the Philippines  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) What was the amount of official development assistance provided to the Philippines in (a) 1983-84 and (b) 1984-85.

Australia will also be supporting an environmental adviser to the National Irrigation Administration and assisting the National Council for Integrated Area Development. The Minister for Defence, to whom the questions in parts (3) and (4) should have been addressed, has supplied the following replies: (3) Under the Defence Cooperation Program (DCP) into with the Philippines, expenditure during (a) 1983-84 and (b) 1984-85, totalled $1.660 million and $1.356 million respectively. (4) The proposed allocation for the program under the DCP in the Philippines for 1985-86 is $1.493 million.

(Question No. 1960) South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty: Nuclear-Armed Vessels (Question No. 1962)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: What period of time would have to elapse before a visiting nuclear-armed vessel, in an Australian port, would be considered as being stationed in Australia in violation of Article 5 of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty.",108
266,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The question of whether the definition of stationing contained in Article I (d) of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty should include a time element to cover, for example, the duration or pattern of port visits was considered by the South Pacific Forum's Working Group which drafted the Treaty. It was noted that the principles on a South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone adopted by Forum Heads of Government at their meeting in Tuvalu in August 1984 had explicitly stated that the sovereign right of a country to decide on port access was unqualified. Moreover, the utility of such a time frame was questioned since circumstances of port visits varied considerably. It was also noted that should any Party to the Treaty have doubts or questions concerning the duration or pattern of port visits it would be open to it to invoke the consultation provisions of the Treaty (Article 10) in order to seek clarification. Code of Conduct for Australian Transnational - Corporations and Financial Institutions (Question No. 1963)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: Does the Government intend to introduce a strict code of conduct for Australian transnational corporations and financial institutions investing in developing countries to ensure that the operations respect the independence of the host country and enhance the prospect of equitable self-reliant development; if so, when.",109
267,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Not at present. Australia was, however, a party to the Declaration made on 21 June 1976 by the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on International Investment and Multinational Enterprises. The Declaration contains voluntary guidelines addressed by OECD countries to multinational enterprises operating in their territories intended to encourage the contributions of these enterprises to economic and social progress, especially in developing countries, and to minimise any difficulties which arise from their operations. Also, the United Nations Commission on Transnational Corporations is considering a draft Code of Conduct for Transnational Corporations (TNCs) which, in effect, is designed to ensure that the operations of TNCs in developing countries 'respect the independence of the host country and enhance the prospect of self reliant development.' In common with other western industrialised countries Australia supports the adoption of a voluntary code, with comprehensive application to private, mixed and state-owned enterprises and which provides for fair, equitable and non-discriminatory treatment of TNCs by states in accordance with national and international law. Emergency Aid to Africa (Question No. 1964)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (1) What is the proposed level of aid to Ethiopia in 1985-86? (2) How is this to be allocated? (3) What provisions for emergency food aid have been made for Africa in 1985-86?",109
268,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Estimated bilateral aid to Ethiopia for 1985-86 is $14.068m, but this excludes unprogrammed emergency aid which will be determined later in the financial year. (2) The estimated allocation of this 1985-86 assistance is as follows ($'000): Projects Training Food Other 100 272 12,446 1,250 It is not possible to estimate amounts reaching individual provinces, but over $3m has been granted so far to non-government agencies' food and other relief programs for use in contested areas of Eritrea and Tigray. A significant part of the balance of other food aid is expected to be used in Government-held areas of Eritrea and Tigray and other northern provinces. Although most food aid is provided for emergency feeding programs, over $4m will be used to provide food in support of a food-for-work development project in the south-western province of Gamo Gofa. (3) The estimate in the 1985-86 aid budget for emergency food aid for Africa is $29m, which is almost 80 per cent of the estimated total for all emergency food aid. Death of Arnold Ap (Question No. 1965)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: Has the Government investigated the death of the Irian Jayan anthropologist, Mr Arnold Ap; if so, what conclusions has it reached regarding the circumstances of Mr Ap's death.",109
269,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: While the Government is not in a position to conduct a formal investigation of events which occurred in another country, it has nonetheless carefully followed developments in the case of the death of Mr Ap. The precise circumstances of Mr Ap's death remain unclear. The Indonesian Foreign Minister, Dr Mochtar, has said that Mr Ap was discovered while attempting to escape by sea and was shot and killed in an exchange of fire with police. I am aware of claims by the Australian Section of the International Commission of Jurists to have evidence that conflicts with that account. The Government is naturally concerned at the death of Arnold Ap and has made its concern known to the Indonesian authorities at the highest levels. Proportions of Multilateral and Bilateral Aid (Question No. 1966)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) What percentage of Australia's development assistance program was allocated to (a) bilateral and (b) multilateral assistance in (i) 1980-81, (ii) 1981-82, (iii) 1982-83, (iv) 1983-84 and (v) 198--85. (2) What percentage is allocated for paragraphs (I) (a) and (b) in 1985-86. (3) How is the present level of allocation of multilateral aid justified.",109
270,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) The following table shows the proportions of expenditures counted as official development assistance (ODA) in the years mentioned: Multilateral Bilateral 1980/81 20.3 1981/82 22.4 1982/83 24.6 1983/84 25.9 1984/85 23.3 1985/86 24.3 (Estimated) (3) The level of expenditure on each multilateral program is established either as an obligation (e.g. drawdowns agreed with the multilateral development banks; multi-year pledges to certain organisations; assessed shares in a few specialised agencies and regional organisations); or as a voluntary contribution (other programs). In 1985/86 provision has been made for all obligations. In setting levels of voluntary contributions the Government has had regard to expenditure levels in previous years and the purposes of the various programs. Aid: Education of Overseas Students (Question No. 1797)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) Has the Government included, as part of Australia's 1985-86 official development assistance budget, funding for the education of overseas students in Australia. (2) What proportion of Australia's GDP constitutes aid payments excluding funding for overseas students.",110
271,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government has allocated in the 1985-86 official development assistance budget $140.283m in support of education and training programs, most of which will be conducted in Australia. A major component is the contribution by the Commonwealth towards the education in Australia of sponsored and private students from developing countries at the post-secondary level. This is estimated at $97.398m for 1985-86: (a) The estimated educational contribution for sponsored students is $8.984m. The Government also meets the overseas student charge, fares and living expenses for all sponsored students. (b) The estimated support for the education of private overseas students is $88.414m. For private students from Papua New Guinea and other South Pacific countries the Australian Government also meets the overseas student charge. (2) Official development assistance (ODA) in 198586 is estimated at 0.45 per cent of the Gross National Product (GNP). If the cost of the educational support for private overseas students (estimated at $88.414m in 1985-86) is excluded from the calculation, the ODA/ GNP ratio is estimated at 0.41 per cent. Level of Aid (Question No. 1968)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: Proportions of ODA 1980-86 Admini- (I) Does the Government intend to achieve the United stration Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance with an immediate % % % target of 0.5 per cent by 1985-86. 78.0 1.7 (2) Is it a fact that Australia's aid payments, as a 75.9 1.7 proportion of gross domestic product, will fall to 0.45 73.4 2.0 per cent as a result of the 1985-86 Budget. 72.3 1.8 75.0 1.7 Mr HAYDEN - The answer to the honourable 73.6 2.1 member's question is as follows: (I) The Government endorses the United Nations target of providing 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance, but has not set a firm date for achieving this goal. The Government has not set an immediate target of 0.5 per cent for 1985-86. ' (2) It is expected that in 1985-86 Australia's official development assistance will represent 0.45 per cent of gross national product. As a proportion of gross domestic product it will represent 0.44 per cent. Free Papua Organisation: Comments of Ambassador Morrison (Question No. 1969)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) Is he able to state what the current strength of the Free Papua Organisation (OPM) is. (2) Has his attention been drawn to remarks by the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, Mr Bill Morrison, in the Australian on 17 September 1985, that the OPM certainly had a decreasing influence in Irian Jaya; the people just wanted a quiet life and they saw the OPM as disrupting that quiet life. (3) If so, is he able to say whether he agrees with the statement.",110
272,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) It is difficult to estimate the strength of the OPM because of the fragmented nature of the organisation. Estimates of 200-300 active members have been used in the press but I am unable to confirm this figure. (2) Yes. (3) Ambassador Morrison's comments were based on his personal observations during his recent visit there. They add to the range of views on the province available to the Government and naturally will be taken into account in our policy formulation. (Question No. 1970)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) Is he able to state what the figure for transmigrants into Irian Jaya is and what the Indonesian target for the 1984-89 period is. (2) Is he also able to say what the strength is of the (a) Indonesian army and (b) police force in Irian Jaya.",110
273,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (I) According to the Department of Transmigration of the Republic of Indonesia, as of the end of the third five year plan in 1984, approximately 82,000 Indonesians from other parts of the country have been settled in Irian Jaya under the transmigration program. In the fourth five-year plan covering 1984-89, it is proposed that around 600,000 trans migrants will be settled in Irian Jaya, as part of the national transmigration program involving approximately four million people. The program, however, is progressing slower than planned and it seems unlikely that the final targets will be achieved during the period. (2) (a) I understand from a recent Embassy visit that there are four Indonesian army battalions in Irian Jaya suggesting a troop strength of 2,700. I also understand that an additional 2,000 personnel, including some from the Indonesian navy and air force are assigned to administrative, logistical and training duties in the province. (b) I have been advised that there are also about 1,500 police officers on duty in Irian Jaya. Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and National Heritage: Soviet Union (Question No. 1971)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: Is the Soviet Union a Party to the Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and National Heritage; if so, which places in the Soviet Union are included in the World Heritage List.",111
274,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answers to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Soviet Union is not a party to the Convention. Government Involvement in Resource Exploitation in the Timor Gap (Question No. 1972)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) Has consideration been given to Government involvement in a hydro-carbon corporation to operate in the Timor Gap. (2) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the Age, of 14 September 1985, that Department of Foreign Affairs officials in Canberra believe negotiations for joint development would be encouraged by a similar organisation on the Australian side; if so, has he made any statement on this matter. Irian Jaya Mr HAYDEN - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I have nothing further to add to the answer provided by Senator Gareth Evans to a question without notice in the Senate on 16 September. In his answer, Senator Evans said that the Government is not giving any formal consideration at this stage to the concept of a Government hydro-carbon corporation to operate in the Timor Gap. Such a corporation is one possible method of organising development on the Australian side in a possible joint development zone with Indonesia. There are many different ways in which the Australian interests could be represented and mobilised in the context of that proposed joint development zone. The hydrocarbon corporation or the notion of some governmental agency as the administering authority, no doubt in conjunction with private enterprise, is just one of a number of possible options and certainly should not generate any concern on the part of the oil industry. Australia-Indonesia Maritime Boundary Negotiations (Question No. 1973)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) What degree of importance does he attach to a settlement of the seabed boundary between Australia and Indonesia. (2) Has he raised the matter with the Indonesian Government; if so, when and with what result.",111
275,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) A settlement of the seabed boundary between Australia and Indonesia is considered by the Government to be very important. The Prime Minister, in answer to a question without notice concerning East Timor on 22 August 1985, referred to the importance of a successful conclusion of the seabed boundary negotiations. (2) I last discussed the matter with the Indonesian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr Mochtar, in Kuala Lumpur on 12 July 1985. As a result of that talk and subsequent contacts between Australian and Indonesian officials, it is hoped that the next round of discussions between officials of the two countries will take place in Canberra during October 1985. Australia-Indonesia Maritime Boundary Negotiations (Question No. 1974)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) Is the Government continuing to negotiate with Indonesia on the seabed boundary south of East Timor. (2) When were the last delimitation talks held and who were the officials who represented Australia. (3) What progress was made at the talks.",111
276,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) 14-16 November 1984 in Jakarta. The Australian delegation was as follows: Mr J. H. Brook, First Assistant Secretary, Legal and Consular Division, Department of Foreign Affairs (Leader); Mr D. G. Nutter, First Assistant Secretary, South East Asia and Pacific Division, Department of Foreign Affairs; Mr J. C. Starkey, First Assistant Secretary, Petroleum Division, Department of Resources and Energy; Mr N. J. Quinn, First ASsistant Secretary, Territories Division, Department of Territories and Local Government; Mr C. Veenstra, Director, Division of National Mapping, Department of Resources and Energy; Mr G. P. M. Dabb, Senior Assistant Secretary, Counsel 2 Branch, Attorney-General's Department; Mr A. C. Kevin, Assistant Secretary, Foreign Affairs Branch, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet; Mr C. Robertson, Assistant Chief, Petroleum Branch, Bureau of Mineral Resources; Mr S. Bailey, Department of Law, Northern Territory; Mr J. Thompson, Crown Law Office, Western Australia; Brigadier G. J. Murphy, Defence Attache, Australian Embassy, Jakarta; Mr G. Atkin, First Secretary, Australian Embassy, Jakarta; Mr H. C. MCMichael, Third Secretary, Australian Embassy, Jakarta. (3) Discussion continued on the four maritime delimitation matters outstanding between Australia and Indonesia; namely, the seabed boundary south of East Timor, the western end of the seabed boundary line agreed in 1972, the seabed boundary between Christmas Island and Java, and the maritime boundary for other than seabed purposes-agreement on a provisional fisheries line having been reached in 1981. One of the options discussed in relation to the seabed area south of East Timor-'the Timor Gap'-was the establishment of a Joint Development Zone which would allow Australia and Indonesia to cooperate in developing the resources of the area before final settlement of itation line. Jewish Migration from the Soviet Union (Question No. 1975)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) Is he able to say what the level of Jewish migration from the Soviet Union has been since 1980. (2) Has he raised this matter with the Soviet Union; if so, what was the response.",111
277,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Jewish migration from the Soviet Union reached a high-point in 1979, with 51,320 being permitted to leave. The figures to date are 1980 approx 1981 1982 less than 1983 1984 1985 (first 8 months) (2) During my discussions with the then Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Gromyko, in Moscow in May 1984, I raised the question of Jewish migration. Mr Gromyko did not respond. Size of the Afghan Army (Question No. 1976)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) Is he able to say whether the Afghan Army has been reduced largely through desertion from some 90,000 in 1979 to around 35,000 to 40,000 in September 1985. (2) Is he also able to say whether conscription in Afghanistan is supplemented by roving press gangs and the draft age has been lowered to 16. Mi' Hayden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Morale in the Afghan Army has been at a low ebb during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and desertion has been a factor in the reduction of its strength, now estimated at between 30,000 and 45,000 men, excluding militia and paramilitary forces. (2) Information available to my Department indicates that forced conscription of the type referred to by the honourable member has taken .place in Afghanistan although to what extent it is not known. According to the 'Report on the situation in Afghanistan' prepared by Special Rapporteur, Felix Ermacora and presented to the Forty-first Session of the Commission on Human Rights in February 1985 the age for conscription into the Afghan Army was lowered to 15 years in 1982. Aid to Afghan Refugees (Question No. 1977)  a delim- Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) What bilateral and multilateral assistance has been provided to Afghan refugees by the Government in each year since 1982-83. (2) What is the proposed level of assistance in 198586. (3) Is the Government providing any assistance to the 6 million to 8 million inhabitants still struggling to survive inside resistance held areas of Afghanistan.",112
278,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to theÂ· honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Government has provided the following amounts, all on a multilateral basis, in support of assistance programs by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross for Afghan refugees in Pakistan: 1982-83-$6. 165m 21,000 1983-84-$6.363m 9,500 1984-85-$4.525m (2) In 1985-86 the proposed level of assistance is 3,000 $4.600m. 1,300 (3) The Government does not provide any direct 896 assistance to the inhabitants of resistance held areas of Afghanistan and as far as the Government is aware the 702 organisations to which Australia contributes do not operate in such areas. This does not mean that the Government is not concerned about the human suffering and deprivation of the Afghan people. The needless loss of life and suffering of the Afghan people will only come to an end when the Soviet Union withdraws its forces in accordance with UN resolutions. Australian Media Reporting on Afghanistan (Question No. 1978)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) Is he able to say whether the war in Afghanistan is still escalating and that no Australian newspaper, magazine or wire service has a full time correspondent reporting on Afghanistan. (2) What efforts has the Government made to negotiate with the Afghanistan Government to enable Australian journalists to report on the war inside Afghanistan.",112
279,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The war in Afghanistan is certainly continuing at a high level. As far as the Government is aware no Australian newspaper, magazine or wire service has a full-time correspondent reporting on the war. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation has. a correspondent based in New Delhi and there are Australian journalists based in Singapore who file periodic reports on developments in Afghanistan-though not from inside the country. (2) The Government does not recognise the Government of Afghanistan and is not in a position to negotiate arrangements for journalists to report on the war inside Afghanistan. Afghanistan: Soviet Forces and Weaponry (Question No. 1979)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) Is he able to say (a) to what extent Soviet forces in Afghanistan have increased since 1979 and (b) whether the Soviet Union has about 115,000 troops in Afghanistan, as at September 1985. (2) Is he also able to say what weaponry the Soviet Union is using in Afghanistan and whether this includes rapid fire MI-24 helicopter gun ship and SU-25 fighter bomber. (3) Did he raise these matters on his last visit to the Soviet Union; if so, with whom and what was the response; if not, why not.",113
280,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) and (b). The number of Soviet troops in Afghanistan has increased slowly from approximately 80,000 at the beginning of the Soviet campaign to approximately 115,000 in September 1985. (2) The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is using a wide range of sophisticated weaponry in Afghanistan, including both the MI-24 helicopter gunship and the SU-25 fighter bomber. (3) Discussions with Mr Gromyko during my visit to Moscow in May 1984 covered a broad range of international, regional, and bilateral issues. A chief aim of the visit was to encourage the Soviet Union to resume a dialogue with the United States of nuclear disarmament. Time constraints did not permit a detailed discussion of Afghanistan although Australia's condemnation of its occupation was registered. It is well known, however, that Australia has condemned the Soviet invasion of that country and has frequently expressed, in Moscow and Canberra, its deep concern over events taking place there. Soviet Military Tactics in Afghanistan (Question No. 1980)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) Is he able to say whether Soviet military tactics in Afghanistan have included high altitude saturation bombing, a scorched earth policy and the use of antipersonnel mines disguised as toys, watches and other objects that Afghan children or refugees would pick up. (2) Did he raise these matters on his last visit to the Soviet Union; if so, with whom and what was the response; if not, why not.",113
281,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Since its invasion of Afghanistan in December 19.79 the Soviet Union has used it variety of means including many of those referred to by the honourable member to subjugate the Afghan people, many of which have inflicted great suffering on Afghanistan's civilian population including women and children. (2) Discussion with Mr Gromyko during my visit to Moscow in May 1984 covered a broad range of international, regional, and bilateral issues. A chief aim of the visit was to encourage the Soviet Union to resume a dialogue with the United States on nuclear disarmament. Time constraints did not permit a discussion of Afghanistan, although I expressed Australia's condemnation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics' occupation of Afghanistan to Mr Groymko in Moscow. It is also well known that Australia has condemned the Soviet invasion of that country and has frequently expressed, in Moscow and Canberra, its deep concern over events taking place there. Alleged Soviet Use of Chemical Weapons in Afghanistan (Question No. 1981)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Is he able to say whether any evidence exists that Soviet troops have used lethal chemical and toxin weapons in Afghanistan. (2) Has he received reports which have alleged the use of myco toxins, nerve gases, blister agents and incapacitants by the Soviet Union in Afghanistan; if so, did he raise these matters of his last visit to the Soviet Union. (3) If so, with whom did he raise them and what was the response; if not, why not.",113
282,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The bulk of evidence produced in support of allegations that Soviet troops in Afghanistan have used lethal chemical and toxin weapons consists of refugee and defector reports, and chemical analysis by scientists in the United States of fragments of two Soviet gas masks acquired in Afghanistan in 1981: see for example the relevant sections of the United Stat-' State Department Special Reports No. 98 'Chemical Warfare in South East Asia and Afghanistan' of March 1982 and No. 104 'Chemical Warfare in South East Asia and Afghanistan-An Update', of November 1982. Further details regarding the analysis of the gas masks were made public at an on-the-record State Department media briefing on 29 November 1982. Examples of refugee reports of alleged use of chemical weapons in Afghanistan may also be found in the Report of the Group of Experts to investigate Reports of the Alleged Use of Chemical Weapons sent to the United Nations Secretary General on 26 November 1982. (2) and (3) The Government has taken careful note of the allegations by the United States that the Soviet Union has used lethal chemical and toxin agents in Afghanistan, and of Soviet statements dismissing these allegations. It has also noted the inconclusive nature much of the evidence (see e.g. the United Nations report cited above). Nevertheless the Government views these reports and allegations with considerable concern. There appears to be a case to answer and the Government hopes the Soviet Union will take appropriate steps to demonstrate its compliance with the relevant arms control agreements: in this case the 1925 Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating Poisonous or Other Gases and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention of 1972. This particular issue has not been raised with the Soviet Union. The Government has, however, stressed on a number of occasions to the Soviet Union the importance it places on full adherence by all parties to the terms of arms control treaties. It has also emphasised the importance it places on the urgent need for a comprehensive chemical weapons Convention which would outlaw the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. The Soviet Union has also been made aware of Australian concerns over the number of reports of use of chemical weapons over the past few years and of Australia's firm view that all such reports should be promptly and thoroughly investigated. Killings in Indonesia (Question No. 1982)  Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) Did he state on Brisbane television, on 8 July 1984, that Indonesian death squads had murdered between 2,000 and 4,000 of their own citizens. (2) Are these death squads still operating; if so at what level. (3) Does evidence exist to show that there is any connection between these death squads and the Indonesian authorities. (4) Has he raised this matter with the Indonesian Government; if so, with whom and what was the response.",113
283,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (I ) Yes. On the basis of information available to the Government, I stated in public on 8 July 1984 that between 2,000 and 4,000 people had been shot without trial by so-called 'death squads' in Indonesia. (2) There have been reports from time to time of 'mysterious killings' in Jakata and other centres. In the absence of reliable information about the extent of the killings, it is difficult to determine their present level. At the same time, the number of victims of such killings appears to have substantially declined over the past eighteen months. (3) I am not aware of any firm evidence to. show that there is a connection between these reported mysterious killings and the Indonesian authorities. If the Indonesian authorities have sanctioned the executions, as alleged in press reports, it would be a matter of deep concern to the Australian Government. (4) I raised this matter with relevant Indonesian authorities during my visit to Jakarta for the Association of of South East Asian Nations Plus Ministerial Consultations in July 1984. The position of the Indonesian Government has been that. the killings are the result of fighting between rival criminal gangs. The Australian Government believes that summary executions are a clear contravention of the fundamental human rights embodied in the universal declaration on human rights and the international covenant on civil and political rights. The Government has consistently taken the view that Australia has a strong interest in seeing internationally accepted human rights observed and respected, especially in our region, and believes that in all situations the due process of law should be followed. Our representations to the Indonesian authorities are in keeping with this interest. Public International Law (Question No. 2259)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: Further to his answer to a question without notice on 15 October 1985 relating to the 'Achille Lauro incident, when was responsibility for public international law transferred to the Attorney-General and why was the change made.",114
284,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There has been no change in the division of responsibility for public international law between my Department and the Attorney-General's Department since the present arrangement was established in 1974. Public International Law (Question No. 2260)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: (1) What administrative changes have taken place in his Department as a result of the transfer of responsibility for public international law to the Attorney General. (2) What has happened to (a) the Law of the Sea Section, (b) the Treaty Section, (c) the International Law Section, (d) the Bilateral and Domestic Legal Section, (e) the Administrative Law Section, (f) the Multilateral Humanitarian Law Section, (g) the Refugees, Immigration and Asylum SectioI'l and (h) the Legal Adviser and how have the officers in each of these areas been redeployed within his Department. (3) Why does his departmental telephone directory list 23 different areas of legal responsibility.",114
285,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: See my answer to question No. 2259. Public International Law (Question No. 2261)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: Was his answer, to a question without notice on 15 October 1985, that responsibility for public international law rested with the Attorney-General, incorrect.",115
286,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. See my answer to question No. 2259. The division of responsibility for public international law between the two Departments has always explicitly recognised the Ministerial authority of the Attorney-General as first Law Officer of the Commonwealth. Soviet Compliance with the Anti-Ballistic (Question No. 2262)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: Is he able to say whether the aggregate of the Soviet Union's ABM and ABM related actions suggests that the Soviet Union may be preparing an ABM defence of its national territory in violation of the ABM Treaty.",115
287,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. The question quotes the conclusion of Item 13 of the Reagan Administration's second report to the Congress on Soviet non-compliance with arms control agreements-I February 1985. The Government is not in a position to expand on this conclusion. Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention: Alleged Soviet Violations (Question No. 2263)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Is he able to say whether the Soviet Union has maintained an offensive biological warfare program and capability in violation of the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention of 1972: if so, what representations has the Government made to the Soviet Union in this regard.",115
288,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government has noted United States allegations to this effect. It has stressed on a number of occasions the great importance it places on full compliance by all parties to arms control agreements with the terms of those agreements. Questions of verification and compliance with the 1972 Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention and the need to preserve and strengthen this important Convention have been discussed with the Soviet Union. It would not be appropriate to give details of confidential exchanges between Governments. Strategic Arms Limitation Talks II Treaty: Alleged Soviet Violations (Question No. 2264)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: Is he able to say whether (a) the Soviet Union's SSX-25 is a prohibited new type of Inter-continental Ballistic Missile and (b) the testing of the SS-X-25 and SSX-24 is a violation of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks II.",115
289,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The United States has charged that the Soviet Union has violated the relevant provision of the SALT II Treaty (Article IV.9) which prohibits each side from flight testing and deploying more than one new type of Missile Treaty light ICBM. According to United States sources the Soviet Union advised the United States that a new multiple-warhead ICBM it began flight-testing in late 1982, designated the SS-X-24 by the United States, was its one new type of light ICBM permitted under the Treaty. Subsequently the Soviet Union began testing another ICBM, designated the SS-X-25 by the United States. In response to United States queries the Soviet Union claimed that this ICBM was only a modification of an existing ICBM, the SS13, first deployed in 1969. The United States does not accept this assertion. It believes the ICBM in question to be a second new type of ICBM and thus prohibited under SALT II. The issue of whether the SS25 is a new ICBM as defined by the SALT II Treaty involves complex technical and legal issues. The Government believes that the complex of issues surrounding the SS25 raises legitimate questions concerning Soviet compliance with the relevant provisions of the Treaty. There appears to be a case to answer and it hopes the Soviet Union will take appropriate steps to respond to United States concerns and demonstrate clearly its compliance with the relevant provisions of SALT II. The Australian Government regards the existing agreements between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as important to all countries because the interests of all are engaged. It attaches great importance to full compliance by both parties with all their agreements, and has made this point to both of them. SS16 Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile: Alleged Deployment (Question No. 2265)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: Is he able to say whether the Soviet Union's deployment of the - SS-16 at Plesetek is a violation of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks II.",115
290,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. The Government is aware of United States concern that the Soviet Union may have deployed the SS16 ICBM at Plesetsk in violation of the relevant provision of the SALT II Treaty. It notes however that in the February 1985 unclassified report to Congress entitled ""Soviet Non Compliance with Arms Control Agreements"" the Administration stopped short of alleging a Soviet violation in this respect, noting that the evidence was 'somewhat ambiguous', that it could not reach a definitive conclusion, and that the activities at Plesetsk were a ""probable violation"" of the Treaty. The Government is not therefore in a position to say whether the Soviet Union has deployed the SS-16 at Plesetsk in violation of the SALT II Treaty. Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty: Soviet (Question No. 2266)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: Is he able to say whether the number of incidents of concurrent operation of surface to air missile (Surface to Air Missile) and anti-ballistic missile (Anti-ballistic missile) components indicate that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has violated the prohibition in the ABM Treaty on testing Surface to air missile components in an ABM mode.",116
291,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government is aware that ambiguous Soviet activities in this field have prompted United States requests for clarification for many years, position to make a judgment on the matter. The Government has noted reports that an important aspect of this matter was resolved in an agreement concluded in the Standing Consultative Commission, apparently in June 1985. (Science, 9 August 1985, pp 535-536.) Anti-Ballistic Missiles: Soviet Compliance (Question No. 2267)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: Is he able to say whether the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics' development of components of a new antiballistic missile (ABM) system is (a) designed to be deployable at sites requiring little or no preparation and (b) a potential violation of the ABM Treaty.",116
292,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) No. (b) No. If the answer to (a) had been in the affirmative, such activity could have been interpreted as a violation of Article 1.2 of the Anti-ballistic missiles Treaty whereby 'Each party undertakes not to deploy Anti-ballistic missile systems for a defence of the territory of its country and not to provide a base for such a defence . . .' Strategic Arms Limitation Talks I Interim Agreement: Soviet Compliance (Question No. 2268)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: Is he able to say whether the Soviet Union's preparations for SS-X-25 Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile deployment at dismantled SS-7 sites raise concern about future Soviet Compliance with Strategic Arms Limitation Talks I.",116
293,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The United States Administration has indicated in its unclassified February 1985 report to Congress entitled 'Soviet Non Compliance with Arms Control Treaties' that Soviet activity apparently related to SS-X-25 ICBM deployments at two former SS-7 bases (and not, as the Question states ""the Soviet Union's preparations for SSCompliance X-25 ICBM deployment at dismantled SS-7 sites"") does not at present violate the agreed implementing procedures of the SALT I Interim Agreement. The Report goes on to indicate, however, that on-going activites raise concerns about compliance for the future, since use of ""remaining facilities"" to support ICBMs at deactivated SS-7 sites would be in violation of Soviet commitments. The Government notes that the United States has not stated that these activities constitute a violation of the SALT Interim Agreement or its implementing procedures. As it does not have access to the texts of the procedures implementing the Interim Agreement-it understands these were concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1974 in the Standing Consultative Commission whose deliberations, by agreement, are conducted in private-it is not in a position but it is not in a to comment further. Labor Parliamentarians for a Nuclear Free Australia (Question No. 2269)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: (I) In what specific ways do the objects and policies of 'Labor Parliamentarians for a Nuclear Free Australia' differ from those of the Government. (2) Is he able to say what the membership of 'Labor Parliamentarians for a Nuclear Free Australia' is and how many Ministers belong to this group.",116
294,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable members' question is as follows: This question would be best directed to the body 'Labor Parliamentarians for a Nuclear Free Australia' which is not a formal body of the Government and for which, therefore, I do not have any ministerial responsibilities. Foreign Affairs Officer Promotions (Question No. 2270)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: (I) How long does it take on average for Foreign Affairs officers holding honours or higher degrees to be promoted from the equivalent of clerical/administrative (a) class 5 to class 7, (b) class 7 to class 9 and (c) class 9 to class II. (2) Is he able to say how these figures compare with the average periods taken for promotion for similarly qualified officers in the rest of the public service.",116
295,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable members' question is as follows: (I) Based on the' most recent promotions within my Department, Foreign Affairs officers holding honours or higher degrees are promoted on average from the equivalent of clerical administrative (a) class 5 to class 7 in 3.55 years; (b) class 7 to class 9 in 4.35 years and; (c) class 9 to class II in 7.74 years. These figures do not reflect the length of time spent at various levels by officers who have not been promoted recently as it is impossible to calculate a meaningful average length of time for promotions occurring some time in the future. (2) I am unable to say how these figures compare with the average periods for promotion for similarly qualified officers in the rest of the Public Service, as these details are not held by my Department. I suggest that this question would be better taken up with the Minister responsible for public service matters. ANZUS: Beijing Reyiew Articles (Question No. 2271)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: (I) Has his attention been drawn to issues of the Beijing Review of 19 and 26 August 1985 in which it is stated, in articles discussing the Government's review of the ANZUS Treaty, that (a) Australia's insistence on regionalisation implies that it was unwilling to take responsibility for events that occur outside its region, (b) by avoiding such involvement Australia had made it clear that it would not be an active supporter of the United States' world strategy and (c) the country's cardinal interests lie in Oceania's peace and security, and consequently, ANZUS should be focussed on the South Pacific. (2) If so, do these comments accurately reflect the Government's Policy.",117
296,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No. (2) The Government's policy remains as expressed in my Parliamentary statement of 15 September 1983 which described the outcome of the Government's review of ANZUS. In explaining the issues discussed and agreed with our Treaty partners at the ANZUS Council meeting in Washington in July 1983, I said: '. . . we cannot assume military support from our Treaty partners in every contingency; we should therefore develop a self-defence capability in case in a particular contingency we need to rely on our own resources. By definition, therefore, it would not be prudent to base the development of our Defence Force structure on the assumption that our forces will necessarily be part of a superpower deployment in the event of any form of hostilities in which we are involved. It is more prudent and proper to elaborate these force structures on the basis of a self-defence ca!>ability within our regional context. I hasten to add for clarity of record that our threat assessment is as it was for the previous Government, that is, that in the foreseeable future we are not confronted by any likely regional threat. Indeed, agreement was explicitly reached as to Australia's prime defence role, namely, as one of building our self-defence capability within our regional context, rather than as a presumed global role as some sort of appendix of a superpower. That clarification will allow a much more explicit and precise formulation of our defence thinking and will govern the defence structure that we establish for our Defence Force'. (Hansard, House of Representatives page 901) Nuclear Safeguards (Question No- 2272)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: (I) Did he reject a draft Cabinet Submission from his Department in 1983, which concluded that existing uranium safeguards were good, sufficient and effective. (2) If so, on what basis did he reject the submission.",117
297,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I and 2) In September 1983 a draft Cabinet Submission from my Department on the Government's review of nuclear safeguards policy was sent back to the Department for redrafting. I instructed the Department to give further consideration to the concerns which the Labor Party had expressed while in Opposition. Review of Nuclear Safeguards (Question No. 2273)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: (I) Did he write to the Prime Minister on 6 December 1983 stating that his Department's draft submission on uranium safeguards was not acceptable for Government purposes in that it proposed that the existing safeguards were good, sufficient and effective. (2) Did he also say in the memorandum that his Department's submission was probably true and that, (a) the Government could not very well expect to Succeed in reporting back to the Australian Labor Party colleagues that all that was said in Opposition about the deficiencies in the safeguards was unjustified,. (b) the concern that was built up within the ALP for the need for more effective safeguards could not be substantiated and (c) contrary to what the Government had been claiming, its opponents had done such a good job that it could not be improved upon.",117
298,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I and 2) A memorandum dated 6 September 1983 went from me to the Prime Minister, the purpose of which was to inform him of progress on the preparation of a draft Cabinet Submission on the subject of the review then being conducted of nuclear safeguards policy. The subsequent review by Cabinet and Caucus of a range of uranium issues led to the decisions on nuclear policy announced by the Government on 7 November 1983, and to the decision by the Government, announced on 10 November 1983, to ask the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) to conduct an inquiry into Australia's role in the nuclear fuel cycle, which included examination of the effectiveness of nuclear safeguards arrangements. Development of Nuclear Safeguards (Question No. 2174)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: Does the Government intend to announce any changes to the Fraser Government's uranium safeguard measures; if so, when.",118
299,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In May 1984, the report of the Australian Science and Technology Council's inquiry into Australia's role in the nuclear fuel cycle was tabled in Parliament. As noted at that time, the Government considered it to be important that there should be an independent and objective audit of policies and practices in regard to Australia's uranium exports to ensure that they contributed to and strengthened Australia's pursuit of its disarmament and non-proliferation objectives. The Government's response to the Australian Science and Technology Council report indicated the manner in which it is addressing the wide range of issues examined in the inquiry. The Government's activities cover not only measures to enhance nuclear safeguards but efforts to improve the international non-proliferation framework within which safeguards systems operate. Australian Bicentennial Authority (Question No. 2175)  Affairs, upon notice, on 18 October 1985: What advice, consultancy services or financial assistance has his Department given to the Australian Bicentennial Authority.",118
300,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: My Department regularly, as part of its overall responsibility for the conduct of Australia's tions, provides advice to the Australian Bicentennial Authority on the foreign relations aspects of its planning in respect of individual country participation. My Department has also assisted the Authority's communication with other countries. No actual consultancy services have been provided, neither has any direct financial assistance been given. Soviet Activities in the Australian Antarctic Territory (Question No. 2177)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: (I) How many (a) Australian and (b) Soviet, bases currently exist in the Australian Antarctic Territory. (2) Is he able to say what the functions of each of the Soviet bases are and how many personnel are present at each base.",118
301,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) Three (Mawson, Davis and Casey). (b) Four Molodezhnaya, Mirny, Vostok and Leningradskaya) . (2) All Soviet stations in the Australian Antarctic Territory are engaged in scientific research. Molodezhnaya is the largest Soviet station in Antarctica and functions as the command centre for Soviet activities on the continent. It is also the main Soviet Antarctic logistics centre being the focus of intracontinental movement by air and sea and the gateway for air, sea, and telecommunications traffic with the Soviet Union. In addition to its control/logistics functions, the station also has an important research function, especially in the fields of geophysics, meteorology and medicine. Mirny is officially designated as an observatory and its scientific program emphasises meteorological observations. An additional function of Mirny is to provide logistic sUPJlort to the inland Vostok station. Vostok is an important centre for geomagnetic observations. Glacology and meteorological work is also conducted there. Leningradskaya is 'part of the Soviet meteorological system in Antarctica and functions as a collection point for geophysical and other data. According to information exchanged under the Antarctic Treaty concerning the 1984-86 Soviet Antarctic Expedition, Molodezhnaya has 124 winter personnel, Mirny 69, Vostok 27 and Leningradskaya 20. During the summer season, Molodezhnaya has an additional 9 personnel, Mirny an additional 20 personnel and Vostok an additional 5 personnel. Soviet Activities in the Australian Antarctic Territory (Question No. 2178)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: (I) Has the Soviet Union requested Australian permission for the establishment of Soviet bases in the foreign rela- Australian Antarctic Territory. (2) Has the Government given permission for the establishment of such bases. (3) If so, when was permission granted.",118
302,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: On 30 July 1955, the then Minister for External Affairs issued a general invitation, in the form of a press statement, welcoming the interest of other countries in the coming International Geophysical Year (1957-58) and offering to provide assistance to anyone desiring to carry out scientific research in the Australian Antarctic Territory (AAT). This was followed, on 29 August 1955, by the despatch of a diplomatic note in similar terms to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union. This note was presented on the Australian Government's behalf by the British Embassy in Moscow. Australia and the Soviet Union are both parties to the Antarctic Treaty. The Treaty guarantees freedom of scientific investigation in Antarctica, subject to its other provisions. Since the Treaty entered into force on 23 June 1961, the question of permission for the establishment of Soviet bases in the AAT since that date does not arise. Soviet Activities in the Australian Antarctic (Question No. 2279)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: What form of monitoring of Soviet Union activities in the Australian Antarctic Territory is carried out by the Government.",118
303,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty requires all parties, including the Soviet Union and Australia, to inform other Contracting Parties in advance of their activities in Antarctica. 'The Soviet Union regularly fulfils its obligation in this regard, including in relation to Soviet activities in the Australian Antarctic Territory. The Treaty also provides for the exchange of scientific personnel in Antarctica between expeditions and stations and for the exchange and free availability of scientific observations and results from Antarctica. Under these provisions of the Treaty Australia and the Soviet Union have regularly exchanged scientific data. Australian scientists occasionally participate in Soviet scientific programs in Antarctica. In addition, Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty permits any Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party to designate observers who shall have complete freedom of access at any time to any or all areas of Antarctica for the purposes of inspection, to ensure that the provisions of the Treaty are being complied with. Inspection visits carried out by Consultative Parties to date have confirmed that the Soviet Union is abiding by its Treaty obligations. Provisions of the Helsinki Final Act: Soviet (Question No. 2280)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: Is he able to say whether (a) the Soviet Union violated its political commitment under the Helsinki Final Act by failing to provide prior notification of a major Warsaw Pact manoeuvre (Zapad-81) exceeding 25,000 troops in 1981 at a time when great pressure was being put on Poland and (b) the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, provided only the bare minimum of information required under the Final Act in 1984.",119
304,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. The Government is aware of United States allegations to this effect in the Administration's most recent unclassified Report of February 1985 entitled 'Soviet Non Compliance with Arms Control Agreements'. The Government places great importance on full compliance by all parties with the terms of arms control agreements. It urges the Soviet Union to take steps to respond to Western concerns and demonstrate its compliance with the relevant provisions of the Helsinki Final Act. Threshold Test Ban Treaty: Soviet Compliance (Question No. 2281)  Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Is he able. to say whether the Soviet Union's nuclear testing activities constitute a likely violation of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974 which banned underground nuclear tests in excess of 150 kilotons; if so, what representations has the Government made to the Soviet Union on this matter.",119
305,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. The Government is, however, concerned about the uncertainty that surrounds compliance with the Threshold Test Ban Treaty. The Government has urged the Soviet Union to accept President Reagan's offer for Soviet specialists to observe and measure American tests at the Nevada test site and to reciprocate that offer. Similarly the Government's strong advocacy of a comprehensive test ban emphasises the crucial importance of having in place adequate means to verify compliance with this measure. Limited Test Ban Treaty: Soviet Compliance (Question No. 2282)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: Is he able to say whether the Soviet Union's underground nuclear test practices have resulted in the venting of radioactive matter and caused such matter to be present outside the territorial limits of the Soviet Union in violation of the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963; if so, what representation has the Government made to the Soviet Union on this matter.",119
306,Mr HAYDEN,ASSISTANCE TO SOUTH PACIFIC COUNTRIES,"The answer to the honourable . Compliance member's question is as follows: In all its dealings with other countries, including the Soviet Union, on arms control and disarmament issues, the Government urges strict compliance with existing treaties. The Government is aware that both the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have encountered some difficulty in totally containing all their underground nuclear tests and that both countries have raised this in discussions and exchanges on compliance. The Government believes the venting of radioactive matter for underground nuclear explosions in the United States and the USSR to be an increasingly rare occurrence. The Government would be deeply concerned if standards were to be relaxed and the immediate contamination of the environment through venting from underground nuclear e?tplosions become a regular occurrence. Committee to Review Australian Studies in Tertiary Education Mr Rocher asked the Minister' representing the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 20 August 1985: (I) Is the Committee to Review Australian Studies in Tertiary Education an official bicentennial activity.

Associate Professor Bennett and Mr MCQueen serve as part-time committee members and receive a sitting fee, set by the Remuneration Tribunal, of $180 per day when they attend meetings of the committee and when they do work on behalf of the committee. The Remuneration Tribunal also determined that they receive travel allowance of $110 per diem for capital cities and $85 per diem for other than capital cities. (8) A total of $196,370 has been spent on establishing and maintaining the committee as at 9 September 1985. Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (Question No. 1426) Dr Klugman asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 20 literature, history, geAugust 1985: How many (a) university students and (b) recipients of Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowances reside in each (i) post code area and (ii) federal electoral division. Mr Dawkins-The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The information requested is not available because: (a) Data collected by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission include the postcode ofÂ· each university student's residence at the time of first enrolment at an institution and is not processed by electorate. (b) While residential addresses are supplied by TEAS recipients in their applications, these are not recorded on computer. What is recorded is the postal address provided by each applicant for receipt of correspondence or cheques. This may in some cases be the student's home address but for many it is a temporary address during term, a post office box number (which may be located close to the intitution rather than to the student's temporary or permanent address), or simply an address at which it is convenient for a student living away from home to receive mail. Departmental Publications: Department of (Question No, 1474) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 20 August 1985: (I) What journals, digests, files, periodicals and the like are produced by instrumentalities within the Minister's portfolio.

(2) What stepsÂ· does his Department take to ensure imported motors meet Australian standards.",121
308,Mr COHEN,CRESWELL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Available statistics indicate that about 28,000 units of used or reconditioned petrol car engines were imported into Australia over the period January to August this year. Figures prior to this period are unavailable as imports of used car engines were not recorded separately. The question of assistance to the automotive engine reconditioning industry was referred to the Industries Assistance Commission (lAC) on 19 September in response to a request for assistance by the Engine Reconditioner's Association of Australia. The lAC has been requested to submit its final report by 18 September 1986. State New South Wales Victoria . Queensland South Australia . State Victoria (2) No. Private hospitals are not required, and usually same applies to companies, both local and foreign, that Investment Review Board controls the level of The Australian - ngine reconditioning industry has claimed that used engines exported from Japan no longer meet Japanese pollution standards. My Department is seeking further information on this matter. (2) My Department has no responsibility for ensuring that imported motors meet Australian standards. The Australian Motor Vehicle Certification Board, comprising representatives of the Commonwealth, States and Territories administers a national certification system for new vehicles to ensure that they comply with appropriate safety and environmental standards. However, this certification system does not apply to vehicle components, including engines marketed as replacement parts for cars already in use. State and Territory authorities are responsible for ensuring that vehicles in use are maintained so that they continue to meet safety and environmental standards promulgated under motor transport and environment protection laws. Private Hospitals: Ownership by American Corpor-tions (Question No. 1620) Mr Staples asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 10 September 1985: (I) Is he able to say how many of Australia's private hospitals are owned or controlled by American corporations. (2) Is he further able to say what is (a) the total of their investment in this area, (b) what amount of the profits of these enterprises is retained in Australia and (c) what amount is repatriated to the United States.",123

In was able to achieve a small degree of profitability company.' I am not aware of any similar Medical Students in Australian Universities Dr Klugman asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 14 October 1985: (I) Is the Minister able to say what proportion of medical students at the Universities of (a) Sydney, (b) New South Wales, (c) Melbourne and (d) Adelaide concluded their secondary education at (i) government and (ii) non-government schools. (2) Has the Minister received a letter from the Australian Medical Students' Association arguing against any proposal to recover a proportion of tuition costs from students. (3) What is the estimated cost of a medical course at each of these universities. Mr Dawkins-The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) This information is not collected by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission. (2) Yes. (3) Based on data held by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission the estimated recurrent cost per student in 1983 was as follows: University of Sydney . . . . University of New South Wales . University of Melbourne University of Adelaide . These estimates represent only the direct teaching and research expenditure from general recurrent grants associated with Medicine in 1983, per weighted student unit (WSU). For all disciplines in universities, such costs ,represent about 60 per cent of total recurrent expenditure. The figures exclude indirect or overhead costs such as those associated with research only staff, library facilities, central ices. If an imputed value for such items were added, based on the average for the system, the total recurrent cost per medical student (WSU) would be in the range $11,000-$13,000 for 1983 (Est. December 1984 prices). This figure would not include capital or major equipment costs or grants provided for special purposes such as the teaching hospital recurrent grant provided through the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission. produced by HCA, it was stated that: to purchase hospitals and a further $17,000,000 to 1983/84, six years after HCA entered Australia, the company for the first time. No profits have been paid to the parent information published by AMI. Ships: Manning (Question No. 1662) (Question No. 1828) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) Which ships have or will receive the special taxation benefits for 'efficiently manned Australian ships'. (2) What will these benefits cost. (3) What does the term 'efficiently-manned' mean and how does it compare with the manning of similar ships already in service in Australia and overseas.  able member's question is as follows: (I) As the Commissioner of Taxation is responsible for the administration of the income tax law, his advice was sought as to the ships that have attracted, or will attract, the special taxation concessions available for Australian trading ships. The Commissioner has advised that, because the income tax secrecy provisions prohibit the diVUlging of information about a person's taxation affairs, he is unable to provide the specific advice sought. My Department's records show that, up to the end of October 1985, manning notices have been issued for 13 ships. (2) The Commissioner of Taxation advises that if all the ships in respect of which manning notices have been issued to that date were to qualify for the special taxation concessions, the estimated total cost to the revenue of the special concessions, for the period 198384 to 1988-89, would be $70m. Of this amount, $48m would be in respect of depreciation deductions and $/student $22m in respect of investment allowance. (Estimated (3) The legislation requires a manning notice to December specify the manning level required to enable a ship to 1984 prices be operated in a safe and efficient manner. In issuing a 6,790 manning notice, the Secretary to the Department of 7,850 Transport pays regard to the following criteria. 6,450 A ship is considered to be operated in a safe manner 7,900 if, in his view, there are sufficient numbers of qualified officers and crew to allow the vessel to meet the safety requirements of the Navigation Act and to comply with the provisions of the relevant international conventions, particularly the Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping. A ship is considered to be operating efficiently if its manning level is such as to ensure commercial efficiency, including economy of operation. In reaching a judgement on this, the Secretary takes into account administration and student serv(a) the current training and experience level of available Australian crews (b) the present state in devel-pment of modern shipboard practices among Australian crews (c) the details of the ship and its trade (d) crewing levels on efficient, comparable, foreign flag ships. The determination of a safe and efficient manning level is undertaken on a ship by ship basis and varies according to ship type, trade and equipment on board. Of the five manning notices issued, for new dry bulk carriers, four were for levels of 26 and one for 27. Comparable bulk carriers in operation under the Australian flag have crews in the range of 31-35. Many of these vessels have been in service for a number of years and do not incorporate the level of technology available on modern vessels. A survey of North European and Japanese flag dry bulk carriers built since 1980 that have called at Australian ports shows that the average crew on the North European ships is 23.5 and on Japanese ships 20. Commonwealth' Heads of Government Meeting (Question No. 1873) Mr Downer asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 17 September 1985: (I) Has the Australian Government requested items to be placed on the agenda for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in the Bahamas in October 1985; if so, what are the details. (2) Which (a) Ministers, (b) ministerial officers and (c) public servants will be travelling to the Bahamas for the meeting.",123
310,Mr HAYDEN,CRESWELL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Prime Minister has advised the Commonwealth Secretary-General of the general directions that the Australian Government hopes discussions might take at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). This was in response to an invitation from the Commonwealth Secretary-General addressed to all CHOGM Heads of Government to indicate their views on the forthcoming Meeting. Mr Hawke indicated his interest that the Commonwealth Heads of Government discuss in particular, the following items: Southern Africa International Peace and Security International Economic Issues The Special Needs of Small States Employment and Labour Issues The Role of Women in Development International Terrorism (2) The Prime Minister is the only Minister attending CHOGM.

311,Mr RUDDOCK,CRESWELL,"the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 18 September 1985: Is he able to indicate which countries that suspended bilateral aid to Vietnam in 1979 following the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea have (a) resumed bilateral aid programs, (b) continued to give aid to Vietnam through multilateral agencies, and (c) suspended both bilateral aid and aid through multilateral agencies.",125
312,Mr HAYDEN,CRESWELL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The following countries suspended bilateral aid to Vietnam in 1979: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Italy, Japan, Federal Republic of Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, although the United Kingdom delivered aid in 1980, under a prior agreement. (a) Of these countries none has resumed bilateral aid programs. However New Zealand, Australia, Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany have given limited assistance of. a humanitarian nature since 1981. Austria and Switzerland, which reduced but did not completely suspend aid in 1979, also give assistance of a humanitarian nature. (b) All have continued to fund multilateral agencies which have programs in Vietnam. The European Economic Community has also provided humanitarian assistance. (c) No country suspended both bilateral aid and aid through multilateral agencies. Hire of Halls and Meeting Rooms: Department of Social Security (Question No. 1899) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 19 September 1985: (I) Did his Department or any authority under his control hire any halls, meeting rooms, et cetera in 198485; if so, (a) what halls and meeting rooms were hired, (b) for what purposes were they used, (c) what was the cost of hirings and (d) was any of the expenditure related to the implementation of the assets test.

313,Mr HOWE,CRESWELL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (a) The Department does not maintain a consolidated record of the venues which have been hired. To obtain this information would require a manmil search of all monthly expenditure details. This would necessitate the diversion siderable resources from other work which I am not prepared to authorise.

Development and Testing of the Fuel Atmospheric Explosion Bomb (Question No. 2120) Mr Staples asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 10 October 1985: (I) Did the Materials Research Laboratories (then the Defence Standards Laboratory, Melbourne) develop and test the fuel atmospheric explosion (concussion) bomb using fuel vapour in the early 1970's. (2) Was this type of weapon highlighted in the 1979 United Nations Conference on inhumane weapons as cruel and indiscriminate. (3) Is he able to say whether this was the type of weapon which President Carter refused to sell to Israel.",126
315,Mr BEAZLEY,CRESWELL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. In 1973 and 1974 the Materials Research Laboratories (MRL) conducted tests on fuel air explosives in canisters at the Puckapunyal Army Range. To describe the work as a development might suggest that the technology breakthrough was Australian. The technology already existed overseas and it was applied here to ensure that our defence scientists understood the technology sufficiently well to be able to provide soundly Source based advice to the Minister and to the Services in case these weapons emerged as options for Australian Defence. It should be emphasised that these were research tests and not weapon developments. (2) No. The issue of fuel air explosives (FAE) was the subject of a resolution introduced in 1978 by Sweden and Mexico at the first preparatory committee meeting of the United Nations Conference on Prohibitions or Restrictions of Use of certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurous or to have Indiscriminate Effects (commonly know as the Inhumane Weapons Conference). The resolution called for the banning of F AE for anti-personnel use. The question of FAE was not discussed in any depth at and Commerce either the preparatory committee meetings or at the conference itself and accordingly was not covered in the draft convention and protocols adopted by the conference. (3) No. I am not able to say whether President Carter refused to authorise the sale of US F AE weapons to Israel, though such was widely alleged in news reports at that time. Canned Pineapple Products (Question No. 2129) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on lO October 1985: (I) Is it a fact that imported canned pineapple products are being sold in Brisbane supermarkets; if so, what are the (a) quantities and (b) value, of imported canned pineapple imported into Australia during 1984-85 from (i) the People Republic of China, (ii) Taiwan, (iii) Thailand and (iv) other sources. (2) Are there limits as to the quantity of canned pineapple which may be imported. (3) Is there any evidence of dumping of this product on the Australian market. Mr Barry Jones-The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Data available to me does not enable me to verify whether imported canned pineapple products are being sold in Brisbane supermarkets although it does indicate that they are being sold in Canberra and Melbourne supermarkets. Imports of canned pineapple are classified to paragraph 20.06.910 of the Customs Tariff, 'pineapple otherwise prepared or preserved, whether or not containing added sugar or spirit'. This paragraph also covers pineapples packed in bottles and other airtight containers whether or not put up for retail sale.

316,Mr BEAZLEY,CRESWELL,"I present the following in answer to the honourable member's question: (I) I made an announcement on 7 November 1985 on the future use of Commonwealth land at Portsea. This indicated that the School of Army Health would transfer from Healesville into the buildings currently used by the Army's Officer Cadet School at Portsea after the Officer Cadet School moves to Canberra at the end of 1985, and that about 210 ha of land at Portsea could be made available to the State. (2) Effects on the local community were considered in making this legislation. The Commonwealth will be discussing the future of Commonwealth lands at Portsea no longer required for Defence purposes with the State of Victoria. (3) There are currently 44 civilian staff employed at the Officer Cadet School, Portsea, 22 of whom are employed on a limited tenure basis. These staff are not covered by the CE (RR) Act and will cease their employment on 31 December 1985. Of the 22 long term staff, 2 are expected to take up duty in other localities, and my Department is confident that the remaining 20 will be employed at the School of Army Health when it moves to Portsea. Funding: Non-Governm-nt Business Colleges (Question No. 2254) Mr Maher asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: What Commonwealth funds were paid to each nongovernment business college within the electoral division of Lowe in each of the years 1981-82 to 1984-85. Mr Dawkins-The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The one non-government business college in the electoral division of Lowe which has received per capita funding under States Grants arrangements is Drummoyne Business College. The funds paid in each year were: 1981-82 1982-83 1983-84 1984-85 Resignations of Foreign Affairs Officers (Question No. 2276)  Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: (I) How many Foreign Affairs officers have resigned from his Department since March 1983. (2) Who were they, at what levels did these resignations occur and what percentage of his Department's officers do they constitute.",129
317,Mr HAYDEN,CRESWELL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) 32 officers of the Foreign Affairs Officer stream have left the Department of Foreign Affairs since March 1983. Of those, 15 resigned from the Public Service and 17 have transferred to other Departments. (2) I am not prepared to provide the names of the officers as I consider that to do so would be an unreasonable disclosure of their personal affairs. The levels at which these separations occurred were: Assistant Secretary, Leve' 1-2; Foreign Affairs Officers Class 4-5; Foreign Affairs Officers Class 3-9; Foreign Affairs Officers, Class 2-12; Foreign Affairs Officers, Class 1-4. Based on average staff numbers, these separations constituted an average of 2.3 per cent of the officers in the Department's Foreign Affairs Officer stream in each year. Public Relations Expenditure: Department of Defence (Question No. 2312) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: (1) What was the expenditure by the Minister's Department and authorities under the Minister's control on public relations in (a) 1983-84 and (b) 1984-85. (2) What was the nature or subject of the public relations expenditure. (3) Was outside assistance obtained for public relations, if so (a) who provided the assistance, (b) what payments were made and (c) why was the assistance sought.",130
318,Mr BEAZLEY,CRESWELL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) $491,300 (b) $630,500. (2) Expenditure on public relations was in the following categories: 1983-84 1984-85 $ $ Seminars . 11,540 14,000 Printing. . 147,000 130,500 Promotions 171,760 210,000 Cine Film Production . 128,646 238,000 $ Stills Photographic . 32,354 38,000 13,335.23 11,107.69 Total. 491,300 630,500 22,928.13 40,901.54 (3) No outside assistance was obtained for public relations. Chemical Weapons (Question No. 2384) Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: Is he able to say whether (a) the USA has proposed at the Geneva Arms Control Summit, the complete prohibition of chemical weapons with a system of internationally organised inspectors to ratify compliance and (b) the Soviet Union has rejected the proposal for international inspection.",130
319,Mr HAYDEN,CRESWELL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am not aware of any United States proposal on a chemical weapons ban for consideration at the forthcoming Summit between President Reagan and Mr Gorbachev. Australia would strongly support discussion of a chemical weapons ban at the Summit. (a) On 18 April 1984 the United States Vice President, Mr George Bush, tabled in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva a draft Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The objective of the United States draft Convention was to ban the production, stockpiling and use of all chemical weapons. The draft Convention also included prohibitions on preparations for the use of chemical weapons and assistance to anyone to develop stockpiles or use chemical weapons, and provided for the destruction of all existing stocks of chemical weapons and chemical weapons production facilities. The basic prohibitions in the draft Convention met all major Australian requirements and was welcomed at the time by the Australian delegation to the Conference on Disarmament. Since then Australia has worked to ensure that the draft receives full consideration by all countries. The United States draft Convention contained unprecedented verification measures including the 'open invitation' principle, whereby all military and government-owned or controlled facilities can be subject to mandatory international on-site inspection upon request to ensure that there are no hidden. stocks or undeclared production of chemical weapons. (b) The Soviet Union has strongly criticised the verification provisions of the United States draft Convention. It has claimed that the references to government-owned or controlled facilities in the United States draft Convention discriminates against socialist systems where all facilities are government-controlled. The United States has replied that no discrimination was intended and it is prepared to negotiate the point. Australia is concerned to ensure that the verification provisions in a future CW Convention apply consistently to both private and government-controlled facilities so that the international community is reassured that there is no diversion from commercial use to the production of chemical weapons. Australia has been active in urging all concerned to seek negotiated solutions to such problems and has welcomed United States assurances that its draft has not been presented on a 'takeit-or-Ieave-it' basis and that the prepared to negotiate on its contents. To date, however, the Soviet Union has not been prepared to offer alternatives to the United States provisions. Deployment of Soviet Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (Question No. 2385) Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: Is he able to say whether (a) the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks II Treaty permits the deployment of one new type of Inter-Continental. Ballistic Missile and (b) the Soviet Union is currently deploying 2 new types of ICBM.",130
320,Mr HAYDEN,CRESWELL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Article IV.9. of the SALT II Treaty permits each Party to flight test and deploy one new type of light ICBM after I May 1979. (b) Please see answer to part (b) of question on notice No. 1776. Boeing 707 Aircraft: Conversion of Air Refuelling Role (Question No. 2391) Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: (I) Does the Department intend to convert the VIP fleet Boeing 707 aircraft to an air tanker role. (2) Will any proposed air tanker aircraft be compatible with the two different refuelling mechanisms for the F/AI8 and FIll.",131
321,Mr BEAZLEY,CRESWELL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) A proposal to convert Boeing 707 aircraft to an air refuelling capability is currently being considered by my Department. No decision has been made to proceed at this time. The priority for this project, along with other bids for major defence capital equipments, is assessed on the contribution it might make to countering credible contingencies and to the expansion base. (2) The proposal under consideration is to convert Boeing 7078 to provide a capability compatible with both the FI AI8 and FIll air refuelling systems. As the two systems are different, the proposal is being considered in phases, with priority being given to the FIA 18 capability. Small Arms Replacement Project (Question No. 2393) Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: (I) What has been the cost of the Australian Army Small Arms Replacement Project to date. (2) Was the Israeli Galil 5.56mm Assault Rifle conUnited States is sidered in the project. (3) Which manufacturers are currently participating in the project. (4) When is a final decision expected.",131
322,Mr BEAZLEY,CRESWELL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) About $6.l5m has been spent on the Army Small Arms Replacement Project to date. (2) Yes, the Galil Assault Rifle was considered. (3) a. Colt Industries, United States of America; b. Steyr Daimler Puch .of Austria; c. Fabrique Nationale Herstal of Belgium. (4) A decision is expected December 1985/January 1986. Australian Army: Field Clothing (Question No. 2394) Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: (I) What was the outcome of the Australian Army trials for a new disruptive pattern camouflage uniform. (2) What provision has been made for waterproof field clothing for members of the Australian Army.",131
323,Mr BEAZLEY,CRESWELL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Australian Army trials of a new disruptive pattern camouflage uniform, conducted during the period July 1982 to April 1983, indicated overall satisfaction with the trial uniform fabric. The disruptive pattern is considered superior to the in-service plain jungle green and it is expected the new pattern will be introduced into service during 1987. (2) The field soldier is presently provided with a lightweight waterproof tropical smock as field clothing. Anny is developing a set of waterproof jacket and trousers, with procurement planned for 1987. In the interim, sets of commercial-type jackets and trousers will be available to selected soldiers. Department of Defence: Use of Aircraft (Question No. 2395) Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: Has the Department given any consideration to: (a) the deployment of the Royal Australian Air Force jet trainer in a ground attack role; and (b) the procurement of close support ground attack aircraft such as the A\0 thunderbolt or attack helicopter.",132
324,Mr BEAZLEY,CRESWELL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Defence Force uses its Macchi jet aircraft solely in the training role for which they were designed. As part of this function, a small number of Macchi aircraft has been modified to train newly graduated pilots in ground attack skills prior to their progressing to fighter and strike aircraft. The Macchi aircraft in Defence Force service could be modified to perform limited ground attack tasks. (b) Dedicated ground attack aircraft were considered by my Department in the late 1960s and early 1970s as part of the new Tactical Fighter Force considerations. It was recognised then that the new-generation multirole fighter aircraft, with the capacity to perform not only the standard fighter roles but also ground attack tasks, had distinct advantages in Australia's strategic circumstances. In consequence, the decision was made in 1982 to procure 75 F/AI8s, which possess very substantial ground attack capabilities. Dedicated attack aircraft tend to be specialised and not necessarily appropriate to Australia's strategic priorities. For example, the A- \0 Thunderbolt is designed primarily as an antitank aircraft employing its armour-piercing gun capability. Machine Guns (Question No. 2396) Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: (I) Will there be restrictions placed on the employment of 600 Belgium Mag 58 General Support Machine guns to be purchased by the Australian Army in roles other than in combat units. (2) Will there be any deployment of General Support Machine Guns in rear echelon roles.",132
325,Mr BEAZLEY,CRESWELL,"The anSwer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) General Support Machine Guns are allocated to units in accordance with the current entitlement. No restrictions have been placed on the employment of the General Support Machine Gun and none are intended. (2) A number of Units that have an entitlement to this Machine Gun could be expected to operate in rear echelon roles and in forward areas. Such Units include: Construction Squadrons, and Transport Units. Australian Industry Participation in Procurement of Swedish Weapons (Question No. 2397) Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: (I) What is the level of Australian industry participation in the procurement of the Swedish RBS-70 Air Defence Weapons.",132
326,Mr BEAZLEY,CRESWELL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) AB Bofors of Sweden have contractually agreed to an obligation of 30 per cent Australian industry participation in the supply of the RBS-70 Air Defence Weapons. Department of Social Security: Petitions (Question No. 2544) Mr Leo MCLeay asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 19 November 1985: What is the procedure used in the Minister's office to respond, to petitions referred by the House of Representatives.",132
327,Mr HOWE,CRESWELL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: If by 'respond' the honourable member means 'reply', the answer to the question is that my office staff do not reply to petitions as there is usually no address to which a reply can be forwarded. However, my staff and I do respond to petitions by reading them, noting their contents, keeping them in mind and sometimes acting on their proposals. Petitions are forwarded to my department for information. Repetitive Strain Injury: Department of the (Question No. 299) Mr Ronald Edwards asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 21 March 1985: (I) How many compensation claims for repetitive strain injury were received by the Minister's Department and statutory authorities under his control in (a) 1983-84 and (b) 1984-85 to 20 March 1985. (2) What is the analysis of these claims giving details of sex, type of duties performed and the number of claims accepted, rejected and finalised. (3) How many employees are considered to have been successfully rehabilitated, and what steps were taken to achieve rehabilitation. (4) What steps are being taken to prevent this type of injury.",132

In addition to this group, 34 staff have been temporarily redeployed to other work. Some of this latter group have been directed by Commonwealth Medical Officers to return to work on a progressive basis and are currently working restricted hours. As part of a rehabilitation program, a training course has been developed to assist keyboard staff suffering from RSI to move to clerical positions. This course is supplemented by intensive counselling. Where necessary, jobs are designed to suit individual requirements and special equipment and furniture are provided to overcome specific problems. (4) As part of an overall preventive strategy, comprehensive guidelines for the control and management of RSI have been developed and distributed to all staff. The guidelines include provision for mandatory rest breaks for keyboard staff, limitation on keystroke rates and restrictions on the amount of overtime staff are directed to perform. In addition to these guidelines, other preventive action taken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics includes: development of preventive training courses for keyboard staff and their managers; provision of ergonomic furniture and equipment; redesign of overall work station environment with special emphasis on aspects of health and safety; employment of specialist staff, including an occupational therapist, to assist staff and advise management on health and safety issues; and consideration of all relevant health and safety aspects in the design of jobs.

331,Mr KEATING,STATUTORY AUTHORITIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Australian banks provide some information on a confidential basis to the Reserve Bank on their aggregate cross-border exposures to particular countries, including South Africa. It is not possible, however, to provide responses to the detailed questions that have been raised. (2) Sub-section 62 (2) of the Banking Act 1959 provides that the Reserve Bank shall not require information to be furnished by banks with respect to the affairs of an individual customer. It follows that the Reserve Bank would be precluded from seeking the information you have requested regarding specific loans. Department of Community Services: Ministerial Representations (Question No; 1149)  Minister for Community Services, upon notice, on 16 May 1985: (I) Do formal procedures exist for the handling of Ministerial representations in the Minister's Department and statutory authorities for which the Minister is re.:. sponsible; if so, (a) what are the titles of the instructions and when were they issued and (b) are target times provided (i) formally or (ii) informally; if so, what are they.

(2) Is the performance with which representations are dealt with monitored; if so, what was the percentage of representations that met their targets in 1985, to 16 May.",143
333,Mr KEATING,STATUTORY AUTHORITIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Ministerial representations, following their receipt in my office, are forwarded to my Department for processing by a specialised Ministerial Correspondence Unit. This Unit distributes the correspondence to the relevant area within my portfolio for arrangement of a draft reply and also assists in the preparation and co-ordination of some replies. With the exception of the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which maintain their own monitoring systems, the Ministerial Correspondence Unit also oversights the actioning of this correspondence by all other agencies within my portfolio. Central Office (I) (a) Yes, the latest formal instructions were contained in a Divisional Head Minute issued on 17 July 1984, entitled 'Ministerial Correspondence Unit'; additionally, each representation is placed in a distinctive folder, upon which handling procedures are detailed. (b) (i) and (ii) Yes, formally. Within one month of receipt of the correspondence. (2) Yes, 89 per cent of representations in this period were dealt with within the target time. Australian Taxation Office (I) (a) Yes, the Commissioner of Taxation has advised that formal procedures do exist for the handling by the Australian Taxation Office of those Ministerial representations that are referred to it. The titles of the instructions are: 'Head Office Instruction No 241, Ministerial Correspondence' issued on 27 April 1984, and 'Head Office Instruction No 250, Correspondence Control System' issued on 7 September 1984. (b) (i) and (ii) Yes, formally. The target time for the issue of Ministerial correspondence is two months. (2) Yes, but not in the detail that allows this question to be answered. Australian Bureau of Statistics (I) (a) Yes, the Australian Statistician has advised that formal procedures exist. They are contained in the Australian Bureau of Statistics Cabinet, Ministerial and Parliamentary Liaison Procedures Manual, Chapter 3, first issued September 1981, revised and reissued May 1984. Representations (b). (i) and (ii). Yes, formally. The Australian Bureau of Statistics aims to provide replies to Ministerial correspondence within twenty working days of receipt of the representations. (2) Yes. The number of ministerial responses which were completed in twenty working days or less in 1985, to 16 May, represented 85 per cent of the total ministerials received during that period. the titles of the instructions Accounting Standards Review Board (Question No. 1384) Mr Jacobi asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 20 August 1985: (1) What progress has been made in the finalisation of matters relating to the Accounting Standards Review Board (ASRB) and the need to get approval on accounting standards. (2) Is he able to say whether the accounting profession has co-operated with the ASRB. (3) Which standards have been forwarded to the ASRB by the Australian Accounting Research Foundation (AARF) for approval and how many standards have been approved. (4) What is the cause of the delays in drafting standards and what action has been taken to overcome them. (5) Will he give a direction to the ASRB to give 'in principle' approval to some standards until difficulties of delay are resolved. (6) Are there problems with the standards or simply with their format and uniformity. (7) Have standards been submitted for approval by any organisations other than the accounting profession; if so, which organisations and have they been approved.",143
334,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,STATUTORY AUTHORITIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (6) The Accounting Standards Review Board has indicated to the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities its concern over criticisms in the media and elsewhere as to the delay in producing approved accounting standards. The main reasons for the delay have been identified by the Board as being the need to resolve with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia and the Australian Society of Accountants (the 'joint accounting bodies') a number of difficult and complex threshold issues which affected the drafting style, content and copyright ownership of. all future standards. However, following extensive consultations by the Board with the joint accounting bodies, and involving my Department and the National Companies and Securities Commission, the Board now believes that these. fundamental issues have been substantially resolved. Hence, on 17 September 1985 Â·the Board approved two accounting standards submitted by the Australian Accounting Research Foundation (AARF) as, respectively, 'ASRB 1001 Accounting Policies-Disclosure' and 'ASRB 1002 Events Occurring After Balance Date'. Nevertheless the Board accepts the need for the production of approved standards to be accelerated considerably in the future. On 18 October 1985 the Board announced that AARF has advised that it will be subinitting four further proposed standards for approval by the Board. The Board said that it welcomed comments from the public on the suitability of the proposed accounting standards. the topics dealt with by each proposed standard are, respectively, 'Disclosure of Revenue', 'Accounting for Leases', 'Accounting for Interests in Joint Ventures' and 'Foreign Currency Translation'. (7) Proposed accounting standards have been submitted to the Board by the National Companies and Securities Commission and the Australian Shareholders' Association. The standard submitted by, the NCSC was approved on 27 September 1985 as 'ASRB 1003 Foreign Currency Translation-Disclosure'. In the case of the proposed standard on Consolidation submitted by the Australian Shareholders' AssoCiation, the. Board has advised the Association that it requires additional material as set down in its Procedures. The Board will commence its review of that proposed standard as soon as this material is made available by the Association.

Compensation and Legal Expenses: National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (Question No. 1602) Mr Smith asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 10 September 1985: Why has $100,000 been appropriated for compensation and legal expenses for national occupational health and safety purposes in Appropriation Bill (No.1) 198586 when, in 1984-85, no moneys were expended for these services.",143
335,Mr WILLIS,WAI WAD,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: An appropriation for compensation and legal expenses for national occupational health and safety purposes has been included in 1985Â·86 appropriations because the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Act, 1985, is expected to be proclaimed in this budgetary period. During 1984-85 provision for compensation and legal expenses was included within the appropriations of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. Treasury Records: Borrowings by Private (Question No. 1661) Dr Klugman asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 11 September 1985: Do the records of his Department contain details of overseas borrowings by private corporations; if so, is he able to say whether records of borrowings by Australian National Industries are held and whether the records indicate whether Mr John Leard was on the Board of the company at the time of any borrowings.",151
336,Mr KEATING,WAI WAD,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Prior to the removal of almost all exchange controls in December 1983, Treasury received information on certain exchange control approvals of overseas borrowings by individual private corporations. Such information in respect of individual company transactions is, however, confidential, as is any similar information that might have been received from corporations in the course of administration of foreign investment policy. Financial Records: Banks (Question No. 1167) Mr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 11 September 1985: . (I) What documents relating to financial transactions are banks required to retain. (2) How long are they required to retain these documents. (3) Will he take steps to require banks and other financial institutions to keep records similar to the requirements placed on individuals under the Income Tax Assessment Act. (4) What power does the Commonwealth have in this area. (5) Has his attention been drawn to claims that the current rules relating to the retention of records by banks and other financial institutions create difficulties for law and enforcement and taxation authorities in investigating (a) narcotics and (b) fraud offences; if so, can he state whether there is any substance in the claims.",151
337,Mr KEATING,WAI WAD,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) Banks are not required by statute to retain any documents relating to financial transactions involving their customers. Nevertheless, in 1978, at the request of the then Treasurer, banks agreed voluntarily to retain current account vouchers (paid cheques, deposit slips, other debit and credit vouchers) for a minimum period of four years. Depending on their own commercial requirements and practices, some banks and non-bank financial institutions do retain these records for periods longer than four years and do, of course, retain other documents for varying periods. (3) and (5) Several Royal Commissioners and Special Prosecutors have reported that the current minimum four year period for the retention of records observed by banks has created difficulties for law enforcement Corporations and taxation authorities and have recommended an extension of this period. The Government currently has this matter under review in the context of formulating its response to the recommendations in this and related areas of the Royal Commission on the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, headed by Mr Costigan, QC. (4) I am advised that the Commonwealth generally has the constitutional power to enact legislation requiring the retention of records by banks and other financial institutions. The major exception to the Commonwealth's constitutional power arises in relation to 'State banking' i.e. the business of banking engaged in by a State as banker within that State. Commonwealth Subsidies to South Australian (Question No. 1875) Mr Downer asked the Minister representing the Minister for Community Servic-, upon notice, on 17 September 1985: (I) Has the Government agreed to reconsider its freeze on Commonwealth subsidies'to South Australian nursing homes; if so, what additional information or factors led to this change of attitude. (2) Will the Government consider the introduction of a shorter working week for nursing staff as a reason for reversing its decision on subsidy freezing. (3) What was the staff to patient ratio in nursing homes in each State and Territory as at I September 1985. (4) What was the nursing home benefit for South Australia (a) before the May mini-budget and (b) on I September 1985.",151
338,Mr HOWE,WAI WAD,"The Minister for Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) and (2) The Government decided to grant a $3 a day increase in the maximum rate of Commonwealth nursing home benefit payable in respect of patients accommodated in non-government nursing homes in South Australia and the Northern Territory with effect from 14 November 1985. This increase reflects the additional costs arising from the introduction of a 38 hour working week in the nursing home industry in April 1985. Otherwise the freeze on benefits continues to apply. (3) Exact information on the total staff to patient ratio in nursing homes as of I September 1985 is not available. However, the following table shows for each State the nursing staff requirements placed on nursing homes by the State or the Commonwealth Government, whichever is the greater. It also shows the actual nursing staff levels for Victoria, South Australia and Queensland (most recent figures available). Nursing Staff Hours Per Resident Per Week Required by Governments and the' Average Actual Levels, by' New South Wales 13.8 Victoria. . . . about 18 Queensland. . . 14.0 Western Australia 14.3 South Australia . 17.9 Tasmania . . . 13.3 (4) Commonwealth nursing home benefits are reviewed annually and any resultant increases are timed to coincide with the first pension payday in November. The maximum benefit rate applicable in South Australia and the Northern Territory, with effect from I November 1984, was' $39.05 a day. In accordance with the decision outlined in (I) and (2) above, the maximum benefit rate for non-government homes with effect from 14 November 1985 is $42.05 a day. However, the rate Nursing Homes for Government homes remains at $39.05 a day.

(5) What coastal surveillance work was carried o-t by Skywest between May and September 1984 and what was the cost to the Government. (6) What amount has the Government paid to Skywest since September 1984 for coastal surveillance work. (7) Who will (a) pay for and (b) own, the 360 degree radar to be fitted to' Skywest Beechcraft and what is the cost of the radar. (8) Who will pay for the installatioll of the 360 degree radar in the Skywest Beechcraft and what is the cost of installation. (9) What is the expected operating cost to the Government of new arrangements with the 360 degree radar on the Beechcraft. (10) Will the new 360 degree radar be capable of undertaking the (a) search and rescue, (b) monitoring of pollution and (c) detection of illegal shipping functions previously performed from the Airesearch Nomad aircraft prior to April 1984. State (11) Is it a fact that the redeployment of funds for coastal surveillance from Airesearch, NTAWand SkyRequired Actual Hours west to a single contract for Skywest was for the purHours pose of saving $1 to $2 million; if so, has the failure of not available the experimental SLAR meant that the cost cutting 19.1 exercise was not worthwhile. 15.5 Mr YOUNG - The answer to the honourable not available member's question is as follows: 20.0 not available (I) The contract with Airesearch expired on 30 April 1984. It was not entitled to any compensation. (2) The SLAR, fitted to the Shrike aircraft, is leased to Skywest Pty Ltd by L. M. Ericcson. The Government had paid Skywest, in accordance with the contract, a total of $64,692.97 for SLAR for the period I June 1984 to 30 September 1985. (3) The Government paid Skywest $32,763.50 for installation of SLAR into the Shrike Commander aircraft. (4) For the period I July 1982 to 30 September 1985 the following amounts hilVe been paid to surveillance aircraft contractors: (a) Airesearch Pty Ltd (b) Skywest Airlines Pty Ltd (c) Northern Territory Aerial Work (NTAW) (5) Littoral surveillance was carried out by Skywest between 1 May 1984 and 30 September 1984, at a cost to the Government of $3,022,715. (6) Since 30 September 1984 the Government has paid Sky west $7,181,739 for surveillance work. This amount covers the'period to 30 September 1985. (7) The Beechcraft aircraft is presently undergoing trials on the Great Barrier Reef, for a three month period commencing 1 October 1985. The aircraft including the 360 degree radar is being provided by Skywest at no extra cost to the Government. (8) Skywest have supplied the aircraft, complete with 360 degree radar, for the evaluation period at no additional cost to the Government. (9) During the evaluation period there will be no additional operating costs to the Government. (10) The Beechcraft aircraft, 360 radar and a Forward Looking Infra Red System are undergoing evaluation. It is expected that the new 360 degree radar will have at least the same performance as that fitted to the Nomad for th- detection of illegal shipping, and for any search and rescue (which is not a primary function of the coastal surveillance patrols). Neither radar can monitor pollution. (11) Funds were not redeployed from NTAWand Airesearch to Skywest. The contracts with NTAWand Airesearch expired on 30 April 1984; the ongoing contract with Sky west included sufficient flying hours to meet the revised requirements in the zones formerly covered by the other contracts.

(2) What sums are involved in the pending inquiries. (3) How many of these referrals have been investigated by the AFP in the last 6 months.

343,Mr HOWE,ROLE OF TRANSPORT COSTS IN RAW,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (4)What fee is to be or (3) For how has been (5) What special background and long was each paid to experience does each consultant consultant each possess to enable the consultant to engaged consultant undertake the engagement $ 7 months 18,000 - Extensive experience in systems development 4,578 - Expertise related to a databank on sea and tidal conditions and the computer analysis of their effects on marine navigational aids 3 months 25,000 - Expertise in shipping safety studies - costs with previous knowledge of the recovered Hydrographer's Passage from industry 12 weeks 46,371 - Engineering and nautical expertise related to navigational traffic separation 2 days 2,040 - Task involved videotaping of part of a major navigation aid project.

The number of files and papers held by the Australian Federal Police at the end of July 1985 in connection with possible offences against the Social Security Act was 1166. Statistics are not maintained for the number of fraudulently negotiated cheques with AFP at anyone time but on average 1400 cases a month were reported to AFP during 1984/85. (2) Cases referred to the AFP for investigation of possible offences against the Social Security Act include those referred for investigation of the extent of possible offences. Accordingly, it is not possible to indicate the amount involved until it has been established that the reference involves an offence and the extent of the offence has been established. For fraudulent negotiation of cheques details of the amounts involved in cases referred to the AFP at any particular time are not maintained. (3) The Special Minister of State has advised that he has been informed by the AFP that during the 6 month period from February to July 1985 a total of 2687 referrals were investigated or were under investigation by the AFP. (4) Section 7 of the Social Security Act places responsibility for the administration of that Act upon the Secretary of the Department. The Secretary or his delegates may refer cases involving suspected offences against the Social Security Act to the AFP where the circumstances suggest that investigation by Departmental officers would not be appropriate. Examples include instances where multiple claims have been made or complex investigations are likely to be involved or where there is a perceived threat if departmental officers were to undertake the investigation. So far as fraudulent negotiation of cheques is concerned, all Australian Government Departments are required by the Department of Finance to advise AFP of these occurrences where they relate to negotiation of cheques drawn on an official bank account. (5) The Special Minister of State has advised that he has been informed by the AFP that deployment of staff to more preSsing tasks and in areas of greater priority designated by the Government has prevented the AFP from investigating all matters referred by my Department. The Government is addressing the problem of AFP resources by the provision of additional funds during this and the next two financial years for the recruitment of a stronger AFP. Further, officers of my Department and the AFP are at the preliminary stages of negotiating working arrangements/guidelines for the investigation of social security fraud which will streamline referral/investigative procedures. It is also pointed out that the incidence of fraudulently negotiated cheques has, and will continue, to fall as payment by cheque is increasingly superseded by direct credit payments to the clients of the Department of Social Security. As at June 1985, 86 per cent of all pensions, 84 per cent of all unemployment and sickness benefits and 90 per cent of all family allowance payments were made by direct credit to a bank, building society or credit union.

(2) Can he state whether any similar studies have poena's to witness been conducted in Australia; if so, what are the details. (3) If no studies of this kind have been conducted, Notice will he take steps to establish a monitoring body in his Department to conduct such studies on a national basis.",169
345,Dr BLEWETT,LEGAL EXPENSES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) My Department is not aware of any studies of populations located in the vicinity of any petro-chemical plants in Australia. However a health surveillance program of the Australian petroleum industry, titled 'Health Watch' is currently being undertaken by a team of researchers based in the University of Melbourne. This program is monitoring the health status of those currently employed at such plants and maintains contact with resigned and retired employees. It is specifically designed to detect health problems in those exposed to long hours to emissions from these plants. Initial findings concerning the incidence of cancer, released in the 'Health Watch' fourth Annual Report 1984, suggest that workers in the industry as a whole are not at any greater risk of premature death than the Australian population in general. Future investigations will attempt to classify broad categories of jobs in terms of exposure and potential exposure to chemical substances and thus begin to narrow the focus onto particular jobs and categories. I shall make a copy of the report available to the honourable member if he so desires. (3) It is generally accepted that workers in petrochemical plants would usually have higher exposures to materials and pollutants from those plants than the general community. In view of the on-going nature of the 'Health Watch' Study and its findings tu date, I am advised that there are no indications for the Government to initiate additional studies at this stage.

Overtime: Department of Social Security (Question No. 1918) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 19 September 1985 (1) What overtime was paid to staff at each level in his Department and authorities under his control in 1984-85. . (2) Was the overtime related to a specific project or projects; if so, what were they. (3) What is the estimated amount of overtime payable to staff at each level in 1985-86. (4) Is the estimated overtime in anticipation of specific projects; if so, what are they.",176
350,Mr HOWE,DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Overtime is payable to officers up to and including those classified as Clerical Administrative Class 8 who are required to work outside normal hours. Total expenditure in 1984-85 on overtime was $4.6m. Information is not readily available on the amount of overtime' paid to each level ofÂ· officer up to that of Clerical Administrative Class 8. (2) Some of the overtime \fxpenditure was related to work on specific projects such as implementation of the Direct Credits System as the prime method of payment of social security benefits, implementation of Stratplan, implementation of the Assets Test, and establishment of Branch Offices of the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation. Specific information on expenditure on each of these projects is not available. Most overtime expenditure was. necessary to clear arrears of work, to deal with seasonal peaks in workload, to perform urgent and unforeseen tasks, to carry out systems testing which cannot be performed in normal hours and in connection with relocation of offices which would cause disruption to client services if performed during normal working hours. (3) Total estimated expenditure on overtime is estimated to be $5.16m in 1985-86. (4) Provision has been made in the estimated expenditure for 1985-86 for overtime in connection with the establishment of Branch Offices for the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation, for work in connection with the introduction of rental assistance for the unemployed and for an increased requirement for computer matching associated with the detection of fraud and mispayment within the social security system. Nuclear Powered Ships (Question No. 1992) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 30 October 1985: (I) Is he able to say: (a) what the estimated number of nuclear powered ships is in each of the navies which have them; (b) whether there have been any confirmed reports of death or injury due to nuclear power on any of the ships; and (c) whether there is any evidence that nuclear powered ships are less safe than other types of ships.",177
351,Mr BEAZLEY,DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) Naval Ships Submarines Total United States of America 13 I3l 144 Union of Soviet Socialist Republics . 2 179 181 United Kingdom 17 17 France. 8 8 China 4 4 (b) There have been unconfirmed reports of nuclear accidents aboard Soviet nuclear powered warships, however, I am unaware of any confirmed reports of deaths or injury due to the nuclear power plants aboard any warship belonging to the nuclear powers. (c) lam not aware of any evidence indicating that nuclear powered ships are less safe than other types of ships. Heavy Vehicles and Road Trains (Question No. 1995) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 8 October 1985: . (1) What progress has been made with the establishment of uniform axle loading limits for heavy vehicles and road train vehicles in Australia. (2) Is he able to say what the present differences are in State. regulations.  able member's question is as follows: (1) The Government is well aware of the need to achieve uniformity in the area of regulations governing vehicle axle load limits, and is actively involved in the Australian Transport Advisory Council (ATAC) and the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities (NAASRA) which have a co-ordinating responsibility in this area. The Report of the National Road Freight Industry Inquiry (NRFII) recommended that vehicle limits be reviewed and in May 1984, NAASRA commissioned a Review of Road Vehicle Limits (RORVL) to examine existing limits with a view to achieving greater uniformity of regulations across the States and Territories. The RORVL study draft report is expected to be finalised in December 1985. For its part the Federal Government would welcome.reforms that will result in improvements in the efficiency, equity and safety of the road freight industry. (2) Differences between States are concisely presented in tabular form in the NAASRA publication 'Statutory Limits on Road Vehicles' copies of which can be obtained from the Tabling Office. (Question No. 2030) Mr Braithwaite asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 3 October 1985: (I) Has his attention been drawn to a petition presented to the House on 20 August 1985 from 2,300 residents of the Mackay region, Queensland, calling for effective Government action to support the sugar industry out of its crisis. (2) Does the lOO-Day Committee Report recommend a price support level for sugar which would result in 43 per cent of cane growers being able to survive within the price support; if so, what is the expected increase in unemployment following the implementation of this recommendation in the major sugar growing areas in Queensland and northern New South Wales should the remaining 57 per cent of farmers be forced from their farms. (3) Does he recognise an urgent need for an effective package of assistance to the sugar industry to be announced before the end of the 1985 crushing season to immediately underwrite a\ld give confidence to the decisions of farmers, millers and financiers. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) The Sugar Industry Working Party Report recommended a price support level for the 1985 season of $220 per tonne. Based on the 1984 costs of production figures this would cover cash operating costs including growers' own labour for around 43 per cent of growers. However, this estimate does not necessarily reflect the overall viability of cane growers as the survey takes no account of non-cane income and other off-farm income available to the grower. Hence the proportion of growers at risk is nowhere near 57 per cent and is generally considered to be no more than about 10 per cent. (3) Yes. The Federal Government announced on 23 September 1985 an assistance package for the sugar industry totalling $150m over three years to cover price support, adjustment assistance and research funding. The levels of support to No. I Pool are $230 in 1985, $225 in 1986 and $220 in 1987. This i- a more generous offer than that recommended by the Savage Committee and, if accepted, would mean more direct cash grants to sugar growers than any Government has given to a particular primary industry for many years. The Commonwealth offer is conditional both on State participation in the price support scheme and a preparedness on the part of the industry to accept a degree of deregulation sufficient to achieve a level of cost reduction necessary to compete at future price levels. The New South Wales Government is prepared to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government but the Queensland Government Government is not.  Cameron: Department of Immigration and Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 9 October 1985:  and Mr Rod Cameron, their companies, or principals of their companies, for services rendered to the Minister's Department or authorities under the Minister's control and for what purposes in each case. (b) What sums have been paid to each of these people or companies for (a) travel allowance, (b) air fares, (c) accommodation costs, (d) hire car expenses and (e) any other expenses incurred.",177
352,Mr HURFORD,DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: During the period II March 1983 to II November  or Mr Rod Cameron, or their companies or principals of their companies by me, my Department or authorities under my control. Pensions Projections (Question No. 217S) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 11 October 1985: (I) What is the estimated liability for age pensions, at current levels of payment, for (a) 1990, (b) 1995, (c) 2000, (d) 2005 and (e) 2010. (2) What would the annual cost to the Government be of establishing a fund capable of sustaining projected liabilities for age pension payments at current levels up to the year 20\ O.",178
353,Mr HOWE,DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Based on the assumption that the proportion of aged persons receiving an age or service Pension would remain at its present level, the figures sought (including service pension liability for those of age pension age) are: (a) $7.8 billion (b) $8.6 billion (c) $9.2 billion (d) $9.9 billion (e) $11.0 billion (2) The cost to the Government of a fund to finance these liabilities would depend on (among other things) whether specific contributions would be levied, the size of such contributions, the earning rate of the fund over time, whether payments to the fund would be evenly spread over the entire period to 2010, and the extent to which liabilities beyond 2010 were to be financed by the fund. Airport Procedure: Spraying of Passengers (Question No. 2228) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 6 October 1985: (I) What is the substance sprayed on passengers after their aircraft has arrived from overseas. Ethnic Affairs (2) Which other countries use this spraying technique. (Question No. 2061) (3) Which animal plant or human disease carriers is the spray considered to be effective against. (4) What scientific tests have been conducted and by whom to determine the effectiveness of the spray. (5) What scientific literature is there on the subject. (6) Who manufactures the spray. (7) Is the spray commercially available; if so, under what brand name. (8) Is the spray considered to be effective (a) generally or (b) only in civilian airliners in Australia. (9) When was the effectiveness of the practice last reviewed.",178
354,Dr BLEWETT,DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The substance is 2 per cent d'phenothrin in a propellant of equal parts of freon 11 and 12. It is sprayed into the air above the passengers, not on the passengers. (2) Other countries using the spray are New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. (3) It is effective against small soft-bodied insects which are carriers of disease, including mosquitoes, culicoides and flies. (4) Scientific studies measuring the killing rates in caged insects (exposed to the standard disinsection procedure have been conducted by entomologists employed by the Departments of Health and Primary Industry on commercial aeroplanes. The most recent study was conducted in September 1985 on aircraft operating the trans-Tasman run from Sydney to Auckland. (5) There is extensive literature in this area. A representative bibliography is listed with Chapter 7. 'Mosquito and other Insect Introductions to Australia aboard International aircraft, and the monitoring of Disinsection Procedures' by Russell RC et al in 'Commerce and the Spread of Pests and Disease Vectors' editor M Laird, Praegei Publishers, New York 1984. (6) Aerosol Fillers Division of Rite-Grow Pty Ltd, Sydney, NSW. (7) No. (8) It is considered to be generally effective. (9) The effectiveness is now being reviewed by the Departments of Primary Industry and Health, in consultation. Disinsection procedures are being examined, and risk assessments are being undertaken with reference to origin of flight, British Pensioners Residing in Australia Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: (1) Is it a fact that (a) a lengthy strike by British civil servants during 1984 delayed by several months the payment of United Kingdom pensions to residents in Australia and (b) that upon their return to work the . civilservants processed outstanding pensions and forwarded the moneys to the beneficiaries in Australia on a lump sum basis. (2) Has this caused the income of many of the recipients of UK pensions to rise above the tax threshold for the first time in 1984-85. (3) Has the lump sum payment caused their Australian pension to be reduced in 1984-85. (4) Will he consider directing his Department to average the lump sum payment over 15 months to allow for a more equitable income figure to be projected so that these recipients are not disadvantaged further ",179
355,Mr HOWE,DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) In May 1984 industrial action in the computer section of the Department of Health and Social Security ('DHSS') Newcastle-upon-Tyne, delayed payments to British pensioners residing in Australia. There were no computer issued payments are 11 May 1984 until after the strike concluded in January 1985. However, emergency procedures were put in place by DHSS and the British High Commission in Australia whereby British pensioners were able to write to DHSS to obtain manual payment of their pensions. These arrangements were made in June 1984 with the assistance of my Department which was able to inform pensioners of the arrangements and assist in communications between pensioners, the High Commission and DHSS. (b) Advice to my Department from DHSS was that, by November 1984, all British pensioners in Australia were receiving their British pensions regularly through the manual arrangements. When the strike ended normal payment by computer was resumed. (2) United Kingdom pensions are paid 4-weekly or quarterly. Under the manual arrangements for the payment of United Kingdom pensions lump sum arrears were paid during the period June 1984 to November 1984 but, at most, only one extra payment of UK pension would have been paid to 30 June 1985. Because of the difference between the pensioner tax threshold and the maximum Australian pension rate, it is unlikely that the DHSS strike would have caused any pensioner to rise above the tax threshold for the first time. (3) and (4) Under the Social Security Act 1947 income is taken into account when it is 'earned, derived or received'. Although some United Kingdom pensioners were not actually receiving their United Kingdom pension for a time, income was derived and was taken into account in the usual way to calculate the rate of Australian pension payable. A lump sum payment received later would therefore not have led to a reduction in Australian pension - and averaging is not considered necessary. and port of arrival in Australia. Public Relations Expenditure: Department of Social Security (Question No. 2192) (Question No. 2314) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Social S-cuÂ­ rity, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: (1) What was the expenditure by the Minister's Department and authorities under the Minister's control public relations in (a) 1983-84 and (b) 1984-85. (2) What was the nature or subject of the public relations expenditure. (3) Was outside assistance obtained for public relations, if so (a) who provided the assistance, (b) what payments were made and (c) why was the assistance sought.",179

(3) As the ABC is a public authority, (a) are these moneys public funds and (b) will their payment to the Premier of New South Wales be disclosed in the ABC balance sheet. (4) Did the management of the ABC, on the advice of its inhouse lawyers, recommend against settling the action on these terms; if so, did the Board of the ABC over-rule the management on this matter. (5) Did the terms of the settlement include a secrecy arrangement between the Premier of New South Wales and the ABC; if so, (a) how is the arrangement in the public interest and (b) will it preclude the Auditor General from investigating the matter and reporting on it to Parliament.

358,Mr DUFFY,SALARIES AND ALLOWANCES,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is as follows: (I) There were two actions by the Premier of New South Wales for defamation one in respect of a Four Corners program and one relating to a radio program broadcast on 19 April 1985. Both actions have been settled. (2) No. The terms of settlement, insofar as they relate to expenditure, are that the ABC only accepts liability for Mr Wran's legal costs incurred up to the time of settlement.

Satellite Services (9uestioD No. 1686) Mr Burr asked the .Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 12 September 1985: (I) Can he indicate whether Tasmania comes under the south-eastern footprint of the Aussat satellite; if so what programs will be able to be received by Tasmanian television viewers? (2) What effect is Aussat programming expected to have on Tasmanian regional (a) Australian Broadcasting Corporation and (b)commercia\programs?",180
359,Mr DUFFY,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation-ABC-is as follows: (I) Tasmania will come under the south-eastern footprint of the Aussat satellite. Services available for direct reception from the satellite will be the ABC Homestead and Community Broadcasting Satellite Service-HACBSS I-due to be inaugurated on 26 January 1986; this will be followed sometime later by the Remote Commercial Television Service-RCTS-on HACBSS 2. The HACBSS I ABC television program will be identical to that transmitted throughout the south-eastern footprint, which covers New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. It is to be noted, however, that the great majority of residents in Tasmania will continue to be served from conventional terrestrial transmitters, programmed' from the ABC's television studios in Tasmania. Apart from the existing transmission system, my Department is continuing to expand the network of television transmitters throughout Tasmania. (2) (a) The availability of Aussat will have little direct effect on programming to the present ABC television retransmission facilities in Tasmanian regional areas. However, use of the satellite for closed-circuitnon-broadcast-interchange of material between studio centres by the ABC, will enable wider and more immediate coverage of news and current events throughout Australia. Three ABC radio programs will be beamed over the entire state; regional listeners will be able to receive these radio services by installing the appropriate satellite equipment. Over time, the ABC intends extending three radio services to all regional areas by conventional transmitter, but the satellite will allow listeners to receive them sooner. The HACBSS radio programs include national radio services, Radio 2 and Stereo FM; Regional Radio I will also be available. Regional Radio I is a new country radio service specially developed by the ABC for its satellite services and will consist of news, current affairs, discussion and music based around the interests of the entire south-eastern footprint. Radio 2 is essentially a national spoken word radio network, with a percentage of transmission time devoted to state-based programmes. Stereo FM is a national stereo radio service presented from Adelaide, but with contributions from around Australia. It features the best in performing arts, particularly music and drama. (2) (b) Once the satellite is fully operational, commercial operators could have the capacity to deliver programs to all commercial television stations in Australia. This would increase the choice of programming available to the regional stations. Outside the service areas of existing regional commercial television stations, primarily remote areas, commercial programming will be available via direct reception from the satellite, of the RCTS service. Andriessen Agreement (Question No. 1996) Mr Downer asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 8 October 1985: (I) Was Hong Kong initially included among the countries which were to be subject to the Andriessen Agreement to protect Australian beef markets in Asia from subsidised European Economic Community exports. (2) Why was Hong Kong subsequently excluded from this list. (3) Is he able to say how much subsidised beef the EEC has exported to Hong Kong since the Andriessen Agreement was signed. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Division Applied Physics, Sydney Animal Production, Sydney . Entomology, Canberra. Entomology, Perth. . Entomology, Canberra. Entomology, Queensland. . . . Forest Research, Canberra . . . (I) and (2) Australia has been seeking to ensure that EEC subsidies have the minimum possible impact on our markets. The objective through the Andriessen agreement was to restrict the use of subsidies as much as possible. A large number of countries including Hong Kong were considered by Australia in the run-up to negotiations with the EEC for inclusion in an agreement limiting the use of subsidies. Following negotiations, the agreement. finally reached relates to a list of countries which did not include Hong Kong and some others. However, Australia's central objective was to ensure EEC - ubsidised beef was excluded from our major markets. Leaving aside the United States of America and Canada where reliance is being placed on other mechanisms to contain EEC competition, the Andriessen agreement covers almost 85 per cent of Australia's export markets for beef and veal. (3) Official Hong Kong statistics show imports of beef and veal from EEC countries from the beginning of February 1985 to the end of September as 208 tonnes. It is not possible to say precisely how much of this trade has been subsidised. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (Question No. 2043) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Science, upon notice, on 9 October 1985: (I) How many Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation staff have visited South Africa since January 1984 and for what purposes. (2) How many South Africans have visited CSIRO since January 1984 and for what purposes. Mr Barry Jones-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The number of staff who visited South Africa since January 1984 and the purposes of their visits are summarised in Table I attached. (2) The number of South Africans who have visited CSIRO since January 1984 and the purposes of their visits are summarized in Table 2 attached.

Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) State and Federal legislation in the primary industry area overlaps only in the sense that provisions of State and Federal laws might apply to the same products or to the same activity. Because of constitutional and other constraints, however, there is no overlap in the legal sense-Federal legislation relates to international and interstate trade elements; State legislation relates to intra-State elements such as production, land use, pricing and transport. Because of these divisions of power, it is often necessary for the States and the Commonwealth to pass complementary legislation to implement an agreed program. (2) See (I). (3) Not applicable. (4) Not applicable. (5) As part of the Government's program of business deregulation, all Commonwealth primary industry legislation is being reviewed on a continuing basis. In addition, where it has been found that the practical implementation of complementary State and Federal legislation is imposing unnecessary costs, the Commonwealth has moved to remedy that situation by seeking the States' _agreement to refer to the Commonwealth their powers on the issues concerned. An example of this is the Commonwealth's initiative in establishing a national meat inspection service. Financial Support for Red Meat Marketing (Question No. 2412) Mr Simmons asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 14 November 1985: (I) What (a) individuals and (b) firms have received financial support from the Australian Meat and Organisation Culinary Olympics Team WA Lamb Marketing Board Tasmanian Meat Industry Advi- $30,000 sory Committee Deep Down Pty Ltd Tendapak Pty Ltd Sabstar Pty Ltd A. & J. Rich Product Development International WA Dept. of Agriculture Vic; Dept. of Agriculture SA Lamb Committee Challenged Limitations on Meat Imports (Question No. 2427) Mr Staples asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 14 November 1985: (I) Is he able to say what the present position is of the complaint, jointly filed in the United States Court of International Trade. in 1984, by the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, Thomas Borthwick and Sons (Australia) Limited and W. Angliss and Co. (Australia) Pty Ltd, concerning challenged limitations on meat imports. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Livestock Corporation for red meat marketing and research since I July 1984. (2) Will he provide (a) a financial analysis of such support and (b) a synopsis of results. Mr Kerin--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) In facilitating the sale of meat in Australia and overseas the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation engages industry consultants, research firms and other organisations to undertake special projects on behalf of the Corporation. It also provides market advice to companies/individuals and organisations who have novel ideas on product development, marketing and promotion of meat. Such advice is provided by AMLC as part of its day to day functions. The AMLC also undertakes expenditure on specific in-store promotions, trade fairs, meat cutting exhibitions etc, which support the promotion and sale of Australian meat and may supply product to support companies in and Research promotional activities. The AMLC also provides direct financial assistance to individuals, companies and other organisations whose ideas and proposals on the development of new meat products and/or the marketing and promotion of meat are judged to be worthy. The AMLC advises that since I July 1984 expenditure under this category has been: Amount Purpose Comments $30,000 Promotion of Lamb Significant impact on food service sector $50,000 Promotion of Lamb Encourage lamb consumption Promotion of Lamb Encourage lamb consumption in Tasmania $3,500 To Develop Lamb Fast About to test market Food $25,000 To Develop New Meat Company now developing business Products plan $15,000 To Develop New Meat Pilot plant now constructed Products $4,500 Marketing Flavour Modi- Sample product has been delivered fied Lamb to overseas markets $39,000 To Develop New Lamb No product yet launched.

Angliss and Co. (Australia) Pty Ltd., on 19 April 1984, lodged a formal complaint with the United States Court of International Trade seeking a judgment that under the Meat Import Act 1979 and the Agricultural Act 1956, the Meat Import Act's minimum access floor of 1.25 billion pounds for meat imports acts as an absolute minimum limit on aggregate US Meat Imports. The United States Meat Import Law requires the administration to impose quotas on supplying countries when estimated imports exceed aÂ· trigger level. The trigger level is calculated by a formula specified in the legislation. The United States Government was able to avoid imposing quotas in 1983 by the negotiation of voluntary restraint agreements with major suppliers including Australia. In June 1984 the Court of International Trade refused to grant an injunction to prevent the United States Government negotiating voluntary restraint agreements with supplying countries which limit US imports to less than the minimum access floor of 1.25 bi11ion pounds annually. It was found that the 1979 Act did not restrict the President from negotiating voluntary restraint levels below the 1.25 bi11ion pound minimum. The court did find that the United States action of restricting imports below the guaranteed floor level did cause material injury to the Australian Industry. The AMLC sought clarification of the judgment to determine whether the President has the discretion to negotiate voluntary restraint levels to the minimum access floor level even where the trigger level was below that floor. The court however declined to offer a judgment on the question as it was considered to be hypothetical at that time. The AMLC and the two exporters were invited to bring the matter before the court if the circumstances should actually arise. To date these circumstances have not arisen and accordingly the matter is in abeyance. Petitions: Department of Primary Industry (Question No. 2540) Mr Leo MCLeay asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 19 November 1985: What is the procedure used in the Minister's Office to respond to petitions referred by the House of Representatives? Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Petitions which have a bearing on my portfolio responsibilities are referred tei my Department in respect of the issues raised. The concerns of petitioners are sympathetically considered in relation to the matters raised. I reply to the individual initiating the petition following its lodgement with the Tables Office. Petitions: Department of Transport Mr Leo MCLeay asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 19 November 1985: What is the procedure used in the Minister's office to respond to petitions referred by the House of Representatives.  able member's question is as follows: Petitions received in my office which are relevant to the transport portfolio are referred to the Department of Transport. The views expressed in the petitions are taken into account in the development and administration of policies and programs in the same way as the views expressed in direct representations received from other organisations and individuals. Beekeepers and Honey Packers: Opinions on the Australian Honey Board (Question No. 2559) Mr Hunt asked the Minister for Primary Ind-stry, upon notice, on 19 November 1985: (1) Is it a fact that requests have been made under the Freedom of Information Act for confidential replies by beekeepers and honey packers to a request from his Department for their opinions on the role and functioning of the Australian Honey Board; if so, what does he in-end to do to ensure the confidentiality of these replies is not broken and their contents made public. (2) Is the release of such information potentially damaging to future surveys requesting producer input into their industries. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Department is currently undertaking a review of the role, powers and functions of the Australian Honey Board. To facilitate this a discussion paper titled 'Review of the Australian Honey Board' was circulated to the industry in April this year. Subsequently the views of those people associated with the packing, sale and distribution of honey on the domestic and export market was sought in July. C In September the Department received a request for access to these comments under the Freedom of Information Act. Consistent with the provisions of the Act all respondents were consulted to ascertain their views towards release of those comments. Only one respondent opposed disclosure in full while another asked that some deletions be made. (2) No. As i11ustrated in my response to (I) sensitive information provided to the Commonwealth by producers or packers is adequately protected from disclosure under the provisions of the Act. Appropriate appeal procedures exist to resolve any disagreement between parties over the release of such documents if this becomes necessary.

363,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The answer to the honourable (Question No. 860) member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) Defence has sourced approximately 314 munitions items from overseas suppliers during the past decade and is currently procuring an additional 97 such items. These items are predominantly special ammunition types or components which cannot be produced in Australia with due economy. Defence currently makes no significant purchases of finished ammunition products from commercial sources in Australia although there are many local suppliers of the raw and processed materials used for the production of such items. Consultants: Department of Transport (Question No. 1250) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 23 May 1985: Has the Minister's Department, or any statutory authority or organisation for which the Minister is responsible, employed consultants since March 1983; if so, (a) who has been employed, (b) for what purpose, (c) what working plan was given to them, (d) what was the cost of their services, (e) when did their services commence and finish, and (f) was any fee in excess of the initial quote; if so, by what amount.  able member's question is as follows: Department of Transport (a), (b), (d) and (e) Relevant information has been provided in the answer to question No. 445 asked by Mr Ruddock on 26 March 1985. Details have been forwarded to the honourable member. (c) and (f) It is the practice to send a commissioning letter to all consultants defining and framing the task to be undertaken. The general practice is that consultancies are subject to fixed fee arrangements. Requests for price variations submitted by consultants will only be approved for demonstrated direct cost increases which are reasonably (a) (b) Prof. L. Zines, Provide legal advice Australian National University Prof. C. Howard, Provide legal advice University of Melbourne Mr W. MCComas, Provide legal, advice Counsel of the Sydney Bar Mr M. Harvey, Provide economic University of advice Queensland Gavan MCDonnell and Provide economic Co., Consulting advice Economists , Ms C. Pirie, Consulting Edit the Tasmanian Editor Freight regarded as beyond the control of the consultant and also beyond normal commercial risks. Where the Department alters the scope of work any additional cost must likewise be demonstrated: I am advised that substantial departmental resources would need to be diverted from normal duties to provide the more detailed information sought by the honourable member in relation to individual consultancy arrangements. I am therefore not prepared to authorise diversion of resources for this purpose. Statutory Authorities As Minister for Transport I am responsible for two statutory authorities-the Australian National Railways Commission (AN) and the Australian Shipping Commission (ANL). Both AN and ANL are required by legislation to operate as commercial undertakings. I am therefore not prepared to provide information which may prejudice their commercial operations, nor am I prepared to direct them to incur the substantial expenditure involved in collating the detailed information sought by the honourable member. Inter-State Commission I am also responsible for administration of the Inter-State Commission Act 1975 which provides for the operation of the Inter-State Commission (ISC) , an authority established by the Constitution. With respect to consultants engaged by the Inter-State Commission, I am advised as follows: (c) (d) (e) (f) $ Opinions on sections of the 2,540 23.3.84 No Australian Constitution as to 20.12.84 applying to the ISC and matters relating to the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme Opinion concerning the 3,000 8.6.84 No Tasmanian Freight to 1.3.85 Equalisation Scheme Advise on corporate struc- 4,890 25.7.84 No ture of numerous compa- to 19.12.84 nies receiving subsidies under the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme Advise on shipping costs 480 10.5.84 No across Bass Strait for the to 18.7.84 investigation into the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme Advise on rail costs for in- 7,080 10.12.84 No vestigation into the Tas- to 28.2.85 manian Freight Equalisation Scheme 11,858 13.11.84 Yes to 14.3.85 $4,342 Equalisation Scheme Report (a) (b) Ms Di Keddie, Occupational health Physiotherapist aspects of ISC Telephone Services: Local Call Access (Question No. 1646) Mr Fisher asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 11 September 1985: Does the Minister's Department provide local call access to clients to the district or regional offices of the Department; if not, will the Department consider installing a 008 telephone number so that clients currently without local call access can have equal opportunity to contact the Department for assistance.",224
364,Mr HURFORD,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: My Department does not provide local call access to clients to Regional or Area Offices, nor is it proposed to install 008 telephone numbers for this purpose in the immediate future. By its very nature, my Department is in daily contact with a wide variety and vast numbers of clients of different backgrounds with whom it has dealings over a range of issues (e.g. migration, sponsorship, citizenship, residence, departure tax, passports (Darwin), post-arrival services etc). However, Departmental activities which come closest to being community support services are the post-arrival programs and services provided to migrants and refutralian gees. By definition these are services which are directed towards an identified group rather than the whole munity. At the last Census, in 1981, some 80% of all migrants (including refugees) were resident in a capital city or in a major urban centre where my Department. has a Regional Office (e.g. Sydney, Melbourne, etc.) an Area Office (e.g. Albury/Wodonga, Wollongong, Townsville, etc.). This is true of an even larger percentdevelopment age of migrants who have been in Australia for less than five years, and who are likely to have more need of specialised post-arrival services than migrants of residence. The Government has given serious consideration to the introduction of a toll-free (008) telephone service by which all migrants, irrespective of their place of residence, could contact my Department's Telephone Interpreter Service (TIS) for assistance with interpreters or for information and referral. Already, diverters and tie-lines link nine areas of significant migrant population with TIS in the nearest capital city for the cost of a local call. Other priorities, such as the purchase of new telephone equipment and the developInterim ment of a community resource index, both intended to enhance the quality of service by TIS, have meant that the provision of the toll-free facility covering the whole of Australia has had to be deferred. Only a small proportion of my Department's clientele is in the position of not having access either in person (c) (d) (e) (t) Occupational health aspects 160 2.4.85 No including measures to to 23.5.85 staff combat repetition strain injury or by telephone to a local office of my Department. This, together with financial and practical considerations (including the real possibility that the provision of the 008 facility might tend to encourage unnecessary calls thus disrupting work flows and service to other clients) militate against the provision of the 008 facility to individuals at the taxpayers expense. Interim Committee of the Australian Sports Commission (Question No. 1823) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: Will he implement any of the proposals of the Interim Committee of the Australian Sports Commission recommending that the Australian Olympic Federation, the Confederation of Australian Sport, the Australian Commonwealth Games Foundation, the Australian Sports Medicine Federation and the Australian Coaching Council should be subservient to the Australian Sports Commission with regard to Commonwealth funding; if so, what progress has been made. Mr John Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The report from the Interim Committee for the AusSports Commission makes no reference whatsoever to any intention to make the organisations mentioned comin the question subservient to the Commission. Although it is not clear in the question, I assume that the honourable member has drawn his wholly erroneous inferences from those sections of the report which emor . phasise that, so far as recommending and overseeing funding from the Commonwealth Government for sports is concerned, the Commission should be the p-minent authority. In performing that role, which is entirely appropriate and necessary, the Commission longer in no way seeks to influence or undermine the status and authority of individual associations. That has already been substantially recognised by the sporting community itself. At the most recent annual meeting of the Australian Olympic Federation, an organisation cited by the honourable member in his question, the role and potential of the Commission was endorsed and supautomatic call ported in the strongest terms. Finally, I would draw the honourable member's attention to a key paragraph on page 9 of the Interim Report in the section entitled 'The report: An Overview'.. The Committee states quite unequivocally: This report emphasises that the establishment of the Sports Commission will not reduce the autonomy or independence of sports organisations, umbrella groups or Governments. The Interim Committee believes that such independence is vital to the development of sport, and indeed, is enshrined in the constitution of bodies such as the Australian Olympic Federation. 'Sports Funding (Question No. 1827) Mr Blunt asked the Mi-ister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: What were the individual recommended allocations for assistance to (II) national sporting organisations, (b) the National Athlete Award Scheme, (c) the Sports Talent Plan, (d) the Children in Sport Program and (e) any other programs administered by the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) , for 1985-86, by (i) the relevant funding committee within the ASC, (ii) the ASC executive, (iii) himself and (iv) any other person or group of persons. Mr John Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The' allocation of funds in respect of the programs and projects mentioned in parts (a) to (e) was decided in the normal context of Budget deliberations and were the subject of discussion b(\tween the Commission and myself. It is not the practice for the detail of such discussions, which are properly to be regarded as confidential, to be disclosed. Radioactive Waste: Bandiana Base (Question No. 1987) Mr Milton asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 8 October 1985: (I) Is there currently a problem with the disposal of radioactive wastes. at the 4 Base Workshop at Bandiana Base, Wcidonga, if so, is he able to say whether the Atomic Energy Commission is aware of the problem. (2) What is the (a) amount of radioactive waste involved, (b) current storage site, (c) period of time it has been stored and (d) origin of the waste. (3) Have appropriate safety procedures been followed to ensure that the waste is not endangering the health of military personnel; if so, what are they. (4) When and where is the radioactive waste likely to be disposed (5) Why has there been a delay in the disposal of the waste.",226
365,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No. The waste is being transferred to interim storage facilities at 31 Supply Battalion, Bandiana Victoria. (2) (a) 2.5 cubic metres. (b) Radiac Calibration Centre at the 4 Base Workshops, Bandiana. (c) The waste has accumulated over the past 5 years. (d) Compasses, gauges and detection training items. (3) Yes, appropriate safety procedures based upon the Victorian Health Act 1958, Health (Radiation Safety) (Amendment) Regulation 1984, and supported by various departmental and unit safety instructions have been followed. (4) and (5) The Minister for Resources and Energy ' indicated in a Press statement of 21 May 1985 that an 'office review' to identify possible locations suitable for national storage and burial facilities would take up to nine months. Field investigations would be undertaken after State and Federal Ministers have considered the results of that review. Aid to Ethiopia: Charges on Grain Imports (Question No. 2037) Dr Klugman asked the, Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 9 October 1985: Has his attention been drawn to reports that the Ethiopian regime imposes a Â£20 (sterling) per ton tax on donations of grain; if so, is he able to say for how long this tax has been in place.",227
366,Mr HAYDEN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There are no taxes, as such, charged by the Government of Ethiopia on donations of grain for aid or relief purposes. There are, however, a number of port handling and various other charges which are legitimately incurred and which are often incorrectly described by outside observers as a 'tax'. Handling charges have recently been negotiated, on behalf of all donors, by the United Nations Office of the Assistant Secretary-General for Emergency Operations Ethiopia. Other costs paid by the donor or on its behalf may include port dues and fumigation, inland freight, surveys and rebagging and reconditioning as necessary. Estate of Petro Fedorczenko (Question No. 2219) Mr Reith asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 16 October 1985: Has a sum of $100,000 been received from the estate of Petro Fedorczenko as reported in the Melbourne Sun on 12 July 1985; if so, to what use have the funds been put.",227
367,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: At this point in time no moneys have been received by the Department of Defence from the estate of Petro Fedorczenko. Arrangements have been made, however, between the Australian Government Solicitor and Mr Fedorczenko's Executors for the payment of an amount of $96,696.78 to the Department of Defence. Subject to existing financial and legal requirements it is intended that the bequest be utilized by the Australian Defence Force Academy, Reform of the United Nations Towards an International Organisation with Sovereign Powers (Question No. 2230) Mr Staples asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 18 October 1985: (1) Have United Nations officials repeatedly insisted that there is no fault in the UN Charter if only member States would obey it, but admitted that the main reason of the UN's existence is to secure peace. (2) Does Australia support reform of the UN Charter towards an international authority with power to override national sovereignties in settling international putes by peaceful means. (3) Have public opinion polls supported such reform. (4) What steps has Australia taken to provide international surveillance systems and to persuade citizens to support them as an essential first step in gaining international confidence in such an international authority.",227
368,Mr HAYDEN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The purposes of the United Nations are set out in Chapter I Article I of the Charter. The maintenance of international peace and security is central. The United  said that the Security Council, the body charged with maintaining international peace and security, has not made full and effective use of the measures available to it under the Charter. (2) While the Government favours procedural reform of both the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council, it does not believe that revision of the UN Charter towards creating such an international authority with power to override national sovereignties is a practical possibility in the foreseeable future. (3) I am not aware that there have been any public opinion polls taken in Australia on Charter reform. (4) While I am not certain what the honourable member means by 'international surveillance systems', Australia participated in several UN peace-keeping operations and in such organisations as the Security Council, the Commission on Human Rights, the Conference on Disarmament, the International Atomi.c Energy Agency and Interpol, which in their various ways contribute to the maintenance of international order. Australia urges support for the work of these bodies. Use of Veto in the United Nations Security (Question No. 2232) Mr Staples asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 18 October 1985: (I) Has his attention been drawn to a statement at the 40th United Nations Anniversary Conference, by Mr Vernon A. Walters for the United States that if the rule of law is to replace anarchy, international law involves surrender of a certain amount of sovereignty. (2) Has his attention been drawn to a statement by the Soviet President, Mr Gorbachev, that detente is needed only as a transition from a world cluttered with arms to a reliable and all-embracing $ystem. of international security. (3) Will the Government commend these statements as the dawn of a sane alternative to the absolute sovereignty allowed to veto powers in disputes involving them at the Security Council of the UN.",228
369,Mr HAYDEN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I am aware of a speech by Mr Walters on the occasion of the 40th Anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter, 26 June 1985, in which he said that 'internationalism must inevitably involve the surdisrender by all nations of a certain measure of liberty of action'. (2) While General Secretary Gorbachev has put forward these general ideas on a number of occasions I am not aware of any recent statement by him using the exact words referred to. (3) The right of veto in the Security Council was a matter much debated at the time of the founding of the United Nations. While Australia and many other member states' have reservations about the right of veto, it must be recognised that the crucial participation in the United Nations of the major powers is, to a significant extent, dependent upon their having the right of veto in the Security Council. Removal of that right would be likely to increase tensions among the great powers, with further a-verse effects for world security. Voting on Disarmament Issues at United Nations General Assembly 39 (Question No. 2355) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: How did Australia vote in 1984 at the United Nations General Assembly on questions of disarmament, nuclear and chem!cal weapons test explosions and related issues.",228
370,Mr HAYDEN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is' as follows: The First Committee, with deals with disarmament and related issues, recommended to the General Assembly in 1984 a total of 72 resolutions and one decision. Of thes- resolutions, 28 were adopted by consensus. Of the 44 put to a vote, Australia voted in favour of 23, against 7 and abstained on 14. With regard to the resolutions concerning a nuclear test ban, Australia and New Zealand worked vigorously at UNGA 39 for the adoption of a resolution which Council promoted' a comprehensive nuclear test ban. This resolution gained the highest ever number of positive votes on a nuclear testing resolution (124 votes) and alone among three competing resolutions, attracted no negative votes. Australia abstained on the two competing nuclear test ban resolutions, those sponsored by Sweden, Mexico and the Soviet Union, because they called only for a nuclear weapons test ban, thus permitting the. possibility of so-called peaceful nuclear explosions. On chemical and biological weapons six resolutions were presented. Australia co-sponsored and voted in favour of a United States resolution condemning the use of CW generally, and a French resolution on the United Nations CW experts' report on procedures for investigating allegations of the use of chemical weapons. Australia abstained on the German Democratic Republic resolution which called for the establishment of a Chemical Weapons Free Zone in Europe. Australia also cosponsored a Norwegian Biological Weapons resolution and a Canadian/Polish resolution urging progress in the negotiation of a CW convention at the CD. Both of these resolutions were adopted by consensus. An Iranian resolution on chemcial weapons use in the Iran-Iraq war was - ot put to a vote. The full details of the, resolutions and decision referred to above, including the voting record may be found in the United Nations Press Release GA/7095 of 21 January 1985 which is held in the Parliamentary Library. National Consultative Committee on Peace and (Question No. 2377) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: What are the names of the members of the National Consultative Committee on Disarmament and Arms Control and on what basis was each appointed.",228
371,Mr HAYDEN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The name of the National Committee which I appointed to assist me in developing and giving effect to the program for the International Year of Peace, 1986, is The National Consultative Committee on Peace and Disarmament. Its members are: The Hon. A. J. Grassby (Chairman) Mrs Stella Cornelius (Director, IYP Program) Mrs Joyce Clarke (Australian Peace Committee) Mr Michael CIQhesy (Youth Affairs Council of Australia) Mr Chicka Dixon (Aboriginal Arts Board, Australia Council) , Mr Cliff Dolan (Australian Confederation of Trade Unions) Mr W. J. Henderson (Confederation of Australian Industry) The Rev. Philip Huggins (Victorian Association for Peace Studies) Sir William Keys (President, Rettrned Services League) Mr Jeffrey Kildea (Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace) , Dr Ian Maddocks (Medical Association for the Previsions of War) Mr Ian Mathews (Editor, The Canberra Times) Mrs Elizabeth Mattrick (Women's International League for Peace and Freedom) Mrs Mavis Robertson (Australian Coalition for Disarmament and Peace) Mr Leon Stubbings (Australian Red Cross Society) Dr Keith Suter (United Nations Association of Australia) Dr P. G. Williams (Scientists Against Nuclear Arms) The Rev. Dr H. D'Arcy Wood (Australian Council of Churches) Mrs Kathleen Taperell (Department of Foreign Affairs) Mrs Tonia Shand (Department of Foreign Affairs) No formal criteria were laid down for selection of Committee members. However, in determining the composition of the Committee I took into account the need for the Committee to be broadly representative of the Australian community and the need to involve community groups which were national in character and which had demonstrated a concern for peace and disarmament issues. Karen Insurgents in Burma (Question No. 2382) Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: (I) What is the Government's attitude to the objectives of the Karen rebellion in eastern Burma. (2) What is the involvement of Australian citizens in Disarmament providing assistance to the Karen rebellion.",229
372,Mr HAYDEN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The leaders of the Karen ethnic minority did not sign the Panglong agreement of 1947, by which the other ethnic minorities joined the Burman majority in forming the Union of Burma. Many Karens rebelled in 1949 in support of an independent Karen state between Burma and Thailand, and the rebellion has continued at varying levels of intensity since then. The rebel cause is now actively supported by only a small proportion of the Karen population in Burma, mainly in the border region. The majority lives at peace with the government in other parts of Burma. The Australian Government hopes that a settlement of the differences between the Government of Burma and the Karen rebels can be negotiated by the parties concerned. (2) I am aware of reports that Australians are allegedly assisting or have allegedly assisted Karen rebel forces. I am not able to substantiate these reports. Australian legislation imposes severe penalties on Australian citizens and residents who enter foreign countries to engage in hostile activities against the governments of those countries. Nuclear Testing , (Question No. 2383) Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November , 1985: Has his attention been drawn to concern expressed by the United States Government that the Soviet Union may have exceeded the mutually agreed 150 kiloton threshold limit in its nuclear testing program; if so, does he support the United States proposal to allow the scientists of both countries to visit the nuclear testing in order to monitor measurements of yield and ensure complaince with treaty obligations.",229
373,Mr HAYDEN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government is aware of United States Government concern that the Soviet Union may have conducted nuclear weapon tests with a yield greater than the 150 kilotons threshold provided for in the signed but unratified Threshold Test Ban Treaty and it does support the United States proposal to allow reciprocal visits by scientific teams to monitor test explosions and to calibrate monitoring equipment. Indeed, in June 1985 I wrote to Mr Gromyko-then the Soviet Foreign Minister-to urge that the Soviet Union take up this American proposal. I would add that, most recently, the United States has made this a unilateral invitation, not dependent on reciprocity. AUstralian Army: Armoured Personnel Carriers (Question No. 2398) Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: (1) What is the number of M113 armoured personnel carriers (a) in the Australian Army and (b) required by the Australian Army on mobilisation under the current Order of Battle. (2) If there is a shortfall in the number required under the Order of Battle, how would he propose to rectify it in the absence of local armoured personnel carrier production.",229
374,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) There are presently 796 armoured personnel carrier variants in service. The current Order of Battle, on mobilisation, indicates a requirement for 1133 armoured personnel carrier variants. However, it is possible that  on Australia's future Defence capabilities may.result in changes to the Order of Battle, varying the numbers of armoured personnel carriers considered appropriate to Australia's strategic circumstances. (2) The Order of Battle on mobilisation would be dependent on the strategic requirements then perceived. Were there to be a requirement to increase the numbers of light armoured fighting vehicles of the M113 type, additional vehicles would be procured from overseas sources during the warning time that would necessarily precede the initiation of any but the lowest levels of hostility. Defence Force Service Awards (Question No. 2437) Mr Sinclair asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 15 November 1985: (I) Is it a fact that (a) the Defence Force Service Awards were instituted in May 1980 and (b) there are many thousands of serving members of the Defence Forces, both permanent and Reserve, who although qualified for these awards have yet to be gazetted. (2) Are the delays from gazettal to issue of the Defence Force Service Awards in excess of 18 months; if so, has he discussed with the Minister for Administrative Services what action can be taken to stop such delays occuring. (3) Is it a fact that the percentage of Air Force Service Awards issued to the Reserve and ex-permanent members serving in the Reserve is significantly less than Pay Level 2 the Reserve percentages in the other 2 services. (4) Will he ensure that similar delays are avoided for Pay Level 4 those members of the Defence Forces who have qualified for the National Medal under the 1982 amendments the issue of which has been delayed until the backlog of Service Awards has been processed.",230
375,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) No. The Defence Force Service Awards were formally instituted by Her Majesty The Queen on 20 April 1982. (b) Yes. (2) No, medal entitlements are generally despatched within 3-5 months from gazeltal. There have been infrequent occasions however, where, due to such difficulties as locating members the medal entitlement has been delayed beyond 12 months. It would be a most unlikely situation where the despatch of the medal was delayed by 18 months. (3) No it is not a fact that the percentage of Air Force Service Awards issued to Reserves is significantly less than the other two Services. The Air Force figure is slightly under 2 percent as in Navy's. The .figure for Army is in the order of 24 per cent which reflects a higher proportion of Reserves as a part of the total Army force. ,.(4) As the 1982 amendments to the National Medal Regulations removed members of the Defence Force from the categories of persons eligible to qualify for the Medal, the question is not applicable. Defence Force Pay Scales (Question No. 2440) Mr Sinclair asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 15 November 1985: What were the pay scales for (a) regular warrant officers, senior non-commissioned officers and other ranks in the Army, (b) equivalent ranks in the Royal Australian Navy and (c) equivalent ranks in the Royal Australian Air Force at (i) 30 June and (ii) 14 November 1985.",230
376,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The answer to the honourable member's question is contained in the table of salary rates attached. The attached rates do not include the Service Allowance component of annual salaryÂ· payable to all these categories. The Service Allowance at 30 June 1985 was $2786; at 14 November 1985 was $3062.

(2) Were anY consultants employed; if so, (a) who were they, (b) what fees were paid to them and (c) what conclusions did they reach.",230
377,Mr BEAZLEY,CHIEF PETTY OFFICER AND WARRANT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) and (b) It is a normal part of my Department's operations that alternative means of Ipeeting capability requirements are assessed. Alternatives are generally assessed for their contributions to Australia's particular strategic situation and could include changes to existing equipment or other resources if other more appropriate approaches are identified. An important element of such investigations is the financial implications, without which a judgment on relative priorities would be deficient. The Department employs external consultants to provide technical advice on many issues; ego environmental issues, detailed design, technology or production questions. Details of the broader investigations being undertaken by Messrs Dibb and Cooksey are provided below. Given the very large number of capability analyses undertaken by my Department and the level of security classification attached to most studies of this type, not in a position to provide the full range of details sought.

(3) Does the Minister's Department or statutory authority carry out a search of the register at the Australian Capital Territory Corporate Affairs Commission. (4) If the search discloses a failure to comply with the Australian Capital Territory Associations Incorporation Ordinance, what steps are taken to ensure that the matter is remedied by those responsible for administration of the Ordinance or the incorporated association. (5) Have all incorporated associations within the Australian Capital Territory funded by the Minister's Department or statutory authority complied with the Ordinance requirements for lodging particulars or financial affairs and balance sheets annually.",232
378,Mr BEAZLEY,CHIEF PETTY OFFICER AND WARRANT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Department of Defence provides a grant-inaid to the Royal United Services Institute of Australia (RUSI), an organisation which operates in the Australian Capital Territory but is not incorporated; (2) The grants do not have a requirement that the RUSI be registered under the Australian Capital Territory Association Incorporation Ordinance 1953; (3) and (4) The Department does not carry out a search of the register of the Australian Capital Territory Corporate Affairs Commission. (5) As the RUSI is not an incorporate body compliI am ance with the Ordinance requirements are not in question, however the RUSI is required to provide the Department annually with an audited statement of its financial affairs.

Labelling of Pharmaceutical Products (Question No. 1121 and 1123) Mr Wright asked the Attorney-General and the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 15 May 1985: (1) In view of criticism by the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations that existing information on pharmaceutical labels is not sufficient for informed consumption, will he give consideration to new Commonwealth laws which would require labels to give (a) the generic name, (b) the nature of uses of the product, (c) dosage and administration guides, (d) unwanted effects and contraindications, (e) storage life and conditions, (f) multi-lingual explanations and (g) mandatoryexplareceive financial nations of side effects. (2) Will he also investigate with the view to implementing, the French policy of requiring drug firms to disclose evidence of the product's efficacy.",234
385,Dr BLEWETT,CHIEF PETTY OFFICER AND WARRANT,"The honourable member has asked identical questions of both the Attorney General and me, as indicated by the above question numbers. With the concurrence of the Attorney-General, I provide the following answer to the honourable member's questions: (1) The labelling of phannaceutical products has been of concern to my Department for a number of years. As a result an Order entitled 'General Requirements for Labels for Therapeutic Goods' has been developed by the Therapeutic Goods Standards Committee. The draft Order specifies the information to be included on labels applied to containers and primary packs of a wide range of pharmaceuticals. The labelling requirements address, amongst others, the points raised in the honourable member's question under(a) the generic name; (b) the nature and uses of the product; (c) dosage and administration guides and (e) storage life and conditions. Limitations of available space on labels preclude the inclusion of information under(d) unwanted effects and contraindications; (f) multi-lingual explanations and (g) mandatory explanations of side effects, (Question No. 1061) and this information is normally included in product literature which may accompany the product or can be found in product reference books. A final draft of the Order which has involved extensive consultation with industry, Government and user groups will be considered for adoption under the Therapeutic Goods Act by the Therapeutic Goods Advisory Committee later this year. In the event that the Order is acceptable to the Therapeutic Goods Advisory Committee the requirements will become mandatory for aU goods covered by the Commonwealth Therapeutic Goods Act. The individual States and Territories have agreed, in principle, to draft complementary legislation to ensure the requirements are uniformly applied throughout Australia. (2) My Department has not been able to determine the point of difference between French and Australian policy regarding disclosure of efficacy. The detailed data submitted by a company to the Australian Government are regarded as confidential. Claims of efficacy are subjected to careful assessment by my Department and the independent Australian Drug Evaluation Committee. My Department reviews promotional claims by companies against these assessments. The Australian mechanism for drug evaluation has worked well and is regarded internationally as one of the best. Freedom of Information: Legal Advice . (Question No. 1135) Mr Staples asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 15 May 1985: (I) What actual or approximate amount has been provided by the Commonwealth, directly or indirectly, for legal advice and representation in respect of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 in each year since its commencement in respect of each department or agency. (2) What was the total amount paid for the engagemerit of private counsel to represent agencies in proceedings under the Freedom of Information Act in each year since its commencement in respect of (a) preliminary conferences conducted before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, (b) the hearing of applications for review or other applications by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and (c) proceedings before the (i) Federal Court of Australia and (ii) High Court of Australia. (3) In respect of the Freedom of Information Act, to what extent is legal advice and assistance furnished to agencies by (a) his Department, (b) Departments of State or agencies and (c) private legal practitioners. (4) What principles or criteria are applied in determining whether a department of State or agency obtains legal advice and/or assistance and/or representation under the Freedom of Information Act from (a) his Department, (b) another department of State or agency, and (c) private legal practitioners including counsel. (5) Who is responsible for making decisions about whether an agency will receive legal advice or assistance or representation in respect of the Freedom of Information Act or proceedings brought under the Act. (6) In relation to the decisions referred to in part (5), are there any limits in relation to expenditure on legal assistance; if so, (a) what are they and (b) who is responsible for determining them. (7) Is there any tension in his Department's responsibility for administering the Freedom of Information Act and in its role as a source of legal advice or representation to agencies concerned to limit access under the Act. (8) How many recommendations have been made in accordance with sub-section 66 (I) of the Freedom of Information Act and what has been the outcome of each such recommendation. (9) Will the Government give consideration to including in the Freedom of Information Act a provision similar to that contained in section 170 'of the Trade Practices Act 1974.",234
386,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CHIEF PETTY OFFICER AND WARRANT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) I do not propose to provide detailed information on the specific matters raised. The work involved in answering in detail would exceed' what is customarily accepted for answers to parliamentary questions and I am not prepared to divert the resources of my Depart' ment for that purpose. (2) I am not able to provide a detailed break up in response to this question, but the following material was reasonably accessible and is provided in partial answer. The Attorney-General's Department receives information from agencies subject to the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act on their costs of operating under the Act for the purpose of publication in the Attorney General's Annual Report to Parliament on the operation of the Act. The Annual Report for 1983-84 reported that fees paid to legal counsel amounted to $24,897. The 1984-85 Annual Report reports that fees paid to legal counsel amounted to $107,865. Specific records on the cost of defending appeals in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), and the Federal Court have not been maintained. No FOI case has yet been heard by the High Court. (3) and (4) My Department gives legal advice on the FOI Act to Commonwealth bodies in the normal performance of its functions. In addition the FOI Act recognises the role of the Attorney-Genera!'s Department in assisting agencies to comply with their obligations under the Act. It requires that the Annual Report on the Act describe the relevant activities undertaken by the Department: see Chapter 3 of the 1982-83 Annual Report and Chapter 5 of both the 1983-84 Annual Report and the 1984-85 Annual Report. In addition to the work undertaken by the FOI Branch of my Department, the Australian Government Solicitor represents many agencies in relation to proceedings under the FOI Act as in any other situation. Some statutory bodies receive legal advice on FOI matters from legal advisors in their own staff or from private legal practitioners. (5) The Attorney-General's Department provides legal advice or assistance on requeSt to aU agencies in respect of the Act or proceedings thereunder and the Australian Government Solicitor represents agencies in appeal proceedings on instruction. It is a matter for each agency to consider whether it will seek legal advice or assistance on FOI matters, except where proceedings in a Court are involved. (6) There are no special guidelines limiting expenditure on legalÂ· assistance in respect of the Freedom of Information Act or proceedings brought under the Act. However, pursuant to Finance Direction 13/7 and 13/ 8, claims for payment of legal costs shaU not be certified in accordance with section 34 (2) of the Audit Act 1901 unless they have been endorsed fair and reasonable by the Secretary, Attorney-General's Department or a Director of Legal Services or an officer appointed by him. Also, where the Australian Government Solicitor acts for a Department or agency, the Australian Government Solicitor has a role in determining whether counsel should be engaged and, if counsel is to be engaged, has the final responsibility for the selection of counsel. VII 1'+ JUIII: 1'0;' It was announceo tnat the uovernment has decided that agencies should reimburse the Australian Government Solicitor in defending FOI cases in the AAT and the Federal Court. This is consistent with the provisions of section 29/1 of the Finance Directions. (7) MeasureS have been taken to avoid any difficulties resulting from the performance of the dual responsibilities. For example, my Department in its role as the Department responsible for administering the Act might advise an agency not to contest an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against a. decision made by the agency under the Act and, if the agency was not dissuaded from contesting the appeal, my Department would bring the matter to my notice. It has been arranged, however, that in such circumstances the Australian Government Solicitor would continue to act in the ordinary way as solicitor on the instructions of the client agency. Also, measures have been taken within my Department with a view to ensuring co-ordination of advice as to prospects of resisting an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and advice generally under the Act. (8) There have been three recommendations in accordance with sub-section 66 (I). Decisions in respect of each have yet to be made. (9) This matter could be considered in the context of a general review of the FOI Act which is expected next year. Ministerial Representatives: Department of Resources and Energy (Question No. 1156)  Minister for Resources and Energy, upon notice, on 16 May 1985: (I) Do formal procedures exist for the handling of Ministerial representations in the Minister's Department and statutory authorities for which the Minister is responsible; if so, (a) what are the titles of the instructions and when were they issued and (b) are target times provided (i) formally or (ii) informally; if so what are they. (2) Is the performance with which representations are dealt with monitored; if so, what was the percentage of representations that met their targets in 1985, to 16 May. Mr Barry Jones-The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Yes. (a) Typing Manual for Authors issued in August 1981. (b) Replies to correspondence from: - Federal and State Parliamentarians-IO working days; and - Private citizens-20 working days from receipt in my Department unless otherwise indicated by my Office. (2) Yes; 47 per cent. My Department has recently completed entering records of Ministerial Correspondence received since December 1984 into a central computerised information system which resulted in the delay in providing this part of the answer to the honourable member. Export Market Development Grants Scheme (Question No. 1266) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 23 May 1985: (I) In view' of the Government's decision to exclude tourism from the export market development grants scheme, has the Government given any undertaking to maintain eligibility for grants for operators with contractual marketing operations extending beyond 20 May 1985. (2) If the Government has adopted this policy, how many firms and businesses are involved and what is the cost of this undertaking. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) At the time the Government announced that the tourism industry was to be excluded from the export market development grants (EMDG) scheme, effective from 20 May 1985, it indicated that the Minister for Sport,Recreation and Tourism, Mr John Brown, would be bringing forward separate proposals for providing assistance to the industry. Subs\Xluently, on 19 June 1985, the Acting Minister for Sport, Recreation  tion of the tourism overseas promotion scheme, effective 20 May 1985. Detailed guidelines' for TOPS were released by the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, on 25 September 1985. In the circumstances there is no need for the Government to give an undertaking to maintain eligibility for grants for operators with Contractual marketing operations extending beyond 20 May 1985, since the overseas promotional activities of these operators will be subject to the provisions of the tourism overseas promotion scheme from that date. A Bill to give effect to the amendments to the EMDG scheme was enacted on 16 October 1985.

(2) Which tourism operators were not extended. interim assistance under the EMDG scheme after it ceased to cover tourism. (3) Were any tourism operators denied interim assistance; if so, (a) who were they, (b) why .were they denied assistance and (c) who decided that such assistance should be denied. Mr Dawkins-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) to (3) At the time the Government announced that the tourism industry was to be excluded from the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) scheme, effective from 20 May 1985, it indicated that the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism would be bringing forward separate proposals for providing assistance to the industry. Subsequently, on 19 June 1985, the Acting Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, the Hon Peter Morris, announced the introduction of the Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme, effective from 20 May 1985. Detailed guidelines for TOPS were released by the Minister for Sport, Recreation and Tourism, Mr John Brown, on 25 September 1985. In the circumstances no interim assistance has been necessary for tourism operators under the EMDG scheme after 20 May 1985 since their overseas promotional activities will be subject to the provisions of the Tourism Overseas Promotion Scheme from that date. ' A Bill to give effect to the amendments to the EMDG scheme was enacted on 16 October 1985. (Question No. 1559) Mr Jacobi asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 22 August 1985: (I) Is it a fact that (a) certain provisions of the Companies Code concern defaulting and/or fraudulent company directors, (b) the courts have applied strict interpretations in dealing with the component of fraud in fraudulent transactions and (c) s.556(1) of the Code and its associated provisions could be a major weapon in the armoury against misfeasance. (2) Has his attention been drawn to (a) the statements by Mr James Farmer in his publication 'Creditor and Debtor Law' which hailed s.556(3) of the Code as a boon to liquidators stating that they would not have to wait for convictions before bringing in funds under ss.556(1) and (3) and (b) the judgment of Young J. in the New South Wales Supreme Court Ross, MCConnel Kitchen & Co. Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v Ross and Ors (1985) 3ACLC 326, 329) which held that only creditors could bring actions under s.556(3). (3) Are s.556(3) proceedings available to creditors only and not liquidators who are able to assess whether or not s.556(1) applies; if so (a) why and (b) will the provisions be amended to make Parliament's intention clear. (4) Is it a fact that (a) s.557(1) allows the court to make a declaration of personal liability where a director has been found guilty of reckless trading and (b) a recovery from a director by the creditor will result in a reduction of the amount of indebtedness of a company; if so, why is the 'prescribed person' not given standing under s.557(1) to apply for a declaration of liability. (5) Is it a fact that ss.557(1) and 556(3) restrict the court in the order it may wish to make in that it must make an order or give judgment in favour of the credi- . tor; if so, will he amend the legislation to give the courts a broader discretion. (6) Is it a fact that s.556(1) substantially re-enacts the provisions of s.374C, UCA, in that a controlling director of a company can say that he is prepared to support the company at the time the debt is incurred and then later refuse that support and not pay, leaving the company with no means of paying the creditor; if so, will he take urgent steps to amend the provision to outlaw or discourage this behaviour; if not, why not.",241
390,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ABORIGINAL HOSTELS LIMITED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) In certain circumstances ss.556 and 557 of the Companies Code impose civil and criminal liability on company directors for the debts or fraudulent conduct of a company. (b) Similar provisions dealing with fraud in earlier legislation have been interpreted by the courts as requiring proof of actual dishonesty. (c) Section 556(1) may render the directors and persons involved in the management of a company civilly and criminally liable for a debt of the company if immediately before the debt was incurred there were reasonable grounds to expect that the company would not be able to pay its debts as they fell due. The section is an important element in the scheme of creditor proCompanies Code tection adopted by the Code. (2) Yes. (3), (4) and (5) The recent decision of Young J. in the New South Wales Supreme Court in Ross McConnel Kitchen & Co. Pty Ltd (in liquidation) v. Ross & Ors (1985) 3 ACLC 326 was that proceedings for the recovery of a debt under sub-section 556(I) are available to creditors oilly and not to liquidators. Similary, sub-section 557 (1) allows the court to make a declaration of personal liability to a creditor where a person has been convicted of an offence under s.556(1). This is quite different from s.557(2) which allows the court, on the application of a 'prescribed person' as defined by s.557(3), to make a declaration of personal liability to the company where a person has been convicted of an offence under s.556(5). There seems little point in allowing a 'prescribed person', such as a liquidator, to apply in his representative capacity for a declaration under sub-section 557(1) when the benefit will only accrue to an individual creditor. On the other hand, under sub-section 557(2) the liquidator is quite appropriately seeking a declaration of liability for the benefit of the company as a whole. (6) While s.556(1) is based on s.347C(I), UCA, it has been restructured to place greater responsibility on directors and persons involved in the management of a company at the time when unreasonable debts are incurred. A significant difference relates to the burden of proof. It was an element of the offence under s.347C(I) that the defendant had no reasonable or probable grounds to expect that the company would be able to pay its debts. This placed the burden of proof on the prosecution, making conviction difficult in the case of a director who claimed that at the time the debt was incurred he was prepared to support the company. Under s.556(1) it need only be proved that there were reasonable grounds to expect that the company would be unable to pay its debts. The defendant would then have a defence under s.556(2) only if he were able to prove that the debt was incurred without his authority or consent or that he did not have reasonable grounds to expect that the company would not be able to pay its debts. Legal Aid: Launceston (Question No. 1560) Mr Smith asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 22 August 1985: (I) How many (a) applications for legal aid were received and (b) grants were made, by the Australian Legal Aid Office in Launceston in each year since 1980. 1980-81 1981-82 1982-83 1983-84 1984-85 Notes: (a) While no statistics are available, it is considered approximately 3 per cent, and defence of debt cent, of the total grants of aid. (b) The relevant available statistical information distinguishes, legal aid arising in family law and general law matters. matters such as those described (c) The number of matters shown as grants in criminal State laws. Figures relating to grants of aid in recorded (see note (b) above). (3) There is no specific information available as the average delay between the receipt and the making of a determination on applications. However, I underpossible stand that at the present time, unless an application for aid is seen clearly to be urgent (see answer to question (5) below), the time taken to determine an application for aid from its receipt until a letter notifying decision is despatched is, on average, 7 days. (4) The establishment level and also the average ing level for each year ending at 30 June are as follows: 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 (5) Where an application for aid is made to the office that is seen clearly to be urgent, for instance it may have beenhand-delivered or preceded by a telephone enquiry, it will be immediately directed for consideration. The usual practice is for the applicant or his or her solicitor to be informed of the decision by telephone before formal notification of the decision is made in writing. The office will also consider applications for aid in urgent cases that are made by telephone. If time per(2) How many grants of legal aid have been made by that office for (a) familY'law matters, (b) criminal matters, (c) claims for personal injuries and (d) defence of debt recovery services, in each year.

(5) What procedures does the office have for handling urgent applications for legal aid.",243

Local Call Access to Department of Employment and Industrial Relations (Question No. 1639)  ployment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 11 September 1985: Does the Minister's Department provide local call access to clients to the district Department; if not, will the Department consider installing a 008 telephone number so that clients currently without local call access can have equal opportunity to contact the Department for assistance.",249
395,Mr WILLIS,S S S S,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No, there has been no evidence seen by my Department that there could be an appreciable level of demand for such a service or that the usage would justify the cost that the Department would incur. The Offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service are located throughout the country, and this should allow for the greater majority of call traffic to be at local rates. Experience has shown that the incidence of STD calls from clients is small. The Department does, however, operate arrangements where reverse charge calls from clients concerning services and programs are accepted by State and local offices of the CES. Where there is a likelihood that a client will need to contact the Department from some distance such a client would be advised of this procedure and invited to use it. While such instances are not common they do occur in cases concerning the Relocation Assistance Program and in rural locations where CES Offices cover large geographical areas. In view of the foregoing, the Department does not consider that it is necessary or desirable at this time to introduce toll free calls into its operating system. Industrial disputes within Ministers' Portfolios (Question Nos. 1793-1820) Mr Blunt-asked all Ministers, upon notice, on 13 September 1985: (I) What (a) industrial disputes, (b) strikes, (c) work bans or (d) work to rule bans have there been within the Minister's Department or authorities under the Minister's control since March 1983. (2) In each case (a) what was the basis of the dispute, (b) what was its outcome, (c) how many employees were involved and (d) for how long were they involved.",252
396,Mr WILLIS,S S S S,"As indicated above, the honourable member asked identical questions of all Ministers. As Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Industrial Matters, I am responding on behalf of all Ministers, with their concurrence. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) In its statutory role as the authority responsible for determining salary and terms and conditions of employment for Public Service Act staff, and consistent with the current industrial co-ordination arrangements, the Public Service Board monitors industrial activity only for those Departments and Authorities in statutory relationship with the Board. or regional offices of the As the collection and collation of the full range of information sought by the honourable rp.ember would impose an unreasonable burden on the resources of departments and authorities, the scope of this answer is limited to such information as is certainly recorded by the Board. The information provided to the honourable member covers the period from March 1983 to mid-October 1985. Since 1 June 1984, when the jurisdiction of the Public Service Arbitrator was subsumed within Division IA of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, the Board has been advised of industrial disputes in Departments and Authorities in statutory relationship with the Board when a dispute has been formally notified to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. In the case of those disputes that do not reach the stage of formal notification, the Board relies on formal and informal advice from Departments and Authorities. On this basis, information is maintained on all industrial disputes in Departments and Authorities in statutory relationship with the Board. This information, in response to the honourable member's question, generally covers the timing and duration of disputes, the types of staff involved, the unions involved, the reasons for the form and location of each dispute and their effects. Given the various forms that industrial disputation can take, it is often not possible precisely to ascertain .the numbers of persons involved; for this reason, statistics are not maintained to this level of detail. . The information is as set out in the following schedule. Further to the specific information requested by the honourable member, I would also add that there has been a considerable improvement in industrial relations since this government came to power. During our term of Government, the number of working days lost due to industrial disputes has fallen dramatically to, and remained at, its lowest level for 17 years. This improvement has been assisted by several Government initiatives and, given the honourable member's interest in the Commonwealth public sector, I shall mention those initiatives taken by the Government with respect to its own employees. Arbitration and protection rights have been restored through repeal of the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Protection) Act and the 'no work as directed, no pay' provisions. Payroll deductions of union dues has been re-instituted and staff-management consultation on, and co-ordination of, occupational health and safety initiatives have becn facilitated by the establishment of the Committee on Occupational Health and Safety in Australian Government Employment.

Immigration Cases before the Federal Court: Legal Aid (Question No. 2107) Mr Robert Brown asked the Attorney General, upon notice, on 9 October 1985: (I) Are people without authority to remain in Australia, or who have been refused permanent residency in Australia, able to obtain: legal aid to put their case to the Federal Court. (2) How many people who have been refused permanent residency have taken advantage of legal aid in each of the years 1980-1981 to 1984-1985. (3) Under what conditions have they been able to take advantage of legal aid. (4) What has been the cost in each instance for their legal representation. Security Mr LIONEL BOWEN - The answer to the honourable member's question is asJollows: (I) The basis of eligibility to apply for legal aid from all major legal aid agencies in Australia, that is, State legal aid commissions and the Australian Legal Aid Office, is involvement in a matter arising under Australian law and not nationality or residence. Therefore, as the Parliament has enacted laws which provide legal mechanisms, which .include proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia, whereby persons alleged to be prohibited non-citizens can have decisions regarding, or arising out of, their status reviewed, such persons can obtain legal aid for the purpose of exercising their rights under those laws, provided they are eligible under the criteria relating to means and merit applied by the legal aid agency in question and subject to the appropriate conditions imposed by the legal aid agency in question according to the circumstances of the case. (2) This information is not available, because statistics currently kept by the legal aid agencies and col$ lected by the Commonwealth do not enable matters 59,614.00 involving residency status to be specifically identified. 325,213.55 However, the Attorney-General's Department has re68,055.00 cently asked all major legal aid agencies to participate 293,166.41 in a survey, to be undertaken in respect of a defined 2,222.00 period in the near future, of legal aid applications from 15,135.10 persons alleged to be prohibited non-citizens in respect 18,372.25 of matters concerning their status. This survey is de2,068.50 signed to provide the Department with statistical infor81,526:73 mation regarding the numbers, nature and cost of matters 2,630.00' in which legal aid is granted for such cases. However, it should be emphasised that, in view of both the legislative protection of the confidentiality of information regarding individual clients of State legal aid commissions and the policy of protecting confidentiality in relation to clients of the Australian Legal Aid Office, the survey will provide information for statistical purposes only and will not involve identification of individual cases. (3) See answer to (I) above. (4) See answer to (2) above. Unauthorised Immigrants: Eligibility for Social Security Benefits (Question No. 2108) Mr Robert Brown asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 9 October 1985: (I) Are people who are not citizens of Australia or are without resident status and without authority to remain in Australia, eligible for unemployment benefits or other forms of social security; if so, under what conditions. (2) What are the relevant sections of the Social Security Act. (3) How many of these people have been eligible for benefits in each of the years 1980-81 to 1984-85. (4) What category of pension have they received and what has been the cost in each instance.",275
400,Mr HOWE,CMOA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Apart from minor exceptions in relation to family allowance and family income supplement, citizenship is not a prerequisite for any form of social security. However, all forms of assistance other than special benefits have as a prerequisite specified conditions of residence in Australia (or corresponding residence under a reciprocal agreement). Legal advice has indicated that 'residence' for the purpose of the Social Security Act means legal residence, so that prohibited non-citizens (persons without authority to remain in Australia) are not generally entitled to receive social security assistance. However, in certain unusual circumstances special benefit may be paid, ego where a prohibited non-citizen has applied for regularisation of residence status and is in hardship. (2) The provisions of the Social Security Act which contain the principal residence requirements for the various payments are as follows: Unemployment Benefit. Paragraph 107 (I) (b) Sickness Benefit . . . Paragraph 108 (I) (b) Age Pension . . . . Paragraph 21 (I) (b) Invalid Pension . . .

(2) By whom and for what purpose was each of the applications made. (3) How many of these applications have been approved and what is the ABA's contribution to each project.",276
402,Mr COHEN,CMOA,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Australian Bicentennial Authority, is as follows: (I), (2) and (3): The Commonwealth Government has provided $166m at 1982 prices to the Authority for the development of a program of National and International events.

Compensation for Criminal Injuries (Question No. 2179) Dr Klugman asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 11 October 1985: (I) What amount was awarded to applicants under the Australian Capital Territory Criminal Injuries Compensation Ordinance 1983 in 1984-1985. (2) What part of this is expected to be paid by (a) the Commonwealth and (b) the person committing the injury. (3) In the case of policemen injured in the execution of their duty, are the awards additional to their ment under the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971.",277
404,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OF EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The total amount awarded was $248,429.31. (2) The Commonwealth pays the compensation awarded. However, if the injured person subsequently recovers damages in respect of his or her injuries, whether in the Territory or elsewhere, he or she is required to reimburse the Commonwealth up to a maximum sum equal to the amount awarded under the Ordinance. (3) No, the awarding of compensation is not additional to a policeman's entitlement to compensation under the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971. Should a policeman receive compensation under the Act he is required, as is the case with any person receiving damages for injuries inflicted as a result of criminal conduct, to refund to the Commonwealth the amount of compensation received up to a maximum equal to the amount awarded under the Ordinance. Helicopter Flights: Electoral Division of Lowe (Question No. 2200) Mr Maher asked the Minister for Aviation, upon notice, on 14 October 1985: (I) How many helicopter flights passed over the suburbs of Drummoyne and Chiswick, within the Electoral Division of Lowe, in (a) June, (b) July, (c) August and (d) September, 1985. (2) How many of these flight were classified as joy flights. (3) Is action being taken to restrict unnecessary helicopter movements over these suburbs.  able member's question is as follows: (I) Since theSe helicopter flights are conducted outside controlled airspace and without the direct knowledge of Airways Operations' staff, no statistical records of the number of flights are kept by my Department. (2) The same applies to joy flights-no records are kept. I am informed that joy flights originating from Piers 22/23 Pyrmont have now ceased. However, previous flights always operated within the transit lanes to the east of the Darling Harbour and Pyrmont areas and not over the Drummoyne area. (3) No. My Department is not in a position to determine what are necessary or unnecessary helicopter movements. Action has been taken, and continues to be taken to remind operators of their responsibilities to conduct flights strictly within the designated lanes. Railway Vehicles Dispute: Appointment of Mr Neil Batt (Question No. 2237) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Employment entitle- and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: (I) W,ho appointed Mr Neil Batt to mediate in an industrial dispute threatening a $200 million sale of light railway vechicles to Hong Kong. (2) Does Mr Batt have the power to settle the dispute caused by the 4 unions without reference to the Arbitration Commission. (3) Is the unions' wage claim outside the Government-trade union accord. (4) If the appointment was by the Federal Government for the purpose of protecting exports, why has similar action not been taken when agricultural exports have been similary threatened.",279
405,Mr WILLIS,OF EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Mr Batt was appointed by the Commonwealth Minister for Trade and the Victorian Minister for Transport following agreement with the company and the relevant unions. (2) Mr Batt's role in this matter is to assist in the negotiation of an industrial agreement between the company and the unions. This agreement is to provide for industrial relations stability in return for job security. The agreement will facilitate the signing of a contract in relation to the Hong Kong light rail projects. Mr Batt will also assist in the resolution of any local which arise in the operation of the agreement. (3) As part of the agreement reached between the company, the unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, any wages claims are to be dealt with by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Comrnission in accordance with the National Wage Fixing Principles of September 1983. (4) This is a matter of Government policy to be decided upon from time to time in light of the circumstances prevailing. Inada Holdings Pty Ltd (Question No. 2248)",280
406,Mr CONNOLLY,OF EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL,"the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: (I) Was Inada Holdings established by the Aboriginal Development Commission in March 1984. (2) Is this firm experiencing financial difficulties; if Mr E. Aaron, 24 Bishop Street, Petersham so, what is the current situation of their accounts. (3) Is Inada Holdings divesting itself or staff, outlets and commitments. (4) Are the accounts of Inada Holdings examined by the Auditor-General. (5) When was the last annual report of the Company lodged with the Aboriginal Development Commission.",280
407,Mr HOLDING,OF EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I have been advised by the Aboriginal Development Commission where appropriate. (I) Inada Holdings Pty Ltd was a shelf company purchased by the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) in March 1984 and subsequently became an operating company. (2) to (3) Inada Holdings is a proprietary Company and as such is covered by the provisions of the Companies Act 1981. The information sought by the Honourable Member in these parts of his question is clearly of a nature considered to be commercial-in-confidence. I am seeking therefore the assistance of the General Manager of the ADC and the General Manager of Inada Holdings to provide the Honourable Member with a briefing on these matters on a confidential basis. (4) No. (5) Inada Holdings Pty Ltd is incorporated under the Companies Act 1981 which requires lodgement of its Annual Report with the Corporate Affairs Commission in Canberra not the Aboriginal Development Commission; Inada has so lodged its Annual Report. Marriage Celebrants: Five Dock, New South Wales (Question No. 2253) Mr Maher asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: (I) Which civil marriage celebrants operate within a 5 kilometre radius of Five Dock, New South Wales. (2) What are their workload statistics.",280
408,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OF EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL,"-;-The answer to the honissues ourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) The following civil marriage celebrants currently reside within a 5 kilometre radius of Five Dock.

Introduction of the income and assets test Conversion to direct deposit . . . . . (2) (a) and (b) Departmental officers. (3) The Government's policy is that all Australians have a right to equal access of information. The role of Government information programs, including advertising campaigns, is to inform Australians in the most efficient and cost effective manner of their rights, duties, obligations and responsibilities and matters deemed of national importance. The necessity of an advertising campaign, such as those listed above, is determined according to these criteria. (4) The basis for the remuneration was in accordance with relevant Commonwealth Treasury Regulations and procedures of the Information Co-ordination Branch and Australian Government Advertising Service. (5) (a) and (b) Yes. Asbestos Mining: Effects on Baryulgil (Question No. 2369) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: What action has been taken by the Government to implement the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs in its report on the effect of asbestos mining on the Baryulgil community? Mr Holdiog-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Discussions have been held with appropriate Commonwealth and State Government departments and agencies on the recommendations with a view to the Government making a formal response to Parliament as soon as possible. Treaty between Aborigines and Islanders and Western Australian Community (Question No. 2370) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: What action has he taken to investigate the principle of a Treaty of Commitment, similar to those negotiated on other continents, to set out the legal and cultural relationships between the Aboriginal and Islander peoples and the Western Australian community.",281
410,Mr HOLDING,OF EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Any Treaty of Commitment between Aboriginal and Islander peoples and the Western Australian community 1983-84 is a matter for Western Australia. $ The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs examined the feasibility of a compact 560,383 or Makarratta between the Commonwealth Govern6,500 ment and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Committee tabled its report entitled 'Two Hundred 31,189 Years Later .. .' on 13 September 1983. 45,000 The Government's position on the Makarratta is outlined in its response to that Parliamentary Committee Report in Hansard of 31 May 1985 (page 2961). 104,995 70,579 Aboriginal and Islander Legal Services (Question No. 2371) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: What action is being taken in response to the report of the Harkins Inquiry into Aboriginal and Islanders Legal Services.",281
411,Mr HOLDING,OF EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Mr Harkins submitted the report on his Inquiry into Aboriginal Legal Aid on 8 November. The report runs to over 1,300 pages and makes 179 recommendations. The report is being examined in my Department. South Africa: United. Democratic Front and Inkatha (Question No. 2390) Community Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: (1) Is it a fact that there is conflict between the policies of the South African United Demo.cratic Front Organisation and of Chief Buthelezi's Inkatha movement? If so, in what respects are the objectives of the Inkatha movement in conflict with those of the United Democratic Front. (2) Has the Government adopted a policy towards the objectives of the Inkatha movement?",281
412,Mr HAYDEN,OF EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1 ) Yes, there are differences between the policies of the UDF and Inkatha. While both are working towards the dismantling of apartheid, the means by which each group seeks to achieve this objective is different. Inkatha has chosen participation in the South African government-created system of homelands. On the other hand, the UDF, which was specifically founded 'to oppose the new South African constitution, is opposed to any participation in the apartheid system. lnkatha opposes the use of mandatory economic sanctions against South Africa, whereas the UDF has repeatedly called for their introduction. (2) The Australian Government has not adopted a specific policy towards the objectives of the Inkatha. The Government shares the common objective of Inkatha and the UDF to work for the dismantling of the apartheid system. The form of Government in South Africa is a matter for consultation and agreement among all South Africans, irrespective of race. Assets Test: Reciprocal Social Security Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 13 November 1985: (I) Is it proposed to apply the assets test to pensioners who become eligible for Australian social security benefits under the new arrangements for reciprocal social security agreements announced in his press release of 7 November 1985; if so, (a) what procedures will be used to (i) calculate, (ii) verify and (iii) review the value of pensioner's assets held overseas and (b) will any allowance be made for fluctuations in exchange rates. (2) What are his Department's projections of (a) the number of people who will become eligible for Australian social security under the new arrangements and (b) the cost of the new arrangements broken down by (i) country of residence, (ii) type of pension, and (iii) the percentage of pensioners who will become eligible for full and part pensions.",281
413,Mr HOWE,OF EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I ) Yes, the assets test will apply to people who become eligible for Australian social security benefits under any new reciprocal spcial security agreement in the same way as it now applies to people who become eligible under the existing agreements and under the Social Security Act. (a) The procedures used to calculate, verify and review the value of pensioners' assets held overseas will be the same as those which apply for pensioners who have assets in Australia. However, a typical reciprocal agreement does include provisions for administrative assistance and it may be possible that some future agreement countries would be prepared to assist in the application of the Australian assets test. This would be a matter for negotiation. (b) Overseas assets, like overseas inCome are generally valued in the currency of the country concerned and social security agreements frequently include provisions governing the method for valuing one currency in terms of the currency of another. Where there are no such provisions, the relevant exchange rate is used which applies at the time the entitlement is determined or reviewed. (2) (a) and (b) It is not possible to estimate accurately the total number of people who will benefit under reciprocal agreements. In the future, the number of agreements Australia might enter into, the number of people who chose to leave Australia to live abroad and the number of people who might be selected for migration to Australia will all have a bearing on the number of people who might benefit once a network of agreements is in place. However, all those people now in Australia who spent part of their lives overseas and contributed to foreign social security systems, and those people who spent part of their working life in Australia and are now overseas, are potential beneficiaries under reciprocity arrangements. My Department estimates this would be well over a million people. Agreement It is possible to estimate the number of people who (Question No. 2409) will benefit under a specific agreement while it is being negotiated. Such estimates are essential to the negotiation process to enable each Government to assess the cost implications of the agreement concerned. Proposed Contracts Review Act (Question No. 2411) Mr Ewen Cameron asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 13 November 1985: (I) Is he able to say whether the New South Wales Parliament enacted a Contracts Review Act on 24 April 1980. (2) Have proposals for a Commonwealth Contract Review Act been submitted to him or his predecessors; if so, why has the legislation not been introduced in Parliament. (3) Will he consider the introduction of a Contracts Review Act in order to safeguard consumers from unconscionable contracts.",282
414,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,OF EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Contracts Review Act 1980 (New South Wales) was assented to on 15 April 1980 and commenced operation on 24 April 1980. (2) and (3) In February 1984 a Green Paper entitled 'The Trade Practices Act-Proposals for Change' was released by the then Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, the then Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, Mr Cohen, and the then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Willis. The Green Paper included a proposal to insert a provision in the Trade Practices Act 1974 to prohibit unconscionable conduct in relation to a contract or proposed contract. Public comment on the Green'Paper was invited. On 9 October 1985 I introduced into the House of Representatives the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1985, which included many of the proposals contained in the Green Paper, including the 'unconscionable conduct' provision (proposed new section 52A of the Trade Practices Act). In the light of public comment received on the Green Paper proposal, the Government decided to restrict the application of the new provision to unconscionable conduct in respect of consumer transactions. As the proposed new section 52A stands, it will protect consumers from unconscionable conduct in their dealings with corporations. The section is designed to cover conduct which, while it may not be false or misleading, is nevertheless unconscionable in all the circumstances. The Office of Consumer Affairs in my Department will be monitoring the operation of the provision to see if it is having the desired effect. There are some differences between the New South Wales Contracts Review Act and the new section 52A, though generally speaking they cover the same type of conduct. Section 7 of the Contracts Review Act provides that, where the Court finds a contract or provision of a contract to have been unjust, the Court may grant relief. However, by virtue of section 6, relief can only be granted in respect of non-business contracts made by the complainant or to contracts made for the purpose of a farming undertaking, and in any case relief cannot be granted to a corporation. Because of constitutional limitations, Part V of the Trade Practices Act is generally limited to the conduct of corporations. Section 52A will prohibit corporations engaging in unconscionable conduct in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a person. The section is not limited to unjust provisions in contracts, but extends to any conduct in connection with a supply or possible supply. Further, relief can be granted to anyone (including corporations), but only in respect of the supply or possible supply of consumertype goods or services, ie goods orÂ· services of a kind ordinarily acquired for personal, domestic or household use. The types of remedies available under the Contracts Review Act and section 52A are basically the same. However, if the Trade Practices Amendment Bill is passed, the Trade Practices Commission will be empowered to take representative actions on behalf of aggrieved consumers for breaches of Part V of the Act, including section 52A, rather than consumers having to institute individual actions to obtain redress. The Trade Practices Amendment Bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 19 November 1985. Unemployment and Sickness Benefits: Australia and New Zealand (Question No. 2413) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 14 November 1985: (I) What is the rate of (a) unemployment and (b) sickness benefits for each category of beneficiary in Australia. (2) Is he able to give comparable rates for New Zealand.",282
415,Mr HOWE,OF EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) Unemployment benefit rates in Australia ($ per week) from November 1985: Unmarried, no dependants 16-17 years. . . . . . . 18-20 years. . . . . . . 21 or more years . . . . .

Adulterated Austrian Wine (Question No. 2425) Mr Andrew asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 14 November 1985: Did he issue a news release entitled 'Federal Author50.00 ities Act on Adulterated Austrian Wine' on 7 August 88.20 1985 which concluded that further information would 91.45 be issued as soon as results were available; if so, (a) is 123.90 there any further information and (b) when will he 163.30 make it available.",283
416,Dr BLEWETT,OF EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes, a news release on 7 August 1985 did make reference to further information being issued when available. My Department has been active in collecting data and collating and dispatching these data to concerned organisations, particularly State and Territory Health authorities, Australian Customs, ,and also the Departments of Primary Industry and Trade. This information has been freely available to any person requesting it. The information available was revised as recently as 20 November and comes in the form of three lists: 1. Information provided by the Governments of Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany on contaminated wines; 2. A list of wines shown, by Australian analysis, to contain diethylene glycol; and 3. A list of wines shown, by Australian analysis, to be free from diethylene glycol. My Department has been in close liaison with New Zealand and has shared analytical results with them, as well as distributing their analytical results to relevant regulatory authorities. Arrangements have also been made to share analytical results with the USA. to arrange for this information to be provided to the honourable member. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation: Territories Occupied by (Question No. 2433) Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 15 November 1985: (I) Did resolutions censuring Israel come before the recent United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation Conference held in Sofia, Bulgaria; so (a) what was the content of the resolutions and (b) what stand did Australia take. (2) What (a) instructions and (b) powers of interpretation were given to the Australian Ambassador for voting on the resolutions.",283
417,Mr HAYDEN,OF EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) (a) The, 23rd session of the General Conference of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation passed three resolutions concerning territories occupied by Israel since 1967: The Cultural Heritage and the Cultural Identity the Palestinian People. Jerusalem and the Application of 22C/Resolution 11.8. Implementation of 22C/Resolution 23 concerning Educational and Cultural Institutions in the Occupied Arab Territories. (b) These resolutions were drafted in more moderate language than in previous years. As a result of debates and discussions, the resolutions were amended to meet broad Australian collcerns. In plenary session of the Conference, the three resolutions were carried by consensus. In the commissions of the Conference, voting was as follows: On the Palestinian People: carried by consensus. On Jerusalem: 90 in favour-2 against (Israel, Costa Rica)-3 abstentions (PNG, Switzerland, Zaire). On the Occupied Arab Territories: 69 in favour-I against (Israel)-4 abstentions (Burma, Ghana, . Switzerland, Venezuela). (2) (a) Australia's objective was to seek agreement on the various resolutions. The delegation was asked to maintain close contact with other delegations and with Canberra. It was to oppose the inclusion of errors of fact, unacceptable or unbalanced formulations, and extreme or inflammatory references to Israel. It was to work for more accurate and balanced descriptions of the situation. (b) It is necessary at international conferences for Australia's representatives to have an appropriate degree of discretion, so that they can react to fast-moving situations and developments that occur without notice. It is expected that delegations will maintain as close as possible a contact with Canberra in regard to difficult questions. In the case of the UNESCO conference necessary contact was maintained between the delegation I will be happy in Sofia, and Canberra. Texts of the' three resolutions are as follows: NA NA NA IsraelÂ· The General Conference, Recalling the importance that the Consitution of U nesco - ttaches to respect of al1 cultures and to their preservation and protection, Recalling in this connection Article I of the Declaration of the Principles of International Cultural Cooperation, adopted at its fourteenth session, stating that if 'Each culture has a dignity and value which must be respected and' preserved', that 'Every people has the right and duty to develop its culture', and that 'All cultures form part of the common heritage belonging to al1 mankind'. Recalling Resolution No. 3 of the Intergovernmental Conference on the Institutional, Administrative and Financial Aspects of Cultural Policies (Venice, 1970), recommeriding that any State occupying the territory of another people should ful1y respect, protect and preserve the cultural property and heritage of that people, and that such occupation should end as soon as possible. Considering that cultural identity is the very essence of of a people's destiny and the living core of its culture. Noting with satisfaction the efforts made by Unesco to safeguard the Palestinian heritage, in pursuance inter alia of the fol1owing instruments: Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (1954); Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (1970); Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage (1972). Invites the Director-General to see to it that Unesco: I. continues its action for the preservation of the cultural identity of the Palestinian people and the safeguarding of its heritage; 2. con tines its action for the preservation of the Palestininan cultural heritage in the occupied territories; 3. ensures the protection and promotion of the Palestinian cultural institutions; 4. undertakes a study on the identity of the Palestinian people in its various aspects (origin, historical development, present state), it being understood that this study will be financed by means of extra-budgetary funds.

419,Mr WILLIS,TERRITORIES,"As indicated above, the honourable member asked identical questions of all Ministers. With their concurrence, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters has provided the following answer on behalf of all Ministers: It has been the practice of successive governments not to authorise the expenditure of time and money involved in answering questions which seek an unreasonable amount of generalised information. It is not intended to depart from that practice. However, if the honourable member wishes to seek information concerning members of any particular overseas post, statutory body, inquiry, advisory body or other body under any Minister's control since March 1983, that Minister would provide the necessary information to him. I would note, however, that notwithstanding that present and former affiliations of individuals are, in some respects, a matter of public record, in other cases they are of a personal and private nature. In these cases, it would not be intended to depart from the practice of not disclosing information relating to the personal affairs of individuals, where such would be unreasonable.

Since the Australian Legal Aid Office was established it has been a major concern of successive Attorneys-General that persons who have applied for assistance from, or to whom assistance is provided by, the Office should have the same privileges arising from the relationship between solicitor and client as they would have if dealing with private practitioners. In these circumstances it would be improper for me to provide a more detailed answer.

430,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,TERRITORIES,"On 16 October 1985 (Hansard, page 2144) Mr Ronald Edwards asked the following question, without notice: My question is directed to the Attorney-General in his capacity as Minister responsible for consumer affairs. My question relates to an article in yesterday's edition of the Canberra Times, headed 'Tarago now safer'. The article states that Toyota is upgrading the safety standards of Toyota Tarago vans. The question at stake is whether previous Toyota Tarago editions may not have been safe in terms of their passenger safety. I note also that there is such a vehicle in the Commonwealth car fleet. Can the Minister advise the House on the current state of discussions in this respect? The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Office of Road Safety in the Department of Transport has advised that until 1985, the Toyota Tarago, like most other models of passenger vans, was classified for vehicle certification purposes as a multipurpose passenger vehicle. The Australian Design Rules (ADRs) applicable to this category of vehicle reflected the commercial vehicle origins of these vans and were, in some areas, less stringent than the requirements for conventional passenger cars. Following evidence of an increase in the use of these vehicles as a means of family transport, Ministers of the Australian Transport Advisory Council (ATAC) requested a review of the design rules applicable to them. Subsequently, in February 1984, ATAC endorsed a package of safety measures aimed at bringing the present level of safety provided by these vehicles up to the same general level provided by passenger cars. This package introduced a new category of forward-control passenger vehicles and, over the next few years, an increasing number of passenger car ADRs will be applied to this category. However the differences in design between vans and passenger cars is such that not all passenger car rules will be directly applicable. I am advised that work is under way to develop new standards for these vehicles in the areas of braking and frontal impact protection. A test program is currently being carried out by the Office of Road Safety to determine which standards for frontal impact protection will be most effective in improving occupant safety. The Office of Road Safety has advised that until the results of its test program have been analysed, it will not be in a position to determine whether passenger car barrier crash test requirements are the most effective means of preventing injuries in forward control vehicles. The Toyota Tarago, and all other passenger vans, meet the safety standards applying at the time they were manufactured. The press statement 'Tarago now safer' is a reference to the manufacturer's claim that the frontal impact performance of the Tarago passes a passenger car barrier crash test, which is in excess of the requirement for vans. I understand that this information is correct. Program Funding (Question No. 1293)",289
431,Mr RUDDOCK,TERRITORIES,"the Minister representing the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 23 May 1985. (I) Does the Minister's Department or any statutory authority for which the Minister is responsible have in place a program under which organisations may apply for funding; if so, what are they. (2) Has the Minister's attention be drawn to an information paper entitled 'Issues in 1984-85 Grant in Aid (GIA) Assessment' distributed by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, in particular the suggestion that large and established ethnic community organisations who in the past have received support from the Grant In Aid Program of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs are now expected to apply for funding from main stream sources. (3) What special provision has been made to ensure that in consideration of applications, appropriate and sensitive consideration is given to the special needs of migrant organisations and their so-called nic organisations are placed in a position to compete equitably for any funds made available under programs through the Minister's Department or related agency. Mr Dawkins-The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question. (I ) Yes. The programs are: Grants-in-Aid Scheme, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) Program, Commonwealth Schools Commission (CSC) Multicultural Education Program, CSC Ethnic Schools Program, CSC Projects of National Significance Program, CSC Professional Development Program, Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission (CTEC), Equity Program, CTEC administered States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act, CTEC Evaluation and Investigation Program, CTEC Participation and Equity Program. (2) Yes. (3) A number of the programs listed in the reply to (I) above make specific provision for consideration of the special needs of migrants and the involvement of migrant groups and ethnic organisations. This provision includes funding for education authorities and schools to help them respond to the multicultural nature of Australian society, assistance for non-profit and volunteer ethnic organisations to maintain students' mother tongue through instruction in a community language other than English, special assistance in study skills and bridging courses for migrants and students from ethnic groups with deficiencies in their academic preparation and funding through CTEC for adult education programs conducted by non-government agencies which are specifically designed for migrants. Other programs, while not concerned specifically. with the needs of migrants, provide assistance on an equitable basis for eligible community organisations which may include migrant and ethnic organisations. Australia and United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (Question No. 1420) Mr Rocher asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 20 August 1985: (I) Why has A)lstralia supported the conversion of the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) from its status as an autonomous organisation into a specialised agency of the United Nations. (2) What regular budgetary support has Australia contributed to UNIDO since 1967. (3) Has Australia contributed to any UNIDO special projects in addition to any regular budgetary support; if so, (a) to which countries, (b) when and (c) for what projects. (4) Does Australia have an input into the direction of the expenditure of the funds it subscribes to UNIDO; if not, why not. (5) Will UNIDO's new status as a specialised agency alter Australia's influence over the use of funds it established eth- subscribes.",290
432,Mr HAYDEN,TERRITORIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) In 1975 the Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation adopted the so-called 'Lima Declaration'. In that Declaration the Conference outlined new programs of work for the organisation and expressed the view that to achieve its new goals the scope and functions of UNIDO needed to be extended and its organisational machinery strengthened. Hence the Conference recommended to the United Nations General Assembly that UNIDO should be converted into a specialised agency. Australia participated in the Lima Conference and supported the 'Lima Declaration', albeit with a number of reservations. A major benefit of the conversion to specialised agency status is that UNIDO's new constitutional arrangements will allow closer direct supervision and scrutiny of the Organisation's activities by member countries. Such closer scrutiny will include UNIDO's budget and programs, both of particular interest to Australia. The new arrangements are expected to improve the efficiency of UNIDO's program delivery. (2) Since its creation in 1967, UNIDO's regular budget has been funded by the United Nations. Accordingly, Australia has not contributed directly to UNIDO's regular budget but has, instead, contributed indirectly through contributions to the United Nations. During this period the Australian contribution to the UN has varied considerably but has tended to be between I per cent and 2 per cent of the UN's regular budget. When, on I January 1986, UNIDO ceases to exist as an organ of the UN General Assembly it will no longer be funded by the United Nations. UNIDO's regular budget for the biennium 1986-87 is expected to be about US$94m and Australia's assessed share of this is presently expected to be 1.66 per cent, i.e. about US$780,OOO per annum. (3) Apart from regular budgetary support, Australia has contributed to the United Nations Industrial Development Fund (UNIDF) since its establishment in 1981. Our contributions to the UNIDF have been: 1981-82 1982-83 1983-84 1984-85 1985-86 By virtue of this contribution, Australia has been involved in a wide range of UNIDF projects since 1981: seven workshops have been held: cement and concrete products; building materials; waste heat recovery; timber engineering; solar desalination; selective solar absorbing surfaces technology; and energy management. These workshops have been attended by over 130 overseas participants from some 40 countries, mainly from the Asia-Pacific region. other UNIDF projects have included the establishment of a mini-hydro plant in the Solomons; the development of a compost management plant in China; the preparation of a manual on rice husk ash cement; and research into the blending of alcohols with diesel fuel. The selection of all projects funded by Australia's contributions to the UNIDF has been subject to Australian approval. (4) Australia is not, at present, a member of UNIDO's Program and Budget Committee. Australia is, however, a member of the Industrial Development Board and participates in UNIDO's General Conference. Through these and other UNIDO forums Australia is able to express its views on all issues affecting UNIDO, including budgetary questions. (5) Under the Constitution of UNIDO as a specialised agency, member countries are able more carefully to scrutinise UNIDO's programs and budgets and to determine its activities and priorities. Accordingly, it is expected that Australia will have a greater influence over UNIDO's budget than has been the case in the past. Australian National Commission for United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural (Question No. 1425) Dr Klugman asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 20 August 1985: (I) Who are the members of the Australian National Commission for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.

Executive Development Scheme Placement with Ms Ita Buttrose (Question No. 1563) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, upon notice, on 23 August 1985: (1) Is it a fact that the executive development scheme is a personnel exchange scheme arranged between Australia's top 150 corporations and the Australian Government for executives to gain experience in other associated positions. (2) Who pays the wages or salary-and costs of the transferred employee during the exchange period. (3) Is it a fact that a Government architect, Ms Abigail Butler, is presently on transfer to Sydney radio station 2KY as a research assistant. (4) Is it a fact that Ms Butler is assisting Ms Ita Buttrose; if so, how does the research relate to Ms Buttrose's employment at 2KY. (5) What salary range is applicable to a person of Ms Butler's public service grading. (6) Is he able to say whether (a) 2KY is one of the top 150 corporations in Australia; if not, what level of corporation is it and (b) the ownership of 2KY is controlled by the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council or other trade union interests. (7) What benefits are expected to result from the transfer for (a) the development of Ms Butler's architectural skills and (b) for her future performance as a public servant.",290
433,Mr WILLIS,TERRITORIES,"The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) No. The executive development scheme is a management development program of 12 months' duration conducted by the Public Service Board for senior clerical administrative and professional staff in the Australian Public Service. The executive development scheme provides an integrated program of coursework and work placement experience. While the majority of work placements are arranged within the APS, some EDS participants undertake placements in the private sector or in state or local government organisations. (2) The salaries and placement costs of an executive development scheme participant are met by that participant's home department. (3) No. Ms Butler, a Government architect, is a participant in the 1985 intake of the executive development scheme and is currently on a work placement as a personal assistant to Ms Ita Buttrose. (4) Yes. Under the executive development scheme, participants are sometimes placed as personal assistants to senior public and private sector executives. Such placements have proved valuable in providing them with insights into senior management styles and the issues confronting executives in organisations different from those with which they are familiar. Ms Buttrose was approached by an officer of the Public Service Board in her capacity as a leading executive in the communications industry and asked to accept and supervise Ms Butler as her personal assistant during a work placement. This request was independent of Ms Buttrose's involvement with any particular company. At the time the placement was negotiated, Ms Buttrose was not in fact with radio station 2KY. (5) Ms Butler's public service classification is Project Manager Class 2. The salary range for this designation is $35,759-$38,009. (6) (a) The ranking of 2KY is not immediately available, and is not relevant in view of (I), (3) and (4) above; (b) Yes. 2KY is owned by the New South Wales Trades a!ld Labour Council. (7) (a) Ms Butler's work placement with Ms Buttrose under the executive development scheme is not intended to develop her existing architectural skills but rather her management capabilities, as discussed in (b) below; (b) The aim of the executive development scheme is to equip potential senior public servants with the knowledge, experience and skills necessary to help them meet the challenges of senior management in the Australian Public Service. Ms Butler's placement is providing her with a greater understanding of the role of the media, experience. in dealing with issues of direct community concern, exposure to executive decision-making in the private sector and research experience in assisting Ms Buttrose in her work with the AIDS Advisory Committee. These experiences are expected to enhance her future performance as a public servant. Compensation and Legal Expenses: Department of Science Mr Smith asked the Minister for Science, upon notice, on Friday 23 August 1985: (I) Will the Minister provide details of all expenditure within his Department in 1984-85 for compensation and legal expenses as outlined in Appropriation Bill (No. I) 1985-86. (2) What was the (a) amount and (b) nature of the expenditure in each case for (i) compensation and (ii) legal expenses. (3) What was the nllme of each recipient of payment for legal expenses. Mr Barry Jones-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I to 3 (i) Compensation-Expenditure by my Department in 1984-85 totalled $570,990. For the most part this covered regular ongoing and lump sum payments amounting to $482,919 made to 38 former employees in accordance with determinations of the Commissioner for Employees Compensation. The balance of expenditure ($88,071) covered: (a) payments to medical practitioners, chemists, hospitals etc. ($87,647) relating to Employee Compensation Determinations and comprising 696 individual transactions, and (b) payments relating to damage to personal property ($424) in respect of 14 officers and comprising 14 individual transactions.

Mr Barry Jones-The Minister for Resources in respect of 198 officers and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) (i) The Government currently has no plans. to decommission the HIFAR reactor at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC) Research Establishment at Lucas Heights. HIFAR has operated with an excellent safety record since it was commissioned in the late 1950s and is currently undergoing a program of refurbishment to ensure its continued safe operation into the 1990s. (ii) In recognition of the fact that in the longer term there will be a limit to HIFAR's operational life, the AAEC has been examining options for the eventual replacement of HIFAR. However, the Government has made no decision on the possible replacement of HIFAR or the location of any replacement reactor. (b) The possible establishment of a cyclotron to produce medical radioisotopes for use in Australia has been the subject of several studies over the last two decades. In September 1984, the Minister for Health established a Medical Cyclotron Committee to examine the need for a national medical cyclotron facility. This Committee recently presented its report, and the Government will now consider the issue further. Both the Medical Cyclotron Committee and the National Health and Medical Research Council have recommended that the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital inÂ· Sydney would be the appropriate location for a national cyclotron facility in Australia. It should be noted that in general cyclotrons produce neutron-deficient radioisotopes which complement the neutron-rich radioisotopes produced in nuclear reactors. If a cyclotron were to be established in Australia, it would ensure the availability of short-lived cyclotronproduced radioisotopes which cannot be imported. It would not make the HIFAR reactor redundant as both a cyclotron and reactor would be required to ensure availability of the complete range of radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine. Local Call Access to Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment (Question No. 1649)  Heritage and Environment, upon notice, on 11 September 1985: Does the Minister's Department provide local call access to clients to the district or regional offices Department; if not, will the Department consider installing a 008 telephone number so that clients currently without local call access can have equal opportunity to contact the Department for assistance.",292
434,Mr COHEN,TERRITORIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment is based in Â·Canberra and, with the exception of the Australian Archives which has a network of State offices, has only two small specialised offices in Sydney. The Department does not routinely make special arrangements for telephone access for the public. On a number of occasions where special provisions have been considered necessary the Department has provided toll free (008) telephone access for speCific services: for example, a service is currently available for people wishing to make enquiries on procedures for nominating chemical substances for the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances being compiled by the Department. While toll free telephone access in cases of this sort is appropriate and cost effective, I consider that provision of such a service by my Department for general enquiry purposes would not be warranted. International Year for Repairing the Earth (Question No. 1848) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 17 August 1985: Has his attention been drawn toÂ·a proposal put forward by the United Nations Association of Australia to have 1989 declared by the United Nations General Assembly as the International Year for Repairing the Earth; if so, what action does he propose to take on this proposal.",294
435,Mr HAYDEN,TERRITORIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. The United Nations Association of Australia wrote to me on 30 August 1985 seeking support for its proposal. My department replied on I October 1985, drawing attention to the United Nations guidelines for international years and anniversaries, which set out the criteria and procedures of the United Natioll' with regard to international years, and asking that the United Nations Association take account of these guidelines in preparing a submission on the subject. I am awaiting receipt of that submission before considering further action. Roads: Expenditure (Question No. 1998) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 8 October 1985: What degree of control does he or his Department exercise in relation to priorities of expenditure on individual State, Local and arterial roads.  able member's question is as follows: For Federal funding purposes roads are classified as National, arterial or local under both the Australian of the Bicentennial Road Development (ABRD) Program and the Australian Land Transport Program (ALTP). The principal controls exercised by the Federal Government over each road category under both programs areNational (comprising National Highways and Developmental Roads) The Federal Government has accepted full responsibility for funding approved works on national roads. The Minister for Transport determines the priority (or carrying out works after consultation with the State. The Minister for Transport has power to transfer funds, where a State proposes, 'from the arterial (and also under ALTP from the local) category to national roads and/or road safety and land transport research. The Minister for .Transport may request particulars of projects or programs that he considers should be submitted in accordance with the request. Arterial (Rural and Urban) Each State Government determines its priorities of individual projects for both programs. These priorities are then submitted to the Minister for Transport for approval. Projects are assessed against the Federal Government's objectives for arterial roads. Under ABRD States are also able to propose a transfer of funds between rural and urban arterial categories. The Minister for Transport may request particulars of projects or programs that he considers should be submitted in accordance with the request. Local State Ministers are required to submit principles for the distribution of local roads funds between local government bodies and government authorities. The Minister for Transport may approve those principles, vary those principles or determine principles where the State Minister has not proposed principles. In practice the Minister for Transport looks to State Ministers to establish those principles in consultation with its local government association. Under ABRD local government nominates projects which the State Government may submit for the approval of the Minister for Transport. Participation and Equity Program: Electoral Division of Ballarat (Question No. 2044) Mr Mildren asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 9 October 1985: (I) What funds have been allocated annually for the participation and equity program to schools in the Electoral Division of Ballarat. (2) Which schools have received funding under this program and what was (a) the amount of each grant and (b) the grant used for by each school. Mr Dawkins-The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Funds allocated for the Participation and Equity Program to schools in the Electoral Division of Ballarat are: Government . Non-government Total . . . 135,775 (2) The following schools received funding under the program: Government-1984 and 1985 Ballarat East High School Ballarat North Technical School Mt Clear Technical High School Wendouree Higher Technical School Sebastopol Technical School Each of these schools received a grant of $14,000 in 1984, and $30,000 in 1985 for the development of new school organisations and curriculum practices. Two of these schools are involved in schools resource programs, a Victorian PEP initiative. In this groups of schools work together to develop an issue in secondary education, document their findings and disseminate them through in-service education and publications. Ballarat North and Wendouree Higher Technical .Schools each received an additional $20,000 (approximately) for involvement in a schools resource program. The grants provide schools with additional time release in a cluster arrangement of sharing programs, expenses, administration and dissemination. Ballarat North is working on Year 12 programs and Wendouree is involved in Aboriginal studies. $ Non-government-1984 Marion College, Ararat- . . . . . 21,930 Equipment to broaden and develop curriculum $18,930 Resources to broaden and develop the curriculum in the areas of manual arts, environmental, agricultural and business studies and media studies $3,000 Ballarat and Queens Anglican Grammar School, Wendouree-. . . . . . 10,092 School to work employment course $9,770 Supplementation of salary costs $322 Sacred Heart Senior School 'St Martin's in the Pines', Mt Clear- . . . . . 4,456 Craft program and market garden Sacred Heart College, Ballarat East- . 4,500 Planning activities St Paul's Technical School, Ballarat- . 3,890 Planning activities Loreto College, Ballarat- ..

(2) What amounts have been paid to each of these people or companies for '(a) travel allowance, (b) air fares, (c) accommodation costs, (d) hire care expenses and (e) any other expenses incurred.",294
436,Mr HAYDEN,TERRITORIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Department of Foreign Affairs including authorities under its control, has paid two amounts totalling $65,387.17 to Monahan Dayman Adams Pty Ltd for publicising new passport procedures. An amount of $35,094 was paid to the same company for n;search and development of a communications campaign for the International Year of Peace. (2) Nil. Department of Aviation Aerodromes: Leasing Arrangements for Airline Companies (Question No. 2191) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Aviation, upon notice, on 14 October 1985: (1) Does his Department require airline companies occupying premises at departmental aerodromes to pay a lease equivalent to local government rates; if not, what are the criteria for leasing. (2) Have any of the airlines refused to make a payment, in whole or in part.  able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, Airlines companies are required to pay a charge, equivalent to local government rates, subject to certification by the Department of Local Government and Administrative Services as to reasonableness, in accordance with Finance Directions. (2) Yes. Trans Australia Airlines is paying 50 per cent of rates levied on Commonwealth airports, pending review of requirements under Finance Directions. Wider Availability of Information Gathered by Reconnaissance Satellites (Question No. 2231) Mr Staples asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the book entitled Secrecy and Democracy-The Central Intelligence Agency in Transition by former Director, Stansfield Turner, in which the author recommends an Open Skies Agency to publish results of America's reconnaissance satellites, the result of which is claimed to reduce the danger of war by minunderstanding, to forecast world food supplies, floods and soil and mineral prospects. (2) Will he promote this proposal in view of Australia's joint sovereignty over the principal reconnaissance data receiving stations, the peaceful objectives of President Eisenhower's 1955 Open Skies proposal and the current United Nations investigation of an international satellite monitoring agency first proposed by France in 1978.",295
437,Mr HAYDEN,TERRITORIES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No. I would say, however, that I am fully aware of the very important role played, on the one hand, by reconnaissance satellites in strengthening the stability of the global military balance and in the verification of arms control agreements and, on the other hand, by a generally distinct group of satellites, in performing civil functions of the kind mentioned. (2) The Government considers greater transparency with regard to military activities to be very important to the prospects for arms control over the longer term both for its general confidence building effects and, more particularly, to allow assured and effective verification of compliance with progressively more ambitious arms control and disarmament agreements. For these reasons, the Government attaches particular importance to protecting satellites (and their ground stations) from attack and to the principle enshrined in the SALT I accords (and elsewhere) of non-interference with national technical means of verification which is the contemporary equivalent of the 'open skies' proposal. Similarly, the Government supports the concept of an international satellite monitoring agency (ISM A) as a desirable, longer term arms control measure, particularly as one component of a more comprehensive international arms control verification regime that would command the confidence of the major powers. The Government believes that this concept will have to be further developed in a number of important ways before the Government would be in a position to consider whether any of the Australia-United States joint defence facilities could have a role in the concept. Trucks: Registration Procedures (Question No. 2241) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 16 October 1985: (I) Which States require or allow separate registration fees to be paid for a prime mover and a trailer. (2) What is being done to achieve uniformity between the States and Territories on this matter. (3) Is the present situation likely to impede the implementation of the inter-State road transport legislation.  able member's question is as follows: (I) I am advised that in the States of Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania the prime mover and trailer are registered separately. New South Wales, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory allow a prime mover and trailer to be either registered separately or as a single unit. In South Australia the prime mover and first trailer are registered. as a single unit, while any additional trailers are registered separately. In Victoria the prime mover and trailer are registered as a single unit. (2) The Federal interstate road transport legislation provides for the prime mover and trailer to be registered separately and it is expected that this provision will encourage a greater degree of uniformity between the States and Territories. (3) No. Diseases (Question No. 2258) Mr Maher asked the Minister of Health, upon notice, on 17 October 1985: (I) How many cases of leprosy were notified in each State and Territory in (a) 1982, (b) 1983 and (c) 1984. (2) What was the incidence of other notifiable diseases in each State and Territory in each year.",296

Nuclear Warships Visits to United States (Question No. 2290) Mr Staples asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November: (I) Is he able to say whether any cities in the United States of America do not allow nuclear-powered and/ or nuclear-armed ships of the United States Navy or other navies to use their port facilities; if so, which cities. (2) Is he able to say (a) what regulations and exclusions are applied to the United States Navy under these circumstances and (b) when the exclusions were implemented.",296
439,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) Information available from the US Government indicates that: Legally any United States Navy ship can visit any United States port at any time. There are many ports, and places in ports, in the United States of America as elsewhere that are not visited by the United States Navy for a variety of reasons, including such considerations as pier-side facilities and services, depth of water, and navigational conditions.

440,Mr RUDDOCK,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: (I) Did Mr E. J. Azzopardi write to him on 9 September 1983 making certain allegations. (2) Did Mr Graham Evans reply on his behalf on 20 October 1983 simply noting the correspondence. (3) Did the allegations raise any matter or matters which might consitute an offence under State or Commonwealth law; if so, what action was taken to (a) inform the relevent State Government or its authorities and (b) investigate the complaint and refer it to the Director of Public Prosecutions.",299
441,Mr HAWKE,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) Matters relating to the affairs of the Parramatta Police Citizens Boy's Club were already the subject of State prosecution action at the time of Mr Evans' reply. Convention of the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (Question No. 2356) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: (I) What was the outcome of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Living Marine Resources recently held in Hobart? (2) Did Australia play a role as a world leader in Antarctic conservation at the meeting and what was the reponse of other nations to the Australian initiative?",299
442,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) the recent fourth meeting of the Commission established by the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), held in Hobart in September, continued progress towards conserving the living resources of the Antarctic. Last year's meeting had prohibited fishing in waters adjacent to the island of South Georgia for other than scientific purposes. This year's meeting adopted a further binding conservation measure prohibiting any directed fishing for the depleted species of Antarctic Cod (Notothenia Rossii) in the South Georgia area. Members of the Commission were also requested to limit the by-catch or incidential catch of Antarctic Cod in fishing operations directed at other species in the South Georgia area to 300 tonnes, and to refrain from directed fishing for Antarctic Cod in the Antarcric Peninsula, South Orkneys and Kerguelen areas. (2) Australia played a leading role at the meeting proposing total closure of the fishing around South Georgia, and in areas adjacent to the Antarctic Peninsula and South Orkeys, pending detailed analysis of the state of the fishing stocks in these areas. Australia proposed a species closure for Antartic Cod in the Kerguelen and Heard Island areas. These closures were resisted by a number of major fishing nations operating in the area. These countries took the view that closure of fisheries should only occur once data establishing the threat to fish stocks was clearly available. Ways of obtaining accurate data are still being developed by the Commission. Australia has taken the view that, in the absence of data, the fisheries should be closed so as to minimise the threat to depleted fish stocks. The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources clearly establishes the need for a cqnservationist approach to the marine living resources of the Antarctic. That approach is based on an a unique conservation principle of protection for the entire ecosystem and not just a single species. Australia's policy in CCAMLR has been concerned to ensure that conservation measures adopted by the Commission reflect the ecosystem approach. To this end Australia has formally placed on the agenda for next year's meeting (Hobart, September) a major item structured towards defining a conservation and management strategy for Antarctic marine living resources. We consider this kind of discussion essential to guarantee an effective CCAMLR regime. Aid: Australian Textbooks for South Pacific Schools (Question No. 2357) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: (I) Has the Australian Development Assistance Bureau donated books to South Pacific nations which have been considered unsuitable for use in Australian schools because they are out of step with Australian teaching methods. (2) What are the details of any aid of this type including (a) the nature of the publications and (b) the locations to which they were sent.",300
443,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Earlier this year the New South Wales Government Printer suggested that a large quantity of primary school reading books declared out of date by the New South Wales Education Department might be suitable for use by schools in South Pacific countries. The books have been evaluated by a panel of education specialists which contained Pacific country representation. Four titles were regarded as having no harmful material and possibly suitable for use in schools, where if necessary they could be accompanied by teachers' explanations. The rest were rejected. No request has been received to date from any South Pacific island country for these books and none as yet have been offered for donation. There is no intention that these books form any part of Australia's official aid program. International Year of Repairing the Earth (Question No. 2358) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign also Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: What action does he propose to take in respect of the proposal by the United Nations Association of Australia for the United Nations General Assembly to declare 1989 as the International Year for Repairing the Earth.",300
444,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Please see my answer to question No. 1848. South Africa: Rotary Exchange Students (Question No. 2359) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the following question, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: Is .he able to say how many (a) Rotary exchange students and (b) South African Rotary exchange students are currently in Australia.",300
445,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There are five Rotary Districts in southern Africa, three of which are located within the Republic of South Africa; one district includes parts of South Africa as well as Zimbabwe, Malawi, Swaziland and Botswana and one district includes Lesotho in addition to parts of South Africa. I am therefore not able to say exactly how many students came from or went to South Africa as distinct from southern Africa. Nevertheless I understand that some 58 Australian Rotary exchange students visited southern Africa in 1985 and some 64 Rotary exchange students visited Australia from southern Africa in 1985. Australian Atomic Energy Commission: Lucas (Question No. 2361) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Resources and Energy, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: (I) How many spent fuel rods are to be removed from storage at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission at Lucas Heights, New South Wales. (2) When will the rods be removed and by what means will they be transported to their final destination. (3) Who will be responsible for the transportation of the rods. Mr Barry Jones-The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) No decision has yet been made by the Government to remove any of the spent fuel elements currently stored at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission Research Establishment at Lucas Heights. However, the Government has the matter under consideration and the AAEC has been authorised to invite tenders from specialist nuclear transport companies for the transport of 450 of the spent fuel elements containing uranium of United States origin to the United States for reprocessing. (2) and (3) Specific details of transport arrangements to apply would not be finalised until after a contract for the transport of the fuel was let. If the Government approves the removal of the spent fuel it would be transported in specially designed and shielded transportation flasks, which would be certified to meet international safety standards. The flasks would be transported by road from Lucas Heights to whichever port was chosen, and - loaded for shipment by sea to the United States. The first movements of fuel would not take place until 1986. High Flux Australian Reactor: Lucas Heights (Question No. 2362) Mr Tickner asked the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: What is the estimated life of the high flux Australian nuclear reactor at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission at Lucas Heights, New South Wales. Mr Barry Jones-The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: It is not possible to determine a precise operating life for the HIFAR reactor. HI FAR is currently undergoing a program of refurbishment designed to enable it to continue to be operated safely at least into the 1990s. There is no indication of any deterioration in any critical components of HIFAR which would prevent the reactor being operated beyond that time, provided necessary maintenance of the reactor is continued. It might be noted that other reactors of the same class as HIFAR, located in the United Kingdom, Denmark and Federal Republic of Germany, are continuing to operate and no technical limitations to the life of these reactors have yet arisen. Assistance to the Australian Students Heights International Network (Question No. 2386) Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, - pon notice, on 12 November 1985: Are there any proposals or submissions for the provision of government assistance to the Australian Students International Network; if so, what is the (a) extent and (b) reason for funding the activities of this organisation.",300
446,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: From advice received from my Department and the Department of the Special Minister of State, I an unaware of any current proposals or submissions for Government assistance to the Australian Students International Network. 'Some Government assistance has already been provided to this organisation and, in this regard, I refer the honourable member to my answer to his question on notice No. 2381. United Nations Educational, Scientific Bnd Cultural Organisation: Ambassador's Reform Proposals (Question No. 2388) Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: Has the Australian Ambassador to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation presented any proposals for the reform of the organisation; if so, what is the nature of the proposals.",301
447,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Ambassador and counsellors in Australia's Permanent Delegation to UNESCO have taken an active part in the proceedings of the Information Group, comprising the OECD members in UNESCO. Throughout 1984 and 1985 the group has discussed reform proposals for UNESCO, usually at weekly meetings. The meetings are held in private and it is not customary for governments to state publicly what their representatives have said in such meetings. Australia's Permanent Delegation also dicusses UNESCO's budget, administration, and the cost-effectiveness of UNESCO programs in the Geneva Group, comprising the OECD members which contribute more than one per cent of the budget. In April 1984 Australia was chosen as a member of a sub-committee of the Geneva Group which set out to avoid the disputes and divisions described in the budget section of the report of the Australian Delegation to the General Conference in 1983. In 1985 the UNESCO conference unanimously endorsed Executive Board decisions in favour of: (a) zero real growth in the budget for 1986-87, (b) no increase in member states' contributions as a result of the withdrawal of the United States, and (c) greater clarity in presentation of the budget, all of which have been major preoccupations of the Geneva Group and member states which have criticised UNESCO. In a public address to the General Council of the United Nations Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in london on 13 April 1985, Ambassador Whitlam made suggestions, in the context of the 40th anniversary of the United Nations, to rejuvenate the four largest specialised agencies-IlO, UNESCO, WHO and FAO. He noted specifically reducing the size of their executive bodies, limiting the tenure of their directors-general, revising their financial regulations and holding their conferences at their established headquarters. The address has had a wide circulation and was available to members of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of the Australian Senate and the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons in preparing their reports on UNESCO. The Department of Foreign Affairs is actively pursuing Ambassador Whit lam 's proposals on the tenure of directors-general and the location of the conferences of the specialised agencies. During consultation in Canberra in January 1985 Ambassador Whitlam urged the Department of Finance to increase the efficiency of the specialised agencies and to set an example to other major contributors by paying Australia's assessed contributions promptly and in full at the beginning of the calendar year for which they are due. The budget in August 1985 implemented this suggestion. Further detail was provided in the answer of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to Question No. 2138. In his speech in the general policy debate at the General Conference ofÂ· UNESCO in Sofia in October, the Ambassador commended the regulations of ITU, which charges interest on late contributions. As a result the conference augmented its stock appeal for prompt payment by requesting the Director-General 'to study the feasibility of providing positive incentives to member states to pay their contributions promptly as well as possible measures to achieve such a policy objective, including where appropriate amendments to the financial regulations'. In June 1985 Ambassador Whitlam persuaded the Executive Board of UNESCO to recommend to the General Conference that the number of board seats for Group I (Western Europe and North America) should be reduced from ten to nine and the number of board seats for Group IV (Asia and the Pacific) should be increased from eight to nine. The conference adopted the recommendation in October. The equalisation of seats will take effect at the General Conference in 1987, when Australia and New Zealand will be transferred from Group I to Group IV. Ambassador Whitlam has been particularly 'active in mobilising support among the representatives of Commonwealth countries in Paris and London for the rejuvenation and universality of UNESCO. The Canadian Minister for External Affairs asked him to undertake a speaking tour in the first week of September 1985 and estimates that he reached two million readers and listeners. Australia was elected to the Executive Board of UNESCO in the person of Ambassador Whitlam at Sofia. At the first meeting of the reconstituted Board the Ambassador was elected as a member of an 18member special committee established to pursue reforms in UNESCO. Australia and Mr Whitlam will therefore remain closely involved in the reform process underway in UNESCO. Aid to Angola (Question No. 2389) Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 November 1985: What is the (a) extent and (b) nature of Government overseas aid to Angola in 1985.",301
448,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable members' question is as follows: The Australian Government has not provided any aid directly, to the Government of Angola so far in 1985. However, 2,420 tonnes of rice were made available to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation World Food Program for use in Angola. The rice was valued at almost $900,000. Aid through other multi lateral programs cannot be separately identified. Israeli attacks on Palestine Liberation Organisation (Question No. 2404) Mr Milton asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 13 November 1985: Has his attention been drawn to statements reported in the Sunday Telegraph of 6 October 1985, by the Israeli Consul-General in Sydney, Mr Alex Ganor, that (a) Israel will track down the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), wherever it is, if it continues to kill Israelis and (b) the long hand of Israel would go anywhere. (2) Has his attention been drawn to (a) the number of PLO officials in western Europe who have been assassinated by Israeli intelligence and (b) the bombing of PLO headquarters in both Tunis and Beirut; if so, is he concerned that Palestinians in Australia, particularly the personnel of the Palestine Information Office, may be under threat. (3) What steps has the Government taken to ensure Mr Ganor's threats are not carried out in Australia.",302
449,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes, my attention has been drawn to the newspaper article. (2) My attention has been drawn also to reports that a number of PLO officials have died violently in western Europe. I am not however aware of any conclusive evidence as to who was responsible for these incidents. I am aware of the bombing of PLO offices in Tunis and in Lebanon. The Australian Government deplored the violation of Tunisian sovereignty which occurred as a result of the attack by the Israeli airforce over Tunis on 1 October and voted in favour of United Nations Security Council Resolution 573 which condemned the incident. (2) and (3) Australia has an effective national counter terrorist capability, developed through co-operation between Federal and State governments, and a national anti terrorist plan has been prepared to ensure a coordinated response to an incident and to provide for effective crisis management should that circumstance ever arise. That capability is available for the protection of all residents of Australia. Aid: Youth Organisations in Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands (Question No. 1445) Mr Coleman asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 18 November 1985: (I) Did the Government receive any requests or recommendations for financial assistance for nongovernment youth organisations in (a) Papua New Guinea and (b) the Solomon Islands, to send delegates to a conference of young political leaders held in Jamaica in April 1985 for International Youth Year. Were the requests or recommendations agreed to; if not, why not.",302
450,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) and (2) According to advice from my Department and from the Office of Youth Affairs, the Government has not received any requests or recommendations for financial assistance of the type referred to in the question. Petitions: Department of Education (Question No. 2537) Mr Leo MCLeay asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, upon notice, on 19 November 1985: What is the procedure usedÂ· in the Minister's office to respond to petitions referred by the House of Representatives. Mr Dawkins-The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Minister's office takes note of the petition and ensures that the views of petitioners are brought to the Minister's notice. The petition is then referred to the Department of Education and other portfolio agencies where it is circulated to relevant areas for information and any necessary action. Petitions: Department of Health (Question No. 2548) Mr Leo MCLeay asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 19 November 1985: What is the procedure used in the Minister's office to respond to petitions referred by the House of Representatives.",303
451,Dr BLEWETT,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Petitions are circulated in my office and then forwarded to the relevant authority in my portfolio for information and attention, if necessary. Political Structure of United Nations Members (Question No. 2558) Dr Klugman asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 19 November 1985: Is he able to say which United Nations member states have hereditary monarchies and which of those have democratic parliaments.",303
452,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The following member states of the United Nations may be classified as hereditary monarchies in that their political system includes a hereditary ruler as head of state: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Bhutan, Brunei, Canada, Denmark, Dominica, Fiji, Grenada, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Lesotho, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mauritius, Morocco, Nepal, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Papua New Guinea, Qatar, Saint Christopher and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saudi Arabia, Solomon Islands, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Thailand, United Kingdom. While it is evident that most of these states have some form of representative institutions it is not particularly fruitful to attempt to characterise them as having democratic parliaments or otherwise, given the variety of situations applying in the countries and the subjective interpretations that may be given to the word democratic. Anglo-Australian Telescope Board (Question No. 2561) Mr MACKellar asked the Minister for Science, upon notice, on 19 November 1985: (I) Did the Anglo-Australian Telescope Board (AAT) meeting in September 1985 have before it a proposal from Britain's Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) to cut by half the funds it assigns to the AAT and the United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope, both of which are located in New South Wales; if so, was the proposal considered by the AAT Board. (2) Are the 2 telescopes in question managed by a treaty between the Australian and United Kingdom Governments. (3) Can the SERC propose a reduction in funding for these telescopes on behalf of the United Kingdom Government. (4) If the United Kingdom Government were to reduce its funding to the 2 telescopes, would this have an adverse effect on Australia's astronomy program. (5) What decision has the AAT Board taken in regard to this matter. (6) When does the AAT Board next meet. Mr Barry Jones-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The AA t Board has no formal proposal from the United Kingdom Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC) on this matter. The Board did, however, discuss the decision of the SERC to reduce the funds allocated to all southern hemisphere astronomy activities by more than 50 per cent. The SERC has been forced into this position by overall budget constraints. (2) The Board operates the Anglo-Australian Telescope at Siding Spring Mountain under the authority of the Anglo-Australian Telescope Agreement, 1969. The Governments of Australia and the United Kingdom equally share the telescope's operational expenses and astronomers from the two countries share the telescope's observing time. Neither of the contracting parties to the inter-governmental agreement, which remains in force until at least 1996, can unilaterally withdraw from it. The United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope is a separate British facility on Siding Spring Mountain operated b}' the Royal Observatory Edinburgh on behalf of the SERC(3) The SERC can make recommendations and proposals to the Secretary of State for Education and Science, who has not yet taken a position on the AngloAustralian Telescope. (4) If the United Kingdom Government were to reduce its funding to the Anglo-Australian Telescope, the Australian astronomy program would be adversely affected. If funds were reduced to a level where the telescope could not operate effectively, Australian astronomers would lose access to one of the best 4-metre class telescopes in the world. (5} The Board wrote to the SERC Chairman on 27 September 1985 and expressed its concern at the SERC decision. It drew his attention to the fact that the Board is coUectively responsible to two Governments and that the AAT Agreement requires the costs of operating the telescope to be agreed by the Board and shared equally by Australia and the United Kingdom. The Board does not advocate a reduction of the telescope's current level of funding and has advised the SERC accordingly. (6) The Board next meets between 7-11 April 1986 in Australia.

(2) The Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Bill 1985 was introduced into the House of Representatives on 27 November 1985. When the Bill becomes law, Australia will be able to become a party to the Convention. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation: Regional Conventions on Recognition of Studies (Question No. 2673) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 21 November 1985: (I) Is Australia a party to the 1983 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation Regional Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and Degrees in Higher Education in Asia and the Pacific; if so, when did it become a party to the Convention. (2) Is it a fact that the 1979 UNESCO Convention on the Recognition of Studies, Diplomas and Degrees concerning Higher Education in the States belonging to the Europe Region permits other states outside the Europe Region to accede to it when the Convention has been ratified by at least 20 of the states of the Europe Region. (3) Is he able to say when the 20th state of the Europe Region ratified the 1979 Convention. (4) What steps has Australia taken to accede to the 1979 Convention.",305
456,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. Australia accepted the Convention on 23 September 1985 and it entered into force one month later for Australia. (2) Yes. Article 16 of the Convention provides that a non-European State may be authorised to accede, upon approval of its request to do so by at least two thirds of the Contracting States, once at least 20 European States are parties. (3) Yes: 19 March 1985. (4) The question of Australia becoming a party to the Convention is under consideration by the Department of Education. Property Lobbyists Registration Scheme (Question No. 2718) Mr Maher asked the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 26 November 1985: Which foreign (a) governments and (b) agencies are clients of companies or persons listed under the Lobbyists Registration Scheme.",305
457,Mr YOUNG,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Under the guidelines governing the Lobbyists Registration Scheme, details of clients are provided to the Government by lobbyists on a confidential basis. Public disclosure of the requested information would breach that confidentiality. Disarmament Video (Question No. 2765) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 27 November 1985: (1) Is his Department producing a video on the subject of peace and disarmament; if so, what is the cost. (2) Are any consultants, agencies or non-departmental employees being engaged for the project; if so (a) why and (b) what amount are they being paid.",305
458,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) My Department is funding production of a video on the subject of Australia's role in disarmament and arms control. The video will be available to schools,' tertiary education institutions and non-governmental organisations. It will also serve as a visual aid to Departmental speakers on the subject. It is part of the Department of Foreign Affairs' contribution to the International Year of Peace. The cost of the video will be $80,000-$100,000. It will be approximately 48 minutes in length. (2) The video is being produced by Film Australia in close consultation with officers from the various branches of the Department of Foreign Affairs that deal with disarmament and arms control issues. (a) Government guidelines provide that Film Australia be given the first option of producing or supervising the production of a departmental video if it is aimed at informing or instructing any section of the public or if its production will require the use of professional contractors or consultants, or if the estimated direct cost, including in-house labour costs, will be more than $5,000. Film Australia, following an approach by the Department of Foreign Affairs, expressed interest in producing the film for the Department. (b) Film Australia will be paid up to the amount of $100,000 for producing the video. Domestic Air Travel (Question No. 2825) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 29 November 1985: What percentage of domestic air travel undertaken by representatives of the Minister's Department is undertaken on: (a) Trans Australia Airways (b) Ansett and its airline subsidiaries (c) East-West Airlines (d) Commuter aircraft, and (e) Charter aircraft.",305

Disarmament and Arms Control Costs (Question No. 2890) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 19 November 1985: (I) Does the Government allocate the equivalent of 0.1 per cent of defence spending for work on arms control and disarmament; if not, what is the estimated level of spending in this area in 1985-86. (2) To what projects and initiatives is the expenditure in this area allocated for 1985-86.",306
460,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer tq the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Government's effort directed at disarmament and arms control is but one of the many functions of the Department of Foreign Affairs and many other organs of Government. It is not possible to identify with any accuracy what percentage of the Public Service's overall expenditure can be attributed to disarmament and arms control functions. However, it is clear from some readily identifiable specific disarmament and arms control related costs that the Government has allocated at least the equivalent of 0.1 per cent of defence spending for work on arms control and disarmament in 1985-86. The Defence outlay for 1985-86 is $6,535.4m and 0.1 per cent is therefore $6,535,400. Readily identifiable disarmament and arms control costs are as follows: $707,945 and Arms Control Branch, the Peace and Disarmaimmediate support staff, and one diplomatic on disarmament work and the Special . . . . $903,721 conferences dealing with such issues as bilateral consultations with other $400,000 $30,000 $20,000 $263,600 $1,947,000 $213,000 $30,272 (est.) . . $2,007,000 Research Laboratory for use in investigating $105,000 $120,000 Resources for upgrading Australia's seismic for Australian participation in a global seismic $470,000 $7,216,938 contribution to the United Nations budget which for of this contribution should be considered as being expended Affairs, upon notice, on 29 November 1985: (1) Has any action been taken by the Government to promote actively the development of a zone of peace and aÂ· nuclear free zone in the Indian Ocean. (2) Is he able to say which Indian Ocean countries (a) support and (b) oppose the development of such a zone.",306
461,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. Australia has been a member of the United Nations Committee on the Indian Ocean since its formation in 1972. Australia is currently a Vice-Chairman of the Committee. The objective of the Committee is to see convened as soon as possible an international conference to examine the establishment of an Indian Ocean Zone of Peace, in accordance with UN Resolution 2832 (xxvi) adopted on 16 December 1971, embodying the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. In a statement issued on 29 November 1984 following the adoption of a resolution on the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace proposal, I said that the Government ""had always made clear its support for the concept of an Indian Ocean Zone of Peace, in line with Labor Party policy and its commitment to peace and disarmament"". Preparatory work for a conference on the Zone of Peace has not, however, advanced sufficiently for a final decision to be taken on the date for the convening of the conference. (2) Most, if not all, Indian Ocean littoral states have signified support for the ideal of an Indian Ocean Zone of Peace. I am not aware of any Indian Ocean state which has opposed the Zone of Peace. International Satellite Monitoring Agency (Question No. 2892) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 29 November 1985: Has action been taken to express support for the establishment of an international satellite monitoring agency for use by the United Nations; if so, what are the details.",307
462,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government supports the concept of an International Satellite Monitoring Agency (ISMA) which was first proposed by France in 1978 at the first special session on disarmament of the General Assembly. The Government considers the concept of an ISMA a desirable arms control measure in terms of its potential confidence-building, verification and transparency objectives. In supporting the concept, Australia voted ""in favour of the resolution at the 1978 United Nations General Assembly which requested the Secretary-General of the United Nations to obtain the views of Member States on the question and appoint a group of qualified governmental experts to study the technical, legal and financial implications of establishing such an agency. Pursuant to the resolution the Secretary-General submitted to the General Assembly at its thirty-fourth session a report containing the conclusions of the group of experts. A subsequent resolution was adopted which requested the Secretary-General to carry out an indepth study on the subject and to submit thereon a comprehensive report in time for the 1982 General Assembly. Australia supported this resolution also. At the 1982 Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Australia voted in favour of a resolution tabled by France which took note of the Secretary General's report and study on the technical, legal and financial implications of establishing an international satellite monitoring agency, sought the publication of the study as a United Nations document and requested the Secretary-General to report to the 1983 United Nations General Assembly session on the practical modalities for implementing the conclusions of the report. In 1983 the Secretary-General tabled in the General Assembly this third report on the proposal of an ISMA. There has been no further movement within the United Nations towards the establishment of an ISMA and the subject was not on the Agenda for this year's General Assembly. "" As it is doubtful that an effective ISMA could be established in the near future, some caution is required at this stage in the terms and level of Australian support. It is clear that there is considerable room for more work to be done in refining the scope of the proposals, reviewing the feasibility and potential contribution of the proposed technical and organisational systems, assessing the likely requirements including manpower and equipment costs that would be involved in establishing a comprehensive international verification system, incorporating a satellite monitoring capability and addressing the political issues which are raised. Australia considers effective verification to be crucial to the monitoring of arms control agreements and implementation of disarmament measures. The Government will continue to follow closely and aim to support the developments of an ISMA which could lead to the establishment of a reliable and effective satellite monitoring system. International Atomic Energy Agency Safeguards (Question No. 2893) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 29 November 1985: (1) Is it a fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards do not require that an International Atomic Energy Agency inspector be placed on site at each reactor, enrichment and reprocessing plant covered by the IAEA for the purpose of personally supervising the implementation of IAEA full scope safeguards. (2) Did the Australian Government argue for the placement of inspectors at the 1985 Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference. (3) Was it agreed at the 1985 NPT Review Conference that no NPT member States shall supply nuclear materials, equipment and technology to any non-nuclear weapons State which is not a party to the NPT and which does not accept full scope safeguards under the NPT. . Mr HAYDEN - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The IAEA safeguards system and inspection schedules, including frequency of inspection, have been carefully developed, taking into account the nature, number and operating patterns of nuclear facilities in a particular country and the nature and quantities of material covered under each safeguards agreement and facility attachment, so as to enable timely detection of any diversion of significant quantities of nuclear material covered under the agreements. So-called bulk handling facilities, such as enrichment and reprocessing plants, require a greater inspection effort, as much of the nuclear material is normally moved and processed in the form of liquids, gases, powders or in large numbers of identical items such as pellets. These items require a continuous inspection effort. The IAEA does not necessarily consider however that continuous stationing of inspectors at all facilities is necessary to achieve its inspection 1981 goals and the objective of timely detection of diversion. Given the number of facilities in Canada and Japan, the IAEA has established field inspection offices in those countries to assist in attaining inspection goals. The proximity of the numerous European facilities to the IAEA headquarters in Vienna does not necessitate similar arrangements in Europe. (2) At the Third NPT Review Conference, the Australian Delegation pressed for the intensification of IAEA safeguards coverage in both non-nuclear weapon States and in nuclear weapon States. It also drew attention to the need for safeguarding techniques to be updated to take account of technological developments, and for the Agency to meet its safeguards responsibilities. At the Review Conference, and within the IAEA, Australia has argued for the IAEA to be provided with the necessary financial, manpower and technical resources to meet these responsibilities. (3) The Third NPT Review Conference urged all non-nuclear-weapon States not party to the Treaty to make an international legally-binding commitment not to acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and to accept IAEA safeguards on all their peaceful nuclear activities, both current and future, to verify that commitment. The Conference further urged all States in their international nuclear cooperation and in their nuclear export policies and, specifically as a necessary basis for the transfer of relevant nuclear supplies to non-nuclear-weapon States, to take effective steps towards achieving such a commitment to non-proliferation and acceptance of such safeguards by those States. The Conference also expressed the view that accession to the Non-Proliferation Treaty is the best way to achieve that objective. Level of Overseas Aid Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 29 November: What was the level of overseas development assistance expressed as a percentage of Gross National Product (a) for each year since 1970 and (b) as at 30 November 1985.",307
463,Mr HAYDEN,NOTIFIABLE DISEASES REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: NA ASSISTANCE (ODA) 1970-1985 ODA/GNP ratio Year ended 30 June (%) 1970 0.58 1971 0.56 1972 0.55 1973 0.53 1974 0.53 1975 0.57 1976 . 0.51 1977 0.47 1978 0.48 1979 0.45 1980 0.44 0.44 1982 0.45 1983 0.47 1984 0.51 1985 0.50 1986 (estimated) . 0.45 Source: Budget Paper No.9, 1985, p. 1. Tomahawk Cruise Missile (Question No. 2898) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 29 November 1985: (I) Was the Government consulted by the United States Government on the deployment of Tomahawk cruises missles; if so, (a) did the consultation occur prior to the missiles' initial deployment, (b) on what date did the communication occur and (c) what was the specific nature of the communication. (2) Is the deployment of Tomahawk cruise missiles into the Pacific region consistent with the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. (3) Is it a fact that the deployment of Tomahawk missiles limits the potential for verification essential to effective arms control agreements.",308
464,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) No. (2) The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty would prohibit the deployment of nuclear-armed Tomahawk cruise missiles on the territory of a State party to the Treaty. Protocol I to the Treaty invites the (Question No. 2896) United States, the United Kingdom and France to apply this prohibition in respect of their territories located within the zone. The Treaty does not affect the rights, or the exercise of the rights, of any State under international law with regard to freedom of the seas. (3) Long-range sea-launched cruise missiles like the Tomahawk and comparable Soviet weapons will present formid,able difficulties for the verification of compliance with restrictions imposed under any future arms control agreement. Aid: Non-Government Organisations (Question No. 2899) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 29 November 19.85: What measures has the Government taken to ensure that official funding to non-government organisations is progressively increased to 5 per cent of the aid budget.",308
465,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In the 1985-86 budget the Government has substantially increased the level of funds for the programs of NGOs to a total of $19.859m. Details are given in Budget Paper No.9. This amount represents 1.9 per cent of the 1985-86 aid budget; this excludes unforeseen emergency aid and is likely to be exceeded (in 1984/85 the figure was 2.5 per cent). I announced on 28 November 1985 that further increases in subsidies for projects of NGOs were justified, though further long-term growth in these subsidies would need to be commensurate with the capacity of NGOs to mobilise public support and to deliver the increased allocation. Australian Companies in Namibia (Question No. 2900) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 29 November 1985: (I) Is he able to say which Australian companies are involved in operations in Namibia. (2) What is the Government's attitude in relation to such operations.",309
466,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Department of Foreign Affairs is not aware of any Australian companies which currently have direct operations in Namibia. (2) Not applicable. Establishment of a Bureau of International Economic Co-operation (Question No. 2902) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice on 29 November 1985: Has the Government co-ordinated its participation in multilateral bodies dealing with international economic issues through the establishment of a Bureau of International Economic Co-operation within his Department with a view to ensuring a common approach to North/ South economic issues; if so, what are the details.",309
467,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Individual aspects of North/South economic issues are shared among a number of portfolio responsibilities I am satisfied that through Cabinet and Inter-Departmental processes the Government is dealing effectively with the co-ordination of these matters and that a common approach is being taken to North/South economic issues. In these circumstances no decision has been taken to establish a Bureau of International Economic Co-Operation within the Department of Foreign Affairs. Anti-Satellite Weapons/ Ballistic Missile Defences (Question No. 2903) IYIr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice on 29 November 1985: What progress has been made in the encouragement by Australia of the negotiation and ratification by the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of treaties prohibiting' the testing or deployment of anti-satellite weapons and space-based anti-ballistic missiles.",309
468,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government attaches major importance to the prevention of an arms race in outer space and has consistently advocated both in multilateral forums such as the Conference on Disarmament (CD) and bilaterally with the United Sates and the Soviet Union the negotiation of an appropriate agreement or agreements to this end. For example, in August 1984 the Minister .for Foreign Affairs proposed to the (CD) that it look into the possibility of protecting from attack all satelites and associated ground stations that contribute to strategic stability. In this context, the Government welcomed the fact that the prevention of an arms race in outer space was one of the objectives agreed to by Messrs Shultz and Gromyko in January 1985 for the bilateral negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on space and nuclear arms. Moreover, President Reagan and General-Secretary Gorbachev reaffirmed this objective at their recent summit in Geneva. The Honourable member will also be aware that the Government has stated that it does not endorse the American Strategic Defence Initiative or the counterpart research program in the Soviet Union. While progress in negotiations on measures to prevent an arms race in outer space has been disappointingly slow it is important that this is now a clearly stated objective in both bilateral and multilateral forums. The Government will continue to urge the superpowers to . take concrete steps to prevent an arms race in space and to make the most effective contribution it can to complementary efforts in the CD. Finally, for the Honourable Member's information, I would point out that the testing and deployment of space-based ballistic missile defences is already prohibited under Article V.I. of the ABM Treaty. Aid: Namibian Students (Question No. 2906) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 29 November 1985: How many Namibian students have been provided with scholarships to study in Australia.",309
469,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Since the inception in 1978 of a scholarship program to enable Namibian refugees to study in Australia, thirteen Namibians have received awards. Five Namibians are presently studying in Australia and it is expected that a further two scholarships will be awarded in the 1985-86 financial year. International Monetary Fund Activities (Question No. 2908) Mr Tickner asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 29 November 1985: Has the Government made any proposals to the International Monetary Fund to encourage that body to ensure that its economic program do not impose unnecessarily harsh conditions on debtor developing countries, especially those of South America, which adversely affect the. poor of those countries; if so, what are the details.",309
470,Mr HAYDEN,AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL DEVELOPMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australian Government supports the case by case approach adopted by the International Monetary Fund to the problems of all indebted developing nations, including those in Latin America. We are sensitive to the problems of those developing countries which are going through the necessary process of economic adjustment while in many cases also attempting to rebuild democratic institutions, sometimes after long periods of authoritarian rule. I have drawn attention on a number of occasions to the need for care in the exercise of conditionality to ensure that economic recovery and political stability are not jeopl!rdised. Concerns of this type are broadly shared'ln the international community and the International Monetary Fund, through its case by case approach, is able to take these sensitivities into acount. We will maintain an active interest in developments in the indebted developing countries, including those in Latin America.",310
