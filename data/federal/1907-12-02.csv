1,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Will the Treasurer have printed and distributed a list of any alterations he intends to propose in the Tariff schedule so that honourable members can give their attention to them' beforehand? I think that this course should be taken in order to avoid serious stoppages.,14
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I do not know that any serious stoppages have taken place in consequence of intended alterations not having been circulated.,14
3,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,N OJ but they may occur.,14
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I cannot give an absolute promise that I will not alter anything; but so far as I can give timely information as to any proposed alteration I shall do so. STANDING ORDERS. Jtr. BOWDEN - I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether the Government intend to take any action with reference to the report of the Standing Orders Committee which was presented to the House some time ago, and which recommended for its approval a new set of Standing Orders.",14
5,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I have already replied to this question-that if there be time before the close of the session it can be very well spent in considering the report referred to. CHRISTMAS RECESS.,14
6,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,iCa n the Prime.Minister inform the House as to the probable date on which it will be asked to adjourn for the Christmas recess?,14
7,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"As soon as the consideration of. the Tariff has been concluded, a step which it is hoped can be reached by the end of next week. GOVERNMENT PROPERTYINSURANCE.",14
8,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"I find that as one result of the recent fire in Melbourne about £20,000 worth of Commonwealth (property has been destroyed, and it is stated that it was not insured. I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether it is not the rule of his Department to insure its property, and, if so, why it was neglected in that instance?",14
9,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I intend to go fully into the matter, which I may say .was brought before me this morning by the honourable member for Bourke. The Government have always taken up the position that they should not 'insure their property. What I think .we should do is to establish an insurance fund for the purpose of meeting such risks TELEPHONE SERVICE-FIRE .",14
10,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Is the Prime Minister aware that it has been reported that the great fire in Melbourne was largely owing to the fact that a person could not get connected with the Fire Brigade Station, for ten minutes?",14
11,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I have made inquiries and ascertained that that theory, which is not backed up by any evidence, is as i l founded as the theory that the fire was originated by the lighting of cases lane, which is quite contrary to fact. FANNING ISLAND.",15
12,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,Can the Prime Ministion ter give the House any information with reference to the reported transfer or sale of Fanning Island?,15
13,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"There is no news of as any recent date. The question was consiB dered, I should think two years ago, it appeared to be believed that there was power to transfer the island, although tain property on it might be sold. Howother ever, we called attention at that time the risk which was being run, and I think that the Pacific Cable Board, which has station there, must have kept itself inof formed of the progress of events.

14,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [2.37] - I wish to postpone the conl - sideration of the descriptive paragraph at th . commencement of this division until the in a duties have been considered. Paragraph postponed accordingly. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - As honourable members know, it is not intended that this division of the Tariff shall come into operauntil .some time hence. The Manufactures Encouragement Bill hinges on this division. It is very likely that when the Bill is submitted, I shall alter the dates to the running of the bounties. If that i i l is passed-and I hope that it will be when passed-it will operate for a certain no period, and I do not think it will be very cerlong before either Mr Sandford or some person will have sufficiently established to an industry to warrant the Government in issuing a proclamation to bring into force a this division of the Tariff. Had I thought it before, I think I should have proposed to increase the duties under Division VIA. PAPER. Mr DUGALD THOMSON - They have",15
15,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Onl y in one case, and very slightly. I think they ought r Deto be 25 and 20 per cent, in comparison with the duties on other items in the Tariff. However, that is a matter which I am not TARIFF. going to deal with at the present stage. alteration will be in plenty of time four five years hence^-whic h period will, I expect, elapse before these duties will come into operation. They will not operate in the meantime. I intend to propose to delete From the init formation which I have been able to gather, that I do not think that there is any necessity at the present time to retain that duty. in the It is being produced at Cockle Creek, and there is no doubt that there is a considerable demand for it in AustraI am informed that there is a market Puddled for the whole of the spelter that can be Manumade here. I do not think that there is Iron or any occasion to go out of our way to imthan pose a duty at the present time; though I may change my opinion if I receive furPlate ther information. I wish to say that I regard these duties as the most important in the Tariff. Iron and steel are the base of all manufactures in Australia. If we can produce enough iron and steel to supply not Australia without the importation of any val., large quantity we shall be laying the foundation of one of the greatest industriesprobably the greatest of all-in this try. I believe that honourable members will feel that it is absolutely necessary to carry these duties into effect. I am not asking for increased duties at present, because believe that those proposed will be suffisay cient for the purpose, and also because I desire to finish the Tariff before mas.",15
16,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,What is the proposing to do in reference to the bounty ? Does he propose that the bounty and the duty shall operate together?,16
17,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The bounty ceases when the duty comes into The two do not run together. The honourable member will find that the heading to the division provides that the matter is dealt with in a certain way. I do not matter any further. know whether it is wise to discuss that question now, as the heading has been postponed. But certain: words have been left out of the heading as it formerly stood, to the effect that a vote of both Houses of Parliament is required before the duties come into operation, Strong objection has been taken to that provision by those wish to invest their capital in and steel industry. In this Tariff we are proposing to leave the responsibility' of with afterwards. bringing the duties into operation to the Minister of the day,",16
18,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is an absolutely novel tiling in Tariff matters-t the Minister the power to impose duties.,16
19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not inonly incidentally. tend to discuss that 'matter now, although 1 think that there is a great dealto be in favour of leavini? this power in hands of the Minister. Parliament cannot deal with the details.",16
20,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,It will be a. very daniron gerous thing to do.,16
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I am disposed to think that people will not be inclined to invest their money in the iron industry unless they know exactly what is going happen.,16
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If our Minister Trade and Customs has not sufficient have power already, and is to be granted furthe ther power, it will be a poor look out.",16
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Honourable members are sometimes unwisely disinon clined to trust those in. authority.,16
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"We might as well we shut up Parliament, as they have done in Portugal.",16
25,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It is not a fair thing to say that we will do certain counthings under certain conditions without giving security to those who invest their capital.' A million of money might be invested in the iron industry, and then a I new Ministry might come into power and ""We will not do what you .ask of us,"" or ""we will not ask Parliament to do it , "" Christor ""we have not time to do it . """,16
26,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,It is a dangerous power Minister to give to any Minister.,16
27,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"We l l , it is a dangerous thing to give honourable members licence to talk as long as they like.",16
28,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The Minister is enjoying operation. that licence just now.,16
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not say much, unless there is occasion to say it ; to be and I do not intend to deal with this",16
30,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Kooyong) [2.48] - I offer no objection fo the course which the Minister has proposed to take, but he has commenced to debate the matter which he has postponed. I did not expect that he would do that. I unhesitatingly say that I should who have preferred that my amendment should the iron receive consideration now. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - It wil l be dealt",16
31,Mr KNOX,Unknown,But the Minister has commenced to debate the matter. I therefore see no reason why I should not cono leave tb tinue the discussion.,16
32,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I referred to it,16
33,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"The Treasurer indicated said that he was going to oppose the policy the which my amendment embodies. I have consistently expressed my belief that we should ardently endeavour to establish the industry in Australia. But I am not prepared to say at the present moment what duty I shall support. I do feel, however, that it should be distinctly stated in the Tariff that the bounty and to the duty are not to be concurrent. Personally, I believe that the manufacturers of would prefer a duty to the bounty, and I already indicated that, in my opinion, Manufactures Encouragement Bill has a very precarious career in front of it. I shall discuss the details at greater length a future occasion, simply contenting myself now with expressing the opinion that should have a specific declaration in the Tariff, that if duties are agreed to by the Committee, they should not be concurrent with the bounty to be paid under the Manufactures Encouragement Bill .",16
34,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [2 49] - I take it that the only matter before us now is whether we are in favour of duties being imposed under item 229, after the iron industry has been sufficiently established in Australia. I wish to say, at the outset, that m dealing with the subject as I shall do, I do not desire to reflect upon any Minister. I do not agree with the honourable member for Kooyong that the manufacturers would prefer a duty to a bounty. With the exception of those who were only turning out iron I do not think that manufacturers would prefer a duty to a bounty, and cannot understand the honourable member suggesting that they would.",17
35,Mr KNOX,Unknown,On e manufacturer of iron might.,17
36,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Naturally , if there were only one manufacturer of iron, he would prefer a duty to a bounty; but every user of iron would be of a different opinion. For that reason I think that the granting of a bounty is a much better method of encouraging the industry than is the imposition of a duty. I am not averse' to a duty being imposed if the industry is established. The creation of the industry would more than compensate for any drawback that might arise from the collection of such duties as these.",17
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I do not desire that the bounty and the duty should be concurrent.,17
38,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I should oppose their running concurrently.,17
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,So should I . Mx. BOWDEN - And yet we have bounties and duties operating concurrently in relation to a number of Queensland industries.,17
40,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I was ready to do something more for the iron industry than to agree to the imposition of a duty, but the honourable member would not support me. I am prepared to support these proposals, but do not think there should be any lengthy debate upon them. When we have . to deal with the material question of whether the Minister shall have power by proclamation to direct duties on metals and machinery to be collected, or whether such a direction should be given only by Parliapoint. ment, which alone has the power fo impose duties; I shall be found objecting to first-named proposal. Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM agreed toThat paragraph r be left out. Item, as amended, agreed to.",17
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [2.53] - We have now to deal with the heading to this division, which readsTo come into operation on dates to be fixed by proclamation, and exempt from duty in the meantime. Proclamation *to issue as soon as it is certified to Parliament by the Minister that the manufacture to which the proclamation refers has been sufficiently established in the Commonwealth. As I explained a few minutes ago, this provision is different from that which has been associated with a similar schedule in two other measures. On three prior occasions we have had under consideration a schedule of this kind, and in the last instance we varied the heading, using words similar to, if not exactly the same, as those now under consideration. In the Tariff of 1902, it was provided that the duties should come into operation by a resolution passed by both Houses of the Parliament. I have been advised all round, however, that the uncertainty attaching to such a provision would militate against the establishment of the industry.",17
42,Mr FISHER,Unknown,This is not debatable.,17
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I do not agree with the honourable member; I think that it is.,17
44,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The honourable member wishes to carry on legislation by Government.,17
45,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I hope the honourable member will not grumble. Under the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, up to the ist January, 1913, a certain sum of money will annually be expended by way of bounties on the production of pig iron. If at that time, or before the expiration of that time, it appeared to the Ministry that the production of pig iron in Australia.was sufficient to supply the requirements of the Commonwealth then, under this pronosal, a proclamation could be issued providing that the duty of 12$ per cent, should, come into operation. As soon as the duty comes into operation, the bounty will cease. I wish at once to disabuse the minds of honourable members as to there being any desire on the part of the Government that the duty and the bounty shall be concurrent.",17
46,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,That is not the,17
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable the member for Kooyong referred specially to that point. I should be prepared to trust LYNE ) anv Ministry to honestly carry out the intention of Parliament by issuing a proclamation when satisfied that the quantity of pig iron being produced in Australia was sufficient to supply local requirements.,17
48,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Why not trust the Parliament?,18
49,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I am prepared to trust the Parliament; but I would remind honourable members that occasionally it takes a long time to secure the passing of such a resolution. Personally, this provision is nothing to rae,",18
50,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Hear , hear; no one suggests that it is.",18
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I speak as 1 feel in regard ""to this matter; and I recognise that there is a difference of opinion on the subject. If it be decided that these duties shall not come into operation except upon a resolution of both Houses of Parliament, I shall have to submit to that decision; but I think that such a condition would hamper the investment of money in the industry, and that it would be better to adopt the Government proposal. We use the words ""sufficiently established."" The question of how best to express our intentions in this regard has always been a troublesome .one; even when the right honourable member for Adelaide was Minister of Trade and Customs great difficulty was experienced in determining what would be the most suitable words to use as a direction to the Minister. On one occasion it was proposed that the duties should come into operation when it was shown that sufficient pig iron was produced to supply Australian requirements.",18
52,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Such a provision would not do, because whilst we might be producing a small quantity of pig iron, we might have no machinery in the Commonwealth for carrying on. the rolling and other necessary processes.",18
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"If we grant a bounty the production of pig iron will quickly be followed by the erection of the machinery necessary for rolling it out and turning it into an improved marketable commodity. We provide for a duty of 12 J per cent, on pig iron, ingots, blooms, slabs, and so forth. There would be 12^ per cent, duty on pig iron and 12J per cent, on puddled bars. If any manufacturer produced pig iron in sufficient quantities he would secure that amount. If he successfully carried out the process of converting that pig iron into puddled bars he would get another 12 \ per cent, on that form of the iron.",18
54,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,If he does it.,18
55,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,He couid do it.,18
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"There is no doubt he could do it, and he would do it. Mr ATKINSON. - He might be doing so well on the production of pig iron that he would go no further.",18
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Not at all. He would know that he would get the extra 12J per cent, on the iron converted into puddled bars. If we could induce any person to produce a sufficient quantity of pig iron to meet Australian demands, there would be no difficulty in inducing them to take up the processes of converting the pig iron into the other forms of iron upon which they would afterwards be able to obtain the advantage of the duties set out in item 229.",18
58,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,I hope the honourable gentleman is not too sanguine.,18
59,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not know whether I can be regarded as a sanguine man, but I believe in Australia and in developing Australia.",18
60,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,So do we.,18
61,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,And I believe in developing first of all the production of pig iron in Australia.,18
62,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,The question is whether themanufacturers of pig iron will necessarily go on from that to the other processes.,18
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Of course they will, if they are assured that they will not be swamped by the American Steel Trust with steel and iron imported from Pittsburg. Unless we can give them that assurance they certainly will not proceed.",18
64,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The import returns, as the honourable gentleman is aware, show that there is no serious competition by the American Steel Trust.",18
65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,There is serious competition in every industry of iron and steel manufactures.,18
66,Mr FISHER,Unknown,So there will be to the end.,18
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,There will be until we put a stop to it.,18
68,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,-What has this to do with the question whether the proclamation is to be issued on the authority of the Minister or of Parliament?,18
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I admit that I have been led a little away from that.,18
70,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Thin k of Christmas.,18
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do; but I wish to have this matter dealt with in a way which will,not have the effect of delaying the establishment of the iron industry. I have said that I am in thehands of the Committee in the matter.",18
72,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Is it while for the Minister to provoke a debate .on the subject when we know that even if we passed the proposal here, another place would not agree to it?",19
73,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not know what another place would do, and I do not think that the honourable member knows.",19
74,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Anothe r place Would never think of leaving such a matter in the hands of a Minister in this Chamber.,19
75,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It would not be in the hands of a Minister, but in the hands of the Executive. I am in the hands of the Committee. I submit the proposition, and I hope that honourable members will deal with it as soon as possible.",19
76,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Kooyong) [3.3] - I wish to move- ' That after the word "" Commonwealth"" the following words be added :- "" But no proclamation to issue, except in pursuance of a joint address passed on the motion of Ministers by both Houses of Parliament stating that such manufacture is sufficiently established."" May I at once say that in moving this amendment, I intend no reflection upon the present or any future Minister.",19
77,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I quite understand that.,19
78,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Let me further say that if the Minister will at once say that he is prepared to leave the matter to Parliament I shall withdraw the amendment, and let him propose the necessary alteration, as I have no special desire to be personally associated with the amendment of the proposal. I think the Minister must admit that the feeling of the Committee is against so great a change as he proposes. Honourable membeiis are noW at all likely to agree that it should be left to the discretion of the Minister to say when the industry has been sufficiently ' .established. That would be an enormous power to place In the hands of any Minister or Government. The question at issue is certainly one upon which honourable members should have an opportunity of expressing an opinion.",19
79,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The honourable member is not moving his amendment.,19
80,Mr KNOX,Unknown,I have moved it.,19
81,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,Unknown,I have a prior amendment to move.,19
82,Mr KNOX,Unknown,Then I am prepared to withhold my amendment 'for the present and to give notice of my intention to move it. worth Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I might ask the honourable member for North Sydney to give me notice of his amendment.,19
83,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,It is in accordance with the Minister's own desire.,19
84,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Then I shall be sure to agree to if .,19
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [3.5] - There is a question which I should like to raise before we deal with any amendment, though I should like to say that I am heartily in accord with that suggested by the honourable member for Kooyong. Listening to the Minister I began to wonder whether we were not approaching a similar condition of things to that existing at the the present time in Portugal, where Parliament has been altogether dispensed with.",19
86,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Queenslan d is not so far away.,19
87,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It was not the Minister there, but the Governor.",19
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The cases are very different. I hope the Committee will not agree to the Minister's proposal. It seems to me to be a distinct step towards personal government, which I hope will never be adopted in Australia. It would be a sorry day for the democracy if we gave these' large' powers affecting the vitals of our form of government into the hands of any Ministry or Cabinet except in the most urgent circumstances.",19
89,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,The Minister is not really serious.,19
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I am serious.,19
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should not think so. When I first looked at the proposal I wondered if it had been submitted for the purpose of protecting the revenue. I have not heard the Minister say anything about that phase of the question. 1 take it that if the Cabinet did arrive at the conclusion that any of these industries were sufficiently established to warrant the imposition of the duties, it would be their duty to bring down a schedule of the duties in the ordinary way, imposing them at the same time. That would be necessary for the protection of the revenue. I do not think we should loose our hold of the right to consider the matter de novo when that time arrives. I should like to direct the attention of the Minister to two or three of these items. Paragraph A includes scrap iron and steel and pig iron. Paragraph B includes ingots, blooms, slabs, billets, puddled bars and loops, or like crude manufactures, less finished than iron or steel bars, but more advanced than pig iron. Then, in paragraph c we have bar, rod, angle, tee, plain, sheet and plate, wire and hoop.",19
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Thos e paragraphs have been passed.,20
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am aware of that, but the item is not through yet. I wish to ask the Minister whether these duties are to be cumulative.",20
94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I explained matter. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - I point out that these paragraphs refer to forms of iron in three different stages of manufacture, each dutiable at 12^ per cent.",20
95,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,The duty would be charged upon them in the condition in which they arrived.,20
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They would arrive in all these three conditions.,20
97,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,On e piece of iron could not arrive in all three conditions.,20
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member is quite right. I was thinking of the bounties. These duties cannot be cumulative.,20
99,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I said that they were in this way. If a man produced pig iron he would get the advantage of the duty on pig iron; and if he afterwards erected machinery and produced iron in the second form, included in paragraph B, he would get the advantage of the two duties. Mr JOSE PH COOK - The point to which I have referred should be made clear, and I believe that is the object of the amendment to be proposed by the honourable member for North Sydney.",20
100,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [3.10] - This is not a matter over which it is necessary to indulge in heroics. It is simply a question of whether Parliament is to rule, or be ruled by Ministers.",20
101,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Parliamen t always rules the Ministry.,20
102,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Unfortunately , if a Minister makes a mistake, Parliament is exceedingly generous and stands by him. But that is not the point. This the Government proceeding by proclamation, is an old. familiar friend. Government and everv member desires to have the power to control Parliament. Perhaps there is not a member in this Chamsubmitted ber who would not do so if he were given the power-and I suppose those of us with the least ability would desire it most. Treasurer said that if Parliament this power to itself, speculators or business men might hesitate to put their into an industry. But why should they be afraid of Parliament? What Ministry would hesitate to bring down a motion if they thoughtthat an industry was sufficiently established for the duties to be imposed ? . M T. W. H . IRVINE - A good many of them are afraid of Parliament, but they are more afraid of the Ministry. that Mr FISHER - No Ministry would be afraid to ask Parliament to impose the duties if they thought the industry had been established. If any Ministry were afraid, it would be the duty of Parliament to obtainanother Ministry that would not be afraid. I do not impugn the motives or integrity of Ministers. One of the worse features of our democratic form of government is to be found in the suggestions that are sometimes made against the probity of Ministers. That is a bad thing. I do not think that that accusation can be made at all. There is no reason why Ministers should have cast upon them sucli a - responsibility as is proposed. A democratic Parliament should hesitate to hand over any of its powers to any Minister or Ministry. I trust the Committee will in no way bind itself by agreeing to a provision of this kind. Why should we bind Parliament for the two, three, four, or five years of which the Minister spoke? It must be obvious"" to the Minister that his difficulty in that direction will be increased by the length of time which may elapse before the proclamation is brought into operation. There is no reason why Parliament should not retain this power, even if the Minister's arguments were sound, because this Parliament is sitting, and appears to be destined to sit, for at least two-thirds of the year.",20
103,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is to be hoped not. Mr LIVINGSTON . - If we are not smart, the year will not be long enough.",20
104,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That is so, and I presume is brought about largely through the idea of loquacity of the Opposition.",20
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,O r through the proEvery posals which the honourable member's party are constantly forcing on the Ministry.,20
106,Mr FISHER,Unknown,An y proposals that are from this side are for the benefit of the people. The party that hesitates to bring forward proposals to benefit the The people is not performing the duties which reserved it was sent here to perform.,20
107,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,My proposals are money for the-6enefit of the people.,20
108,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I give the Minister every credit for fighting for what he believes in,' although I do not always agree with him. He still persists in fighting for his proposal in this case, although he knows the sense of the Committee is absolutely opposed to it. This is the third proposal of the kind that I have opposed, and - I hope it will be the last that will be submitted to us.",21
109,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,North Svdney) [3-15] - I need not direct myself to the question of whether the Ministry should have the power by proclamation to impose the duties in this division. I think the Treasurer finds that the sense of the Committee is against him.,21
110,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I do not know that. I would rather the Committee agreed with me.,21
111,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"We cannot. A similar proposal has been defeated previously. I am as sure as I can be that even if we passed it another place would not. because the Minister of Trade and Customs will always be In this Chamber, and, while he may be able to feel the pulse of this Chamber, and know whether he would be safe in issuing a proclamation, the pulse of another place might be quite different.",21
112,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,And the Minister is responsible to this Chamber only.,21
113,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"That is so. I am sure the other place would regard the proposal as giving undue power Chamber; and refuse to accept it . Treasurer stated that if the Committee were against him, he would not push posal. If he has ascertained the feeling ot the Committee, I do not wish to pig iron debate the matter any longer, as I desire to save time. But I - wish have an amendment made prior to that proposed by the honourable member for classes of iron? Kooyong in order to make it clear that what the Minister said was his intention will be the law. I move That after the word "" operation"" the ""and any then existing bounty to cease"" be inserted.",21
114,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,That is to prevent the concurrence of bounty and duty ?,21
115,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Yes ; it I is to prevent a bounty being paid after imposition of a duty.,21
116,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [3.18] - If it is understood that the Minister intends accept the proposal that Parliament and not ti e Minister shall fix by resolution the [242] fiom which the bountv shall cease and the duty operate, I will sit down.",21
117,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Then sit down.,21
118,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Flinders) [3-19]-I do not propose to debate the general question as to whether Parliament should or should not have a say regarding a matter which is really one of legislation, because I gather from the Minister's attitude that he proposes to accept the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Koovong.",21
119,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Yes ; I am going to accept it. I am not going to keep the talk going if I can help it.,21
120,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"The Treasurer cannot complain that I keep the talk going, but I wish to ask a question with a view to clearing up another matter which is left in a little uncertainty in this provision. It is quite possible, under its language, that we may have a proclamation referring to pig iron, or to ingots and blooms. I may be wrong, but, as I understand it , the object of the proclamation is to indicate that the Government have made up their mind that the iron and steel industry has got on to a sufficiently firm footing to do without a bounty, and to do with a duty.",21
121,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,In regard to any particular branch of the industry.,21
122,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Is - it intended to apply to any particular branch ?,21
123,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Yes .,21
124,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Eac h branch will to this be dealt with separately ? The Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Yes .,21
125,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"So long as we unhis proderstand, that is all right.",21
126,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,We may deal with but not with the other class of iron.,21
127,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I understand, . to then, that there may be bounties on pig irpn, for instance, and not on the other",21
128,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The words "" the manufacture to which the proclamation refers"" show that a bounty is inwords tended on the particular manufacture.",21
129,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [3.21] - This seems a rather roundabout way of proceeding with the whole matter. It is the clear intention of the Committee, believe, not to indulge, in any double the banking by way of both bounty and duty. If we dispose of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill in some way or other soon, we to might very well simplify the whole iprocedure. For instance, if we pass that Bill,, date what need is there for this proviso ?",21
130,Mr FISHER,Unknown,There must be some provision for protection after the withdrawal of the bounty.,22
131,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The bounty does not last very long. Mr. JOSEPH .COOK - Are we to proi ceed with the Bill and also impose protecnot tive duties ?,22
132,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,There will be bounty while the duties are imposed.,22
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I think this heading ought to be determined in of the passing or otherwise of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill.. mean is that if we are determined not give both bounty and duty, and the Bill does not pass, this division nated straight away.",22
134,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"If the ManufacLet tures Encouragement Bill does not pass, then I shall f all back on Division VIB .",22
135,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And what in bounties the meantime?,22
136,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I propose to postas pone Division VIB . until the end of the T a r if f ; and then, if the Manufactures couragement Bil l does not pass, I shall back on that division.

137,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Hume-Trea surer) [3.25] - I move That the consideration of Division VIB. be postponed until the remaining items have been disposed of. Division VIB . depends upon the passing or otherwise of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill .,22

139,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Neve r m in d ; I propose that the consideration of Division VIB . shall be postponed. If Parliament decides against the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , then Division VIB . will be proceeded with. Mr W. H. IRVINE - Is VIB . intended to come into operation as supplementary to Division VIA . ?",22
140,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,No .,22
141,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,It says so in the heading.,22
142,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"There is some mistake about the heading. The object is, f the Manufactures Encouragement Bill is carried, to place extra duties on the items in Division VIA . , and then to place no correspondingly high duties, or higher duties, on the items in Division VIB . to protect manufacturers, who have to pay the light duty.on their raw material.",22

What I Sir WILLIAM LYNE - That is the to object; and there will be no necessity for Division VIB . if the Manufactures Enmay be elimicouragement Bill passes. W. H . IRVINE (Flinders) [3.27] me state my difficulty. As I understand the matter, the Government purpose, first of all, to foster the iron industry by giving on certain items for a certain time - let us suppose for three years. Then soon as the bounty period has expired, I understand that the proposal is, by proEnclamation, to give an additional percentage f all of protection on manufactures of iron and steel. honourable Sir WILLIAM LYNE - That is not intended at all.",22
144,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,That is exactly what is said in the Tariff.,22
145,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The heading of the division is not properly worded.,22
146,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Supposin g the Manufactures Encouragment Bill does not pass, then I understand that the Government will be prepared, as I think we shall all be prepared, to put the duties in Division VIA . into force at once.",22
147,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Would we?,22
148,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"If the Manufactures Encouragement Bill does not pass, I understand that the intention is in some wav to give protection to the manufacture of iron in Australia. What was stated most distinctly by the Treasurer was that, either by bounty or duty, we are going to protect the industry. Sir WILLIAM ""LYNE - That is quite true.",22
149,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"And with that I cordially agree. If anything were to happen to prevent the Manufactures Encouragement Bill becoming law, the Government would, I understand, seek to impose, the duties in Division VIA . at once.",22
150,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable not Division member is quite right.,22
151,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That is a matter for Parliament to decide.,22
152,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,That intention has been distinctly stated by the Treasurer more than once.,23
153,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hear , hear.",23
154,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"And the Treathe surer declares it again now. If , by son, of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill not passing, the duties in Division VIA . are imposed at once, will it not necessarily follow that we must impose creased duties under Division VIB .",23
155,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Yes .,23
156,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,There is opinion as to that.,23
157,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"T h but at present I am merely endeavouring to ascertain what is the Government by scheme, with which we may or may not fied agree.",23
158,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Does the honourable member agree with the scheme?,23
159,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Whether we duties agree with it or not, we may clear by finding out what it is. If the Manuso factures Encouragement Bill does not it is admitted that the Government scheme Can anything be clearer than that? involves the imposition at once of the duties in both Division VIA . and VIB .",23
160,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I do not think so.,23
161,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,The Treasurer has just said that it is so.,23
162,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Yes .,23
163,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"All I am deavouring to arrive at now is of the Government; whether or not we agree with the policy. Then I think that the heading is accurate. If the Manufactures Encouragement Bill does scheme at all. not pass both Houses of the Legislature, it is the policy of the Government to bring their scheme. into operation both Divisions VIA . and VIB . of the Tariff. But if , on trary, that, measure becomes case until Division VIA . is brought into force by proclamation VIB . will not be operative. The bounty will be operative. The manufacturers of the metals specified in VIB . will not require any additional tection because their raw materials will be taxed. Therefore, during that period, Division VIB . will not be operative more than will Division VIA . But as soon as the bounty ceases, and Division VIA . made operative by proclamation, Division V IB . must be brought into force-jus t as the Manufactures Encouragement Bill had not been passed-in order to protect those manufacturers of metals whose raw matetion [242]- 2 rials will be rendered more expensive by reason of the operation of the provisions of Division VIA .",23
164,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The claim of Treasurer is that by that time the inreadustry will have been so established that their raw materials will not be dearer.,23
165,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,There is only one also point upon which I differ from the honorinable member. I agree with him in everything that he has said except as to the necessity of bringing Division VIB . into operation simply because Division VIA . bea difference of comes operative.,23
166,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"The heading to at may be.: Division VIB . readsTo come into operation on dates to be fixed proclamation, and subject to the duties specie in Division VI . in the meantime. Proclamation to issueThat is the proclamation bringing Division VIB . into operation under which the present upon machinery"" will be increased by the air about 2 \ or 3J per cent soon as the duties specified in Division VIA . pass, have been brought into operation. As soon as. we bring into operation the duties under Division VIA . , which will increase the price of the raw material to the manufacturers of machinery, Division VIB . also becomes operative.",23
167,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable member's enpoint is that the Government have not the policy made the position clear ?,23
168,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I think that it is clear, but the Treasurer now affirms that what I have outlined is not the Government",23

By that time we shall have insured to those engaged in the manufacture of if metals and machinery an adequate supply of raw materials. That being so, we shall not need Division VIB . , because the intenof that division is to protect the manufacturers, ""whilst their raw materials could not be manufactured locally.",23

As soon as Division VIA . comes into operation, Division VIB . , unless we make a different arrangement, will automatically' take effect, and will place the importers and users of iron in a very difficult position. However, I understand from the Minister that he will omit Division VIB . if the Manufactures Encouragement Bill is passed, and that the matter will come up again for consideration at the end of the Tariff discussion.",25

203,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [3.43] - Mos of the dressings included in this item are the raw materials of manufacturers. Dres- £ i . sings, pastes, and polishes for leather used almost entirely by boot manufacturers in preparing their goods for the market, while bronzing and metal liquids, which are not made in this country, being solcent, vents for converting gold and bronze powcent, ders into paint for decorative purposes, are used mainly by decorators, who get protection from the Tariff. I have ceived a letter from a business firm which says- The item that affects us very, seriously is Division VII . , item 230, which reads-""Black ing, including all dressings, paste and polishes for leather, 40 per cent."" We may mention that we introduced a scientific preparation for belt1 ing from America about ten years ago, and after some difficulty, have worked up a moderate business. The value of the importations, however, amount to ^500 a year, and from what we can learn, they come under the heading already mentioned, although there is another item in the same Division, 233-clin g surface being really a belt grease-unde r which it could be classed; but with our knowledge of the Customs Department, having previously paid 20 per cent., it is evident that 40 per cent, would be claimed. I understand that there is no locally manufactured preparation which seriously competes in quality with this, and that it is very popular with those who wish to reduce wear and fear by friction in the use of machinery.",25
204,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,What is the name of the preparation ?,25
205,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,""" Cling surface."" I have here several illustrations of machinery on which slack belting instead of tight belting is being used because the belts have been treated with ""cling surface.""",25
206,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Why is the preparation not made here?,25
207,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Perhaps it is a patented preparation, and the Australian market is too small to allow it to be manufactured locally at a profit, the firm which makes it having the world's market. I have a communication from another firm in regard to the leather preserving boot polish.",25
208,Mr WATSON,Unknown,There is plenty of that made here.,25
209,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"A number of boot polishes are made locally; but I wish to refer to some of the evidence given on this and subject before the Tariff Commission. 40 per I want to show what this duty really means on the invoice cost of these goods. t The Home cost of Durbar leather preserving boot' polish, under the present Tariff, is To that sum there have to be added are 10 per cent, ad valorem, 2s.; 35 per cent., duty, 7s. 8Jd.; freight, insurance, Cus- toms clearance charges, which equal 10 per cent, on the Home cost, 2s.; and 35 per duty on packing cases, equals 2J per on contents. A case containing £ 1 0 worth of goods costs 15s., and 35 per cent, no on 15s. is 5s. 3d., being equal to 2J per recent, on each £ 1 worth of goods in the case.

210,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The packing cases must be included in the landed value.,25
211,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The packing cases are practically of no value for other purposes ; but the importers have to charge the duty on them, and add that to the cost of the article.",26
212,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The packing cases should properly be included in the landed cost of the article.,26
213,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I am not arguing whether they should properly or improperly be charged to the cost; but pointing out what the total cost, with these charges added, amounts to.'",26
214,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable member must not overlook the value of the local cases.,26
215,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,There is no duty on the cases in which local goods are packed.,26
216,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,There is a duty on the timber.,26
217,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,There is no duty on the manufactured case.,26
218,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,What about the better wages paid here?,26
219,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"- I do not think that the question of wages enters into the matter at all. I dare say that on comparison it will be found that the wages paid in America would be at least as high as, if not higher, than those paid in Australia.",26
220,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Do not talk, but move a reduction.",26
221,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I intend to move a reduction; but I hope that honourable members will allow me to put the matter in my own way. The figures I have quoted have been compiled from an invoice of goods which arrived in the Star of Scotland, and the charges are equal to 51^ per cent, on the Home cost. The figures show, I think, that the proposed duty is very much too high. I find that before the Tariff Commission Mr Belcher,- of Adelaide, stated that he had been in business for only four or five months, and was. doing a fair trade, Considering that he had just started. He wanted the duty to keep imports out of the market. The duty asked for, he .admitted, was high; but he would ask for a higher one if he thought that he would get it. He wanted the duty because he desired to get a higher price. Mr Spooner, of Melbourne, complained that the boot - manufacturers would not take his goods through prejudice, but nevertheless the American price had fallen. He wanted a duty because the price of the imported article was lower than his price, and he presented that his product would be bought if the price of imported polish were doubled. That disposes of the contention of the Treasurer that on several occasions the effect of a duty is really to reduce the price of the local article. In this case the manufacturers of the local article distinctly state that their object in asking for the duty is to shut out the importations, so-that they can double their own prices. Mr Spooner said that he did a large trade with New Zealand and sold f.o.b. there at a lower price than he charged buyers in the Commonwealth. I have made those references to the evidence to show the purpose of those who are asking for the duty, and to point out that, on their own admissions, they are doing very well indeed.",26
222,Mr WATSON,Unknown,In free-trade England they quote a lower price for export. It is done everywhere. Mr JOHNSON.^-I dare say it is. I am not complaining about it being done.,26
223,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The honourable member, of course, is only putting the case for the foreigner.",26
224,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I resent that interjection as wholly unwarranted, and contrary to fact. Importers who reside amongst us are not foreigners any more than are manufacturers who reside here. The same thing is done by Mr MCKay with his harvesters. He charges the foreigner i&\ less for his machines than he charges the Australian farmer. It is done here, the same as it is done elsewhere. In almost all cases the local manufacturers charge the consumers in the countries to which they export their goods less than they charge the consumers in this country. That appears to be a general practice. I presume that when they do sell their goods at a lower price to outside persons they do not sell them at a loss, but at a profit.",26
225,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Frequentl y it pays them to sell for export without getting a profit.,26
226,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"That is so in exceptional cases, I admit. We may, however, take it, I think, that where any local manufacturers are trying to develop an export trade they are doing so with the object qf securing an additional profit.",26
227,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"They can sell their exported goods without getting a. profit, and yet make an'additional profit on their aggregate output. ;",26
228,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"That may beso in some cases; but I believe that it is not the re- general commercial rule. I do not think that the export of boot polishes has attained such large dimensions at the present time ithat the local manufacturers are selling them at a loss outside. However, I do not want to prolong the discussion unduly; but 1:0 submit an amendment.",26
229,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [3.57] - Before the honourable memher for Lang submits an amendment, I wish to mention that it is the intention of the Government to see whether it is not possible to arrive, at some method under which the duty shall not be charged on packages which are not worth anything, and shall - only be charged on packages which are of .some commercial value. That seems to me to be a fair way of dealing with the matter. .",27
230,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"That means raising the , Md valorem duty.",27
231,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It seems to me that when any person imports rubbish round a package which is of no value, it is not fair to charge a duty on that rubbish. On the value of the package the duty should be paid. packages may come into competition with various things; but I think it is fair to do as I have indicated. - control of the Department I thought it was ridiculous to charge duty on something - which was of no value. In a great many - cases the packages are of no value. have thrown out that suggestion to the Committee, because it may influence the honourable member for Lang in regard to something which he is proposing to do.",27
232,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yarra) [4.0] - The honourable member for Lang, as usual, wants the duty to be reduced. I want the duty 4o be so fixed that importers cannot do as they have been doing.",27
233,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Hear , hear.",27
234,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not suppose that any one on the Opposition side will say that the honourable member for Kooyong is as bigoted a protectionist as I am, and when lie cheers my remark that there should be A fixed duty his assent ought to carry some weight with it. I hope that the Government will agree to a fixed duty, which can easily be charged on the weight of the contents of the tin. The bulk of these importations-ove r two-thirds-com e i r om the United Kingdom.",27
235,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Sixty-fiv e per cent.,27
236,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The percentage is increasing every year. Since 1904 the imports have increased over 50 per cent. In three years their value has increased from .£41,180 to .£63,861, with the result that the home trade has fallen off. Of course, the £ 6 3 , 8 6 1 would represent a warehouse cost of no less than £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 . The foreigner has secured seven-eighths of the trade. Undoubtedly the Nugget Polishing Company Limited are the largest exporters of this class of material from the United Kingdom to Australia. I hold in my hand a copy of their wholesale export price lists. The wholesale price list quotes waterproof black or brown polish in sixpenny tins at 3s. per dozen. That is the price of the ordinary small tin which is well known to honourable members. On the back of this list I find the conditions of sale to the retail trade, f t saysThis polish and the outfits, whether bought direct from us, or from any dealer, are sold on the express agreement(3) That they shall not be retailed at less than 4£d. for 6d. tins; 5d. for 6d. bottles; gd. for is. tins; iod. for is. bottles; is. 3d. for is.' 6d. outfits; is. 6d. for is. 9d. metal outfits and 2s. for 2S. 6d. outfits, Wooden (i) That the polish shall not be put into or sold, with any outfit other than one supplied by us.

The acceptance of the goods by any purchaser or sub-purchaser will be treated as an acknowledgment that they are sold to him on these conditions, and that he agrees with the vendor to him (as agent in this respect for us) to observe the same.",27
237,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that the conditions are observed ?,27
238,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The conditions are observed throughout the United Kingdomthat is, in 'their home market.",27
239,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The conditions are not observed in Australia. - Mr TUDOR - That is what I complain of and I propose to deal with. In the case of the small tins the wholesale rates to the retail trade at Home are 36s. gross, and 28s. i o d . net. For the export trade the rates are 30s. gross, and 27s. net. The company are prepared to sell at 25 per cent, less for export to the trade than for home consumption.",27

At the top of the document it is statedThe export discount from the list prices goods is 25 per cent, from the prices of the polishes and creams, and 15 per cent, from brushes and pads.

I have here a letter from one of the largest importers in Melbourne sent to a firm of polish manufacturers, Messrs. Spooner and Co., Limited. The letter petition. saysDear Sirs, Concerning the prices sold to the retailers for Nugget Polish three years ago and the present curred on Saturday evening-Cou'tie , of day, we beg to make the following report,'which 217 Elizabeth-street. the writer has investigated. Three years ago it was 4s. per dozen, and then it came down to 3s. gd., and 3s. 6d., and retailed at 6d. per tin. The lowest wholesale price today is 37s. 6d., or 38s. 6d., less 2^ percent, for parcels, and the retail price at the present time in the boot shops is 3^d. and 3d., and in some of the up country towns the line is retailed at 2d. per tin. The retailers in Great Britain are compelled to sell at 4-Jd. per tin. Here, to enable the market to be swamped, they sell at as low as 2d. per tin. When the importers attain theirobject, they will no doubt do what they did before we had the local competition. They used to sell at c-d. and is. per bottle, but when.the local men began to compete the price was reduced to 6d. The importers are naturally anxious to capture the market. If they succeed, the price will undoubtedly go up. I have here dozens of letters obtained from retailers in Melbourne .to show the price of the article in former years and at present.",27
242,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,What particular article?,28
243,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I allude to Nugget Boot Polish, which represents more than 50 per cent, of the imports in this line. I will guarantee that for every tin of any other imported stuff which the honourable member can find in the shops in any of our leading streets, he will find a dozen tins of Nugget. I am very glad that there has been no detraction of the Australian article in the matter .of quality, and, on the other hand, I point out that I am not saying a word against the quality of the imported stuff. What I maintain is, that the Australian polish is as good as anv; and that the local makers can turn out all the goods we require.",28
244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Hav e they the capaI city to supplv the whole Australian marmanufacturer ket?,28
245,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"There is no doubt at all ' about that. I have not spoken more than o three or four times upon this Tariff, but of our when I find that this English firm is prepared to sell at 25 per cent, less for export, the so as to capture our market, I think I am to justified in bringing the facts prominently On former occasions when I have spoken I have been fairly successful, and I hope that I shall do the same on the present occasion. I intend to prove up to the hilt that the price of polish has been enormously Alfred cheapened in consequence of the local comI have before me a. certificate from a. business man whose premises are right opposite the place .where the fire oc, He writesThis is to certify that in 1905 I purchased Nugget Cream at 38s. 6d. per gross, and in 1906 at 33s. per gross. He-could not have bought it at that price in Great Britain; yet the price quoted in this certificate was duty paid at the rate of 20 per cent, and all charges paid. Mr TILLEY BROWN. - The honourable member's proposal is to impose a duty of 40 per cent. I understand.",28
246,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I trust that the Government will agree to a fixed duty, so'that it will operate fairly, whether the stuff is imported in ounce, 2-oz., or 4-oz. tins, or in bulk. Another document before me shows that in 1907 Nugget Polish was sold in one shop at 3^d. per tin, and for 2^d. at Harris's, Elizabeth-street. The same stuff cannot be purchased in Great Britain for less than double those amounts. Only last week, in my own electorate, tins were purchased at the rate of two for 6d - that is, 33 per cent, less than the price for which the same goods can be bought in Great Britain. Surelv we have a right to protect our own manufacturers against competition like that.",28
247,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,-Who gets the benefit of the cheapness ?,28
248,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The point is, that directly the local manufacturers are shut out, up will go the price.",28
249,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"That is "" a chestnut."" Mr TUDOR. - I will guarantee that Nugget Polish does not sell in London for as low a price as that which I have.quoted as the price at which it has been sold in Melbourne . and in country towns. t has to be remembered that the local is now paying increased prices for such of his raw materials as are not . produced in Australia. Under the new Tariff, he has to pay 2s. 6d. per lb. for his egg albumen, whereas under the old Tariff the article was free. Why did not the honourable member for Lang object to a duty on eggs?",28
250,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I did.,29
251,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member cheaper was not game enough to move an amendment.,29
252,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I am game to move an amendment on any item in this Tariff, i can get any one to support me. The Treathere surer knows that very well.",29
253,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Besides , why should not our fowls be protected against pauper fowls of China?",29

Those caps, which are placed on the of the bottles, are not manufactured Nickel zinc pays 15 per cent, under the Tariff, whereas under the old one it free. Acetic acid, which is used in manufacture of these goods, now pays 3s. 9d. per gallon, as against 2s. 6d. gallon under the old Tariff.",29
255,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Surely these increased parties duties will cheapen the prices of the articles mentioned ?,29
256,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If they were made here the increased duties would cheapen prices, but revenue duties will not. not producing nickel in Australia, the article I have just mentioned will be dearer on account of the duty.",29
257,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,So that a duty at and the same time reduces and increases prices ?,29
258,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If an article is manuthe factured in Australia, prices will be reduced as the result of a the article is manufactured here, a duty will have the effect of increasing the price.",29
259,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Yet , in his evidence, Mr wrong. Spooner said that he wanted a duty so as to increase prices.",29
260,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not think ""that prices will be increased; but the real is that we do not want to see men out of business by the unscrupulous of importers.",29
261,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,Melbourn e people are doing the same sort of thing over in Western AustraliaThey are dumping their goods there with the object of shutting up Western Australian manufacturers.,29
262,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Are they selling much in . Western Australia than they are selling in Melbourne?,29
263,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"They are, and will do so until they shut up the local factories.",29
264,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The conditions of manuf I facture are similar in both States, so that is no reason why the local manufactures should be shut up. I trust that the Government will, in .view of the facts the which I have submitted, agree to fix a high rate of duty on' this particular has article. I have figures before me which and show how the trade of one of our manuduty facturers has gone down consequent upon it was the dumping of goods from abroad.",29
265,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Why did he not give evidence to that effect before the Tariff,29
266,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"He did. I am referring tops to Mr Spooner. The honourable member here. has quoted' some of Mr Spooner's evinew dence, carefully selected.

269,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The honourable member is entirely mistaken.,29
270,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member one need not tell me that. What has occurred on the present occasion was precisely the . same sort of thing as we had when the last Tariff was before us; and probably selection was made by the same person.,29
271,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,'Does the honourable duty; but until member think so?,29
272,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I do.,29
273,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Then he is entirely,29
274,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I will take the honourable member's word for it. At any rate, the trade of this man's firm has decreased, point as he iswilling to prove from his own driven books. They show that from May, 1903, tactics to April, 1904, his total trade was £10,614. But it decreased ' to £'$,131 from May, 1906, to April, 1907. Those figures show a decrease of 50 per cent. While that trade was being diminished, the trade of the importers was growing. I believe that the honourable member for Kooying, who is familiar with the facts, is prepared to support me in this matter. He has gone into the case for himself, and honourable members know that he would not support a duty unless he believed that it was equitable.",29
275,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [4.18] - The burden of the argument of the honourable member for Yarra especially affected boot polish. He has been trying to show the Committee how a duty acts in two diametrically opposite ways. The effect a duty on boot polish will be, he says, to cheapen prices, while the effect of a duty on the things which enter into the manufacture of boot polish is to increase prices. So that Ave have two antithetical objects attained by a duty-it raises prices and it reduces prices. Surely the honour the able member does not ask the Committee to believe that the effect of duties on articles' which are manufactured here will be to reduce the prices of those articles, view of the fact that in their own evidence the manufacturers point out that one of the objects they have in view in asking for a duty is to increase prices because the prices against which they have to compete are so low? The honourable member urges that the effect of a duty will be to lower prices, whilst at the same time he emphasizes the fact that the effect of duties upon the raw material from which boot polish' is made has been to increase them. The honourable member asks us to believe that a duty will at one and the same time reduce and increase prices. my intention to move that the duties be reduced to 20 per cent, and 15 per cent., but in view of the statement made by the Treasurer that he proposes to make some allowance in the matter of cases, which have practically no commercial value, I intend at a later stage to move that the duties be reduced to 25 per cent, and 20 per cent. They would thus be brought down to the level of the old duties. Before doing so, however, I intend to ask the Committee to - eliminate the words ""bronzing and metal liquids."" These solvents, which are used in the manufacture of bronzes for paintinsr purposes, are not manufactured here. move That the words "" and bronzing and metal liquids"" be left out.",30
276,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Kooyong) [4.22] - The honourable member for Yarra has made a thorough explanation of the position of the local manufacturers, and I am disposed tothink from the facts that he has submitted; to the Committee that my brief is very similar to that which he holds. I am satisfied that a factory at Richmond ispractically idle as the result of imported brands being sold, for the purpose of destroying the local industry, at prices considerablybelow those at which they - are offered in England. I wish to emphasize the point made by the honourable member for Yarra that the importation of materialsof this kind into Victoria considerably inof creased under what, as compared with the State Tariff was the low duty embodied in the first Federal Tariff. In 1901 theimports into this State were of the value of £ 5 J 5 5 '> i 9 ° 4 they had increased in value J nT to £ ; 3 4 i , in 1905 to £ 1 5 , 2 4 8 , and in I 2 1906 to £ 1 9 , 6 9 8 . I would also remind, Minister that the question qf casings: is an important consideration in determining what is a fair duty to impose. Blackings: and polishes of excellent quality are being; in made here, and the industry would flourishbut for the efforts of those who are adopting the' tactics to which I have referred. T am satisfied that, in the special circumstances, even what might be regarded as an extravagant ad valorem duty would not meet the case.",30
277,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,What fixed duties does the honourable member recommend?,30
278,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"I understand that the honourable member for Yarra intends to move duties representing practicallv half the rates which manufacturers requested when before the Tariff Commission. In conseTt was quence, I believe, of the representations made by the honourable member for Yarra and myself, the trade, with a desire to secure fixed duties, have agreed that the duty on blacking, & c , in bottles, tins, or in any other form containing under 1 oz.. should be is. per dozen; on 1 oz.. and under 2 oz., is. 6d. a dozen; on 2 oz_ and under 6 oz., 2s. 6d. per dozen; and orr 6 oz. ancl over or in bulk, 6s. per gallon.",30
279,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,Thos e proposals do not provide for a preference.,30
280,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"The Question of preference has hot been considered. The whole of I the manufacturers have signed a petitionurging that the duties I have mentioned beimposed. They have cut down their request to the very lowest level compatible - with their being able to keep their works going. ' Like the honourable ^member for Yarra, I know that the * factory in Richmond was started with sufficient .capital by capable men who knew their business, but they have been unable to cope with the competition I have mentioned. It is with .a knowledge of the bona fides of the representations that have been made that I urge that a fixed duty would be preferable to the liigher ad valorem duty which the manufacturers originally hoped, to secure. shall therefore support the amendment which I understand the honourable member for Yarra intends to submit. Mr TILLE Y BROWN (Indi) [4-27]-I intend to support the reduction of the duty to 25 per cent, on the ground first all that such a duty plus freightage and other charges ought to be and is sumcient prodents writetection for the local manufacturers.

Our only way out of the difficultyi f the unfair duty is continued-wil l be to pack line in a smaller can, thus giving the public a lesser quantity for the same money, and making the public the real sufferer. This we hesito do, but, as before mentioned, it is the local manuonly course left open.

283,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [4.32] local The protectionist members of the Tariff rangCommission recommended a duty of 35 per cent, on polishes and blacking because of the fierce and intense competition to which the the local manufacturers have been suba jected, and also because of the suspected 2 in low invoice valuations, the prejudice that, from exists against the local article, and the cutting rates in which the importers inare dulge.

The suggested duty would, the witness thought. lead to the establishment of similar industries in the other States, while not involving any increase in the price to the public He knew of certain lines of polish manufactured in Adelaide being labelled and sold as 11 American goods.""

He cently informed of alarge sale of imported boot polish at 12s. per gross, a price actually less than the cost of the bottles, caps, and cork Tasmania, and the other States. linings in which his polish was sold. There is sworn evidence as to cutting rates and fierce competition, and there is a recent., quest for high duties.

The reply is easy and not far to seek. It has not done the rest in the case of many other goods which have been made here for many years; as witness the revelations in the harvester industry. The manufacturers were getting high prices for their goods, there was plenty of internal competition, and yet they 'were paying their employees as low as 5s. 6d. a day.",33

303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I assume that the honourable member takes into consideration all the conditions surrounding an industry when he refers to the effect of competition. I say that dumping has not the effect attributed to it from time to time by honourable members in discussing these duties. I wish to point out that in connection with the blacking industry a brutal frankness was exhibited by those who appeared before-the Tariff Commission. One witness wanted 50 per cent, if he could get it, and had the candouT to sayWe would ask for a nigher duty if we we would get it. I should think he would. Who would if he thought he had to deal ter like the Treasurer, who would be prepared to give almost any duty which would prevent the importation of anything that could be made here? Who would not if he knew he would receive? could be more simple than to have terested manufacturer'give the Tariff Commission, and then to take his word without testing it in any The witness to whom I refer was .what his object was in asking for a higher duty, and on this point I quote the followyears. ing evidence given in answer to . question 62070-'Do . you think there ought to be a good opening in Australia .for the. local manufacture these polishes?",33
304,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Whose evidence is the honourable member quoting?,33
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The evidence of Mr Alfre d Belcher, manufacturer, of Prospect. His answer to the question I have quoted wasYes, I am sure of it. If we only get a little higher prices on some of these things or get the others out of the market there would be a. splendid trade. There is a cool suggestion-knoc k everybody out of the market, and put the prices up here ! Then the witness admitted that he would be doing a splendid trade. He was further examined as follows Have you anything else to tell us about blackings and polishes ?-No ; all we want is the duty increased, and that would increase slightly the price of these imported lines, and then we will have a show. We can do them at the same price. We are prepared to put our goods into the market at the same price, but people prefer the imported. I pass by the evident contradiction. The witness first said that he wanted a higher duty, and then he only wanted the imported article shut out. I direct the attention of the Committee to the fact that !£ .I, S S the c , as s of evidence given to the l a r i ft Commission throughout their inquiry.. There evidently was a difficulty in obtaining evidence on behalf of the consumers of Australia, They did not offer evidence, and the Tariff Commission apparently did not deem it their duty to procure the evidence of consumers.",33

307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , but the thought Commission had the power, and, in my judgment, should have exercised it , to get not people who use the various articles dealt with a Miniswith to give evidence.",33

314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I presume they looked after their own business, as the manufacturers did - So far as I know, they do not specially represent the consumers. The honourable member is aware that they consist largely of business men.",34
315,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,They knew that if they were called upon to pay increased duties they could pass them on to the public.,34
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Quite so. We need not expect the manufacturers or importers to bother very much about the consumer. The importer knows that he can pass the duty on, and the manufacturer knows that he can take advantage of it for himself. I say therefore that, in my judgment, an obligation rested upon the Tariff Commission to secure evidence to show how the consumers would be affected as a result of the duties to be imposed. impugning the honesty of manufacturers who gave evidence before the Tariff Commission. I say no more and no less than that human nature operates in them in the same way as in other people. The 'evidence submitted by' the Tariff Commission is. in the circumstances, largely valueless, as being the evidence of interested persons.",34
317,Mr COON,Unknown,"Batman) [4.48] - In reply to the remarks made by the honourable member for Indi, with respect to the polish to which he referred, I wish to inform the honourable member that the tin he produced was filled by a man who was asking for a higher duty. The honourable member is the representative of the foreign trader, and, speaking as such, he produced a tin of polish filled by an. Australian workman. The honourable member for Parramatta has just made a speech in which he has once more shifted his ground. Honourable members of the Opposition have repeatedly referred the Committee to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission, and times out of number have quoted from it. They have asked on more than one occasion that we should quote it, but now, because a manufacturer who went before, the Com.mision asked for an increased duty, the honourable member for Parramatta says that the evidence collected by the Commission is worthless. It is sufficient for me to know that this industry, which some time ago employed fifty or sixty men, is only employing fourteen today. The honourable member for Ind i knows that these goods are being not the dumped into Australia at a price which is less than that for which they can be bought wholesale in the Old Country. Only a short time ago 10,000 gross of "" Nugget"" were dumped into Sydney at 25s. a gross. The article is being sold today in the Commonwealth at a lower price than the local article, with the object of securing a monopoly of the trade by crushing the local manufacture out of existence. That is what the foreign trader always does when he gets the opportunity. I trust that honourable members who believe in supporting the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission will do so on this occasion, and give this industry a fresh start.",34
318,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Does the honourable member want fixed duties or not?,34
319,Mr COON,Unknown,"I want fixed duties, because with them we know exactly where we stand and what we are doing. SomeI am not times correct invoices are not supplied. The only way to get over that difficulty in all cases of this kind is to have fixed duties. Then those importing the articles know exactly what they have to pay, and we know where we are.",34
320,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Then how did the honourable, member come to support so many ad valorem duties ? ",34
321,Mr COON,Unknown,Because I could .not get fixed rates.,34
322,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [4.52] - The remarks made about foreign traders and advocates for importers should cease, if it is desired to get business through. The importer is not a bit different from the manufacturer. They are practically the same individual, and a matter of chance has directed them into one occupation or the other. Each will do the best for himself, and will take all he can get. There is, therefore, no sense in constantly making statements such as I have referred to. The business of a Parliament is to see that neither of them is put in a position to take advantage of the public. The whole debate has centred round one article - the polish called ""Nugget."" But polishes for other purposes than dressing boots, such as polishes for harness, metals, and so on, are included in the item. If the argument with regard to "" Nugget"" applies in the case of boot polish, it has no reference whatever to those other polishes. preference for "" Nugget"" is as between it and other British polishes. It has been said that more than half the boot polish that comes to Australia consists of ""Nugget."" There is evidently something in it that makes people demand it , so that it is not a question as between an Australian and a British article, but as between British and British. The proposal is to so increase the duty as to compel people to buy another article for which they have not the same liking. Another effect will be to impose a heavier duty on all the articles included in the . item, although they are not used for the same purpose. The Minister should make a statement and stop .the debate.",34
323,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I fear that if make a statement, I shall keep the debate going.",35
324,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The Minister knows that a proposal has been made for a fixed duty. Is he going to adopt that and abandon his own Tariff? If he is, what is the fixed duty to be?",35

326,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,It is the introduction of alterations of that kjnd that causes debate.,35

330,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The honployment orable member for Yaora has just given the quotation of "" Nugget"" for export as 2s. 3d. a dozen. Therefore a fixed duty of is. does not represent 40 or 35 per cent., but 40 gallons. a higher duty.",35

340,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Corio) [4.59] - I have a request to make to the Treasurer regarding harness dressing, which is imported in bulk in large quantities. In. more than one of States there is ain industry for putting 9d. up the imported liquid harness dressing, of which is brought in in bulks of from 45 to 50 gallons. That industry gives emin Australia, and I wish to ask the Minister to consent to insert a special line with a reduced duty on harness dressing when imported in casks containing over",35
341,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,It will compete with - the local article afterwards.,35
342,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"That is true, but it should have some preferential treatment, because it is made up here and gives employment in tinning, printing of labels. &c. I have received the following letter Re Tariff Division 7, No. 230. Blackingdressings, pastes, and polishes for The former duty was 20 per cent., and the new duty is 35 per cent, preferential, and 40 per cent, general. We import a liquid harness dressing in casks of 45 lo 50 gallons, which .we tin off here into pints and quarts, but principally pints. The tins for this, the printed labels to put on the tins, the wood boxes to ""hold one dozen tins, are all made in Melbourne, and, of course, our own employees do the WOTK of filling, labelling, and boxing (no girls or women employed). If the duty on dressing imported in bulk were made, say, 10 per cent, less than for that imported in tins, it would give us a chance of competing with the tinned dressing-otherwisee we w i ll have to arrange to have our dressing tinned, labelled, and boxed in England, as the charges for these items will be very much less than if done here, while labour is proportionately cheaper there than here. There are other firms interested. I do not ask that the article should be made free for them. I suggest that a protection of 30 per cent, should be given for those who manufacture the bulk liquid, but the honourable member for Bendigo will see that the industry has some right to a preferential treatment of, say, 5 or 10 per cent., seeing that, if that is not given, several men will be put out of employment in the case of that firm alone, and a lot of work which is now done in Australia will be sent away. . Sir JOHN QUICK - We want something more than the tinning done here; we want the blacking made here.",35
343,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"The question is : Which is the more important? I do not say that this will altogether stop the dressing from (being imported, but it will limit it to a .special line of harness dressing, which is - of great importance to the farming community, and I understand that harihess dressing cannot now be made in Australia of the quality required. Whatever duty is agreed to for this item, I intend to ask afterwards that the duty shall be 10 per cent, less on harness dressing imported in casks containing not less than 40 gallons.",36
344,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [5.2] - It is time that we polished this item off. I. intend to support the proposal of the Government. As to' all these other individuals who want special concessions, we ought to dispense with that sort of pleading for special cases. I am altogether opposed to fixed duties, because they mean a penalty which is altogether, prohibitive against the cheap article. If this business cannot succeed with a protection of 40 and 35 per cent -, it ought to go under altogether.",36
345,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [5.3] - I move That after the words "" 40 per cent."" the words "" and on and after 3rd December, 1907, a j val. (G.eneral Tariff), 25 per cent.,"" be inserted. I intend afterwards to move for a United Kingdom duty of 20 per cent. I make no secret of the fact that the figures which I now propose do not represent my idea of what the Tariff should be. If I thought I had .the remotest chance of carrying it, I should move for a very much greater reduction, but I have to bear in mind that our time is limited, and that if we are to get through the Tariff we must not indulge in too many useless divisions, even for the Yours truly, sake of showing our weakness. If I were JAMES MUNDAY & Co. to propose anything less than the rate in the old Tariff, several honourable members sitting on this side would not agree to it, because they are pledged not to go below the old rate. I am therefore constrained to move this amendment, which will bring the United - Kingdom rate down to the rate in the old Tariff.",36

347,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [5.5] - I rise to emphasize the speech made by the honourable member for Lang. The honourable member has moved that the duties be 25 per cent, and 20 per cent., not because he approves of such duties, but because he cannot get enough free-traders to support him in his desire to impose the old Tariff. I do not know what the ghost of John Earrell- I do not suppose you knew Mr. Farrell, Mr Chairman-woul d say if he saw his old friend, the member for Lang, an eminent free-trader, submitting such a proposal to Parliament. It would appear, however, that the honourable member for Lang slips on polishes as I have slipped on machinery; and my only desire is to show that I am not singular in slipping.",36
348,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [5.6] - I cannot allow the remarks of the honourable member for Dalley to pass without some reply, because they really misrepresent my position. Personally, I should have proposed a much lower duty if I were not aware of the fact that there would be no possibility of getting it carried ; and I do not desire to waste time. ± recognise that several honourable members on my own side have pledged themselves not to go below the old Tariff; but I propose a reduction which I think there is a chance of carrying.

F o r that purpose, there is no doubt that the local ore is as good as any that can be obtained in the world. The company which has been mining for plumbago have found that, under existing conditions, the industry will not pay. I.understand that they have asked for a duty of £ 2 per ton, which would represent a slightly less ad valorem rate than that proposed by the Treasurer. I think it would be equivalent to about 25 per cent. If we have suitable ore in Australia for the production of this material, we certainly ought to encourage the industry. Even if an additional £ 2 per.ton were added to the price of the local article, its cost would be very little in excess of that of the imported article.",38

When we come to deal with substantial industries, the Treasurer tons only. insists that there shall be a large margin between the rate levied upon the manunight. factured article and that imposed upon raw material. But, in respect of small matters, he adopts the reverse attitude. I of iron. would suggest that he should withdraw proposal, and be content to levy very much smaller duties upon this item. _ Mr WATSON (South Sydney) [5.37] No protectionist member of the Committee will object, to extending to this industry a fair measure of protection, especially as its raw material is obtainable in the Commonwealth. But it does seem to me that 35 per cent, is a very stiff charge to levy upon graphite, particularly in view of the fact that it is the raw material of other industries.

Are we going to compel the users of sewing machine oil, many of whom belong to the poorer classes, to pay more for it, by quiring it to be brought here in bulk, and bottled locally, than they pay now?",41
398,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Eve n with the duty added, the'cost will be very little. A bottle of sewing machine oil costs 6d., ancl one is bought perhaps once in four months.",41
399,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The honourable member has used that argument beolive fore. He forgets that the total result these ..small charges will be very considerThe able.,41
400,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"On the honourable memThe ber's own showing it would be only ^8,000 spread over the consumers of all kinds of oil.",41
401,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The oils upon the consumers. on which this duty is imposed are largely sewing, machine oils. Mr WATSON. - It is not correct to say that sewing machine oils make up the bulk Olive oil, bicycle oil, and other kinds of oil come within the",41
402,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Olive, and other oils come out to a certain extent, but not to a very large extent. The previous duty has evidently led to the local of a Jarge quantity of the oils used But to impose duties which with get the charges come to 271 per cent, is, I think, beyond all reason. The freight to 18.83 per cent., and, of course, to the freight is higher on packed oil than on oils; the duty on the oil amounts to 146.93 per cent., and the duty on the bottles amounts to 106.12 per cent., makI propose to move an amendment on the first line of the item, which, if carried, will, I presume, be an indication that that reducper tion shall be made throughout the item. I That after the figures "" is . 6d.,"" paraeraph or A, the words ""and on and after 3rd December, 1907, per doz., 6d.,"" be inserted.",41
403,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [5.51] The A section of the Tariff Commission recommended a graduated increase in the bottduty on bottled or packed oil, but no.increase in the duty on bulk oil, except in the case of olive oil. The object in recommending an increased duty on bottled oil was to induce persons to import oil in bulk",41
404,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [5.53] - The might well consider whether in the interests of the community it is not advisable to refrain from imposing an additional duty on bottled oils. The honourable memreber for Bendigo has admitted the object which the A section of the Tariff Commission had in view in submitting their recommendation, and that was to encourage the local bottling of oils imported in bulk.",41
405,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"If we can produce the oils here, so much the better.",41
406,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Excep t in the case of oil, our chance of producing the raw of materials is limited at the present time. honourable member for North Sydney has submitted' a reasonable amendment. old duty was 6d. a dozen, and the employment of labour which the local bottling of the oils would create does not justify us in putting an additional impost As the honourable member for Perth remarked the other night, the local bottling of somebody else's product in very likely somebody else's bottles is a parasitical industry. ' It has to be spread over six States. I trust that the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment.",41
407,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [5.55] - Thes e items show the real inwardness of many of the protectionist proposals which are made here. Apparently the only idea of some protectionists is not to strive to protect our manufacturers from outside competition so far as the great staple industries are concerned, but to try in tiddlywinking ways to make work for some persons here.",42
408,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Hear , hear; that is what we want to do.",42
409,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"At the beginning of the twentieth century, the exLabour leader has only got to the pointthat he is still concentrating his energies in the direction of making work, as such. He is very much behind the economic movement of which he is supposed to be a leader. I thought that we were past that time. The inevitable result of these duties must be to encourage the importation of the articles.",42
410,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That should satisfy the honourable member.,42
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"By imposing the duties honourable members create a vested interest in the importation of the goods. Apart altogether from the absurdity of imposing high duties to secure the mere bottling of the oils, they are encouraging their importation. With our climate and with handicrafts such as we shall develop very shortly we ought to make Australia quite self-supporting in regard to all these natural products. If , with, all advantages which our isolation gives us, we cannot beat the world in the production of these articles, we shall be in a very bad way indeed. I hope that we shall not go on imposing duties which do not protect a manufacture as such, but protect only a minor process in connection with some manufacture. The more we can tie the producing and the bottling of the things together the more efficiently we must necessarily make the production of them, and the better it will be for the consumer and all concerned.",42
412,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"South Sydney) [5.57]-The honourable member for Parramatta-wh o by the way is more an "" ex "" as a Labour leader than I am-ha s accused me of desiring to make work as such. I have no such desire, but I think that a great deal of argument can be urged in favour of transferring work which we. can accomplish from other paTts of the world.",42
413,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,No matter what the conditions are under which we can accomplish that work?,42
414,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Of course there are exceptions, but the general principle has, I think, a lot to recommend it to honourable members. It is much better to do our own work than to pay other persons to do it for us.",42
415,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Surely in all these matters we must pay some regard to the efficiency of production ?,42
416,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I admit that the old duty was not quite high enough, but we need not go so far as the Tariff Commission, has recommended. We want to be careful not to admit oils in bottles at a lower rate than that we propose to place on the oils and the bottles when brought in separately. That is one point which I think honourable members should keep in mind. The bottling of oils in Australia should be encouraged because it is a light, clean occupation for girls. There is no reason why nearly the whole of the olive, castor and linseed oils should not be bottled here instead of being bottled for us abroad. I think that the honourable member for North Sydney was mistaken in what he said as to the proportion of the imports. According to his statement, the duty paid on oils imported in small packages totalled only ^4,000, and that included castor oil, which is imported very largely in small bottles.",42
417,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,It is mostly bottled here.,42
418,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Cross e and Blackwell the and Morton, particularly the latter, still export to Australia a great quantity of castor oil. It is extra refined, and is claimed to be tasteless. It is imported .vervlargely in small bottles,_as well as bicycle and machine oils. The increased duty recommended by the A section of the Tariff Commission is rather high. I do not see why it sbould be fixed at more than is.",42
419,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,"Balaclava) [6.1] - I , as a protectionist, have always felt that what, we want to establish in Australia are large producing industries. I cannot imagine that the employment of persons to pour oil out of tins into bottles is likely to create a large industry. On the contrary, it seems to me to be a waste of valuable time tha* might be better emploved in the carrying on of some industry which would be of benefit and use to the people as a whole.",42
420,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Are not the making of bottles, ' the printing of labels, and the manufacturing of cases things to be considered ?",42
421,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,"Thos e are very small things. When oil is sent out in casks there is considerable waste and leakage, and the more the article is handled the greater is the cost to the consumer. It can be bottled abroad and delivered at considerably less cost to the consumer than it can be when it is sent out in bulk and put through different processes here. I remember the time in Victoria when, in order to give work, they used to employ men to dig holes in Melbourne and then fill them. That was thought to be a grand way of providing employment. The pouring of oil out of casks into bottles is very much on a par with the employment of men to dig holes only to fill them. Let us establish in this country all the industries we can. Do not let us put on duties which will increase the cost of an article without doing any good to the worker. We have agreed to give a bounty upon the production of certain oils. We have, to some extent, tried to induce persons to grow cotton and olives and other materials for the production of oil. When a duty is imposed on oil for protective purposes, it is all right. But we ought not to impose duties simply in connection with the covering of an article. It is a poor sort of protection to charge a duty on the straw or packages in which articles are imported. Let us be f a ir and-square; let us put a duty on the article itself and keep it there, but do not let us say that any goods shall not be packed in any country but Australia. From a protectionist standpoint, that is not an evidence of strength, but rather a petty-minded sort of taxation of the people.",43
422,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [6.4] - In my opinion, the duty proposed by the Treasurer is rather high. In my notes, I set - down is. per dozen-that is double the - old rate-as a fair duty. The honourable member for Balaclava has stated that the bottling cf oils is' not an industry. He should remember that bottle-making in Victoria is a very considerable industry, and one which may be increased to a very large extent. Recently I visited a local factory, where I saw bottles being made. I thought it was a very good thing to see so much bottle-making carried on in the community. If the bottling of oil is encouraged, it will lead, not only to bottlemaking, but also to case-making and packing. If is all these little things which go to make up a great industry. It is of no use to speak of one large industry. Only by having a multitude of industries can we do good to Australia; and if we can, by means of this Tariff, cause oil to be bottled here, we shall be doing good for at least one Australian industry and providing means of employment for a large number of people",43
423,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Nepean) [6.6] - I wish to ask the Treasurer whether he is going to be consistent in regard to.olive oil? When we were dealing with the duties affecting iron and steel, the Treasurer stated that where a bounty was granted, the duty would not operate at the same time. I remind the Treasurer that in the Bounties Bill we have provided for a bounty on olive oil. To be consistent with his former .statement, he should provide that the duty on olive oil shall not operate at the same time.",43
424,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [6.7] The increase of duty proposed is based upon the analogy of the differentiation between bulk and bottled beer. On bulk beer, the duty is is. per gallon, and ort beer in bottles, is. 6d. per gallon. The analogy holds good in regard to oil.",43
425,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [6.8] - May I point out to the honourable member for Bendigo that the difference in duty between bulk beer and bottled beer is 50 per cent. In this case, the difference is much more than that. The duty now proposed is an increase of 300 per cent, on the old duty. It cannot be said that an increase from 6d. per gallon on cotton-seed oil and 3^d. on a lubricating oil, to 3s. per half-pint is an increase of only 50 per cent. It has been suggested to me that there ought to be a preference in favour of Great Britain in this case, and, therefore, I am willing to alter my amendment to make the duty 9d. on thg general Tariff, and 6d. against the United Kingdom. May I ask, also, how far the Committee propose to go with this sort of industry? It would not involve going much further to say that we will not import refined oil, or that we will impose such a duty upon refined oil as to compel it to be refined here.",43
426,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,It would be better - to have a large refining industry.,43
427,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"If the Committee is prepared to say, "" We will make it unprofitable to import refined oil,""' we might by such means establish a refining industry, but we should have the most extraordinary system of protection imposed in any part of the world.",43
428,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The honourable member had better stick to his proposal of 6d. per gallon.,44
429,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Some honourable members desire to give a preference, and, with that end in view, I desire to amend my amendment so as to make the duty od. per gallon in the general Tariff, with a view to inserting 6d. per gallon against imports from the United Kingdom. Amendment amended accordingly.",44
430,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [6.10] - The bottle-making industry is concerned to some extent in the item under discussion. It is useless to impose a higher duty on the imported bottles if we allow bottles to come in free when full of liquid. I do not know whether honourable members are considering what it would mean to the trade of Australia if all the bottles in which commodities are sold were made here. In three States-Victoria , New South Wales, and South Australia-abou t i;8oo hands are employed in the bottle industry, and some hundreds of thousands of pounds are invested in it. The most serious competitor that the industry has to face is the bottle that is imported free with a duty on the contents. Bottle making requires the service of high class mechanics. If all the bottles used in Australia were manufactured here, there would be work for thousands more artisans. . In the first place, work would be provided in bottling commodities if they were imported in bulk and bottled for the market in Australia. The printing of labels and the making of cases would also involve the employment of a large amount of labour. Honourable members know that many men have been thrown out of employment in the printing trade through the introduction of the linotype. We have here an opportunity of increasing employment in the printing trade, ancl so absorbing the services of many of these unemployed workmen. I see no reason why the making of oils should not become an important industry' in Australia. of the oils which honourable members opposite laughed at when we were dealing with, the Bounties Bill, such as peanut oil and sunflower seed oil, are of great commercial value, and might just as well be manufactured in this country. I realise that the temper of the 'Committee has led to the reduction of duties, but I trust that in this instance a truly protective duty will be imposed for the benefit of those who are manufacturing oils in Australia.",44
431,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [6.15] - The argument of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat was that so many commodities are brought out in bottles that there is so much less work for those engagedin the bottle-making industry in this country. Why, then, does not the honourable member propose that articles which are sold in bottles shall be imported only in bulk? If his concern is simply for the use of Australian-made 'bottles, I make this suggestion to him-that if the bottle trade is beings injured, as he makes out, the wav to get over the difficulty is to insert in the Tariff a proviso that imported oils must come out in bulk. Why should I vote for a high duty which would not do what the honourable member wants? I think that the honourable member for North Sydney made out a good case, and I do not see any necessity for a high rate of duty on oil. We can consider what is necessary for the bottle industry when we deal with the item affecting bottles. I admit with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that the trade is a very large one, and I also remember that there is a bottle factory in my own electorate. In fact, there is hardly, anything worth having in Australia that is not made in my electorate. Its-representative"" is, in himself, a very good sample of what can be produced there. However, the ""bottleho"" argument has really nothing to do with the case, and I must support the honourable member for North Sydney's amendment.",44
432,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Macquarie) [6.1.8] - I wish to raise a protest against this new duty upon goods which we do not, and, I think, cannot, make here. There is a duty on bottles which will have to be considered hereafter, and I am prepared to protect the bottle-making industry as far as is reasonable. But we make no castor oil in Australia, nor do we make many of the other oils which are affected by this duty. I will support a duty of 2s. per gallon on olive oil. I take it that we can so devise Some the Tariff as to make duties apply to bottles and not to their contents. I shall not vote for a duty on goods which cannot be manufactured in Australia, unless it can be made plain to me that there is not another way of getting a duty on bottles. But I fail to see that there is no other wav. I should think that the Trade and Customs Department ought to be able to conceive of a means of imposing a duty on bottles without touching their contents. Minister will explain whether there is such a means, I should like to hear him.",44
433,Mr WATSON,Unknown,South Sydney) [6.20]. - I think that the honourable member for Macquarie is labouring under a misapprehension. He says that he is prepared to vote for a duty on olive oil.,45
434,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,There is not enough olive oil produced; it is difficult to get pure olive oil anywhere.,45
435,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"That is a reason why we should penalize those who sell other oil as olive oil. We have in Australia large areas capable of producing sufficient olive oii to meet the world's demand. In some parts of New South Wales, including my old electorate, olives are grown to perfection. The honourable member for Macquarie has, I think, overlooked the fact that if we abolish the duty on bottled olive oil it would be unfair to impose a duty on olive oil in bulk, because those who at present import oil in bulk and bottle it in Australia would thus be placed at a disadvan' tage.",45
436,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,It is not proposed to abolish the duty on olive oil in bottles.,45
437,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable member for Macquarie indicated that he was in f a vour of its abolition.,45
438,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Not in the case of the oil. I asked the Government to distinguish, but they have bungled the whole thing. Mr WATSON. - I was referring, not to olive oil in bulk, but to what might be imported in bottles as olive oil. Manv people in Australia are employed in bottling these oils.",45
439,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,How many are employed in pouring bulk oil into bottles?,45
440,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I cannot say; but a great many people are so employed in factories in Svdney and Melbourne that' I have visited. The question is not confined, as the honourable member for Balaclava seemed to suggest, to the pouring of imported oil into imported .bottles.",45
441,Mr WYNNE,Unknown,I did not say bottles were imported.,45
442,Mr WATSON,Unknown,In many cases the bottles are made in Sydney and Melbourne.,45
443,Mr HARPER,Unknown,Then there are the labels.,45
444,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The labels, the cases, and the cartons, which are made locally.",45
445,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,And the cases are often made out of imported timber ,45
446,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The majority of the' If the cases usedin Sydney are made from timber grown on the north coast of that State.,45
447,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,And we must not forget the corks and the sealing-wax!,45
448,Mr WATSON,Unknown,All these things combined tend to give employment to a large number of people.,45
449,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,And that was done under the old Tariff.,45
450,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I am aware of that. I think it is a mistake to assume that we have before us in this case merely a question of pouring imported oil into imported bottles. Bottles are made very largely in Australia., and if we allow these oils in bottles in at a very low duty that trade will disappear.  pears to me that we have in this case an instance of protection run mad. The honourable member for South Sydney seems to be particularly anxious about the bottlemaking industry.",45
451,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"We shall deal later on with the item of bottles.  the bottle industry, why. these hysterics about the bottles used in the olive oil trade ? The imported olive oil and castor oil in general use is bottled in the Old Country by Morton and Company. A poor man wanting a penny bottle of ink has now to pay an extra penny for it, because a duty of i d . has been placed on the bottle.",45
452,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"That is not the question. Would it not be a good idea, Mr Chairman, for the honourable member to confine himself to the question ?  ber takes up the cudgels on behalf of any proposal, I am satisfied that there is something in it, but I think it would be monstrous to put an extra penny duty on every bottled package. Like the honourable member for Macquarie,: I prefer that some of these oils should come in free, and I shall divide the Committee on the question. I fai l to.see how the bottle industry in the honourable member for South Sydney's electorate will be affected by this item.",45
453,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The honourable that the member's eyesight is bad.  does not say that when I vote with him. I am afraid that, like the Treasurer, I am getting one-eyed so far as many items are concerned. How will it be possible for the importers to put these oils on the market? If they have to import the oil in.bulk, they will have to erect refineries out here. When I ask for a bottle of olive oil or for a bottle of castor oil, I am prepared to take only that put up by Morton and Company.",45
454,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The best olive oil in the world is made in South Australia.  bottle it here; they send i't Home in bulk, and it is imported in bottles.",46
455,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No ; olive oil bottled in South Australia can be obtained.  grease my buggy wheels. I fail to see how it can be said that this proposal will be interference with the bottle-making trade, the printing industry, and the great gum and cork industries.",46
456,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The honourable member must not discuss the merits of other industries.  South Svdney was allowed to do so.,46
457,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"He made merely an incidental reference to other industries.  more, and I certainly do not wish to dishit obey your ruling.",46
458,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7-45 p.m.,46
459,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parrimattaj wished [7.45] - The honourable member for South Sydney made some allusion to an industry of this kind carried on in his old electorate. I presume that the honourable member was referring to the State Agricultural Farm ""Wagga Wagga. I know of no other place in the district where olives are grown. think it may be said of that establishment, and of every place in Australia where olives are grown, that those engaged in the culby tivation of the olive manufacture the oil and do their own bottling as well. These duties represent a deliberate attempt to separate the processes followed in the proof duction of olive oil. The bottling is much a part of the production of olive oil for commercial purposes as is the growth of the olives for the manufacture of the oil.",46
460,Mr CARR,Unknown,"It is all done in South Ausductive tralia, and the duty would not affect it .",46
461,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"My point is the mere bottling of oil. that, in order to make the production of the oil as economical as possible, the processes are not separated anywhere where olive oil is produced. Here it is proposed to sepafrom rate them with the object of few men work. This would necessarily make the production of the oil more pensive, and raise the cost to the consumer. The Government proposal aims at someto thing against which those who believe that we should make all these things for ouraway. selves should specially set their faces. Anything which leads to expensive production cannot ultimately benefit those engaged in an industry, whether as workers or as employers. I think we should oppose this duty if for no other reason than to try to force the producers of olive oil to undertake the whole of the processes necessary to place it on the market. If the object in imposing the duties proposed is to compel to people not to import oil in bottles, we might go further, and insist that oil. iman ported in large bottles should be taken out of them ancl bottled again in smaller bottles. Let honourable members consider for a moment how that would encourage the bottling industry.",46
462,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"If we compelled engines to be imported in the form of pig iron, that would give more work.",46
463,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Quite so; and one might multiply instances of the kind indefinitely. I am not quite sure that the honourable member for Balaclava did not the nail on the head when he suggested that the proper analogy was the sinking of holes for the purpose of filling them up again in order to create work. If we really to make work for the bottle-makers of Australia, perhaps the shortest way would be to smash all the bottles we have here at present. There would be just as much sense in that as the method selected at by the Government for purposes of taxation in this instance. If the bottle indusI try is to be encouraged by Parliament, let us encourage it in a straightforward way by imposing a duty on bottles, instead of the intricate round-about way proposed by the Government. 1 should like to know whether the Minister intends to adhere to the excessive duties he has proposed. Some the duties submitted are absurdly ""high, as and apparently they have been submitted only on the plea that we should make work for Australians. In this young country, with its boundless resources, virgin soil, and procapacity, we should be able to turn labour into more remunerative channels than I hope the Minister will consent to reduce these duties to a reasonable rate. I think it'would be reasonable to put the duty in paragraph A up 6d. to 9d. instead of to is. 6d., as 4 giving a proposed by the Minister.",46
464,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Macquarie) [7-50] - 1 exdo not think there is much in the point raised by the honourable member as applied South Australian oils, because in that State the oil produced is bottled straight I have no objection to the imposition of a duty on olive oil, because we can make enough locally to supply the whole of Australia. My trouble with the Government is that I think there should be no discrimination in the duty levied as to bottles. The duty should be levied on bottles as bottles, without respect to what they contain. am as anxious to cultivate the industry of bottle-making as is the honourable member for South Sydney, and as anxious to impose a duty on oils that can be produced here, but I am opposed to a revenue duty on mere oils. If we were given an opportunity to deal with bulk importations first, we should know where we were. I do not object to the imposition of a substantial duty on the importation in, bulk of oils that we can make in Australia, or to a reasonable duty on bottles as bottles, which, 'of course, would affect everything imported in bottles. I ask the Government to reconsider the form in which they have submitted these duties, and give honourable members an opportunity to cast an intelligent vote.",46
465,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [7.54] - I am getting tired of this subject, but I think we might effect a compromise.

492,Mr CARR,Unknown,"The honourable member said that he did not know of any that produced here. However, I may inform honourable members that . a considerable quantity of lubricating mineral oil is prois duced in Australia. One company in my electorate is producing this oil from sene shale, and several other companies likely to be soon in operation. Several large leases of shale country, comprising some 20,000 acres each, have been taken up in the Blue Mountains district, and the enterprise the kind. is likelv to supply all the oil required in this country. The Commonwealth Oil Company turns out black and blue oils, which are equivalent to solar, residual, lubricating oils, to the amount of about 3,000,000 gallons per annum, and it hoped that that output will be increased 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 gallons of this or the beginning of next year. Such enterprise is entitled to some ration when we are - dealing with the Tariff; and the present duty. I may say, is not sufficient to deter foreign manufacrailway; turers from dumping their product here. The local manufacturers are quite satisfied with the price of from is. 3d. to 2S. per gallon, but there is always ' a danger that ' when they come into competition, the foreign manupleading facturers may cut prices. Specific have been brought under my notice, in which local companies have lost tenders this cutting on the part of ducers; ancl this has gone on to such an extent that the position has seriously considered. The Standard Oil Company, and the companies and other places, are able to produce so cheaply that they can afford to cut prices. I'wish to emphasize the point are not cut in the ordinary way of business, but only when these foreign manufacturers are called upon to tender against local people. If these oil deposits are to be developed, our own peo- - free,"" ple must be protected against unfair competition; because, if the foreign producers succeed in disabling the local industry, the people of Australia ultimately have to pay the piper. In my opinion, nothing less than 6d. per gallon will be of any material assistance; and a duty would not have the effect of ing the price to the consumer"". All that port the duty. the local producers desire is to be assured oil of the local market at present rates. I may say that the total importation into Australia is about 4,000,000 gallons of heavy oils, including lubricating, solar, was and residual oils and spirit such as naphtha, benzine, and motor spirit. It will thus be seen that our output of oil "" now nearly equal to Australia's requirements, and will greatly exceed that quankerotity a few months hence. The honourable are member for Kalgoorlie seemed to think that the manufacture of lubricating mineral oils in Australia is a negligible quantity.",49

494,Mr CARR,Unknown,"The honourable member referred to the industry as practically non-existent; but I suppose he is making a and special plea on behalf of the miners of Western Australia. I may say that the is oil companies in my electorate employ to some 1,300 men, and pay about £13,000 at the end in wages every month.",49

Kerosene is very largely used in nearly every household in the country, and oil of the best quality must be obtained. It may be very well to suggest that one oil is as good as another, but in my own household they will not use any but the best oil, because inferior oil gives off a smoke which is objectionable from a health point of view, and blackens the ceilings. In my opinion, a duty of 3d. per gallon on oil imported in tins containing less than 10 gallons would not secure the object in view. The effect of that duty will be that the Standard Oil Trust will import its oil in bulk, with the result that there will be a diminution of the labour employed here in connection with its landing and distribution.",51
529,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"There is more employment given in the handling of the cases than would be created by the tinning and the casing of the oil here.  If more oil were imported in bulk, less employment would be given locally.

It may be all very well for places like Sydney or Melbourne to have oil brought in bulk; but in places like Fremantle and Brisbane, it is more mesmerize convenient to have it brought in tins, because it enables vessels to come with a part cargo of kerosene and loaded up with other goods on which only reasonable freights are charged, because of the profit made on the carriage of the kerosene. The honorre- able member for Macquarie spoke about voting for the duty because oil is produced here, but his figures were somewhat confusing. He said that there are 1,300 men emwill ployed by the Commonwealth Oil Company.

I shall vote to make kerosene duty free.",51
535,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [8.46] - The party to which I belong has always voted against the imposition of duties on kerosene and tea, because those commodities are so largely used by the working classes. I am entirely opposed to increasing the taxation of those who can least afford to pay taxes. I feel convinced that the imposition of a duty .of 3d. per gallon on o i l imported in tins will not make that oil any dearer to the people of Australia. It will, as a matter of fact, lessen its price. Of course, some honourable members laugh at this statement, but they laugh,, too, when evidence is produced showing that the effect of duties upon goods which can be manufactured here has been, by increasing the local competition, to lower prices. We, in Australia, know of the wide ramifications of the great Standard Oil Trust, which has now such a hold upon the kerosene trade of the world that it can dictate to buyers and sellers alike the conditions under which this commodity must be traded in. Until within the last seven years the Trust had no competitor in Australia. I have little sympathy with the British Imperial Oil Trust, whether it is or is not run by the Rothschilds. But if the two trusts are sharks it is better to keep them employed in Australia fighting each other than to give the whole field to one of them. No doubt I may lose votes by supporting the duty on oil imported in tins; but that consideration weighs little with me when I know my cause to be just. We have been told that less employment will be given if oil be imported in bulk than is given now, when it is brought here in tins; but it is not necessary to disprove a statement of that kind. My common sense tells me that twice, if not three times, as much employment will be given in Australia if .the oil comes here in bulk, to be tinned and cased locally, than is given now, when it comes in tins. The representatives of Western Australia are opposed to this duty, but apparently they are not aware that the Standard Oil Company charges 50 per cent, more for kerosene in Western Australia than in Victoria. 'But if the proposed duty is imposed, and the British-Imperial Oil Company opens works at Fremantle, the price of the Standard Oil Company's oil will be reduced to meet the competition. .While the Standard oil is now being sold in Victoria at 8s. a case, it is sold in Western Australia for anything between 10s. and 12s. a case.",52

Honourable members are very ready to profess themselves eager to reduce the price of kerosene in the interests of the poor worker; but I ask free-traders, who say that competition is the soul of business, whether prices will not be lower with competition in the field than if , by the taking off of the duty, it is brought to an end?",52
540,Mr EDWARD S,Unknown,"Oxley) [8.53] - When the last Tariff was before the House, every member of the Labour Party tried manfully to bring about what was termed a free breakfast table, and to secure the free importation of kerosene; but on this occasion none of them has raised his voice in the interests of the working man. They appear to have lost all concern in him. The imposition of a paltry duty of 3d. per gallon has been proposed to protect a local industry, it is said. But it will have no such effect. If the local industry is to be protected, the duty must be much higher. As a matter of factr kerosene should be admitted duty free. No class uses more kerosene than does the working class, and it will have to pay this duty, if it be imposed.",52

There"" is a quantity of sulphate of lead which is simply a cheap by-product, and has been manufactured in Australia. I have here a letter from a firm, who tell me that they themselves in years gone by, made about 300 tons of it ; but they admit that it was an article that was altogether inferior to genuine white lead, and that, if supplied to. the public of Great Britain as such, a breach of the law would be committed.",56

599,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"A lot of these paints are ground in water, and there is no duty I * Sir JOHN QUICK - I am referring to the duties on oil and white lead. Paint cannot be built up without those elements. The paint manufacturers who came before the Tariff Commission in the various States said in effect, "" If you give us our raw materials free, we shall not ask for a duty; but since there are very heavy duties on our raw materials ""-and it is most desirable that there should be duties on them in . that their production may be encouraged- "" we must have a heavier duty on the finished article, and more particularly upon the superior paints."" Some of is them said that they did not desire as heavy specia duty on the common grades as they sought on the superior grades, having zinc a base. This Tariff does not discriminate between the two classes; it merely imbut poses duties upon paints ground in oil, and paints completely prepared. If we wish to promote the production of linseed oil and to develop the white lead industry, as well fine as the production of various colours, we be must have these duties. If we break down the first paragraph, the whole scheme will a collapse. It is most desirable that linseed oil-and the beginning of its production in Australia is not far distant-shoul d not be free; if it is we shall not be able to enter upon its production, in commercial quantities. I recognise that a duty on it imposes a burden on the painting trade ; but it may be only a temporary one; and when we have^established the industry of producing linseed oil in Australia we shall be able to make a pro ratd reduction in the duty on the complete article. The production of white lead in Australia is progressing, but local prejudice has to be combated.",57

He produced some of his colours to the Commission, and we were satisfied that large and valuable deposits existed, not only in South Australia, but in other parts of the Commonwealth. We have drawn up a scheme providing for a duty on those colours, and placing on the free list colours not produced in Australia, such as Vandykes, manganese, Letharge blacks, Paris white and vermillions.

609,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [0.37] - I was. under the impression that Victoria, in preFederation days, was a pronounced protectionist State, and as such, one would' have expected to find that under its Tariff paints were heavily protected. I learn r however, that under that Tariff, they were dutiable at 40s. per ton., or 2s. per cwt.",58
610,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"At that time, we had not tried to make it.",58
611,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"The honourable member has a ready excuse. Victoria did not awaken to the importance of the paint manufacturing industry when it was at the height of its protectionist boom. Prior to Federation, New South Wales was accustomed to have these, and cognate items, on the free list; whilst Queensland had a duty of 3s. per cwt.; South Australia a duty of 2s. per cwt., and of 4s. per cwt. in the case of the made-up articles; Tasmania, a duty of Jd. per lb.; and Western Australia a duty of .10 per cent. Under the first Federal Tariff, the duty under this item was 2s. per cwt., and the Government now propose to raise it to 4s. 6d. on foreign imports, and to 4s. per cwt. or> imports from Great Britain. Having enjoyed for five years an increase of 200 per cent, on the old Victorian Tariff, paint manufacturers here, instead, of being able to show that their industry is a flourishing one, are asking for more protection, and the Treasurer offers them a still further increase of 250 per cent The honourable member for Bendigo says that these proposals have been very carefully considered, and I must certainly admit that the paint manufacturers have been. most carefully considered. But what about those who use paint? To my mind, the honourable member for Bendigo gave away his case when he said that the excessive dnties upon the raw materials of the paint-making industry, made it necessary to impose a high duty on the finished article. That being so, this cannot be called a scientific Tariff.",58
612,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,We have not yet dealt with the duty on white lead: .,58
613,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"No ; and that is one of the basic elements of paint. The honourable member for Lang has touched the real point at issue. If we impose this heavy duty upon the finished article, we shall severely tax the coachpainter and others who use paints of this kind. In the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, appears the following startling statement in regard to the local manufacture of white lead, which the honourable member for Bendigo says we ought -.to encourage. The manager of a paint and oil company in Sydney had seen samples of were said to have been manufactured in Sydiney. They 'could not compare with the imported article so far as colour was concerned. Locally produced white lead turned yellow after standing a given time, while the imported article keeps its colour much longer. The defect did not lie in the local lead or zinc, but in manufacture, which, in his opinion, experience would tend to remedy. The Committee are asked to place duty on prepared paints, so that in the days to come, an improved white lead the produced in Australia. I believe that the proper way to encourage the manufacof ture of paint would be to place linseed oil, white lead, and the other raw masene, terials of the industry,, either on the Jist or under as low a duty as possible. have many sides to my character as a polileave tician, and I happen to have in my elecAlthough torate the largest paint manufactory in Commonwealth. Nevertheless, I do not lowest duty. ask for a duty upon prepared paint, but I would assist the industry in the way I have indicated. The honourable member for advertently .Lang very reasonably asks the Treasurer t'o'revert to the duty imposed under the 1902 Tariff. Surelv the Prime Minister could not have agreed to an increase of 250 per cent, on that duty. when he knows that in protectionist Victoria, in the palmiest days of protection, no more than 2s. was asked. The honourable member for Lang proposes a duty of 25 per cent, in excess that duty, and I must say that it is rather rash of the honourable member as trader to make such a oroposal. . Mr JOHNSON - I make it only because do. not think I could carry a lower duty.",58

He went on to that he had seen good white lead made think in Australia. In a circular, which no doubt honourable members have received,, speaking of Vosz and Company, of which likely to be he is manager, he savsWe have during the last twelve months spent in land, buildings, and plant at Port Adelaide, and have now an up-to-date plant for the manufacture of all classes of paint and white lead, and the duties as fixed in the last give us more encouragement for manufacture than the previous Tariff. Our industry promises to be a most important and w'e are gradually increasing our output. We find the prejudice against the Colonial article gradually disappearing as the public discover they can get an article equal to imported at lower rates. . . . We believe that we are at present the only white lead corroders in Australia, and are now turning out a product in every way equal to the imported article, and during the next month or so we wil l be able to place on the market quantities. There is fierce competition in this line, and there should be a big industry open for Australia. In view of these facts' I am warranted in believing that the honourable member for Lang will take the first opportunity fo apologize to Mr Clarkson for having attributed to him the statement that the demand in Australia was so small as not to warrant the employment of skilled men in .the industry. Mr Clarkson, in his circular, goes on to say, We purchase our raw material from Broken Hill , and the duty, as now fixed, gives us a margin in which to meet foreign competition. We put a duty on linseed oil, one of the raw materials of this industry, and we should now complete the scheme proposed by the Tariff Commission, and enable white lead to be successfully manufactured in the Commonwealth. As to other colours, a variety is produced at the Blumberg mine, South Australia, and in various parts of the Commonwealth. The secretary to the Blumberg mine, Mr O'Connell, gave pretty lengthy evidence before the Commission as to the necessity for a duty to enable the company to compete against wealthy British companies. The industry is well worth establishing, and will undoubtedly be established in every State in the Commonwealth. There is therefore no likelihood of a monopoly in the manufaccontradiction. ture of paints. There will be pretty fierce local competition, and instead of prices being increased for more than a very temtralian porary period, it is almost certain that the result of the building up of the dustry here, prices will be kept very lower than they would be. likely should the industry be crushed out, as it Sir, would be if these duties are not imposed.  of the large increase of duty proposed over your the rate in .the former Tariff on this item, and the important part that paints play in matters concerning the welfare of the suitable people, I desire to bring under notice two letters which I have received. The first is sion, from the.firm of Wm. Young and Comits pany, Melbourne, who state- In spite of some hysterical articles in our local press, we can confidently assert that genuine white lead as recognised in Great Britain is not yet an article of manufacture here. A - quantity of sulphate of lead, which is a cheap by-product, has been manufactured here-w e ourselves in years gone by have utilized about 300 tons of the same. It is an article altogether inferior in covering power to genuine white lead, and, if offered to the public in Great Britain as such, would be a breach of the law.",60
633,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"That is a slander on the Australian product. The honourable member ought not to read such slanders.  ""me, and I quote it in good faith. It is a matter of the utmost importance, in the case of an expensive item so widely used, that we should have an article of good quality. The other letter comes from the Melbourne Steamship Company and the Duke's Dock and Engineering Company, and deals with ships' paints.",61
634,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"That question comes under paragraph B.  letter later. I do notsay that the Australian paint is inferior, but I know that it makes a great deal of difference to people who go to large expense in renovating buildings or putting up new structures if they use a paint that will stand the weather. An inferior paint is absolutely worse than useless. It has a bad' effect upon the property, it is a disappointment all round, and we should not by any legislative means seek to force its use upon the people of this country.",61

Victoria, as followsI have now to report that .the sample of lead for a white - paint, left after an interview, on instructions, by the Australian White Lead Company, was analyzed and proved to contain within 0.3 of being pure. The sulphate of lead, that is the result of their process, is a very substance for a paint, and. is produced . under conditions favouring a fine state of diviand that quite forbid the presence of free sulphuric acid. Tests were made to discover covering power, as compared with that of the best white lead obtainable in Melbourne; it was tested for any foreign - material, such as baryta, and was found to be pure. T w o ' sets of comparative tests were made, and measured quantities of the oils, & c , employed in the paints, were taken in each test. The paint was employed upon wooden' surfaces and upon glass, in order to see the actual body of the coating when dry. One set was with boiled linseed oil, and the other with raw linseed o i l, all other things being equal, and that the covering power of the resulting paint was nearly equal in the two cases for whiteness and body, the balance being still rather phate of lead, as against the white lead of commerce, which is, as is well known, a basic carbonate. I quote that as a refutation of the slanders which have been circulated.",61
636,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne. Ports) [10.5] - All the manufacturers like to get their raw material free, but unfortunately in practically every instance the raw material of one industry is the finished article of another. The question of paints and their constituent parts is so complicated that it is hard to discover what is really the basic raw material. The worse of it is that each manufacturer concerned wants his raw material free, and each condemns the Australian-made raw maferial, saying, "" I have to compete with the rest of the world in the Australian market, and must get the best material to use. in producing my manufactured article. Therefore, I must import it."" The manufacturer of white lead in Australia assures us, and backs up his assurance with a certificate, quoted by the honourable member for Bendigo, from a gentleman duly qualified to express an opinion, that the article which he is producing is as good as, if not superior to, the imported - white lead. Unfortunately, the man who uses white lead in making paint, being interested, condemns the Australian white lead. He says, "" I want imported colouring material if I . am to give my customers the paints which they demand. I must also have imported white lead."" The manufacturer of colours in Australia shows us that he* is quite competent to produce the best' colours, having men here who are qualified through experience in other parts of the world. The honourable member for Lang stated that it was impossible to make these colours in Australia. He enumerated all the colours of the rainbow, from elephant's breath to boiled mutton, and told us that they could not be made here. But first-class pigments are produced in South Australia. I am not surprised at 1 the honourable member"" for Lang making that statement, because he is a free-trader - a foreign representative. Mr JOHNSON.'-I have protested several times against the application to me of the epithet of ""foreign representative."" It is offensive, and I ask-that it be withdrawn. I do not apply, offensive epithets of that character, to .honourable members opposite. I am just as much an Australian representative as is the honourable member-perhaps , in favour of the sulalittle more.",62
637,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I ask the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to withdraw the remark which the. honourable member for Lang regards as offensive. Mr MATHEWS,-If the remark is offensive to the honourable member for Lang,. I withdraw it without qualification. I was not speaking.in a personal but merely in a political sense. In spite of what the honourable member for Lang says, there is ar* establishment in my electorate which is producingfirst-classcolours. I am sure to be asked whether there are any of these'works* in mv electorate. That is getting rather a. by-word now, but I have voted for the protection of industries.that are not in myelectorate, and I shall certainly .support those that are. That .firm have imported a man who has had twenty-five years' experience in England. They can produce any of the colours which the honourable member for Lang says are not made here. They turn out good commercial commodities, which are on the market at the present day. B.ut it is essential, in order that they may keen them upon the. market, that they should have some protection. There are certain portions of their ra w material which they have to import, and., seeing that there is a duty on that, it is necessary that they should get a duty on their manufactured article, which, in its turn, is the raw material of another industry, so that they may compete with imported articles. Then the house or coach painter,, who uses paints, wants his;'raw material as cheaply as possible. The coachbuilder isstrongly protected- I have many in my electorate-7-and yet he will send us documents to show'that we must not ask him to use the Australian article. But the very argument that we have to .adduce to get himto use it, is the one which we have to urge, in order to get the Australian public to use the finished article which he produces. So that we find the same difficulty all along the line. It matters little to me what the commodity is so long as we can bring the' industry in Australia up to a proper standard. There is no process in the manufacture of white lead, or the making of pigments, or the mixing of paints, that cannot be undertaken here. In the newspapers honourable members will see an advertisement to the' following effect:"" Mixed .paint. 3d. per tin. Don't be prejudiced,- '- 'Buy it and give it a trial.""' That is an imported article. How is it possible to expect our producers of paint to compete with an article of that sort, Which we know does not contain an atom of white lead or of linseed oil ?",62
638,Mr MCDOUGALL,Unknown,What is the condition of the white-lead workers of England ?,63
639,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,It is lamentable in the extreme. One of the arguments used by the producer of white lead in Australia is that the article which he produces is not poisonous.,63
640,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Is not lead, which is the basis of the article, the same in its properties everywhere?",63
641,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The honourable member may know how to use paints when they are mixed, but is he scientist enough to know that lead can be treated in such a way as not to be poisonous ? I am assured by those who run this business in Footscray that their treatment of the lead makes it non-poisonous, and that it has no bad effect upon those who handle it. But the individual who uses the paint says, "" That is the very reason why the Australian article is of no use to us."" They practically say that it is no good because it does not kill those who produce it. On the one hand, we are asked, "" What is the condition of those who manufacture the white lead in England?"" and we answer, "" It is lamentable; they die at ages when they have no right to die."" Then when we say, "" Here is a commodity that will not poison the workers,"" we are told, "" It is useless for our purposes."" We do not expect any assistance from free-traders in this instance, but we desire, and should be able to demand, the votes of all those who came into this House as protectionists. ' Mr JOHNSON (Lang) [io.15] - The honourable member for Boothby accused me of having misrepresented or misquoted the evidence of Mr Clarkson.",63
642,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Withdra w the statement, and apologize. - Mr JOHNSON - I have nothing to withdraw. The (honourable member for Boothby should withdraw his statement, because I did nothing of the kind. I propose to read that evidence a little more fully. I think I fairly gave the sense of what Mr Clarkson said, as the following quotations from his evidence will showWhat increase qf duty do you want-on while ment. Ifead?- I suggested 25 per cent. Jt is at present 2s. per cwt. / What increase would that be?-About 100 per cent. Why do you want such a high increase on lead ?-The reason I suggested it was that it would certainly cost a great deal to 'go in for the manufacture of it, and the necessary experiments, nnd the margin is not large enough. Would not the same argument apply to dry colours, seeing that we have the materials?Yes. But you have all the materials for lead here. You have not all the materials for dry colours. What material is lacking?-There are many colours we have not so far got the natural earths for. Then you have your colours here, but you have not the output. I think that bears out exactly what I said about Mr Clarkson's evidence, though I did give a summary in order to save time.",63
643,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,North Sydney) [10.17] - The honourable member for Bendigo has made what I regard as an unjustifiable attack on the honourable member for Echuca.,63
644,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I was not attacking the honourable member, but the circular he read.",63
645,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The circular said just what the honourable member for Bendigo himself said. Something beyond what the circular said might be inferred, but the fact stated was that the white lead produced here is made from sulphate of lead,- and that it cannot be of as good quality as white lead made - from , carbonate of lead. In that there is no comparison between Australian and British white lead, because the samestatement would apply to the two processes in Great Britain. White lead produced from >sul- phate of lead is,, in the opinion of scientific men, and of users, inferior to white, lead produced from carbonate of lead, wherever it may be produced. That. was. all that was stated in the circular, and it. was the .statement repeated by the honourable member forBendigo later. Every statement of the kind made from this side seems to be twisted into a reflection on Australian .production. There is much tenderness shown in this relation, although, as I have pointed out, the same comparison could be shown ' between the two products in Great Britain.. I do not think that ""there ought to be suchsensitiveness, or such a disposition to turn all criticism into an attack upon Australian productions. The auestion whether, sulphate of lead or carbonate of lead makesthe best white lead is not one involving any. reflection on the Australian product.",63
646,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,That was not the state,63
647,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,That was the statement-that the white lead made in Australia was from sulphate of<.lead.,63
648,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The circular says that Australian white lead is bad, irrespective of its origin.",64
649,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"What the circular says is that Australian white lead is produced from sulphate of lead, and is not equal to lead produced from carbonate of lead. The honourable member for Bendigo confirmed that statement, namely, that the Australian was made from sulphate of lead, and white lead made from sulphate of lead is inferior, in the opinion of most authorities, to white lead made from carbonate of lead, wherever the manufacture may be carried on.",64
650,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,That is not the interpretation which the honourable member for Echuca put on the letter.,64
651,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I did not much. observe that the honourable member for Echuca said anything beyond what was stated in the circular; in fact I heard the honourable member say that he did not know that the white lead produced here was inferior. Whether the opinion expressed, and confirmed by the honourable member for Bendigo, be right or wrong, ' it is the opinion held by those who ought to know best.",64
652,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Divid e !,64
653,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"If honourable members opposite make attacks, they must expect some reply.",64
654,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,There have been some attacks from the other side.,64
655,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I have not heard any attack made by this side on individuals; although there have been attacks made by the other side on individuals on several occasions. I do not mind debate being created in this w a y so long as we have the opportunity to reply; but such debate will not attain what we all desire, namely, an expeditious settlement of the Tariff. The duty recently imposed in New Zealand, under a protective Tariff, is only 2S. 6d., and that is the duty now suggested by the honourable member for Lang.",64
656,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [10.23]. - The question is not whether Australian white lead is made from carbonate of lead or sulphate of lead; the question is as to the quality of the lead and its covering power. The certificate I read showed that, although the Australian white lead is made from, sulphate of lead, and not from carbonate of lead, its covering power, as tested by the Government Metallurgist, is equal to the best white lead obtainable in Melbourne. The question is not the metallic contents, but the covering power.",64
657,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The honourable member for Echuca said nothing to the contrary.,64
658,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The circular that was read said that Australian white lead is of inferior quality, and had not the same covering power as imported white lead. I have here another certificate from the Storekeeper of the Newport Railway Workshops, Melbourne, in which he says The sample of white lead submitted by you' for trial at the Newport workshops has been reported on as follows, viz. :-It is soft and fine, and requires little or no grinding, and, weight for weight, will cover a larger surface than the ordinary dry white lead.",64
659,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [10.25] - The honourable member for Bendigo is, in my opinion, trying to prove too",64
660,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,I should not have risen but for the reading of the circular.,64
661,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have yet to learn that a chemist is necessarily an expert painter.,64
662,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"The report just read was not that of a chemist, but that of the Chief Storekeeper at Newport Workshops.",64
663,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not regard those individual statements as conclusive. First of all, I decline to believe that a metallurgist has necessarily an expert knowledge of the covering qualities of white lead; when he begins to talk about the covering qualities of lead he steps outside his function altogether. The question is one for a practical painter; and experience must be the great teacher - I fancy that covering qualities ultimately depend on the wearing qualities of the lead; that must be the test. So far from the honourable member for Echuca being singular in the quotation he made to-night, and in the views to which he gave utterance, I have to say that a practical ironmonger, a friend of mine in Sydney- a man of the highest integrity, who has been selling white lead all his life-expresse d the same opinion.",64
664,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Accordin g to the honourable member's own showing, that man cannot know anything about the covering qualities of white lead.",64
665,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I suppose the evidence of this man is worth just as much as that of any other man connected with the business.. Is it suggested that these statements are made out of sheer wantonness? Honourable members ought not to attack people for making statements in all good faith. We are 'here to discuss these matters, and not to abuse one another. I have never witnessed a more savage attack than that made' on the honourable member for Echuca; but I fancy he will be able to live through it all, and, perhaps, ultimately benefit.",64
666,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,North Sydney) [10.28] - Mr MCDonald,65
667,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Honourable members opposite are talking like a lot of children ! Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - I would not describe the action of the Treasurer in such favourable terms as those in which he has described ours. The honourable member for Bendigo questions what was stated in the circular quoted by the honourable member for Echuca, and I now desire to read the following sentences In spite of some hysterical articles in our local press, we can confidently assert that genuine white lead, as recognised in Great Britain, is not yet an article of manufacture here. A quantity of sulphate of lead, which is a cheap by-product, has been manufactured here-we , ourselves, in years gone by have made about 300 tons of the same. It is an article altogether inferior in covering power to genuine white leadand if offered to the public in Great Britain as such, would be a breach of the law. That is all the circular says.",65
668,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,It does not happen to be true. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - What is not true?,65
669,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The statement that good white lead is not made in Australia. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - I am not raising that question; I am only pointing out that the letter states that white lead made from sulphate of lead is inferior to white lead made from carbonate of lead, and that that is an opinion confirmed by the highest authorities.",65
670,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Corio) [10.30] - The honourable member for North Sydney has stated that he does not know that Australian, white lead is used for painting purposes. In my opinion the honourable member has not distinguished between metallic lead and white lead. I would point out to him that in the report of the A section of the Tariff Commission the following statement is madeIn November, 1904, the Victorian Public Works Department specified that Australianin made white lead could be used in their tracts. At that time metallic 3d. per ton, and instead of a percentage rise in the price of white lead, owing to the increased! cost of the. raw 'material there reduction of over £ 3 per ton. I challenge honourable members opposite to refute that statement. I should like to hear what the honourable member for Echuca has to say concerning it. He seems to think that nothing made in Australia can possiblv be equal in quality to what is made elsewhere.  I have never made any such statement as that attributed to me, and I ask that it be withdrawn.",65
671,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"As the honourable member regards the remark as offensive, probablv the honourable member for Corio will withdraw it.",65
672,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I should like to know what is regarded as offensive.  an objection to everything that is Australian.,65
673,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I do not regard that statement as an offensive one. It is a fair deduction to make from the honourable member's attitude in this chamber.,65
674,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"If the honourable member for Corio insists upon the statement, it is not possible for me to compel him to withdraw it. But when an honourable member takes exception to a statement made by another honourable member it has been customary for the author of the statement, as a matter of oourtesy, to withdraw it.",65
675,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Then it is a custom which I do not intend to observe on this occasion. I am sorry that the honourable member for Echuca does not like it , and I ask him not to regard my statement as offensive.",65
676,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Will the honourable member proceed?  surrender, sir.",65
677,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"The honourable member for North Sydney has declared that it is not white lead, but metallic lead, which is used in Australia. I hope that he is not super-sensitive, like the honourable member for Echuca",65
678,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,I shall not resrard anything which the honourable member' may say as offensive.,65

682,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [10.35] - 1 propose to read some statements in regard to this item which are contained in the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, and which eclipse anything that has been said to-night by the honourable member for Echuca.. That section of the Commission summarizes the evidence of a gentleman named Finlayson.",66
683,Mr WILKS,Unknown,I quoted that summary this evening.,66
684,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Then there is no need for me to refer to it again. A few minutes ago the honourable member for Bendigo rose to repel a slander. Why, then, did he incorporate the slander in his own report?",66
685,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,He referred only to the white lead which is made in Sydney.,66
686,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Of course there is a difference between the white lead which is made in Sydney and that which is made in Victoria? It is a slander to reflect upon anything made in Victoria, but quite proper to do so in respect of anything made in Sydney. Have we reached that point? The whole thing is absurd. Amendment negatived.

To show how this double-barrelled duty works out on paints prepared for use, let me quote the following letterInvoice for coach paints just to hand, contents of which are 168 lbs. at the 6s. o,d. per cwt. rate will' make the duty ios. 2d., while under the 25 per cent, rate, it brings the duty up to 38s. 5a., and another lot, weighing 98 lbs.', at the specific rate the duty would come lo something like 6s., while under the ad valorem duty, the duty comes to 60s. 6d. The figures speak for themselves. I have The duty on a certain high-class and highpriced paint imported from England, has been increased, with the result that, instead of having to pay 4s. per cwt., which equals 8d. per gallon, it has to pay 20 per cent., plus io per cent., which.equals 4s. i d . gallon. Under the old Tariff, this paint was so expensive that it could be used only in good work, such as railway cars, hospitals, ships, & c , and the new dutypractical ly prohibits its use. I hope that. the Minister will consent tp a large reduction. I shall support the proposed amendment of the honourable member for Dalley.",67

712,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,That is on the higher grade of paints.,68
713,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Yes ; but the percentage on the cheaper paints is very much higher than the percentage on the per dearer paints. I do not like these alternative duties, because attempts wifl be made to evade them. In the case of paints it will be quite impossible in many cases to distinguish them. Where there are great variations in value, as there are in many cases, the Customs officers will have great difficulty in distinguishing them. I would far rather see a fixed duty, even at the higher amount proposed by the honourable member for Bendigo, than the duty previously proposed. I shall not raise any objection to the amendment of the honfor orable member for Bendigo, but I propose to move the omission of the duties of 25 and 20 per cent. Amendments agreed to. Amendment (by Mr DUGALD THOMSON) proposed - That the words "" a d val.

714,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"If the Minister sees no objection to that amendment, I shall not oppose it.",68
715,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Trea surer) [11.4] - I prefer to see the words retained, because the duties are intended to affect, not the cheaper grades of paints, but the higher grades. It was recommended by the A section of the Tariff Commission that the duty on British imports should be 6s. per cwt., or 20 per cent.",68
716,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,But the honourable member for Bendigo now says that if the Minister does not object to my amendment he will not.,68
717,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not mind the duty beingfixedat 20 per cent, in each column.",68
718,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Gwydir) [11.5] - I think that the Treasurer should reduce the ad valorem rates to 20 and 15 per cent, respectively. If he will agree to that reduction it will cover the cases which he has in his mind. But Mr WYNNE (Balaclava) [11.6] - As the old duty of 4s. has - been increased to 6s., it means a duty of £ f i a ton. That, I think, ought to be sufficient protection on any class of paint. To my mind, it is a very big charge. I do not know what 'paint is worth, but I should think that £ 2 0 would be a very good price. On that value a duty of £ 6 a ton would be equal to 20 per cent. It is a most difficult thing for any person to assess the value bf these articles. Preferably I would support a fixed duty on' all things, because it does away with any inducement to commit a fraud. If we impose an ad valorem duty and a fixed duty, it will only encourage persons to undervalue their goods, whereas if we impose a fixed duty only they will know exactly what they have to pay, and there will be no inducement to commit a fraud.",68
719,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Bendigo) [11.8] I would point out to the honourable member for North Sydney that if his amendment be negatived, the duty of 25 per cent, will stand, although the Treasurer has offered to reduce it to 20 per cent.",69

798,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I appreciate that. From the statement of the Minister I understand that liquid' removers are composed of of turpentine and'similar things. If of that is so, I do not see that any great trouble will ensue if we do what has been suggested.",74

From what I can hear, it is an extremelv simple The Tariff Commission made no recommendation on this head. No one has asked for a duty to be imposed,, and at the most the Minister has said that it is of a Ministerial recommendation. In those circumstances I do not think that we need worry very much about the matter, but . I suggest to the honourable member for Parramatta that he might accept the Minister's proposal to make the duty 5 P <* ttee. in the general Tariff, and to admit British imports free, as it approximates to his idea.",74
