0,NA,Unknown,"Tuesday, 13 September 2016 The SPEAKER (Hon. Tony Smith) took the chair at 12:00, made an acknowledgement of country and read prayers. NA Privilege Petitions The SPEAKER (12:01): I have three short statements to make before we go to government business. The first relates to the seizure of material under a search warrant. On 23 August, in accordance with the AFP guidelines for the execution of search warrants where parliamentary privilege may be involved, I was notified by the Australian Federal Police that it was intending to execute a search warrant on the Department of Parliamentary Services at Parliament House on Wednesday, 24 August in relation to an investigation into unauthorised disclosure of Commonwealth information. I attach a copy of the MOU under which the guideline was made, and the guideline, for the information of the House. I understand the search warrant was executed on 24 August and, as a result, a range of material was seized. From the perspective of the House, the member for Blaxland has made a claim that material that has been seized is protected by parliamentary privilege. As a consequence, this material is now held securely in the office of the Clerk of the House. The member for Blaxland is seeking a ruling from the House in relation to his claim for parliamentary privilege, as is provided under the guideline. This is the first occasion on which a ruling has been sought from the House under the guideline. It will be a matter for the House as to how it will determine its position on the documents. I will undertake consultations to determine the way in which the matter will be dealt with. On a second matter, yesterday the Manager of Opposition Business raised a matter of privilege relating to an online report from The Daily Telegraph of supposed directions given by the Leader of the House. I do not see any privilege issues raised by the matter which the Manager of Opposition Business has put forward. I remind members that privilege relates to the special rights and immunities of the houses, their committees and members to ensure the parliament is able to operate without improper interference. Finally, I have a statement on the development of an electronic petitions website and system. In October 2015, I informed the House that the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of Parliamentary Services were to develop an electronic petitions website and system for the House. I now inform the House that the e-petitions system and website have been developed. The system and website have not been activated as the House will need to consider amendments to the standing orders to allow the establishment of an e-petitions system. I understand those amendments are part of a package of changes to standing orders to be considered by the House shortly. The system as developed will be accessible from the House of Representatives website. It will enable members of the public to enter and sign petitions online and track the progress of  any petition as it is presented, referred and responded to. This new development will update the petitions system and make it easier for members of the public to petition the House. NA Registration of Deaths Abroad Amendment Bill 2016 Returned from Senate Message received from the Senate returning the bill without amendment or request. NA Appointment The SPEAKER (12:04): I have received a message from the Senate concurring with the resolutions of the House relating to the appointment of certain joint committees. Details will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings. Membership The SPEAKER (12:04): I have received messages from the Senate informing the House of the appointment of senators to certain joint committees. Details will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings. NA Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 Second Reading Cognate debate. Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",17
1,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for failing to implement comprehensive budget measures that are fair and sustainable for Australia."" Cigarettes are the only legal product which, if consumed as directed, will kill half of their users. They are extremely addictive. Ask smokers if they plan to quit and 92 per cent will say yes. Yet Australia has managed over time to significantly decrease the share of people who smoke. Rates since 1980 have approximately halved, with smoking rates now around 18 per cent for men and 14 per cent for women. How did we do it? Part of the answer was information. People are more likely today to know that cigarettes cause cancer, and they are more likely to understand the risks of smoking while pregnant and the risks of smoking around children. We have also made available cheaper nicotine patches. Since 2011 patches that previously cost $4 a day have now been available for $1 a day for anyone with a doctor's prescription. One of the things, too, that has changed smoking rates in Australia is the change in price. Over the past generation the cost of cigarettes after inflation has increased from about 40c a stick to about 70c a stick. Whose behaviour is most changed by that? Well, young people are  particularly price responsive. So we have seen a rapid drop in the share of young people taking up smoking. The old days of a bunch of boys getting together behind the toilet block to light up are, thankfully, rarer than they once were. Economists estimate the elasticity is about minus 0.5, meaning that if you increase prices by 10 per cent you will decrease smoking rates by five per cent. Plain packaging also played an important part-a measure which I am proud to say was spearheaded by the Gillard government and ultimately supported by the then coalition opposition. These changes will have an effect, predominantly, on certain groups in society. We have to recognise that any changes in price affect smokers, and because smoking rates are higher among disadvantaged groups the effect of price changes will be higher too. But that means that increasing tobacco excise is a progressive health measure. The smoking rate among people living in disadvantaged areas is 24 per cent, among Indigenous Australians is 47 per cent and among the unemployed it is 38 per cent. And these groups consume more cigarettes than the average smoker. So, as we make changes to tobacco excise, the people whose behaviour is most changed are disadvantaged Australians. This was brought home to me by one of the most poignant emails I have ever received from a constituent, which read as follows: My great-grandfather, grandfather, father and one of my uncles all died from smoking-related conditions. Each of the latter three died 20-30 years before the life expectancy for their generation. My father's addiction contributed to two decades of poor health prior to his premature death, resulting in frequent periods where he was unable to work. My siblings and I grew up in poverty, the effects of which are still evident, and the taxpayer bore the cost of his many hospitalisations as well as the cumulative years of income support our family depended on in lieu of employment. I say this so that you will understand my absence of sympathy for the ""principle argument"", that tobacco companies have a right to make a profit from pushing legal drugs. I thought of this constituent when Labor announced that we would increase tobacco excise, because it is people like this constituent and her family who will benefit most. The beneficiaries will also be those who are around smokers-the one in six babies born to mothers who smoke while pregnant and the children who inhale passive smoke. Making sure that we reduce smoking rates in Australia has benefits that flow out to the broader community. This bill will be supported by Labor-of course it will, because it was Labor policy to begin with. In November 2015, the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, and the shadow health minister, Catherine King, announced that Labor would, if elected, deliver four 12.5 per cent excise rate increases in government, commencing on 1 July 2017. In May 2016, in this year's budget, Treasurer Morrison announced exactly the same policy-copying Labor's policy. But while students at school are sometimes aggrieved when their classmates copy their work, we on the Labor side are delighted. We are delighted that the government is copying this area of Labor policy because it is excellent policy. It is a goldmedal-winning, double lay-up, full-on backflip, and we are very pleased to see it. Why do I say it is a backflip? Well, I remember the assessments of Labor's policy at the time, with the health minister, Sussan Ley, describing Labor's policy as: … a grab for money, it's a political statement and I don't like it.  That was 29 November 2015. The then Assistant Treasurer, Kelly O'Dwyer, described it as: … another tax take that Labor has proposed. That was on 9 November 2015. Treasurer Morrison's assessment of Labor's tax policies were that they showed the opposition as 'fringe dwellers'-that was on 24 November 2015. And the member for Warringah, going back to one of his emptier slogans, described changes to tobacco excise as, 'a workers tax'. But this change will be a progressive health measure. According to the latest National Drug Strategy household survey, daily smoking is continuing to decline and, as shadow health minister Catherine King has noted, Labor's plain-packaging laws take a portion of the credit for that change. And so we are delighted on this side of the House that the government has again followed Labor in an antismoking measure. I say 'again', because it took the Liberals nine years after Labor before they ceased accepting tobacco donations. It took the coalition some months before they decided to back plain packaging. And in this instance it took the coalition a full six months to back in our changes to excise on tobacco. But they got there, to the right place, in the end and we are pleased to see that. I will speak in other debates later about the range of issues on which the government has made a mess of consultation and has engaged in a series of backflips. But for now let me commend the government for finally reaching the right policy. This is a policy which will increase the cost of cigarettes and decrease the smoking rate. There will be lives saved as a result of this policy. We currently lose around 15,000 Australians every year to smoking, and this policy will reduce the number of people who die from smoking-not just smokers themselves but the children who inhale passive smoke and the babies born to mothers who smoke. There will be fewer young kids who take up smoking and Australia will be healthier as a result. It is Labor policy, and I commend the bill to the House.",18
2,The SPEAKER,BILLS, I second the amendment.,20
3,The SPEAKER,BILLS,"The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this, the honourable member for Fenner has moved an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. If it suits the House, I will state the question in the form that the amendment was agreed to. The question now is that the amendment be agreed to. Ms CATHERINE KING: I rise to join my colleague the member for Fenner in support of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2016 and related bill. This is first and foremost a Labor policy and I am very pleased to see that the government have now adopted it, even if they were dragged kicking and screaming to do it. Labor proposed this policy-I think it was in about November last year-because, in line with international best practice, we know that cigarette pricing is a key factor in the reduction of smoking rates. As Tobacco Australia says: Many smokers and recent ex-smokers report that high prices of tobacco products are a key factor motivating their attempts to quit or cut down smoking.  We were up-front with our decision to continue the existing annual increases in tobacco excises, in using the tax system for reform with purpose-reforms that will see more people give up smoking and fewer kids start. At the same time, these reforms helped with the task of budget repair, but they did not attack our hospitals or education system to do it. Labor were listening to the experts when we proposed this plan last year. The World Health Organization considers that raising tobacco taxes to more than 75 per cent of the retail price for tobacco products is amongst the most effective and cost-effective tobacco control interventions. And the economic and social costs of smoking are significant. Tobacco kills more than 15,000 people and accounts for more than $31.5 billion in health and economic costs, so the long term benefits of decreasing the rate of smoking far outweigh the revenue that is collected here. It is quite simply a win-win. So you can imagine, frankly, the utter surprise on this side of the House when the government completely trashed this plan-a plan which was in line with expert advice and would cut smoking rates. This is what they had to say when Labor announced this policy. The former Assistant Treasurer dismissed the idea as 'another tax take'. The Treasurer said that the opposition were 'fringe dwellers' for our tax policies, this one in particular. More shockingly, this nation's Minister for Health and Aged Care-who is meant to be acting in the health and welfare interests of all Australians-despite the evidence of the impact this measure would have on smoking rates, dismissed the plan on national television, saying that it was a grab for money, a political statement and she did not like it. In contrast, the experts said that the policy would make a real change because price was an important factor in the decision to smoke. The chief executive of the Cancer Council of Australia said: Every time you increase the excise consumption goes down. We anticipate if there were four of these recurrent tobacco increases over time, that about 320,000 current smokers would attempt and be likely to quit as a result of all four increases, and about 40,000 teenagers would be deterred from taking up smoking. In the longer term that means tens of thousands of cancer deaths would be prevented. Make no mistake: this is a massive backflip from this government. Only months after the health minister dismissed the plan as a grab for money, the government's own budget papers said: One of the most effective ways to discourage smoking is to increase the price of cigarettes. Increases in tobacco excise over the last two decades have contributed to significant declines in the number of people smoking daily. Of course, on this side of the House we have always known the positive impact government policy can have on tobacco consumption. The proposal of this measure from Labor followed a track record of anti-smoking measures which have had a real impact on the rates of smoking in Australia. We adopted the World Health Organization's national framework to make sure that this country had the best possible policies to get our smoking rates down-and they have worked. Under the previous Labor government, as part of the National Tobacco Strategy, COAG committed to reducing the national adult daily smoking rates to 10 per cent by 2018 and halving the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adult daily smoking rate. Labor's world-leading anti-smoking measures, from bans on tobacco advertising to graphic health warnings and plain packaging, have seen smoking rates and tobacco consumption plunge over recent years. Tobacco consumption has fallen 16.8 per cent since Labor's plain packaging laws came into effect. According to the latest National Drug Strategy Household Survey, daily smoking declined significantly between 2010 and 2013, from 15.1 per cent to 12.8 per cent, and the increase to the tobacco excise will ensure that smoking rates continue to decline. Australia has become a global leader, with our plain-packaging laws inspiring the rest of the world to follow our public health lead. What we are seeing is a rare role reversal for this government. The government are completely divided about their approach to health measures, and their approach to health measures has been chaotic. Labor always said we would welcome the Turnbull government's adoption of our approach to tackling tobacco consumption. We hope they continue this lead and adopt Labor's other measures, which will have a significant impact on Australia's health system, like reversing their hike to medicines, which has seen the most vulnerable and sickest Australians hit every time they fill a prescription; unfreezing the Medicare benefits rebate, which is forcing doctors to reduce and abandon bulk-billing and will see more people presenting to emergency departments; and reversing their cuts to pathology and diagnostic imaging, which are increasing the cost of vital scans and tests. This government, time and time again, have proved that they cannot be trusted with this nation's health. Labor welcome this backflip and we encourage the government to adopt more of our sensible measures to improve the health care of Australians. Labor are very proud of Australia's record when it comes to the reduction in tobacco consumption in this country. Lives have been saved as a result of those measures. When this policy was announced by Labor, it was regrettable that those on the other side, including this nation's health minister, took the decision to basically say that this was a 'rubbish proposal'. This nation's health minister said that she did not like it. For the nation's health minister to actually make those comments, when this is exactly what the World Health Organization has recommended actually be done-frankly, she should have apologised. She should have apologised to all of the cancer councils, to Tobacco Australia, to all of the people who have been fighting for these measures for such a long period of time. If this government was serious about reducing tobacco consumption in this country, it would not have cut hundreds of millions of dollars out of the Indigenous smoking cessation program-a program that was working to deal with a cohort in our population whose smoking rates we have struggled to get down. For the first time, we actually saw a decline in the number of teenage Indigenous Australians taking up smoking as a result of that initiative. If this government was serious about real changes to tobacco, they would not allow the National Party to continue to accept donations from big tobacco. Frankly, it is well past time that the National Party ditched accepting donations from big tobacco. If this government is serious about getting smoking rates down, if it is serious about ensuring that fewer Australians take up smoking in the first place, then that is one of the measures I would suggest would be a very clear signal to big tobacco in this country that their days of influence within this place, their days of influence within this parliament, are well and truly over. This is an important measure, a measure that we do support because it is Labor policy. It will see more Australians give up smoking. It will see fewer teenagers take up smoking in the first place. I commend this measure to the House, and I particularly thank the government for finally seeing some sense and actually adopting a sensible health measure.   move: That the question be now put.

The SPEAKER (12:52): The question now is that the bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. National Cancer Screening Register Bill 2016 National Cancer Screening Register (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2016 Second Reading Cognate debate. Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.  Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat) (12:52): I will now speak to the National Cancer Screening Register Bill 2016 and the National Cancer Screening Register (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2016. From the outset I want to put on the record that Labor strongly support the policy intent of these bills, which is to strengthen Australia's cancerscreening programs. We support the policy intent of these bills, which is to establish the National Cancer Screening Register, which will replace the nine existing registers and improve prevention, identification and treatment of cancer in Australia. The National Cancer Screening Register will replace the current national register for bowel cancer screening, which is currently undertaken by the Department of Health, and state and territory registers for the National Cervical Screening Program, again undertaken by departments of health or, in the case of Victoria and South Australia, by the Victorian Cytology Service, which has done so, at least for Victoria, since 1989. I will address the specifics of these bills. They will first and foremost, as I said, establish the National Cancer Screening Register. In fact, slightly different bills were introduced in the last week of the last parliament. I want to flag that, had we been where we understood we were then, these bills would have largely been uncontroversial but they are controversial because of an action that this government took, which I will speak about in a minute. Addressing the specifics of these bills: they first and foremost establish the register and they authorise the collection, use and disclosure of information for the designated cancers: cervical cancer and bowel cancer. These bills authorise the migration of existing bowel cancer screening and state and territory cervical-screening data to the register, ensuring that existing screening information is retained in the new register. The bills also mandate reporting of screening information on the register. It should be noted that the creation of this register will enable improvements to several cancer-screening programs. We understand that the National Cervical Screening Program will move from a two-yearly Pap test to a five-yearly cervical-screening test-a recommendation of the independent Medical Services Advisory Committee. Incorporating this change in the National Cancer Screening Register is expected to stop an additional 140 incidences of cervical cancer a year. In addition, this legislation will see the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program accelerate its transition to biennial screening, with Australians aged 50 to 75 to be screened every two years by 2020 instead of 2034. Clinical trials have shown that biennial screening can prevent 300 to 500 deaths a year-again, something Labor very strongly supports. But a serious question has to be asked of this government: why are these bills being debated today? Why have they been rushed into the House for debate right at this moment? The answer is that the government took a decision some four days before the election was called to actually award the contract for this National Cancer Screening Register to Telstra before this parliament had even had an opportunity to debate the merits of the register, before this parliament had had an opportunity to scrutinise whether the privacy and data protections inherent in these bills and in the decision the government has made are adequate and before there had been any debate about whether it is appropriate for such sensitive data to be placed for the first time into the hands of a for-profit provider. These cancer-screening programs make sure screening is actually undertaken for the health of women and the health of our nation when it comes to bowel cancer. This is about making sure we have good women's health in this country-the cervical cancer-screening program is  a fundamental women's health program-and we have a good National Bowel Cancer Screening Program. This government made the decision four days before the election was called to award a contract to Telstra for the Cancer Screening Register before the parliament had even approved its establishment. There are some serious questions the government has to answer about its process when it comes to that, let alone the merits of the government making a decision-a very big decision, I have to say-to, in essence, put some of the most sensitive health data into the hands of a private telecommunications company. It is a big question and a big call-not one that we, frankly, support. Indeed, the government are debating this legislation before the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill, so you have to wonder what is driving them to rush this legislation through the parliament. One clear factor, as I said, is that they have already signed this contract. It is a $220 million, five-year contract, with an option of a further 10, with Telstra. That is why they have decided they need to rush this legislation through, because they have already done the deal on selling off this information. On the eve of the federal election, as I said, the government signed that contract. We need to be clear about the legislation we are debating here. This government is rushing it through because it has completely botched the implementation and signed a contract without giving the parliament respect to debate it first. As a result this parliament needs to scrutinise not only the concept of a national cancer register-something we support-but also whether it should be operated by a for-profit provider and the circumstances in which that came about. Interestingly, the minister for health could not bring herself to acknowledge in her second reading speech that the contract for this register had already been signed, let alone that it had been signed with a multinational private corporation. The minister has not acknowledged that in signing a contract with Telstra the government is making an unprecedented move to hand over extremely private health data to a for-profit multinational telecommunications provider. The new national register is designed to hold extremely sensitive information about every Australian who is eligible for the cancer screening programs. The register is not opt in and an individual will only be able to opt out of the register once it is actually implemented. At the most basic level, it will hold an individual's personal data such as their name, address, contact details, date of the birth, gender and sex. It will also hold an individual's Medicare item number, Medicare claims information and preferred GP or other health providers. This information could, on the surface of it, seem relatively benign; the Medicare data certainly is not. The register will also contain extremely private and intimate health data that is usually only disclosed between a person and their GP and the not-for-profit sector-in the case of Victoria, the Victorian Cytology Service. The register will record human papilloma vaccination status. It will record every woman's Pap smear screening results. It will record cancer diagnosis. Further to this, the government's own explanatory memorandum says that Telstra will have the information if a person has cervical or bowel cancer, the person has a precursor to cancer or genetic marker that may lead to cancer, a woman has had a hysterectomy or partial hysterectomy, or a person is transgender. It will hold the Medicare item number data for any cancer screening services and tests that someone has undertaken who is on the register. Certainly, this is not information that most Australians would be comfortable disclosing to a telecommunications provider. Labor accept that this information is necessary for the operation of the register but we do not  accept that Telstra, with a questionable record of privacy breaches, should have Australians' most private and sensitive health data. We know that many Australians would question the rationale behind giving a for-profit company access to this health data. The scope of these bills also make it clear that the minister can give Telstra even more information and the register may be expanded to other cancer screening programs into the future. As the explanatory memorandum notes: With rapidly advancing technology or changes in screening tests, the range of information that needs to be collected may also change and is difficult to predict. This provision allows rules to prescribe additional classes of data to form part of the contents of the Register that is considered necessary to be included in the Register for the purposes of the Register. So, more sensitive data will not have to come before this parliament to see if it can be added to the register; it will be added to the register once the processes in the bill have been complied with. Telstra themselves have admitted that they already have their eyes on expansion with Telstra Health Managing Director, Shane Solomon, saying: Certainly we have an eye on the potential of other registries … This parliament is also tasked with determining not only if Telstra should operate the national register but also if we should give the government power to hand them further undefined personal information. They are serious and obvious concerns and they do require proper scrutiny of this House and the Senate. The existing cancer screening registers are currently managed by government and not-forprofit organisations, with expertise in managing the registers such as the Victorian Cytology Service, which operates the Victorian and South Australian registers for cervical cancer screening. You have to wonder what the government were thinking when they rushed into signing a $220 million contract with Telstra only four days before the election was called, despite the fact that this parliament had not voted to even establish the register. Telstra is a for-profit company, whereas the intention of the register is to improve the experience of patients and to save lives. As David Vaile, the executive director of the Cyberspace Law and Policy Centre at the University of New South Wales, points out: Telstra on the other hand is a strong proponent of big data, of open data they're obviously a commercial operation, they're often seeking to use personal information for uses beyond what it was originally collected for and to push the limits of privacy and data protection law. Telstra has never operated a register like this. The register is far too sensitive to be used as a guinea pig for Telstra's foray into health, which they clearly see as a new and expanding source of profit. You only have to open the newspaper to see that Telstra is struggling with its core business, with significant and numerous network outages this year alone. This is on top of Telstra's questionable track record of keeping data secure. In 2011 the personal details of almost 800,000 Telstra customers were left online for eight months, available for anyone via Google. In 2013 the details of almost 16,000 customers were discovered by an online user by chance, including 1,257 silent numbers. This mob opposite wants to give them Australian women's Pap smear results. That is what this bill is allowing. Under the government's contract with Telstra, that information could have included whether a person had cervical or bowel cancer, whether a woman had a hysterectomy or a partial hysterectomy and whether someone was transgender. There are obviously serious implications about a breach of information of this nature.  In the second reading speech, the minister correctly pointed out that the bill also creates an offence arising from the unauthorised collection, use or disclosure of personal information contained in the register. What the minister failed to mention, in addition to the fact that a contract had already been signed with Telstra, was the size of the penalty in relation to unauthorised collection, use or disclosure. In fact, under these bills, the penalty for recording, using or disclosing information without authority is only $21,600. The penalties for breaching the privacy provisions in these bills are not enough to force Telstra to be more careful. While this amount is enough for a not-for-profit organisation to think twice about how it uses information on this register, for the size of a corporation like Telstra it is an absolute drop in the ocean in terms of penalties. The former secretary of the Department of Health, Stephen Duckett, notes: The automatic consequences of release of data-inadvertent or not-must be made so great that any risk-management matrix will ensure the organisation and its managers always have patient privacy at the forefront of their mind. It will not be good enough to do the standard dance after the data is released, or inappropriately used, where the contracting organisation (in this case, the Department of Health) tuttuts, and the contractee (in this case Telstra Health) issues a mea culpa. The contract should prescribe tough financial penalties that have automatic effect after any data releaseand I would say this legislation should prescribe much tougher penaltiesallowing little discretion for the penalties to be lobbied away with promises of future good behaviour. The contractual penalties need to be strong enough (A$1 million per person identified or data element used, for instance) so management ensures that patients' rights and privacy are protected. Telstra reported profits of almost $2.1 billion in the six months to 31 December 2015. A $216,000 penalty is simply not enough to put privacy concerns front and centre for Telstra. In addition, as a result of the government's delays, Australians often do not know when their personal cybersecurity has actually been breached, because companies are under no obligation to inform the victims that this has occurred. It might be customary; it is not compulsory. And, as we saw with the previous breaches with Telstra, they did not inform every one of those customers that that had occurred. Labor introduced mandatory data breach notification legislation back in 2013 to require companies to tell Australians as soon as practicable when their personal information had been compromised, but the incoming government did not proceed with that legislation. In early 2015 the parliament's bipartisan National Security Committee insisted that the government implement mandatory data breach notification legislation by the end of the year. The date came and went with no implementation. In this online age it is unacceptable that after three years the government has sat on its hands, only introducing the legislation to provide the most basic privacy protections last month. Considering the nature of the information this government has decided to give to a for-profit provider, the fact that they do not have mandatory breach reporting is a serious flaw in this government's plan when it comes to the National Cancer Screening Register. It is critical that strong legislative frameworks are in place to protect this information. Frankly, the government's handling of this contract has been, in signature fashion, completely farcical. After signing a $220 million contract to a for-profit corporate giant only four days before the election was called, the public found out about the contract only when it  was reported in the Fairfax newspapers. The minister then left it to the department to defend the government's decision-in a very surprising press release, frankly, given that we were in an election period and the caretaker conventions applied. We never had an announcement from the government. We understand one was proposed and planned on Daffodil Day-there was some proposal around doing that-but the only reason the public found out that the government had decided to award Telstra the contract for this $220 million Cancer Screening Register, with some of the most sensitive data you could possibly imagine, was that a journalist in Fairfax got hold of the story. That is the only reason we knew. Then we had the Department of Health, in the middle of the election campaign, taking the decision to intervene and then defend the government's decision-something which was frankly very, very questionable. The minister left it to the department to come out and defend the contract. Furthermore, the government has not released the contract with Telstra, so we do not actually know the details, other than that, in a briefing from the department, they informed me that there was an option within the contract for a further 10 years beyond the existing five. The government, frankly, have some serious questions to answer about why they did not provide more information about this contract. There are also some questions, which we will pursue later in another place, around the appointment of a former chief executive of Telstra Health as the new head of the Digital Health Agency and the timing around that announcement-some very serious questions indeed. Key stakeholders have expressed concerns about the lack of consultation in the government's development of the register, such as Dr Juanita Fernando from the Alfred Hospital's Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine. Dr Fernando said: Telstra and the government have not talked to doctors, they have not talked to patients, they haven't done any consultation with the people who are going to be most directly affected by the system ... The peak body for public and not-for-profit hospitals, the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association, also expressed concerns about Telstra being awarded the contract. It has had no experience in collecting and managing such an extensive array of national health data and has reportedly approached the Victorian Cytology Service for assistance in establishing the national registry. It begs the question as to how prepared Telstra Health is to manage the health data of millions of Australians. What is clear is that the cervical and bowel cancer screening programs are the thin end of the wedge. Telstra could take on more and more data, adding more and more risk. As we saw during the election and as we saw prior to the election, this is part of the government's agenda: to put more and more of our public health data into the hands of private for-profit companies. The decision that they pursued from the 2014 budget, from the Commission of Audit on, to privatise the Medicare payment system was a case in point. If this government and this Prime Minister are serious about saying, 'We will not be outsourcing Medicare or anything that is done,' then they will rescind the Telstra contract. We know they are not going to do that, but that is what they would do. If the Prime Minister is to be taken at his word that none of this will be outsourced-none of the existing functions will be outsourced that are currently done by Health-then the government would not have signed the contract or they would rescind it, but we know that they are not telling the truth when it comes to that. Labor understands that the government's contract with Telstra is for five years, with the option of 10. So, if we get the establishment of the National Cancer Screening Register  wrong, we may not be able to visit it for another 15 years. As a parliament, we have clear responsibilities to look at this proposal with thorough diligence and to consider what the impacts will be for well over a decade. As I said, during the election campaign the Prime Minister said at least 27 times that he would never outsource Medicare, but that is exactly what these bills do. They put Australians' Medicare numbers and Medicare claims information into the hands of a multinational telecommunications corporation. This is just another example of the government's determination to privatise our health system. This is a government that spent $5 million to set up a task force with the express purpose of looking at how you can privatise the Medicare payment system. Now they want to pay Telstra to not only store Australia's most sensitive health data but run the national cancer screening register. The government has proven time and time again that they cannot be trusted when it comes to health. They have delivered nothing but a track record of cuts and cost shifting from Medicare to patients and privatisation by stealth. The government remains committed to all of its bad health policies that it took to the 2016 election. The government has continued to put profit over patients, and this is exactly why they cannot be trusted and why this parliament should be sceptical of their decision to hand over the sensitive information of millions of Australians to a for-profit company. While Labor supports the establishment of a national cancer screening register, we have serious concerns about the risks of giving Australians' most sensitive data to a telecommunications corporation that is set up for profit and has never managed a register like this. The question we need to ask is: are we comfortable handing a for-profit provider control of Australia's most intimate health information, such as results of pap smears that allow inferences about a personal sexual status? Labor will be proposing amendments to the National Cancer Screening Register Bill. These amendments will make it clear that the new national cancer screening register can only be operated by a government or a not-for-profit entity. This would include those who have successfully managed the existing registers: the Commonwealth Department of Human Services, which operates the national Bowel Cancer Screening Program; states or territories, most of which operate the existing registers for the National Cervical Screening Program; or a not-for-profit organisation such as the excellent Victorian Cytology Service, which operates the Victorian and South Australian cervical screening programs. These amendments will ensure that the integrity and intention of the register is protected. We have the responsibility to protect the integrity of Australians' health data, and to ensure that it is used with its absolute and utter intention, which is to improve the health of all Australians. Labor looks forward to the register being established, but we do not support the government's absolute decision, before the election, to sign a contract with Telstra before this parliament had even voted to establish the register. They had absolutely no authority on which to do that, because this parliament had not taken a decision as to whether the register would be established or not. They have entered into a contract-I am sure for public purse purposes there better be some protection clauses in there-for something that technically does not exist, because the parliament has not voted to establish it. There was no possible basis on which the government could have proceeded, because they had no knowledge of whether the parliament  would proceed with this or not. We had not given any indication whether we would support it or not-neither had any of the other minor parties-and nor had the government even sought that. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for outsourcing Australians' most sensitive health information-including Medicare data-to Telstra, and before passing the necessary legislation.""",27

13,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS," Before I call the honourable member for Bruce, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech and I ask the House to extend him the usual courtesies.",35
14,Mr HILL,BUSINESS," I was hoping for a division to end that debate, because I thought the government might turn up, but there you go. I come to this place from the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne where I was born and bred. It is a region which I am proud to call home and proud to represent as the member for Bruce. Like most of us who hail from big cities, electorate boundaries are somewhat ephemeral. Bruce today is bordered by Highbury Road and Glen Waverley in the north; Blackburn Road, as it runs past Monash University and the Australian Synchrotron; the  Pakenham railway line in the south, as it runs through Springvale, Noble Park and Dandenong; and back up the Dandenong Valley creek. For thousands of years these have been the traditional lands of the people of the Kulin nation-the Bunurong and the Wurundjeri people. With that in mind, I pay my respects to their elders, past and present, as well as to the traditional owners of the land of this place, the Ngunnawal people, and to the elders of other communities who may be here today. I also want to thank my community for the trust they have shown in me and the Labor Party by electing me to represent them. I ran a grassroots campaign knocking on 14,000 doors over 13 months. Fronting up on people's doorsteps for a chat-or the occasional bollocking, and you get a bit of that-to listen to people one-by-one, family-by-family, is a humbling and intimate process. I will do my very best every day that I hold this office to honour their trust. Every encounter has value, and I hope some of the 'wisdom of the crowd', if you like, stays with me. My favourite question to ask people was: what is most important to you? I thank everyone who took the time to answer that question and to share their views, and I would like to reflect today on what I heard and what I learnt. The distinguishing characteristic of Bruce is its human diversity. It is one of only two federal electorates where a majority of people-53 per cent-were born overseas. Over decades, people from every part of the world and from every cultural, religious and language group have settled to live and work in the suburbs of Bruce. It is truly a microcosm of humanity. And I had that line before Peter Khalil used it yesterday, I will note. I am one who cherishes-relishes-this diversity of the multi-ethnic fabric that makes up Australia's multicultural communities. Unfortunately, there are too many people in this 45th Parliament who tap into and take advantage of the fear of diversity. The politics they play is both devious and dangerous. It is devious because it taps into genuine community concerns, such as economic exclusion and uncertainty, and it is dangerous because it trades on the basest of human instincts, to fear 'the Other' and scapegoat 'people not like me'. This is surely the lowest form of politics and the antithesis of good leadership, and it is a path that I know all of my Labor colleagues reject. I must say that the aftermath of the federal election reminds me of the time that I spent as Mayor of the City of Port Phillip, a large and diverse inner city municipality, from 2000 to 2002. This was at the tail end of the first phase of One Nation. Back then, community leaders spoke up against bigotry. Right now, we need to continue to call out this behaviour because it is morally wrong and because demonising and marginalising people sells out and damages Australia's security and prosperity. To paraphrase my friend Councillor Meng-Heang Tak, who is the Mayor of the City of Greater Dandenong, Bruce today is Australia tomorrow. Think about those words. Australia is a diverse nation, and the reality is that even greater diversity will be there in the years to come. We can get a sense now of what this could mean from communities like Bruce. We all want to believe that Australia's best years are in front of us. I wish I could say that I am certain that they are. They can be if we make the right choices, but if we do not, if we fail, then we will be the first generation to bequeath a lower standard of living to our children as well as a less equal society, and that would be a disgrace.  Current indicators are worrying. Despite 25 years of continuous economic growth, inequality in Australia is at a 75-year high, and the transfer of wealth from the poor and the middle classes to the rich continues. More than 2.5 million of our fellow Australians live below the poverty line, unable to fulfil their human potential or contribute meaningfully and fully to our economy, our society and our community. I have listened to a few first speeches and I have heard other people say those things. These facts are known, but they must not be accepted as our new reality. I worry that the language of social justice has become too soft, that we must speak more clearly about poverty and stark, indefensible and growing inequality. In my electorate of Bruce I see pockets of growing affluence right alongside entrenched unemployment. Young people, migrants and older workers are especially at risk. Thousands more job losses in the auto supply chain loom across south-east Melbourne, which are a direct result of the laissez-faire extremism of this government. In some areas we are at crisis levels already. For example, the unemployment rate in Dandenong is consistently more than twice the metropolitan average, the youth unemployment rate in south-east Melbourne is pushing 20 per cent and there are anecdotal reports of unemployment amongst African youths far higher than that. The social and economic costs are immense, not just from direct expenses but lost productivity, forgone growth and genuine community safety concerns when alienation turns to anger. I am proud to be a member of a Labor Party that fights policies that fuel inequality, such as the largesse of massive company tax cuts and personal tax cuts skewed to the top end; the current negative gearing and capital gains tax arrangements; a tax on penalty rates for low income workers; cutting pensions and family payments or attacking public education and Medicare. I could go on. I am conscious, though, of the community's frustration with negativity and the lack of cooperation between parties. You certainly pick that up when you are door-knocking. Too often this century, parliaments and parties have failed to reach enduring agreement in important areas of policy where stability is most needed-for example, climate change and carbon pricing, retirement incomes and the taxing of resources. I am up for doing my bit to listen, learn and find common ground with other views in this place. As long as we stay true to our core values there is no shame in difficult compromise if it solves our shared problems. Finding common ground to solve problems is what the people we represent expect of us, and we sell them out when we avoid it. I have listened to a few of the first speeches of new members opposite, and I have noticed a theme about Australia's now-precarious fiscal outlook. If anyone opposite is listening-they are probably on the television-I will say this in response: I agree that sustainable budget reform is a pressing challenge for this parliament and that Australia needs to act. Imagine then how great it would be if this government could cut a deal that included serious structural reform where the top 10 per cent contribute rather than consistently asking and picking on and taking from those who have the least, because there can be no grand bargain with us to protect the wealthy and vested interests from the burden of budget repair. Let me take members back to the streets of Bruce. I mentioned that when door-knocking my favourite question to ask people was: what is most important to you? Given the exceptional diversity in Bruce, you might think that there was no one issue that stood out, but you would be wrong. Overwhelmingly, the answer was education, from parents worried about the  government cutting the Gonski needs based school funding; baby boomers who benefited from free education and are worried about their grandkids paying $100,000 for a degree; working-class families who are so proud that their kids are not just finishing high school but attending TAFE or university; or students angry at the prospect of a lifetime of debt. Education was especially important to migrants who, like my mum, have a laser-like focus on education as the key to a better life for their children. I share that belief in the importance of education because I have lived it. My mum raised my brother and I alone after my dad died when I was four. Although money was tight, Mum used the money available when my grandma died to ensure we got the best education possible. We were the kids who rocked up in the old Torana to the rich school, Wesley College Glen Waverley in Bruce. I then went on to study science and law degrees at Monash University. Mum was the political black sheep of her family for being a Liberal voteralthough John Howard lost her in the end! We can talk about that another day. But I need to be careful because Mum died about six or seven years ago, so she cannot answer back and she may haunt me from the grave! She always did think voting was private-but we knew what went on! It was when I was at Monash that she finally accepted I was like the rest of the family-a Labor person. She saw me on TV on the nightly news with a megaphone, leading a student protest against Jeff Kennett. We are forever grateful that she did not see us chucking the oranges! Without a great education my life could have been very different. Like so many parents, Mum made sure we had what she never had. Mum was a working-class girl from Footscray in Melbourne's west.",35
15,Mr Watts,BUSINESS,"Hear, hear!",38
16,Mr HILL,BUSINESS,"Hear, hear! It explains my footy team-go Doggies!",38
17,Mr Watts,BUSINESS,She was a Liberal voter?,38
18,Mr HILL,BUSINESS,"I know, we never really got that. Anyway, she was an independent woman. Despite her intelligence she could not finish high school as her family could not afford the uniforms for her to change to a matriculation school. This contrasts with my father's story. His family had access to funds which allowed him to pay his way through medicine at university and reach his potential. I tell this story to explain my deep personal commitment to ensuring that education is available in Australia according to merit, not money. Education is the most important protection we have for equality of opportunity, and it is also a critical enabler of our future economic prosperity. I learnt this in my professional career as a senior public servant in the Victorian government, most recently in economic development including international education, investment and trade. Over 14 years I also worked in regional development, business engagement, Aboriginal affairs, metropolitan planning and infrastructure. I am proud to have worked as a public servant and was honoured in 2012 to have been inducted as a fellow of the Institute of Public Administration Australia, Victorian Division. I intensely dislike the way the term 'public servant' is often deployed in political discourse as a pejorative. People in Bruce have told me how important it is to them that government does its job well. That is because there is a direct correlation between the quality of services and the quality of life enjoyed by citizens. In other words, great societies have great public services, which require excellent public servants who deserve our respect.  Australia has been well served, but the impact of ongoing budget efficiency dividends on the public service is now a grave concern. I believe both sides of politics-and I have served governments of both sides-are guilty of overusing this budgetary technique. It is a question of not just hiding cuts, which may be perfectly justifiable, but also accountability. Through efficiency dividends, cabinets outsource decisions about cuts to the public service-not always with ministerial input, as I know, and usually hidden from public scrutiny. Australians feel the impact of diminished service quality, and I pay tribute to the great work of my union, the Community and Public Sector Union, for their fight to protect services. Of equal concern is the insidious damage this assault does to the ability of our public services to provide long term, strategic policy advice to governments of the day and to remember the lessons of decades past. Consulting houses have arisen to fill some gaps, but we cannot contract out society's memory, and I believe over-reliance is putting at risk our tradition of great and innovative public services for the next generation. I think a great deal about the increasingly complex world that my daughter, who is now 20 years old, will have to live and compete in. This much is clear: as Australia's neighbours grow stronger and more confident, it is apparent that the world does not owe this lucky country a living, and we would be foolish to try and build our 21st century economy on the happenstances of good fortune. You do not have to spend long in Bruce to understand how truly connected to the world my community is. People sense we are entering a paradoxical period of strategic uncertainty but incredible economic opportunity. Power is increasingly divided amongst major nations. The so-called rise of China, India and Asia is historically unexceptional-the world returning to normal, as some say-and welcome. But it is less predictable than the security of empire, or the bipolar or US-dominated world we have been used to in my lifetime. My point is that we will be forced to adapt. I firmly believe that Australia's best future lies in rebalancing our ties and deepening our connections across the Indo-Pacific region-to, as Paul Keating continues to remind us, seek security in Asia, not from Asia. This serves our national interest, and also that of our dearest, abiding friends. China is critical, though Asia is greater and more diverse than any one country. Despite this strategic uncertainty, we are geographically blessed. We sit at the bottom of a fast-growing region of 4.5 billion people. The centre of the world's economy is returning to Asia, faster than at any time in human history. Australia's opportunities to support Asia's growth are immense, whether through goods exports, manufacturing or services. Growing our national wealth is, and must remain, core business for Labor. Manufacturing is important. Despite the headlines, it remains the largest single employment sector in Bruce. Local businesses are transforming into high-tech advanced manufacturers and cracking new export markets. Yet if we are successful in moving up the global value chain, manufacturing will be a bit like the story of agriculture in recent decades: greater productivity, higher export output, more highly skilled jobs, but declining job numbers overall. So, we must capitalise on the long boom in services that will come as the middle classes of Asia grow to number more than three billion. We have expertise to export in education, financial services, transport, infrastructure, urban management, health, business services and so on. Government has a role to play in helping business to trade and grow.  Closer economic ties with Asia can also help ensure regional peace and security. I am a person who does believe that the potential for violent conflict is, sadly, a persistent part of our human condition and a risk we need to realistically always be prepared for and guard against. If politics is our alternative to violence then war or state-sponsored violence surely represents the greatest failure of politics. A prosperous interconnected region, while never a guarantee of peace, can be a strong preventative measure. Deeper regional cooperation is also critical to addressing shared problems, such as climate change or forced migration and this is important, but not easy, work. We share a common humanity, but people in other societies have their own thoughts, values, histories, traditions and norms, and those differences must be respected and understood. To do so, business people, public servants, diplomats and academics all tell us that we need to develop better language skills and more cultural understanding, and deeper international networks and relationships. As I move around Bruce I see all of this capability in the multicultural suburbs, yet I cannot help feeling that we are not fully leveraging our human diversity and that we need to do more to make sure that the promise of Australian multiculturalism lives up to the reality. Spend time with highly-skilled migrants and you will hear stories of frustration and bewilderment at being denied employment due to that deathly phrase, 'a lack of local experience', or darker tales of people still anglicising their names just to get an interview. Our society's institutions of power-our parliaments, judiciary, public services and military-still have a way to go to fully reflect the communities we serve. This includes gender, especially for those opposite, as well as class, ethnicity, disability and sexuality. We make the best decisions when all perspectives are considered-when all voices are heard and at the table. I am conscious that as a Rainbow Labor member my election is a very small step to adding to the diversity of this parliament, and I am proud to see more LGBTI Australians in this parliament than the last. There are other things-important things-that I will talk about another day, given the time: issues such as the lack of real action on climate change; environmental degradation; cuts to science and research; the arts; care for our veterans; housing affordability; the growth and productivity of our cities, in one of the most urbanised nations; or how our region addresses migration and the global refugee crisis. Or the republic-yes, the 'R' word! I am a proud and passionate republican. Monarchies are by definition undemocratic, illiberal and nonegalitarian systems of government, and these are not Australian values. And I see my daughter up there at the moment going, 'Oh, no, Dadnot one of your antimonarchist pro-republican raves!' So I will stop now-but it is a hot button! I think there is a standing order also that I need to be mindful of. For now, though, it is important that I say some thank yous, as getting here was only possible with immense support. Thanks to my family, whose love and forbearance I treasure. My daughter Elanor: we are very close, and I have lived at times as a single parent, experiencing that unique joy and loneliness. She is here today, so I will put it on the record: yes, you are the perfect daughter! I am not the only one who thinks this. For years she kept asking why people kept calling her Saffy. I have always had to explain to her it is because of her innate, wonderful qualities and not because her parents are anything like Patsy or Edina!  I have also known the love of two long-term partners, her other parents: her mother, Lorien, and David. Thanks to my brother Damian, and to Flap, Eva, Cynthia, Janina, Oz, Winston, Posy Regina and Paisley Regina. Thanks to the previous member for Bruce, Alan Griffin, who served in this place for 23 years-a mentor to many, and occasional dementor. That is a Harry Potter reference! That is the sum total of my literary references so far, and I thought that was appropriate. Thanks to the campaign team and supporters, including Callum Drake, Sarah Spivak, Paul Haseloff, Lee Tarlamis, Matt Broderick, Mathew Hilakari, Ray de Witt, David Hodge, Peter Jabbour OAM and Angie Venuto-Cole; and to our state members of parliament, Daniel Andrews, Gabrielle Williams, Steve Dimopoulos and Hong Lim. Senator Louise Pratt-she was going to be here. Louise is a very dear old friend of mine, but it looks like we found the Senate something to do! So there you go. It is great to be back here with her. Thanks to Helen Tierney, Kate and Feyi, Dalan and Bawa-actually, Dalan is in the gallery here today. I will stop now! To Penny Sharpe and JoB, Cam Green and Flora Yeh; the CPSU, the ASU and other unions; Ben Knight, Corey Rosevear and the Monash University crew. Thanks to the ALP branch members who time and time again perform impossible feats, as well as hundreds of community members from across Bruce who campaigned tirelessly for over 12 months, giving voice to their values. Thank you also to my colleagues here, especially Bill Shorten for such strong, effective leadership through the last term, seeing off one PM, and through the campaign. I thank my old friend Tanya Plibersek. We were staffers together last century, when we were youngactually I think that is AA Milne, isn't it? When we were young we used to leave on Wednesdays and sip chamomile tea together. Thanks also to Albo. I remember 1996 when you arrived and the fun faction began-and I am back. And to the class of 2016 and all the rest, who I am getting to know. I said to Tanya yesterday, actually, as we were walking out of the chamber and we were both feeling quite emotional after some incredible first speeches that my overriding reflection was that if diversity counts for anything, if values count for anything and if knowing who we are here to represent counts for anything then we have the makings of a truly great Labor government, should we be successful and given that honour by the Australian people at the next election. I will close by saying that if I am fortunate enough to follow previous members for Bruce with a reasonable stint in this place-however I choose to undertake my responsibilities-I would hope for two things when I look back. Firstly, that my time here would rank well against the two types of people that Alan Griffin observed are called to serve in this place: 'politicians', who work with their party to seek power to effect change, see justice done and progress made and also 'parliamentarians', here for service, to take responsibility and to represent others-most especially giving voice to those without any. And, finally, that I could be proud of my contribution: that I had the courage to change my view in light of new evidence or circumstances, that I was not still or silent when it mattered and that I could not have worked harder. Thank you.",38
19,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS, The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour  NA WestConnex,41
20,Mr ALBANESE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to raise my concerns about the latest stage in the WestConnex project, which has been characterised by poor and ill-conceived planning. The latest suburb potentially to suffer is Leichhardt. Local residents are concerned that a site on Darley Road in Leichhardt will be the midpoint for tunnelling for the extension of the WestConnex project. Darley Road is already a very busy road. There must be proper consultation with local residents and proper planning, including a local traffic plan, to satisfy residents that there will be no adverse impacts on them. Of even greater concern is that the nearby Blackmore Oval and/or other public space in the area will be used during construction. Active and passive open space is at a premium in my electorate. Blackmore Oval is used by a variety of sporting codes for local sport. In addition, the Canal Road Film Centre is situated behind Blackmore Oval. This centre houses 75 or more specialist businesses that comprise a big part of the Australian film industry infrastructure, which is important for our national economy. I have spoken to the federal minister responsible for urban infrastructure about these issues and have had two direct discussions with the appropriate state minister, Duncan Gay, and called on him to ensure that these issues are resolved and that Blackmore Oval is protected. (Time expired) Anderson, Mrs Donna Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (13:45): My electorate has some tremendous leaders in the field of education, and I would like to acknowledge one of those today, Mrs Donna Anderson, who is Head of College at Canterbury College. Mrs Anderson is an excellent example of how our schools need to think outside the basic curriculum to develop pathways where Australia's students can engage and achieve. Through the success of the college's strategic partnerships programs, Mrs Anderson has been chosen to speak at an educator research symposium at the University of Oxford in the UK. The strategic partnerships programs connect students with the real world and also develop personal relationships where staff network and collaborate with universities and businesses. Through this program, Canterbury College has been able to provide more subjects for its students, including robotics in kindergarten, as well as better facilities, including world-class science laboratories, and access to higher education programs though first-year university subjects and on-site training. Mrs Anderson has gone above and beyond to drive cultural change at Canterbury and offer real-world, out-of-the-box experiences for students to truly discover their talents and passions. She is a true leader in the electorate of Forde, and I commend her hard work and commitment to the students of Canterbury College. Australian Football League",42
21,Mr WATTS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The Saturday night before last a very excited crowd filled VU Whitten Oval in Footscray to watch the AFL Women's All-Stars game between the Western Bulldogs and the Melbourne Demons. My daughter estimated that the crowd at the ground was 'about a million', but official counts suggest that about 6½ thousand people came out. The television audience for the game did top one million viewers, and they saw the Dogs beat the Demons 14.6 (90) to 6.9 (45)-finally. Even more impressively, in Melbourne the game averaged 387,000 viewers, 40,000 more than the best men's regular season fixture. The  game's success highlights the tremendous potential the new eight-team women's league has when it kicks off in February 2017. It was a thrill for me to be able to go through the footy record with my daughter before the game, knowing that this would be the last women's exhibition game and that we would be able to watch Steph Chiocci, Ellie Blackburn and Katie Brennan in Dogs colours week after week next season. The establishment of this league is a testament to the hard work of many women, but Whitten Oval paid special thanks on the night to the Western Bulldogs' Vice-President, Dr Susan Alberti AC, a true champion of the Western Bulldogs' new club new slogan: 'Three teams; one club. Be more Bulldog'. Extraordinary strides have been taken in recent years to advance the women's game in Australia but there is still a distance to travel. We need to see an enduring, fair and equitable pay agreement for the players if we want the game to thrive in the long term. The Women's All-Stars game showed that the demand is there from the fans, and if the AFL invests in the players and invests in our women then the community will support it. Wood, Mr Joshua and Mr Benjamin",42
22,Mr VASTA,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today I would like to speak about Joshua and Benjamin Wood, two remarkable brothers from Carindale. These young men are an inspiration and an example of what hard work can achieve. Josh is nine years old and profoundly vision impaired. I first got to know Josh two years ago, when he came second for reading in the Queensland Braille Writing Association's Braille Literacy Challenge. Josh worked extremely hard for this result. I am pleased to inform the House that last week, at this year's challenge, he came first in the state in his section for reading and second in his section for writing. This is another great result he should be proud of. Josh's older brother Ben has also achieved remarkable things. Ben has learnt Braille to help Joshua and attends Braille camps with him every year in Sydney. He has also received the highest mark in the state twice for his AMEB speech and drama exams. Ben is a fantastic speaker with a big interest in politics, and I look forward to seeing him in this chamber one day! Josh recently wrote to me about his and Ben's wish to meet the Prime Minister. Tomorrow I will have the pleasure of hosting both Josh and Ben at Parliament House. I am excited to introduce these young men to the Prime Minister in person. Thank you, Joshua and Ben, for the fine example you have set for the community. Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games",43
23,Ms RYAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to speak about Morgan Mitchell, an incredibly talented young woman who, I am proud to say, hails from the electorate of Lalor. With Cathy Freeman as a mentor, a thousand-megawatt smile and tonnes of talent, a less grounded athlete might get a big head. However, Morgan's beautiful family has kept her grounded. In news reports it has been said that Morgan's mum begged her to 'please just come home the same person' from Rio. Alongside Jess Thornton, Anneliese Rubie and Caitlin Sargent-Jones, Morgan did her country proud in the 4 x 400 relay. All of them were first-timers at an Olympic Games and they made the final. The Australian athletics team has not done that since 2000. The last time,  our friend Nova Peris ran in the 4 x 400. I was proud to see Morgan Mitchell have the same honour. Like many other kids, Morgan started her career in Little Athletics, and she has always been an incredibly talented sportswoman. At 17 she played in the under-19s Australian netball team and represented Australia in the IAAF World Junior Championships. Her humility and hard work are an inspiration to everyone in the electorate. We are proud of our national champion and we are proud of her efforts as an individual and as part of the team in the 4 x 400 relay team. Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games",43
24,Mr WALLACE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," With a population nearing 300,000, the Sunshine Coast is punching well above its weight, with no fewer than 12 of the Olympians representing Australia in Rio last month having lived or trained on the coast. Of those 12, eight hailed from my electorate of Fisher. It is with great pride that I inform the House that the Fisher Olympians returned from Rio with two silver and three bronze medals. Shining under the tutelage of swim coach Chris Mooney from the University of the Sunshine Coast, Leah Neale and Taylor MCKeown both won silver: Leah in the women's 4 x 200 freestyle relay and Taylor in the women's 4 x 100 medley relay. Jake Packard, also coached by Mooney, took away a well-deserved bronze medal in the men's 4 x 100 medley relay. Also in the water, 18-year-old Chelsea Gubecka, from the Kawana Waters Swimming Club, came 15th in the women's 10-kilometre open water swim. In archery, Ryan Tyack, from the Sunshine Coast Archery Club, put in a great performance to help clinch bronze in the men's team bronze medal match. Also hailing from the coast, Buderim born Alyce Burnett and Alyssa Bull, from my home town of Alexandra Headland, fought valiantly to place eighth in the K2 500-metre kayaking final. Also, Alana Boyd placed fourth in the pole vault final. Childhood Cancer Awareness Month",44
25,Ms RISHWORTH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," If we look around the chamber, many of us have started to wear yellow ribbons. These are very important symbols of recognising that September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. This month was first proclaimed in 2010 by US President Obama, and it has since become a global initiative. We wear gold ribbons to raise awareness about this incredibly important month, where we recognise those young people in our community who are suffering from childhood cancer or have passed away from childhood cancer. It is pleasing to see so many members and senators starting to wear them. For those who have not got a gold ribbon, look into getting one because it is an important month. The Kids Cancer Project here in Australia works hard to help fight the scourge of cancer. It funds research to help end childhood cancer and has been doing so since 1993. According to the Kids Cancer Project, three families will hear the words 'your child has cancer' every day. There are 950 children diagnosed with cancer in Australia every year. I would like to recognise Erin, who has unfortunately passed away at the age of 14. But before her death, she advocated on behalf of other children around the world; she really shone a light on this terrible scourge. She urged us to continue to address this issue in this parliament. (Time expired)  Robertson Electorate: Employment Mrs WICKS (Robertson) (13:54): It is a fact that the Central Coast needs a major injection of local jobs to become the thriving centre of opportunity that it deserves to be. That is why our community supported our plan to deliver 600 new federal jobs, mainly from the ATO, into Gosford during two federal elections. Over the last few years I have held hundreds of listening posts, community meetings and round tables regarding this desperate need for local jobs. but let us contrast this with Labor. Just last week, Senator ONEILL sent an error ridden open letter through the media that was misleading and bizarre, and it only highlights Labor's opposition to local jobs and growth. My commitment has always been to jobs, not to a building. In deciding the location for 600 new jobs in Gosford, the ATO chose a site that is a two-minute walk to the centre of Gosford. It was selected independently by the ATO through an open, thorough tender process-and that is as it should be. Senator ONEILL actually confirmed this in a series of stunts in the Senate. Labor now wants to build a performing arts centre on that very land. So why did Senator ONEILL spend three years as the local member publicly campaigning for it to be elsewhere? And why doesn't the senator admit another simple fact: that the location of the performing arts centre is actually up to the council to decide? Businesses describe our 600 new jobs as a catalyst project our region needs. It is a catalyst that I will fight to see delivered, with 600 new jobs into Gosford by the end of next year. The future of our region depends on it. Batman Electorate: Preston South Primary School",44
26,Mr FEENEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I am always inspired by stories from within my electorate of individuals and communities coming together and making real change. Today I would like to make special mention of one particular success story-Preston South Primary School. Sitting in the heart of my electorate, Preston South primary has students from a diverse range of social and cultural backgrounds. Not long ago, Preston South primary was facing some immense challenges, including declining enrolments and the challenge of a serious fire in 2009. Today the school is transformed, a model of quality education and inclusion with a vibrant curriculum and dedicated staff. This transformation has been led by Principal Leon Leonidas. Last month I had the pleasure of celebrating National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children's Day with the school. This event was an excellent example of the outstanding initiatives championed by the school. The day began with a moving welcome to country by Aunty Di Kerr and offered students the opportunity to explore Aboriginal culture and history. It is with immense pleasure that I congratulate the Preston South Primary School and Principal Leon Leonidas on their success. Universal access to quality education is critical to giving our children their best start in life, and I extend my thanks to all the educators in my electorate who dedicate themselves to achieving that goal. O'Connor Electorate: Music Festival Mr RICK WILSON (O'Connor) (13:57): It is with great pleasure that I report to the House a fantastic night of fun and frivolity last Wednesday at the Albany Entertainment  Centre. This year's Albany District Primary Music Teachers' Network's music festival was hosted by Flinders Park Primary School and included outstanding performances by Spencer Park primary, Mount Barker Community College, Mount Lockyer primary, Parklands primary, Flinders Park primary, Australian Christian College, Little Grove primary, St Joseph's College and, last but by no means least, the school that my youngest kids attend, Albany Primary School. My favourite individual school act for the evening was Flinders Park Primary School's performance of the old Beatles classic Octopus's Garden, where music teacher Mike Staude had every single student in the ensemble playing an instrument. However, the highlight was undoubtedly the combined school choir's resounding rendition of All Over the World, where every child who had performed on the evening came together in an ensemble of more than 400 voices in perfect harmony. My hearty thanks to Flinders Park Primary School principal, Richard Bushell, and his team for hosting a wonderful concert. Congratulations to each of the students who performed with pride and confidence in front of a full house. As a parent of one of the performers, I can honestly say how proud I was of not only my daughter but of every single student as they sang their little hearts out for their teachers, families and friends. Finally, a big shout out to the Albany music teachers' network for their hard work and professionalism in preparing their students for this wonderful evening. I would like to single out Robyn Wilson, of Spencer Park Primary School, who is retiring after 19 years, and acknowledge her years of commitment to cultivating the musical talents of so many young students. I am sure- (Time expired) Women in the Workforce",45
27,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I was one of the many Canberrans who woke with a shock one Saturday a few weeks ago to front-page images in The Canberra Times of topless women in G-strings serving drinks at a Geocon worksite. The idea that in 2016, a company would think it appropriate to celebrate with strippers on a worksite raises questions about how committed that company really is to promoting gender diversity in the workforce. I encouraged Canberrans to write to Geocon to make their views heard, and I am pleased that many did just that. I have since met with the managing director of Geocon to hear what is being done to ensure this never happens again. Geocon has enlisted David Morrison to serve as a 'high-level mentor' to the company's managing director and it has developed a cultural change strategy. As far as these moves are evidence of a proactive response this clear failure of judgement needs to be recognised and we need to ensure this is just a first step in a very long process towards banishing these attitudes for good. It will take more than a mentor. It will require a sustained and tangible determination to improve. I will keep pushing for progress because these attitudes, cultures and behaviours do not belong on building sites in 2016, they belong in the history books.",46
28,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded.  NA Marriage",46
29,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. How does the Prime Minister respond to reports that he told his cabinet last night to keep the details of the plebiscite very close to their chests-directly warned them not to leak the details of cabinet's discussions-details which were then almost immediately leaked to David Lipson of Lateline? Is his leaking cabinet what the Prime Minister means when he says, 'So far, so good'?",47
30,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for his question. It is a remarkable thing, isn't it? Today we were able to announce an agreement negotiated between his shadow Treasurer and shadow finance minister and the Treasurer and the finance minister in the government. We reached agreement on $6.3 billion of savings, an important step in restoring the budget to balance-a measure of the commitment the government has to ensure that we do not load a mountain of debt onto the shoulders of our children and grandchildren, a reassurance that the government is committed to working with all parties in the parliament to achieve that, a tribute to the constructive and good faith negotiations between his colleagues and my colleagues. And what does he want to ask about instead of that? Does he want to deal with that? Oh no. He has a another shabby political question; another smart alec question. The Australian people are concerned about the mountain of debt that is being loaded onto the shoulders of their children and grandchildren, demanding that the 45th Parliament get on with the job of budget repair. And what do we have? Another smart alec political question from the Leader of the Opposition.",47

33,Mr Burke,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on direct relevance. I refer to your previous rulings where you have said we have to allow for a reasonable introduction. The Prime Minister is now halfway through his answer and has not got to the cabinet leak which is at the heart of the question. ",47
34,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the House will cease interjecting. He does not have the call. The Prime Minister is responding to a question that had a number of parts. Manager of Opposition Business, I have pointed out in previous rulings which I could take you through in great detail-I do not think you would like that at this point-that the Prime Minister is entitled to compare and contrast and have a preamble. There was a large number of elements to the question and I am listening to the Prime Minister carefully.",47
35,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. And this highly political question turns to issues of solidarity. Of course, there is no greater solidarity than that between the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Dastyari. Oh yes, they stuck together! There he was, taking payments-cash for comment. And when it was revealed that he had sought and obtained money from a Chinese company to pay his debt-all Australians would be astonished to see a member of parliament use their position, use that eminence to which they have been raised by  the electorate, to extract money from somebody to pay their debt-he said there was nothing untoward about it. He describedMr Dutton interjecting",47

38,Mr LITTLEPROUD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister advise the House on the steps the government is taking to reduce debt and deliver on the coalition's economic plan?,48
39,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for his question-and what a contrast! On our side of the House, we are focusing on the economy, the budget and the responsibilities of parliament. On the other side, it is all the game of politics-avoiding responsibilities for the big issues. I thank the member for his question. The most important priority the 45th Parliament has is to work together to deliver the budget repair that we need. We cannot continue to load mountains of debt on the shoulders of our children and grandchildren. We talk a lot about fairness in this place-and so we should. We have to be focused on fairness. We have to ensure that the economy as it grows does so in a way that includes all Australians. That is key, but a critical element of fairness is intergenerational fairness. It is simply unfair to live beyond your means and load that mountain of debt onto the shoulders of your children and grandchildren. This budget repair has a long way to go. If we fail to meet that responsibility, it will put pressure on our AAA rating. It has enormous consequences-negative consequencesbecause the reality is, if we keep on borrowing, our children and grandchildren will either have to pay much higher taxes or have less government services-less quality government services and less in quantity. They will lose. We want our children and grandchildren to do well. We want them to have greater opportunities than we have had. That is our commitment, and a key part of that is budget repair. We introduced in the last sitting the omnibus savings bill, which set out around $6 billion of savings that the Labor Party had previously opposed but, in the election, they had adopted and incorporated into their own alternative budget. The Treasurer asked the Labor Party to support that. Negotiations continued, and I give credit to the Treasurer and the finance minister and their counterparts, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister, for cooperating and working on that-in a constructive manner, I must say, which seems quite at odds with the attitude of their leader. But, nonetheless, the good news is that we have achieved by that agreement $6.3 billion of savings over the forwards. That is a critically important element in budget repair. There is a long way to go, but it is a very good step, and it underlines that, if we work together constructively and in the public interest, we can deal with these big challenges. This should be the first of many successful negotiations to achieve the restoration of our public finances and ensure fairness between generations ensure that those whom we should love the most, our children and grandchildren, are not burdened with a mountain of debt.",48

42,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. The Herald Sun reports today that the Attorney-General originally proposed to cabinet that neither side would receive public funding but that a group of conservatives, including the Treasurer, the Deputy Prime Minister and the immigration minister, rolled the Attorney-General. Is this civil war what the Prime Minister means when he says, 'So far, so good'?",49
43,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," It is interesting the member for Grayndler is sitting there stony-faced as talk about civil war ensues. The honourable member knows very well indeed that cabinet processes are confidential. He knows very well. But what he should know-what he should understand-is that, when it comes to civil war and factional politics, the Labor Party is in a league of its own. So frightened of his opponents in the Labor Party, he cleaved to Senator Dastyari like a drowning man clinging to a piece of wood in a shipwreck. He hung onto him-nothing untoward! Let's just reflect on this. Let's reflect on this. This, they tell us, is the party of fairness. I hear it all: the Labor Party is always talking about fairness. I ask honourable members: how is it fair for a senator earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, vastly above average weekly earnings, when he has a debt he does not want to pay-people often do not want to pay their debts-to ring up a Chinese company and say, 'Pick up the tab, mate; pick up the tab'? Do we imagine he could have done that if he were not a senator? So Senator Dastyari was elevated to the position of senator by the people of New South Wales.",49

For the assistance of the Manager of Opposition Business, I do not want to go through and restate every question that is asked, but  let me, just for a bit of guidance, say that, when a phrase like 'civil war' is used, my attitude is that the floodgates are open.",49
52,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Returning, the floodgates of cash are open for Senator Dastyari. Yes, just dial 1. Just dial 1 for cash-that is what he is able to do. And, you know, these are the standards of the Labor Party. This is a man of whom the Leader of the Opposition said there was nothing untoward. He said that it was petty to insinuate that there was something improper in a senator being able to call somebody up and say, 'Pick up the tab; pay my debt.' Mr Rob Mitchell interjecting",50

(Time expired) NA The SPEAKER (14:14): At this point in time we welcome back two former members, who are in the Speaker's gallery this afternoon- Mrs Mary Easson, the former member for Lowe, and the Hon. Melissa Parke, the former member for Fremantle. Welcome back to question time. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Economy Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (14:15): My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer advise the House on the importance of budget repair to a stronger economy and how this government is arresting the debt burden for future generations of Australians?",50
57,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Hughes, my shy neighbour, for his question. Rising debt robs current and future generations of their living standards, forcing higher taxes on them and forcing them, because of those higher levels of debt, to accept lower levels of services. When those opposite left government, they left this side of the House with a debt curse-a debt curse that we are having to deal with. The Turnbull government is committed to arresting that debt by repairing the budget by getting expenditure under control. That is why we initiated and brought into this House an omnibus bill to ensure that we move on savings on  expenditure-savings that would relieve this country of some $30 billion worth of debt going forward. We are pleased to say that we have been able to come to an agreement with the opposition. I thank the shadow Treasurer opposite that we could come to an agreement on ensuring that measures that they had put in their forward estimates and that they had put in their costingssome 20 out of the 24 measures in that bill-have been agreed to unamended. That is a demonstration of the Turnbull government getting the job done in this 45th Parliament that was elected by the Australian people. We have brought in those savings that included measures that they had opposed, in some cases, for three years-savings that those opposite had said before the last election that they would never support. I welcome the fact that they now support them. Equally, on this side of the House we have put forward measures which we did not wish to proceed with in order to reach agreement. That shows that, in this parliament, this government is dealing with the job of repairing the budget. But, on top of that, it is also about doing this so we can drive the growth and jobs which we are delivering. Under this government, in the last year we have delivered two things, and that is jobs and it is growth-200,000 jobs, growth at 3.3 per cent. We are leading the advanced world. What this government is delivering to the Australian people is more jobs and more growth and a plan to deliver more jobs and more growth. This is a plan which escaped those opposite at the last election. As a result, they were rejected at the last election because they did not have an economic plan to continue to drive the successful transition of our economy from the mining investment boom to the more diversified base. Today we note that both business confidence and consumer sentiment is up again. In particular, it is up on this time last year. In the last year, we have seen a rise in consumer confidence and a rise in business confidence, because this government has a plan for jobs and growth, and it is delivering jobs and growth.

In this respect, everything we do is about him and his generation. I am very disappointed that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would use Eddie-take advantage of Eddie's presence here.

72,Mr BANDT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Following that answer, my question is to the Prime Minister. Lyle Shelton from the Australian Christian Lobby has said that the push for marriage equality 'is causing unthinkable things to happen, just as unthinkable things happened in Germany in the 1930s'. Is your hold on power really so slim that you will spend over $7 million of taxpayers' money so bigots like these can spread their hate speech during a plebiscite instead of letting MPs just get on with a free vote in parliament?",53

77,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just before I call the Prime Minister, there is no doubt that the first part of the question was not in order. The second part went to a decision to expend funds on the plebiscite. The Prime Minister can address that aspect. I caution the member for Melbourne on his language in the question. The Prime Minister has the call.",53
78,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Thank you, Mr Speaker. The decision to provide funding to 'yes' and 'no' committees is on all fours with the method that was used in the republic referendum in 1999. It is a very well-established precedent. I want to thank the Special Minister of State and the Attorney-General for crafting a design that reflects very closely the mechanism that was used in 1999 by the government to provide funding for both sides. I note that during the Gillard government there was a proposal to have a referendum on the recognition of local government and, indeed, the Labor government then proposed I believe $20 million of funding to be shared between the two sides advocating the case. So what is being proposed is a conventional approach. It has a precedent in the republic referendum. It is thoroughly fair. I want to say to the honourable member: when the plebiscite comes he and I, despite all of our many differences on other issues, will both vote yes. That is true, so we will agree with that. But I have to say to him, as somebody who would like the 'yes' vote to be successful, he does his cause no service by insinuating that those who oppose same-sex marriage are homophobic or bigoted.

What the honourable member is saying to the electors of Melbourne is: 'I don't trust you to have a respectful, civil conversation. I don't trust you to be anything other than bigots.' The reality is we put our faith in the Australian people. This is a great democracy. The plebiscite is a proposal we took to the election. We won the election. We have a mandate. We are asking the Leader of the Opposition to work with us to ensure that on 11 February every Australian gets their say. Mr Buchholz interjecting",54
82,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Wright will cease interjecting. New Colombo Plan,54
83,Mr ALEXANDER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister update the House on the success of the government's New Colombo Plan and what opportunities it is providing Australian students to enhance their education and career prospects? Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Minister for Foreign Affairs) (14:28): I thank the member for Bennelong for that question. I also thank him for his support for a coalition government initiative that has already seen great success in demonstrating Australia's deeper and broader engagement in our region. Indeed, I have been able to judge the success of this coalition initiative by the feedback I have had from numerous foreign minister counterparts in the region, who cite the New Colombo Plan as an extraordinary example of Australia's genuine commitment to engaging in our region. Indeed, at a recent ASEAN Regional Forum meeting, attended by at least 28 foreign ministers from the region and beyond, a majority of them in their own speeches to the forum raised the New Colombo Plan as an example of Australia's genuine commitment to the region. Indeed, since we established the New Colombo Plan in 2014 till the end of this year over 10,000 Australian students will have had the opportunity to live, study and work in one of 38 countries in our region. Last sitting period, the minister for education, Senator Birmingham, and I announced the new funding for 2017. I can confirm to the House that a further 7,441 Australian university students from 40 Australian universities, across 31 countries, will experience the New Colombo Plan opportunities in 50 different fields of endeavour. What is unique about the New Colombo Plan in terms of a student exchange is that it involves partnerships with business, the community, NGOs and government to provide our students with opportunities to work, to undertake internships and practicums in the countries where they are studying. The member for Bennelong will be interested to know that, for example, by the end of next year 365 students from Macquarie University will have undertaken the New Colombo Plan experience. Next year, which I think is of great interest, 10 students will be studying big data, artificial intelligence and robotics in India with an internship at Tata Consultancy. These are the examples that we are providing to young Australian students. It is transformative. It gives them new perspectives, new insights and new skills. Many of them  take up language skills. We are focused on ensuring that our students have a greater level of Asian literacy than any previous generation. I do want to place on record my deep appreciation and thanks to Senator Penny Wong, who not only turned up to our event but spoke at it in such glowing terms. Her father-an original Colombo Plan scholar from the 1960s-Francis Wong, was present to endorse our New Colombo Plan. Marriage",54
84,Mr DREYFUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to reports that a 10-person committee will decide how money is allocated for his expensive, divisive and damaging plebiscite on marriage equality, consisting of five private citizens and MPs. What MPs will be on this committee? Will it be the Prime Minister or the member for Warringah or the member for Menzies or Senator Abetz or Senator Bernardi?",55

87,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,55
88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on my right!,55
89,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I can say, Mr Speaker, that listening to my colleagues there seems very little support for Senator Dastyari being on the committee. The 10-person committees are based on the model used in 1999 where committees were established by the Howard government to plan and manage expenditure for the yes-andno case in the republic referendum. What we are proposing here is that there will be, in exactly the same way, committees chosen by the Special Minister of State and the Attorney General. There will be five members of parliament-five members of either the House or the Senate. There will be two from the government, two from the opposition-it is up to the opposition, of course, to nominate them-and one crossbencher. So that is five. The other five will be chosen from the ranks of the advocates' leading figures on the yes-and-no case, and we will obviously consult widely. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to join with us in supporting this plebiscite, I would be delighted to consult with him. If he supports the plebiscite, he can have two people on each of these committees. So, as to all of this concern about hateful advertising being published with government money, he can have two of his own people on those committees and they will have a direct say and influence over any advertising developed or promoted. In accordance also with the practice in 1999, advertising, because it involves government money, will have to be approved by the cabinet subcommittee, the SDCC-the successor to the MCGC. This is not from a point of view of censorship but in order to ensure that it complies with advertising standards and the purposes of the campaign for the plebiscite. I was on one of those committees in the 1999 referendum. I can tell you I do not recall the Leader of the Opposition being prominent in the yes case. I remember that referendum very well. We did not win the referendum, as we know, but it was not because equal funding was provided to both sides. Is he suggesting that the only way the Australian people would vote yes for same-sex marriage is if no funding were given to each side? Is that what his suggestion is? It is ridiculous. This is a thoroughly fair process. It is based on precedent. It is  based on very solid, well proved precedent. Again, I acknowledge the great work of my ministers in bringing the details together.

91,Ms LANDRY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources. What action has the government taken to support the Australian beef industry? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?,56
92,Mr JOYCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"New England-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (14:35): I thank the honourable member for her question, coming from the beef capital of Australia-it is certainly the beef capital of Queensland; I know that Mr Hogan might have a different view about the beef capital of Australia. Certainly the cattle industry has been one of the best examples of a turnaround that has been delivered in the time of the coalition government, no better seen than in the price of cattle, especially 400 kg steers through Roma. When we came into government, back in September 2013, it was less than 150c a kg, and now it is at 300-and-over cents a kg-a 100 per cent increase. This means that there is a real turnaround in the prospects and lives of people-to think that a B-double means that you get well in excess of $100,000 and that comes back to those mums and dads who are the backbone of the cattle industry. There is so much work that has been done in the cattle industry and you can see it in the free trade agreements that we have delivered to China, Japan, South Korea, to the new live animal destinations that underpin over $14 billion a year that we get from the cattle industry-$12½ billion from slaughter and processing and $1½ billion from live export. We continue to build on that work in the cattle industry by investing in the infrastructure, through such things as the announcement of $100 million for the Winton to Laverton road to connect us up to those in the Gulf Country. Also the money we put into the beef roads; the money that we are putting into further development of markets by having people positioned overseas to drag our product into new markets and expand new markets. We also noted that, during our time of government, we have had something that has not happened for 50 years-that is, the opening of two new abattoirs since we have been in government. Just recently, Jack Burton over at Broome opened a new abattoir, promoting new jobs for people in those areas, just like the new jobs that are going into the AA Company abattoir in Darwin. This is how we bring the wealth back into our country. This is how we turn things around. Of course, turning things around is vitally important. The Labor Party have obviously got some views about turning things around and had a little problem with the member for Maribyrnong. I noticed the member for Grayndler was playing touch football today and he was doing a very good job. I noticed that, as the member for Grayndler came onto the field, they said: 'Now, here's a leader. Here is a leader.' That is what the crowd said as the member for Grayndler came on.",56

97,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. With regard to the Prime Minister's plebiscite, what groups will be eligible for taxpayer funding and what restrictions will there be on what this funding can be spent upon?",57
98,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for his question. The $7½ million will be allocated to each of two committees-one for yes and one for no, as I described. The money will be fully audited, again as it was in 1999. The money will only be able to be used for advertising and research. It will have to be authorised by the respective committees and of course the members of the committees will have to take responsibility for it. There will be five members of parliament and senators on each of the committees, and the opposition has the opportunity to appoint two members to each committee if it so wishes. So there will be very clear accountability. The model, as I said, is based on 1999. That is the only entity that will receive government money. Of course, other parties, as happened in 1999, will no doubt advertise or advocate themselves, but the only recipients of the collective $15 million of government funding will be those two committees. Again, the precedent is very clearly and deliberately based on what happened in 1999 and which worked from an administrative point of view very well in 1999. Australia's National Interests",57
99,Ms FLINT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry. Will the minister outline to the House why it is critical to take a consistent approach to the defence of Australia's national interest?  thank the member for Boothby for her question. It is certainly true that Australia does have critical national interests. The first of those is maintaining international rules based order. It needs to maintain the capability to be a good ally to the United States and to others, and we need to have stability in our region, particularly in the South China Sea. They are three key national interests. And it is vital that both the government and the opposition adopt a consistent approach to those national interests. And until recently there has been a consistent national approach, but Senator Dastyari's statements about the South China Sea have altered that. After receiving payments from businesses associated with the Chinese government, Senator Dastyari publicly repudiated the ALP's policy on the South China Sea and took China's side rather than Australia's side for our national interests. But what is interesting is that, at that time, Senator Dastyari suffered no consequences. At no point did the Leader of the Opposition feel that Senator Dastyari's role was untenable as a shadow minister or manager of business in the Senate. It was only when it became a public issue, when there was a controversy, that in fact Senator Dastyari resigned; it was not the Leader of the Opposition requiring him to resign. So, since the resignation of Senator  Dastyari, this has become an issue for the Leader of the Opposition and his leadership, because he is yet to explain what he did when he first found out that Senator Dastyari had received personal payments for his debts and had repudiated ALP policy. Who did he consult about what action to take? What inquiries did he initiate to satisfy himself about action that should be taken about Senator Dastyari? The truth is the Leader of the Opposition took no action at all. Right through to the resignation of Senator Dastyari, the Leader of the Opposition did not feel the need to act. Amazingly, Senator Dastyari's standards were higher than the Leader of the Opposition's. Is this what he meant when he said he would govern like a union leader? Clearly a leader would have taken action at the time that Senator Dastyari repudiated Labor's policy. Or is it more likely that the truth is that Senator Dastyari is the ignition in the New South Wales right-wing machine and therefore the Leader of the Opposition was unable to act against Senator Dastyari, because his leadership is so tenuous, in the same way as he was unable to act against Senator Kim Carr? When the Left faction dumped Senator Kim Carr from the front-bench, it was the Leader of the Opposition that saved Senator Kim Carr, because his leadership is so tenuous. This will be the continuing pattern under the Leader of the Opposition. (Time expired) Marriage",57
100,Ms BUTLER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. This morning Lyle Shelton of the Australian Christian Lobby said that the $15 million of taxpayer funding for the marriage equality plebiscite could be spent campaigning against what is taught in Australian schools. Is that correct?,58
101,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I cannot comment on what Mr Shelton said, but what I can say to you is that the purpose of the money given to the two committees will be for the production of advertising and advocacy material directed at the vote, the issue, in the plebiscite. That is all. People may have interest in other matters. If they are extraneous, if they are not pertinent to the question",58
102,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Moreton will leave understanding order 94(a). The member for Moreton then left the chamber.,58
103,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"then the money will not be used for that. I say to the honourable member that she should encourage her leader to support the plebiscite. There is the opportunity to place two opposition MPs or senators on the committees. I note, in terms of the 'No' committee, about which she appears to be concerned, that when the House last voted on this matter there were a number of Labor members who voted against a bill to allow same-sex marriage. It included the member for Lilley; it included the member for Watson; it included the member for MCMahon. If they hold the same views now as they did then, the Leader of the Opposition may well put such responsible people on the committee. Economy Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) (14:45): My question is to the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. Will the minister update the House on how the government is supporting the rebalancing of the economy by promoting Australia's growing services sector? ",58
104,Mr CIOBO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Goldstein for his question. I know he takes a very strong interest in Australia's services sector and in the operation of free trade and markets and, no doubt, follows on from the very strong footsteps of the previous member for Goldstein, who also has a very strong track record in this respect. I note, as well, that in his first speech he raised the importance of services exports. They are important, because the Turnbull coalition government recognises that, as the Australian economy continues to rebalance, we need to make sure that we put a strong focus on driving services exports. The fact is that services account for about 80 per cent of the Australian workforce and make up about 70 per cent of our GDP, yet only 21 per cent of our exports are in fact services. So herein lays a tremendous opportunity for Australia. One way, in particular, that we are focusing on it is in relation to the Trade in Services Agreement or TISA. TISA is an opportunity for Australian education exports, in particular, to be brought to the forefront, when it comes to powering the Australian economy, so we continue to see the strong growth the coalition has delivered of some 3.3 per cent. Education is also an important opportunity with respect to investment. We see, for example, where foreign businesses will look at investing in Australia to capitalise on education export opportunities. We see, for example, that Top Education Institute invested in Australia hoping to maximise, no doubt, the opportunities that flow from full-fee paying international students. Unfortunately for Top Education Institute that has not always been the case. The Labor Party have not been the strongest advocates when it comes to full-fee payment, and they have not been the strongest advocates when it comes to some of those investment opportunities either. We also see other opportunities around foreign trade. In particular, under the ChinaAustralia Fair Trade Agreement we have a clause called 'most-favoured nation treatment'. This effectively means that Australia ensures that our economic competitiveness with our largest trading market is maintained. With the rising middle class in China, the opportunity for Australians has never been better. I suspect that Senator Dastyari recognised some of these benefits in the Senate during an adjournment debate, when, in 2014, he explained that few countries were better placed than Australia to capitalise on the rise of China for their own economic benefit. Little did we know that when he was referring to 'own economic benefit' he was taking it on a very personal level indeed. Fundamentally, the issue, when it comes to trade and when it comes to education exports, is that this side of the House will continue to champion the economic opportunities to take our nation forward, while that side of the House will only look at what their own personal interests are with respect to those opportunities.

128,Ms ODWYER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I would like very much to thank the member for MCMillan for his question. He, like his constituents, understands how critically important it is that we preserve our tax base, for the benefit of all  Australians. We in this government have made it very clear that hiding assets and not disclosing income offshore is not going to be tolerated by our government. Evading your tax obligations is cheating law-abiding Australian taxpayers. Tax evaders have nowhere to hide. Just on a year ago, the Minister for Justice and I set up the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce, a multiagency taskforce that brings together our law enforcement and regulatory agencies to make sure that we can detect and combat serious financial crime. Led by the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Federal Police, in collaboration with our international partners, the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce has had a week of action in relation to the Panama papers. The week of action saw 15 unannounced visits in Victoria and Queensland which involved more than 100 Australian Taxation Office officials. We had three search warrants executed in Queensland, which saw the recovery of documents, electronic documents and 170 kilograms of silver bullion valued at about $150,000. More than 100 taxpayers have been contacted by the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce through the Australian Taxation Office. They have been told that they will be subject to compliance action, and that may result in them receiving, potentially, criminal prosecutions, going forward. They include high-net-wealth individuals and professional facilitators such as accountants and lawyers. This has not been the first action of the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce. It already has a significant list of achievements over the past 12 months, including more than 300 audits, more than $130 million in liabilities raised, more than four people who have received custodial sentences as a result of prosecutions, and 19 joint operations that are on foot at this stage. The Serious Financial Crime Taskforce is the successor to Project Wickenby, which raised more than $2 billion in liabilities and saw more than 46 people prosecuted with criminal convictions, a number of whom were jailed. The government will continue to work with our international partners, with our regulatory agencies and with our law enforcement agencies to make sure that we crack down on tax- (Time expired) Marriage",61
129,Ms BUTLER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Leader of the Opposition. Will the Leader of the Opposition inform the House about the progress through the parliament of his private member's bill that would enshrine marriage equality in Australia?,62
130,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for her question. Yesterday, the member for Sydney and I introduced a bill to make marriage equality a reality, but the bill will not progress unless the Prime Minister schedules debate and a vote during government business. We should be debating our private member's bill during government business because it is the fastest way to achieve marriage equality, we should be debating our private member's bill during government business because it is the cheapest way to achieve marriage equality, and we should be debating our private member's bill during government business because it is the least harmful and divisive way to achieve marriage equality. In explaining why we would seek to debate the private member's bill during government business, I note the support of the members of the crossbench for a free vote in the parliament. Today, I call upon the Prime Minister to go back to the views that he once  cherished and vote with us to allow the private member's bill and make marriage equality a reality once and for all. Small Business Mr LLEW O'BRIEN (Wide Bay) (15:00): My question is to the Minister for Small Business.

I acknowledge the great role that he has played since taking over from another fine former member for Wide Bay, Warren Truss, who served that electorate so well, served the National Party so well and served this parliament so well. I also acknowledge the work that the current member for Wide Bay has done for the 13,200 small businesses in his electorate. He has hit the ground running. Next Wednesday he is attending Roz and Michael White's IGA store opening at Peregian Beach. That is an example of a fine small business employing Australians. Small businesses in Australia-the 2.1 million of them-employ 4.7 million Australians and contribute $340 billion to the economy. They are big numbers. I have been asked about the work that this side of the House has done for small businesses. I have only one minute and 58 seconds to go, and that is a shame because it could take a long time to talk about the instant assets write-off-$20,000 for businesses to be able to invest in their companies. I could talk for a long time about the company tax rate. It has gone down to 27½ per cent, the lowest it has been since the late 1960s. That is what this side of the parliament has donebecause the Liberal and National parties are the side of politics for small businesses. Hand up all those on this side of the House who have run a small business or worked in a small business? Hand up those on that side who have run a small business? There you go! That is proof positive about what our side of politics does for small business. That side of politics has never seen a small business they would not want to run a picket line in front of! Just this morning, the latest results of an ANZ Roy Morgan survey showed that business confidence is up and consumer confidence is up. That is great. Going into the Christmas retail period, that is a tremendous thing. We are also simplifying the business activity statements. That is a great thing for small business. And what we are doing for small business does not just cover Wide Bay. It could be a stock feed store in Shepparton, a fish market in Mackay, a dentist in Dubbo, a cafe in Coffs HarbourMr Feeney interjecting",63
132,Mr MCCORMACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Or, indeed, it could be a bookstore in Batman. I note that the member for Batman has Anthony Albanese's book-I do not know what the numbers man for Labor is doing there. Businesses across Australia are passionate and diverse. They are risk-takers. They are the lifeblood of our economy. It is probably time that Labor should acknowledge that. They are certainly the backbone of our economy. (Time expired)  United Kingdom",63
133,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and goes to her ministerial responsibility to be aware of political developments overseas. The former conservative prime minister of the UK, David Cameron, said overnight: As a former PM it's very difficult to sit as a backbencher and not be an enormous diversion and distraction from what the government is doing. Can the foreign minister explain the government's position on Mr Cameron's comments and is she aware of any other former prime ministers in any other countries causing an enormous diversion from the back bench?",64
134,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is out of order. I call the member for La Trobe. Victoria: Infrastructure,64
135,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. I refer to the government's $1.5 billion Victorian infrastructure package announced in the 2016 budget, including funding for the Murray Basin rail project, the Monash Freeway and the rural and regional roads package. Will the minister explain how these projects will deliver on the government's economic plan?",64
136,Mr CHESTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and his long standing interest in road, rail and other infrastructure in his electorate and right across Victoria. He has been an outstanding advocate for the people of La Trobe when it comes to infrastructure funding because, like all members on this side, he understands what a difference good infrastructure can make in people's lives. We know that if you invest in good infrastructure you can change lives and actually save people's lives. It is all about reducing congestion, improving productivity, cutting costs for small business owners and, of course, saving lives by reducing serious injuries through building safer roads. The $1.5 billion Victorian infrastructure package announced by the Prime Minister earlier this year is all about getting Victoria moving again. It is a great package, it is a fair package and it benefits Melbourne as much as it benefits regional Victoria. Mr Rob Mitchell interjecting",64
137,Mr CHESTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not sure why the member for MCEwen is interjecting. Those opposite virtually copied our entire plan. When the future leader, the member for Grayndler, the people's choice, copies our plans we are flattered by that. When the Andrews government failed Victoria over the East West Link, members on this side of the House knew their communities were getting ripped off. We knew they were getting ripped off. On no other occasion in Australian history has any government made such an expensive decision-$1 billion to not build a road. But we have set about trying to fix the mess, and along with my ministerial colleague, the member for Bradfield and Minister for Urban Infrastructure, I put forward a $1.5 billion package to the Victorian government that will help get Victoria moving again. This government under this Prime Minister is committed to getting on with the job, delivering the projects and the infrastructure that Australia needs for the 21st century. We have committed to delivering $500 million to the Monash Freeway Government members: Hear, hear!",64
138,Mr CHESTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And I hear members behind me cheering. It is not surprising-the member for La Trobe and the members for Aston, Deakin and Menzies. Even the member for MCMillan and the new member for Chisholm, of course, understand how this investment will change the lives of Victorians. Mr Speaker, you understand yourself in your own electorate how the $500 million in the seat of Casey will benefit Victorian families-get them home to their families sooner. We have also allocated $75 million to ease urban congestion in Melbourne. As I said at the outset, this is a fair plan. It is a plan that extends out into our regional communities. There is the Murray Basin Rail Project as well. On top of that, we are allocating $345 million to the Rural and Regional Roads Package in the seat of Murray. The new member for Murray would appreciate the $97 million for the Echuca Murray bridge. Again in MCMillan there is $25 million for the South Gippsland Highway. There is $25 million for the Great Ocean Road upgrade-the member for Corangamite is very happy with that. The member for Mallee was satisfied with a $10 million increase in funding for the Calder Highway, to improve safety on that section of road. And the member for Wannon's community will benefit from upgrades in his community. I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. This is a government which does have a plan for stronger economic growth, and part of that planning is building our future through investing in infrastructure we need. (Time expired) Superannuation",65
139,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. During the election campaign the Prime Minister said his superannuation policy was 'absolutely ironclad'. It had: … the full support naturally of the Government, the Cabinet and the party room. Will the Prime Minister update the House on progress of the government's superannuation changes? Do these changes still have the full support of the party room? Or is it another case of 'so far, so good'?",65
140,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister has the call-most of that question is in order.,65
141,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I am relieved to get that question from the shadow Treasurer because we had so many Dorothy Dixers from the opposition on the subject of the plebiscite I was starting to be concerned there had been a leak of the Leader of the House's question pack to the Labor Party-that they were asking our questions to us! But I thank the honourable member for his inquiry. Consultations continue on implementation. It is an important issue. The Treasurer and the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services have it in hand, and we look forward",65

143,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We have listened very carefully to the honourable member's suggestions and we are very focused on ensuring we have a superannuation system that is fit for purpose.  Cybersecurity,65
144,Mr SUKKAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Cyber Security. Will the minister update the House on the achievements of this government in cybersecurity, and what has this government done to keep my constituents safe online?",66
145,Mr TEHAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question and note his strong and continued interest in Australia's national security. I must say it is a pleasure to get a question on national security, and I look forward to a few more questions from those opposite-also on economic security, because it seems to be when it comes to national security and economic security there is very little interest on that side. Not so on this side, and especially when it comes to the member for Deakin. I congratulate him on his appointment to the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security, and in particular his role in chairing that. It is an incredibly important committee. It does great bipartisan work on the national security agenda, and I know he will do an outstanding job in heading that committee. It is also incredibly important that we focus on the national security threat of cyber.",66

152,Mr TEHAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You might learn something if you listen! The government's national Cyber Security Strategy, released by the Prime Minister in April, was the first significant commitment to Australia's cybersecurity capability in our history. And it is something that those opposite should recognise and support. We have committed $230 million to our strategy-$230 million-which includes commitments to cybersecurity health checks for Australian businesses and which will give companies tailored solutions to online challenges and threats. We will also increase the capacity of the Australian Cyber Security Centre to have agencies across government coordinate their response and defence against threats. It will also bring business closer to our agencies, to help them get the solutions that they need to remain secure. In an online world the government is putting out real solutions and investment to secure Australians. By fully committing to these and other initiatives, this government is expected to create 800 specialist jobs back in the economy-800 specialist jobs-over the life of the strategy. This government has the runs on the board with regard to cybersecurity. We have delivered the blueprint for a safe cybersecurity future. (Time expired) ",66

159,Mr BURKE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In question time today the Prime Minister described me as a staunch opponent of same-sex marriage.

I think the Prime Minister should come and immediately correct the record.",70
170,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I would say to the member for MCEwen that he has made his personal explanation. The best way to avoid this in the future is to cease interjecting. Now he has said it, I will also caution him to refer to members by their correct titles, even when he is interjecting. NA Prime Minister The SPEAKER (15:17): I have received a letter from the honourable the Leader of the Opposition proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Prime Minister's failure to deliver in his first year of office.

171,Mr SHORTEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," What a busy week it has been, and it is only Tuesday: cabinet leaks directly defying the Prime Minister's orders; a public split in the Liberal party room; the Liberal party room now a live blog site for different factions of the Liberal Party; the extreme right wing calling the shots; the member for Warringah airing his views to all and sundry about all and sundry; and a parliament in chaos-a government Senate with no business to do. The last time we met, those opposite could not wait to go home, and now they are here they have got nothing to do. This is a government in chaos. Let me correct myself: this is business as usual, another week in the busy life of the Turnbull government.  Let's cast our minds back to a year ago, the fateful 14 September. It was the beginning of new politics, and our friend the Prime Minister said it would be the end of slogans. The future was here. It was the second coming of the Sun King. We were going to see the heroic mould of individual leadership shining brightly like a lone star over this benighted Liberal government and we were going to be rescued by none other than Malcolm Turnbull, Prime Minister. Of course, we were told by some of his boosters-indeed, some in the media-that this was a marvellous development for democracy. No longer would we need the outmoded two-party system; we had the Turnbull-party system. And what a year it has been since then! I concede there has never been a more exciting time to be Malcolm Turnbull, but unfortunately for",70
172,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The Leader of the Opposition will refer to members by their correct titles.,71
173,Mr SHORTEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"the member for Wentworth, the Prime Minister, the Sun King, the man who invented the internet. Anyway, a year later",71
174,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I want the Leader of the Opposition to be able to use his entire 10 minutes without me pulling him up.,71
175,Mr SHORTEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Thank you. Me too.,71
176,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, you know the answer.",71
177,Mr SHORTEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"A year later, this Prime Minister is the great national disappointment: from Messiah to mediocrity; from agile to fragile. Never before has a Prime Minister promised so much and delivered so little. He claims, in a remarkable statement, that this has been a substantial year of achievement, but in fact it has been marked by dithering, delay, dysfunction and disunity. It has been a year marked by cowardly retreats and by the betrayal of everything the old member for Wentworth pretended to care about. It has been a year of weakness, not strength. It has been a year of moral cowardice, not leadership; a year when at every turn, on every issue, the Prime Minister has allowed himself to be bullied by the rightwingers in his backbench. The promise the Prime Minister made, to be able to say that he could lead and unite his party, was that he would deliver a massive electoral mandate to the government. In the first 10 months of his government that was the promise which even the most optimistic Turnbull boosters hung on to-that he would deliver the electoral dividend that would mean he would at last be able to stamp his authority on the party. But that did not happen. There are 17 fewer coalition members sitting on that side of the parliament because of this Prime Minister, a Prime Minister to whom no-one in the government owes anything. Authority is not granted by title; authority is granted by the ability to deliver. We on this side understand very bitterly that the government won the election, but we also recognise a wounded, weak leader, with no agenda or authority, just waiting for the next mistake. Every time his backbench have demanded more and more of him he has caved in. He surrenders on every issue that he has ever said he believes in. On climate change, the once heroic figure who would cross the floor is now letting the climate sceptics write his climate change policy. But at least he is in charge, he says. On marriage equality, in the month before he rolled Tony Abbott, the member for Warringah, the Prime Minister said that he believed a free vote in parliament was the best way to go. He knows it is the best way to go. Why are we  led by a man who will, when knowing the best option, recommend to Australians a second best option? That is moral cowardice. He can claim his mandate for a plebiscite, but we understand that he knows that if he was actually in charge of his party he would not be having this plebiscite. So Australians are presented with a leader claiming to lead the country when he cannot lead his own party in the way which his own conscience demands he should. But we have also seen him on superannuation, a matter very important to millions and millions of Australians. The changes that these vandals opposite, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, made with their agendaless government in the last budget have critically undermined the confidence of every Australian in superannuation investments. I acknowledge we have to rein in the excessive concessions at the top, but the way this ham-fisted government went about their business means they have created a question mark in the minds of millions of superannuants: why do we even bother doing this? It takes some going to trash the superannuation system. He says he has got an absolutely ironclad policy, and then he uses his weasel words and his weak retreat. He is already explaining to people: 'Well, I might've said that then, but I certainly can't say it now. And I'd better check with some of my backbench in case I can say what I said today tomorrow.' And what does he always say when we have these problems? I am sure what he says to his few remaining desperate backers-he shrugs his shoulders and he says: 'What do you expect me to do? I'm only the Prime Minister. You must be realistic. You have unrealistic expectations of me. All I wanted was the job. Why do you ask me to do anything with the job?' But you do not have to take my word for it; the reviews are in a year in. Michelle Grattan: … since the coup that installed Malcolm Turnbull, many Liberals are disappointed and surprised he has turned out, so farlove your optimism, Michellea mediocre Prime Minister. … … … He struggles in adversity, anger on display, firing bullets of blame. His graceless election night address was appalling. Andrew Bolt, not exactly a true believer: HOW bad is Malcolm Turnbull? Even he struggles to name one thing he's achieved since becoming Prime Minister. … … … [The] official list of achievements is so embarrassingly tiny that his staff have padded it with things … stolen from Abbott's. Or what about that memorable exchange between Jeff Kennett and Andrew Bolt, which I concede I failed to watch. But I repeat: Bolt: Can you name the achievements of the Turnbull government one year in office? Kennett: Not easily. Bolt: Can you name one? I am not asking this as a trick question … Kennett: I want him desperately to succeed. Bolt: That's right, but can you name one? Kennett: No, not at the moment.  But I think Michael Gordon summarised this government best by quoting Neil Young: It sorta starts off real slow and then fizzles out altogether. A year ago when he launched his coup, the current Prime Minister said about his predecessor, 'Ultimately the Prime Minister has not been capable of providing the economic leadership our nation needs.' Let us look at his economic leadership in those fun 12 months. Plan A: a 15 per cent GST on everything. He sends out poor soldier Morrison, and then abandons him and runs away-and do not ask poor old Premier Baird what he thinks about Malcolm Turnbull's spine! Plan B-which the Prime Minister called, with his characteristic trademark humility 'a once in a generation reform'-double taxation. Why didn't we all think of that? Because you need to be as clever as Mr Turnbull to come up with an idea as absolutely dumb as that idea. Plan C: a $50 billion giveaway for multinational companies. I must record that when we went into the lock-up on budget night I saw my shadow minister for finance and my shadow treasurer and they were surprised. They were stunned. They said, 'You'll never believe it'and I couldn't. A $50 billion tax giveaway. Even Goldman Sachs says $30 billion of that will go overseas; the big banks will pay $7½ billion less tax profit to the bottom line. They want to look after multinationals to send more profits overseas. We want stronger Medicare. They want to give the banks a tax cut. We are determined to seek justice and give Australians a banking royal commission. Indeed, when we talk about the lack of conviction of this Prime Minister, what we have to look at is marriage equality. The idea that he will provide $7½ million to the no case and $7½ million to the yes case, to be supervised by five MPs and five citizens, is an atrocious idea. It shows the retrofitting of a bad idea being reinforced by even less sound planning. This nation does not need to spend nearly $200 million of taxpayer money on a government opinion poll when we have a budget repair situation requiring hard choices. That is all this plebiscite is; it is a government opinion poll. But even worse, this government and this nation need leadership from the Prime Minister. We know the Prime Minister's heart is not in this plebiscite. He desperately wants the issue to go away. Our problem is that the consequences of Mr Turnbull's pursuit of power will be to damage- (Time expired)",71
178,Mr FLETCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Is there a more ludicrous spectacle than a leader of a Labor opposition having the temerity to criticise this side of the House when it comes to delivery? How short their memories are, when you look at that side's utterly inept record of delivery. There is the member for Lilley, creeping out of the chamber. He was the man who stood here and said 'the four years of surplus I announce tonight'. How many years of surplus did he deliver? Not four, not three, not two, not one-he delivered none of them. Who can forget Labor's disastrous incompetence on border protection? I had a look recently at a press release issued by the then minister for immigration, Senator Chris Evans, on 13 May 2008, speaking about the scrapping of temporary protection visas. He said this: … would not compromise the Government's commitment to protecting Australia's borders. 'Would not compromise'? What a disastrous record of delivery the Labor Party has when it comes to protecting Australia's borders-1,200 deaths at sea, 50,000 unauthorised arrivals, 8,000 children put into detention, 17 onshore detention centres-and the Leader of the Opposition has the temerity to talk about delivering.  What about their hopeless record of incompetence on delivery when it comes to the National Broadband Network? During the 2007 election they promised they would spend $4.7 billion to connect 98 per cent of Australians to a fibre-to-the-node network-complete failure to deliver. They just could not do it. So in 2009 they had a new plan. Now it was going to be $43 billion, and they were going to connect 90 per cent of Australians via fibre to the premises. What had they achieved when they left government? They had spent money. They are very good at spending money, this lot. They had spent over $6 billion. But what had they delivered? Barely 50,000 Australians connected to the network. We are connecting more Australians to the network every month than Labor's chaotic, incompetent record of delivery when it comes to the National Broadband Network. What about the pink batts disaster Tragically, four young men died and there were some 200 house fires, thanks to this lot's incompetent record of delivery. What about my personal favourite. There were going to be 260 new childcare centres built on the premises of schools all around the country. The member for Adelaide was going to end the double drop-off. Do you know how many they managed to build by the time they pulled the plug in April 2010? They managed 38 out of the promised 260-and this hopeless ravel has the temerity to come in here and talk about delivery! Let me tell the House about delivery. Let me tell you what the Turnbull government is delivering. Economic growth has strengthened to 3.3 per cent. We now have faster economic growth than any of the G7 economies. In the last year we have created almost 220,000 jobs, and over 60 per cent of those have gone to women. I will tell you one very important thing that we have done to create jobs-we ended Labor's disastrous Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which was an arrow in the heart of small businesses in the trucking sector delivering jobs. That meant 35,000 owner-drivers could get back on the road. Our PaTH program, announced in the budget, will provide up to 120,000 internships for young people to get a foothold into jobs. I talked about the National Broadband Network before. I talked about Labor's incompetent, unbelievably hopeless record of delivery. Compare that to the systematic and steady progress we are making on this side of the House with a competent chief executive, a competent board, a competent management team and a credible business plan. That is why over three million premises around Australia can now connect to the National Broadband Network-and the chief executive of the National Broadband Network, as recently as last week, made it clear that we are on target to get the National Broadband Network completed by 2020. That is delivery. That is what is happening under Prime Minister Turnbull, that is what was happening under Communications Minister Turnbull and that is something that this lot on the other side have simply never managed to achieve because they are completely incompetent when it comes to delivery. Let's talk about the export agreements through which Australia is engaging with the growing economies in Asia and the terrific opportunities for our exporters. Under the China free trade agreement the tariff on fresh and frozen beef cuts has already been cut from 12 per cent to 9.6 per cent. By 2024, it will be zero. Under our Korea free trade agreement the tariff on fresh beef has already been cut from 40 per cent to 32 per cent. That is delivery.  We are delivering on health care. Despite the extraordinarily misleading claims made by the Labor Party in this last election, bulk-billing is at record levels under a Turnbull government. We are investing more in localised mental health care and support. Our ambitious $1.1 million National Innovation and Science Agenda is being implemented. Innovation and science is being supported by responsible guaranteed funding of schools, which will increase by 26 per cent over the next four years. Let's talk about border protection, where the Turnbull government is delivering. It has been almost 800 days since a boat arrival. We have been able to close 17 detention centres. When it comes to border protection, you do not hear Labor having anything credible to say. We have a proud record of delivery-and that is before I even get to talking about the $50 billion infrastructure program which we are delivering and continue to deliver. This motion asks: 'What has been achieved in the last 12 months?' I will tell you what has been achieved in the last 12 months. Flinders Link, an extension of the Adelaide rail network to Flinders University-$43 million committed in June of this year. Forrestfield Airport Link, an 8.5-kilometre extension of the Perth rail network to connect to Forrestfield near the Perth Airport-$490 million committed in May this year. Gold Coast Light Rail Stage 2, construction of a 7.3-kilometre light rail system-$95 million committed by the Turnbull government. Sods were turned in August 2016 for stage 2, and I was very pleased to be at that sod-turning. WestConnex, an extraordinarily important project that will link Sydney's west and south-west with the CBD-a 33-kilometre continuous free-flowing motorway. M4 East tunnelling began in July 2016. That is delivery. We are getting on with the Turnbull government delivering. The Gateway Upgrade North project in Brisbane, an 11.3-kilometre widening from four lanes to six lanes between Nudgee and Bracken Ridge. Major works commenced in February 2016. The Tullamarine Freeway upgrade to widen and upgrade the freeway between the Melbourne Airport and Melrose Drive. Work commenced in May 2016. In Adelaide-the north-south corridor, the Darlington Upgrade, a reconfiguration of a section of South Road into an expressway standard road. Work commenced in April 2016. Across every aspect of this government's activities, we are delivering. What has been delivered by the Leader of the Opposition? We have seen a complete failure to act on Senator Dastyari taking payments from Chinese owned companies. We have seen $40,000 pay cut to the member for Fenner to accommodate that old-style socialist hack 'Senator Kim Il-Carr'. That is what we are seeing in terms of comparative wage justice from the Leader of the Opposition! And we have seen the Leader of the Opposition imposing silence on the member for Grayndler. The member for Grayndler has been barely heard of in some four question times. I wonder why the member for Grayndler is never allowed to get a question under this Leader of the Opposition? By contrast, what you are seeing from this side of the House, from the Turnbull government, is a consistent pattern of delivery. Just today we have announced a way forward in relation to the plebiscite on same-sex marriage. We have announced the date when that will be held. We are carrying out the action we committed to carrying out during the 2016 election. We are delivering. Just today you have seen us announce agreement with the opposition in relation to $6 billion of budget savings. We are doing what the people expect the Turnbull government to do, which is to get on and get the budget under control.  This is a government which is delivering. We have had a year of delivery. Of course there is much more to do, but we are determined to create in this country the growth, the jobs, the prosperity and the opportunity to back Australians to achieve everything they want to achieve. That is what we are focused on. We are not focused on inside-the-Beltway political games. We have had 12 months of delivery, and there is much more to come.",73
179,Mr HAMMOND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," I must say I am very pleased that the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Maribyrnong, has phrased the matter of public importance in the manner in which he has. If we had been asked to debate the topic of what it is the Prime Minister has actually done, I would have sat down by now. Whenever I am asked to reflect upon what it is that the Prime Minister has actually done in the last 12 months, I cannot help but keep coming back to Monty Python's Life of Brian, in that famous scene in which the People's Front of Judea asked, 'What have the Romans ever done for us?' But the problem is that, like most sequels, it is horribly disappointing, because unlike in Life of Brian, in which the People's Front of Judea are able to reel off quite a lot of things that the Romans had actually done for them, in this sequel what we have seen is a Prime Minister who has failed to deliver any single thing of substance in the course of the last 12 months. Let's just dig down a little deeper in relation to what it is the Prime Minister has failed to deliver. You heard it in question time. In the course of the issue of marriage equality, he inherited a flawed plebiscite concept from the honourable member for Warringah. The Prime Minister could have done something. He could have led from the front, and he could have made marriage equality a reality with the stroke of a pen, but he has failed to deliver on marriage equality. You might ask yourself: what is it that the Prime Minister has done in relation to the issue of health? Well, he has failed to deliver in the last 12 months in relation to the issue of health care. Perhaps we should reflect on that further. Perhaps we can concede there are a couple of things he has done. ",76
180,Mr HAMMOND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, I am happy to talk about the fact that he created a Medicare privatisation task force, and I am very happy to talk about the fact that the Prime Minister has proposed and backed in $650 million of cuts to Medicare, which affects mums and dads and the community who desperately need pathology services the most. You might ask yourself what it is that the Prime Minister has actually done in his first year of office on education. Let's look back at what the Prime Minister has done in relation to education in the last 12 months. He said this to Fran Kelly: 'you could make a very powerful case' to stop funding at a federal government level to government schools. But then he also said this: No Coalition Federal Government, I suspect no Federal Government, would retreat from funding and continuing to support the non-government school sector … What we can take away from all of that is that the Prime Minister has failed to deliver any single thing in relation to education in the last 12 months.  What about mums and dads? What has the Prime Minister delivered for mums and dads in the last 12 months? Well, he has not really concentrated on mums and dads. What he has done is deliver a $50 billion tax cut in relation to big business. ",76
181,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE, The member for Barker will be quiet.,77
182,Mr HAMMOND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,A $50 billion tax cut-that is what he has promised. Ms Ryan interjecting,77
183,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Lalor is not in her place and will be quiet.,77
184,Mr HAMMOND,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And, of that $50 billion, what has he done? He has promised-he has not even delivered, but he has promised-$7.4 billion of that to the big four banks. What are we doing in relation to the big four banks? We want to hold them to account by calling them into a royal commission. That is what we are doing, and this Prime Minister has done nothing. The Prime Minister has failed to deliver, in the last 12 months, anything meaningful at all as far as the National Broadband Network goes. In my home town, in the federal electorate of Perth, not one single home has got or will get the National Broadband Network in the next term of government. Mums and dads in the federal electorate of Perth do not think 'NBN' stands for 'National Broadband Network'; they think it stands for 'not before never', because we are never going to see it. We are never going to see it under this Prime Minister if his last 12 months is anything to go by. In relation to infrastructure, the member for Bradfield boasted about infrastructure projects that he says he has delivered. In my home town of Perth, there are only three infrastructure projects of the 76 promised. Seventy-six of those projects are being delivered into Liberal and coalition electorates. That is an abject failure of infrastructure in this term of government. We are not left with a single thing in the last 12 months. Not so far, not so good. (Time expired)",77
185,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The free-ranging conversation is getting too loud. I suspect the divisions that will follow this MPI might be important to members in this House, and I suggest that they tone it down. Mrs SUDMALIS (Gilmore) (15:43): Matters of public importance are supposed to be just that: matters of importance, not a cowardly attack on achievements or a person individually. But I have learned over the past couple of years that Labor only cares about the negative, not the positive. Labor determines success by acts of bullying rather than the skills of negotiation and conciliation. So let's do what I love best, and that is talking about the positive. It actually goes on very well with the theme set by the last speaker. Monty Python said, 'Always look on the bright side of life.' So let's do all those things and look there. We need to look at the activities, outcomes and achievements of the Turnbull government, because, in reality, to look at the positive is easier, it is better for our nation and it is better for our people. From spring last year to spring now, we know that we are an economic aspiration for other developed nations, with our strong economy and strengthening budget measures. Our economic growth has gotten to 3.3 per cent, meaning that we now have faster growth than any of the G7 economies.  We have legislated some of the world's toughest measures relating to multinational tax avoidance, which has been a hot issue locally, that my local people requested to make some of the huge profit making international businesses pay the correct amount of tax. We have put legislation in place so that the small businesses, like my local IGAs, will be able to have a fair go at competing against big businesses, which helps them to keep their market share. On the national front, almost 220,000 jobs have been created over the past year, with more than 60 per cent of these jobs going to women. Let me tell those who sit opposite: getting women into work is a catalyst of social change, particularly in rural and regional areas. Those sitting opposite will whinge and complain that a large proportion of the jobs gained are only part time. Many of the unemployed people in Gilmore would love to get part-time work, as it gives them a balance to their other favourite activities. Getting rid of Labor's so-called Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal has meant my local owner drivers can get back on the road. Mark and Allen, my dairy farmers, and the drivers for the meat processing works are unbelievably pleased about saving both their rigs and their mortgages. I cannot wait for the PaTH program to start, and neither can a number of businesses and job seekers living in my electorate. Preparing, trialling and then perhaps getting hired for a job is a great strategy for young people living in families where there is no role model of a working adult. Yesterday at HMAS Albatross, the Chief of Navy, Vice Admiral Tim Barrett, along with hundreds of Navy personnel under the command of Captain Simon Bateman and our newly appointed Commodore Chris Smallhorn of the Fleet Air Arm, took delivery of our last MH60R Seahawk 'Romeo' helicopter. That brings 24 to our local base. Their trained crews and families number in the hundreds. This completes the first half a billion dollars of investment into my local Navy base. There is another half a billion dollars to come, included in the already begun program of unmanned defence technology piloted by our local, very-skilled Defence workforce. We have put legislation through to crack down on terrorists and keep our people safe. We have made strong progress on the NBN, with over three million Australian premises now being able to connect to the NBN, which is over 1.2 million Australian homes and businesses as active customers. The new NBN Sky Muster satellite service is delivering high speed broadband. Let me tell you: I have all three types of NBN in my area, and that is including 31,855 ready-for-service homes and businesses in Gilmore. As for our trade agreements with China, Japan and South Korea-well, what can I say? I have wine growers, shellfish farmers, dairy farmers and even mushroom growers, skin-care manufacturers like Nowchem, and alpaca meat processors all champing at the bit to get into the game of making money from exports. We have made many medicines cheaper and added life-saving drugs, including those for breast cancer and melanoma, to the PBS. In November this year, one of my favourites will be added-the vaccination against shingles for people aged between 70 and 79. In Gilmore, we have Waminda, an Indigenous women's health network getting great outcomes. They got $764,000 over three years. I worked hard for the $2 million for Triple Care Farm for their youth detox centre.  We are investing more in localised mental health care and support. In particular, we have the $2 million development at the UOW Shoalhaven campus to help with mental health care. It is now going to be the call centre for Lifeline. In addition, we are implementing our National Ice Action Strategy, including almost $300 million over four years to improve treatment. I think we have done a lot in just a year, and it is all for the people of Australia and our national feeling of success. We are absolutely going to look on the bright side of life.",77
186,Mr GEORGANAS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Last year, on 15 September 2015, the member for Wentworth was sworn in as the 29th Prime Minister of Australia. I have to say that even I, as a member of the Australian Labor Party for over 30 years and entrenched in Labor politics, felt a glimmer of hope. I thought that the attitude of this place was going to change, the threeword slogans were going to be out the window-that there was going to be a clear plan for Australia and perhaps a Prime Minister that may leave a legacy behind that this place is better after he left than when he came. But how disappointed was I, and how disappointed were the thousands and millions of Australians around this nation? To mark the one-year anniversary, we are witnessing one headline after another-and what are those headlines? Every major paper across this country is asking the same question: what has the Prime Minister achieved? The answer, quite unanimously, appears to be: not much. Whether you are listening to reporters on the TV, in newspaper articles or on the radio, the answer is unanimous-and it appears to be: not too much. It must be a real concern for the government when their very own former Victorian Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett, who has held executive positions on their national body and on their state body in Victoria, when asked in a television interview, was not able to name one achievement-not one. What does it say about the coalition government's confidence in its leader when not even the Deputy Prime Minister can come up with an answer? When he was asked by Barrie Cassidy on ABC's Insiders what their best achievements were, the only answer he could come up with was that they had won the last election. This must be really concerning for the Liberal Party, the coalition and the government. It is also concerning that the Senate today ran out of work to do, and the senators were reduced to talking about all sorts of absolutely unrelated things just to fill in time. Not only that, last week they all decided to go home early. Australians see this. It is reflected in the polls that coincide with the one-year anniversary, which show that the Prime Minister's approval ratings were lower than the Labor leader's. So what, exactly, has the Prime Minister achieved in 12 months? Well, for one, he has sorely disappointed his supporters by not being able to take a stance on many important policies. On so many issues such as climate change, health care and education, the PM is following the right-wing fringe of his party instead of leading the country. It is like they are riding a horse and they have the reins in their hands and they turn his head and direct him in any which way they wish. He has threatened our education system by saying you could make a very powerful case for the federal government to stop funding public schools. We know that he still plans to cut Medicare. He still plans to give a $50 billion tax cut to big business and  the banks. These are his achievements. He refuses to stand up and protect penalty rates and he has also learned nothing from the brutal election results, where he lost a number of seats. The Prime Minister must understand that these policies hurt real people. They hurt people in our electorates; they hurt the Australian public. They have an impact on local jobs and local schools, and the ability of people to access basic services. The overwhelming feeling in the community is one of great disappointment and, as I said, I share that feeling. Motherhood statements are not actions. Getting up and performing opera in this place for your fans on the other side is not governing. Unless those statements are followed up with policy, action, conviction and leadership, they are just empty words. I am worried about the future. The Prime Minister made promises to the good constituents in my electorate and Australia. We have seen many things in his first year: setting up the Medicare privatisation task force and cutting $650 million from bulk-billing incentives for pathology services. As I said, he wants to give big business a $50 billion tax cut while at the same time cutting from those lower- (Time expired)",79
187,Ms PRICE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," It really is a joke-and we have heard a bit of comedy here today-the Labor Party's MPI on failure, particularly a failure to deliver, considering their woeful record on delivering in the bush during their six years in office. It is also unfathomable that they have the audacity to discuss failures, given that they were widely known as a deeply chaotic government that rarely had Australia's interests at the forefront whilst they were in office and raking up debt that left our country with a whopping interest payment of $1 billion a month. The Labor leader failed yet again another test as opposition leader. Illustrating his complete failure to lead, he sat idly by and did not have the political fortitude to sack one of his factional lieutenants-well-known Senator 'Shanghai' Sam. There are many other colourful names, but that is my preference. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has delivered right across Australia. A number of projects and initiatives in Durack got off the ground on the Prime Minister's watch. I would like now to educate those opposite. In January I announced a women's resource centre in Fitzroy would be receiving $150,000 from the Turnbull government to address domestic and family violence in the community. This is part of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children announced by the government last November. It is a very important initiative. The funding was for the women's resource centre to offer workshops promoting and enhancing safety and well-being of women and children in the communitytackling one of our national shames. In May two Durack organisations were awarded Australian Small Business Advisory Services grants. The Karratha Business Enterprise Centre and the Small Business Centre East Kimberley will receive $600,000 over the next three years to provide low-cost advice to tourism small businesses and start-ups, which will be of great assistance to them. Tourism small business is a vital economic driver of local economies throughout not just the Pilbara but Australia more broadly. What about the Defence white paper that was released in February, again under Prime Minister Turnbull's watch? This white paper was not just about submarines and frigates; this paper included increasing Defence spending by two per cent and a number of upgrades to incredibly important Defence facilities in my electorate of Durack. RAAF bases Curtin and Learmonth will be upgraded to support the RAAF's new strike and air combat capabilities.  The Harold E Holt communications facility in Exmouth, which the Minister for Defence, Marise Payne, and I visited in April, will be upgraded to support communications capabilities and enhanced space situational awareness. The investments in my electorate of Durack and across Australia will boost the economy in Durack and further add to this country's recent excellent economic growth of 3.3 per cent, which we heard previously from the minister is better than any of the G7 members' economies. That does not sound like a failure to me. The boost in the economy will also lead to further job creation, which is a hallmark of this government, with almost 220,000 jobs created in the last year. I am very proud to say that 60 per cent of those jobs are being filled by women and many of those are in my electorate. The Dob in a Dealer campaign was launched in two places in my electorate: in Broome and in Geraldton. This campaign, which is part of the Turnbull government's National Ice Action Strategy, will get real results in this government's efforts to tackle the ice scourge in Australia. The campaign raises awareness of methamphetamine use and encourages people to contact Crime Stoppers to help tackle the manufacturing and distribution of the drug in their area. As I have said numerous times in this chamber, ice is a massive problem throughout regional, rural and remote Australia, and every single measure like this strategy will play a role in decreasing ice use across the country and start to mend communities. This is just the flavour of our commitments and what we have achieved in the last 12 months. The time allotted here today does not allow me to mention all of them. On closing I would like to say that, thankfully, we on this side are in control. We are the adults. We have achieved a lot. Thankfully it is us who are in control, not the rabble on the opposite side.",80
188,Dr ALY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," I have been sitting here for about the last half an hour really keen and eager to hear about the achievements of this government in the last year. When given an opportunity to speak for 10 minutes on their achievements the member for Bradfield spent 6½ minutes talking about the Labor Party. I find it quite astounding that when he was given an opportunity to speak for 10 minutes about their own achievements all he could muster up was 3½ minutes to talk about them. I find that really quite astounding. I have to agree with my colleagues here. The year that has passed, which started for some of us-some people in Australia and certainly some people in my electorate-with so much promise, with so many promises of a different kind of government, has delivered nothingnothing but disappointment. So many have asked: where is the Prime Minister? Where is the Prime Minister they hoped for? Where is the strong moral leadership that many Australians so eagerly crave? On issue after issue, this Prime Minister has dithered and danced to the beat of his extreme right-wing friends. It reminds me of a saying that we have in Arabic that the man might be the head of the house but the woman is the neck that moves the head. It certainly is the case here, where the Prime Minister might be the head of his party but the neck that moves that head is certainly within the right-wing of that party. An opposition member: It's certainly not a woman either.",81
189,Dr ALY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And it is not a woman! Nowhere is this more evident than in the less than impressive report card given to the Prime Minister by those within his own ranks, who one would expect would be spruiking the achievements of this government-indeed, if there were any. So let us just do a little bit of a stocktake here. Let us see: in this first year, as the 29th  Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull has got a rather unenviable list of achievements, the first, of course, being the setting up of a Medicare privatisation task force. What about cutting $650 million from bulk-billing incentives for pathology services? There is an achievement you all can be proud of. What about giving big business a $50 billion tax cut, of which $7.4 billion will go to the big four banks? There is a big achievement. But, wait a minute, if you go into Cowan and talk to the people that I represent, what about the NBN? Now, there is an achievement you all can be proud of. The Prime Minister calls himself a feminist but he has five fewer female members in the House than his predecessor. Now, there is an achievement. He has crowed on about how he has a very solid working majority. What happened last week? What did we see last week? It was such an achievement. A majority government lost a House of Representatives vote for the first time since 1962. What an achievement. And his much-touted 25 pieces of 'new legislation' were not actually new at all-one had been on the Notice Paper for over 1,000 days. Let me make mention as well of the issue of border security. One of the previous speakers talked about the last 800 days. Last I counted, a year has only 365 days. Am I right? Opposition members: Yes.",81
190,Dr ALY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let us not forget that Mr Turnbull has suggested that the solution to the housing affordability crisis is that wealthy parents should shell out for their kids to help them buy a house. Now, there is an achievement. I guess it is all part of the PM's latest slogan-so far, so good. And is it any wonder that everyone agrees with the member for Warringah, Mr Tony Abbott, when he says the reality is that this government has been in office but not in power? So far, so good.  deliver a message to those opposite, so I thought what I would do was put it in a language they could understand. I am channelling Clinton-Gore 1992: 'It's the economy, stupid.' Let us look at our economic achievements over the last 12 months. Of course, our economy and our budget are strengthening. Those opposite might not realise it, but we have an economy that is growing at 3.3 per cent. This means that the Australian economy is growing faster than any other economy in the G7. In my language, that is an achievement. The member for Lilley-who is gracing us with his presence this afternoon, and I appreciate that-even understands that that is an achievement. What does it mean for jobs?   outside of this place is that 220,000 new jobs have been created in the last 12 months. For those opposite who want to talk about gender inequality, 60 per cent of those jobs were created for Australian women. That is an economic achievement. I appreciate that some of the new members of this place would not know this, but in the last government they were pretty cool and pretty keen to kill off 30,000 small business operators who drove in the transport industry. The Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal-remember that? Member for Lilley, you were here in the last parliament. Do you remember that? That is 30,000 jobs-small businesses.",82
191,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Opposition members interjecting  South Australia. Let's talk about naval shipbuilding. In the six years that those opposite were in government there was not one order, not one ship. They did not even order a dinghy-not one. I will tell you what we have done. We have invested $195 billion in defence capability. We are going to acquire 54 new builds. Some opposite want to talk about the NBN. Dr Aly interjecting the former member for Cowan in this place. Let me tell you something about the NBN. In my electorate, when I came to government in September 2013-statistics here-zero connections to the NBN. Not one. In the three years of our government, including the last 12 months, we managed to connect 28,423 people to the NBN. That is an achievement. What we have is fibre to the node and what you had was fibre to the press release-and the Australian people know it. If we are talking about telecommunications, let us talk about the mobile phone black spot program. In six years in government, what did you deliver for the bush? A big fat zero. The member for Solomon over there should know something about regional communications-a big fat zero. What are we delivering? $228 million for mobile phones in the bush. Those opposite want to talk about leadership. They want to talkMr Dreyfus interjecting him. I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. I really should not call him by that term, but he kind of earns it. Those opposite want to talk about leadership. You know what I have observed over the last two weeks, not 12 months? I have seen an absolute lack of leadership from 'Brown Paper Bill'. Sam Dastyari-'Senator Dim Sum', or 'Shanghai Sam' as he is known by somebrown paper bags et al",82
192,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Order, member for Barker! I call the member for Isaacs.",83
193,Mr Dreyfus,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Barker should know better. He has been here for more than a term. He should use parliamentary language. He should use the titles by which members of this place are entitled to be addressed. And he owes an apology to the House and a withdrawal.",83
194,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is a free-ranging debate, but I will remind the member for Barker to tone his language down.  Sam Dastyari. I thank you for your indulgence.",83
195,Ms HUSAR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Today I am rising to speak about the government's achievements over the last 12 months, since-what is his name again; Malcolm Turnbull; that's right- Mr Turnbull, 'the member for net worth', took office.",83
196,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I will remind the member to refer to members by their title.,83
197,Ms HUSAR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Absolutely. You would think a government attuned to the feeling of the nation right now would use this opportunity to fess up and admit they have an awful lot of making up to do for the abject failure and disappointment of the last year. You would think  the recent election would at least provide some point of reflection for members opposite-oh, he has left-because the Australian people were pretty clear in the brutalising result for Malcolm Turnbull's Liberal government. The Prime Minister's lack of vision led to the loss of 14 seats across Australia. Smile all you like. The government's so-called win literally could not have been narrower. Communities right across Australia sent a clear message to those opposite, but it seems the message was lost on the Prime Minister and each of the coalition members we have heard from this afternoon. For their benefit in particular, the message was simple: start paying attention to the real issues that people care about in their day-today lives. Stop meddling with Medicare and quit this obsessive preoccupation with ripping money out of health and hospitals and handing big tax breaks to hugely already profitable companies. Start delivering on your education promises and reverse the government's abandonment of the Gonski model that you promised to match. Stop trying to distract from the real issues affecting working people and stop giving a green light to the right-wing of your party to go on ideological crusades that are divisive, expensive and downright indulgent. This government lurches from disappointment to disappointment, humiliation to humiliation. They cannot seem to go a fortnight without another stuff-up. When will it stop? When will this government start talking about the real issues facing the people in this country? It is a pretty clear indictment on the Prime Minister's failed year of leadership when his own people cannot name a single achievement. The Prime Minister's own colleagues decided to desert him and headed home early in the very first week of parliament-day 2-as if they had been elected to lounge around in their own self-importance and skip out on discussing the things that matter. The Prime Minister's personal failure with regard to the NBN will surely be viewed in years to come as the largest and most harmful infrastructure failure of our time. He calls himself a feminist, but has five fewer female members in the House than Tony Abbott did. He is out of touch. He failed to appoint a minister for small business until the community reacted with outrage. There was the $50 billion corporate tax cut to the big end of town, while his Treasurer flies around the country lecturing working men and women about living within their means. And the suggestion that the serious issue of housing unaffordability could be solved by getting wealthy parents to shell out for you is an outrage. His own MPs describe his performance as wishy-washy and his senators are told to review their favourite TV shows in the chamber instead of discussing anything real or meaningful. When I was looking for his list of achievements, I dug deep. I even consulted Google and this is what it returned-that is all we could get: blank white paper. It is simply not good enough, and I hear time after time that people expect more. This is not some frivolous issue to be dismissed as opportunism from our side. It speaks to the serious lack of delivery from this government and the impact it is having on local communities. My electorate of Lindsay has the most under-pressure hospital in our state, Nepean Hospital, which looks after 350,000 people in Western Sydney. More than half of the emergency patients are forced to wait longer than the national benchmark of four hours to be admitted. I hear, time after time, stories of patients having to wait 15 hours or more to be admitted into the emergency department. I hear constantly from our nurses and our doctors, who provide exceptional care but are frustrated year after year by Liberal government budget  cuts and policy indifference. I expect that, if you stopped anyone on the streets in my electorate in Penrith, St Marys, Emu Plains, Jordon Springs or Kingswood, they would beg this Prime Minister to stop throwing away $170 million on a wasteful and unnecessary opinion poll and direct the money to the local hospital instead. That is on top of the $50 billion handout to big business that will gift more than $7 billion directly to Australia's big four banks, the most profitable banking industry in the world-I should get a job there-and one which is ridden by systemic failures that cripple hard working customers and small businesses for nothing more than profiteering. The people on the streets of Lindsay would tell this Prime Minister to use this money to reverse the cuts to bulk-billing and pathology services, reinstate a proper school funding model and build a proper NBN in the suburbs of Lindsay where they cannot even access ADSL at the moment. The people of Lindsay and Australia deserve more.",83
198,Mr SUKKAR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," I suppose we got what we deserved with such a tawdry, hopeless MPI today. This has been one of the less inspiring debates, I must say, particularly from those opposite. Let's just try and look at some facts. When we look at the success or otherwise of a government, we by definition on this side of the House have a different set of criteria. I remember very vividly during the Gillard years that their measure of success was how many pieces of legislation they rammed through this parliament. I quite often remember Gillard or Rudd or a minister at the time talking about X hundred pieces of legislation or regulation that they had passed through here. That is not our definition of success on this side of the House. When I look at the success of a government, I look at the scoreboard. A number of members on this side of the House have spoken about the scoreboard, and one of the most important scores is our GDP figures. We are growing at 3.3 per cent per annum. I know members opposite take that for granted, but we are the fastest growing economy in the G7 and that is what is going to underpin our prosperity into the future. It will assist in addressing the most significant issue of our time, which unfortunately does not appear to be in the speaking notes of those opposite, and that is repairing the budget. All we hear from those opposite and from the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow front-bench is talk about a constituency or a group that they want to spend more money on. The reality is that this government is focused on ensuring that we get our fiscal house in order. Until the Labor Party accept that that is one of the existential challenges not only for this side of parliament but also for our entire parliament, they will be languishing in opposition, because the Australian people instinctively understand that a government is no different to their families and no different to a small business. We must start living within our means. When all I hear from those opposite is 'Liberal cuts' and 'Liberals reducing spending', it is a mark of success, because until government starts living within its own means all we are doing is burdening the next generation with higher taxes. Every dollar we borrow now is a tax that our children and our grandchildren will have to pay into the future. When we are looking at the markers of success, that figure alone indicates that this government is showing leadership and stewardship of the economy. But we do not take credit for it. The Labour Party take credit for successes in the economy. We take some credit, but we ultimately accept that it is hard working private individuals who must take  credit for those things. That is why we want to empower them. We want to ensure that they can harness their creative talents to improve the economy. The second marker of success that those opposite do not talk about, and that we seldom get questions about in question time, is national security. The fact that we are very blessed in this country to have a security environment that, in my view, many jurisdictions around the world would wish for is a credit to the government, but I will also say that it is a credit to this entire parliament. I give credit particularly to the Leader of the Opposition for ensuring that our agenda to strengthen our national security has not been scuppered by the hard left of the Labor Party, whose views on national security we know about instinctively. That is- (Time expired)",85

(e) Reports of the committee under paragraph (d) shall be treated as having been adopted when they are presented. Reports shall be published in Hansard. (f) A referral by determination of the Selection Committee pursuant to paragraph (a)(ii) or (a)(iii), once the determination has been reported to the House, is deemed to be a referral by the House. It is not my intention to delay the House unnecessarily by debating this first tranche of standing order changes. I have, for the benefit of the House, put two notices of motion to change the standing orders. The first, which we are dealing with now, is the standing order reforms suggested by the Procedure Committee and the Petitions Committee from the 44th Parliament. The second group is the suggestions to change the way we schedule the parliament, and we will deal with those separately. It is my understanding that the opposition is opposed to some of these changes in both of these different notices of motion, and it is not my intention to truncate constructive debate. However, if the debate becomes not constructive, then I reserve the right to do so. The first tranche of reforms to the standing orders has been proposed by the Clerk and, in some instances, by the Petitions Committee or by the Procedure Committee, to make clear certain practices that the House has adopted over recent years, particularly because of technological changes-for example, in the way that we operate in our daily working liveswhich have not been reflected in the standing orders. These are particularly around things like e-petitions, to make it easier for committees and for the parliament to operate and to put some of those conventions, if you like, in the standing orders. This makes it easier for the person occupying the chair to be able to interpret what the House wants and how we want our  arrangements to be managed by the chair, and it makes changes to the standing orders that allow the Federation Chamber and this chamber itself to operate more effectively and efficiently. The changes will establish the general purpose standing committees in the way that we have outlined previously and, as the member for Grayndler has correctly pointed out, will not continue with the Library Committee, which has been omitted from this 45th Parliament. The changes will also continue the arrangements around the Selection Committee that were in place in the 44th Parliament. I would have thought most of these matters were entirely non-controversial, and I would be very surprised if they were opposed by the opposition or, for that matter, the crossbenchers. We have, as they say these days, socialised these changes with the crossbenchers, and I am hoping that we will garner support for the changes that are proposed by the Clerk, the Petitions Committee and the Procedure Committee. That is the first motion. I should point out to the crossbenchers that I have been studying their letter to me about other changes to the standing orders. That remains a live prospect for us in the future, but we want to get these machinery changes to the standing orders done first. We then of course want to change the sitting pattern of the House. I understand the Manager of Opposition Business does not want to finish at 8 pm as a hard finish, which I think will come as a surprise to many people on both sides of the House, particularly those with young families. But, nevertheless, we will deal with that matter next. I hope that we will garner the support of the crossbenchers for these machinery changes. With regard to the further changes that they propose, I am happy to keep talking about those within the government and to the crossbenchers, because I think there is merit in some of them. There are some where I do not believe there is merit to them, but I do believe there is merit in others, and I will continue to talk to the crossbenchers about those matters.",92
209,Mr BURKE,MOTIONS," The Leader of the House is nearly accurate. When he says that there are some aspects of his amendments to standing orders that are not controversial, that is true-for example, changes to petitions. Allowing e-petitions is something that has been sought in the House for a long time, and it is good to see a first step happening with that in standing orders. But it is quite disingenuous to claim that what was put in a joint letter from the crossbenchers and I to the government some time ago now is something that they still need to spend time reflecting on and considering, when they have been able to rush through changes that deal with what happens when you want to conduct a vote for a second time. I move: (1) Omit proposed standing order 132. (2) Omit proposed standing order 215(d), substitute: (d) Each committee appointed under paragraph (a) shall consist of seven members: four government Members and three non-government Members, provided that if a non-aligned Member is appointed to a committee, such committee shall consist of eight members: four government Members, three non-government Members, and one non-aligned Member. Each committee may have its membership supplemented by up to four members for a particular inquiry, with a maximum of two extra government and two extra opposition or non-aligned Members. Supplementary members shall have the same participatory rights as other members, but may not vote. (3) Omit proposed standing order 222, substitute: 222 Selection Committee  (a) A Selection Committee shall be appointed to: (i) arrange the timetable and order of committee and delegation business and private Members' business for each sitting Monday in accordance with standing orders 39 to 41; (ii) select private Members' notices and other items of private Members' and committee and delegation business for referral to the Federation Chamber, or for return to the House; (iii) recommend items of private Members' business to be voted on. Three members of the committee are sufficient to recommend an item to be voted on; (iv) select bills that the committee regards as controversial or as requiring further consultation or debate for referral to the relevant standing or joint committee in accordance with standing order 143. One member of the committee is sufficient to select a bill for referral; and (v) subject to standing order 1, set speaking times for second reading debates. (b) The committee shall consist of eleven members: the Speaker, or in the absence of the Speaker the Deputy Speaker, the Chief Government Whip or his or her nominee, the Chief Opposition Whip or his or her nominee, the Third Party Whip or his or her nominee, three government Members, two opposition Members and two non-aligned Members. The Speaker shall be the Chair of the committee. A quorum shall be three members of the committee. (c) For committee and delegation business and private Members' business, the committee may determine the order of consideration of the matters, and the times allotted for debate on each item and for each Member speaking. (d) Any non-aligned Member who has a notice of motion or order of the day on the Notice Paper may attend a meeting of the committee to advocate for its selection. (e) In relation to committee and delegation business and private Members' business the committee must report its determinations to the House in time for its decisions to be published on the Notice Paper of the sitting Thursday before the Monday being considered. In relation to bills the committee must report its determinations as soon as practical in respect of each bill or each group of bills. (f) Reports of the committee under paragraph (d) shall be treated as having been adopted when they are presented. Reports shall be published in Hansard. (g) A referral by determination of the Selection Committee pursuant to paragraph (a)(ii) or (a)(iii), once the determination has been reported to the House, is deemed to be a referral by the House. This amendment omits the change which is proposed by the Leader of the House to standing order 132. He says, 'You only told me 10 days ago.' How long do we think they have been considering a need to change this standing order? The proposed change to 132 deals with this: (b) If a division has miscarried through misadventure caused by a Member being accidentally absent or some similar incident, any Member may move on the same sitting day, without notice and without the need for a seconderThat the House divide again. At the moment, a suspension of standing orders is required to do that. At the moment what happens is that both sides have to agree to have the absolute majority required for the suspension of standing orders that it is reasonable to have the vote a second time. The Leader of the House wants to push through a change that is all about his humiliation last Thursday. That is what this is about. There is one reason that this has been brought forward and the issues that were contained in the letter have not been brought forward, and that is that there is a special urgency for the Leader of the House to change the rules when people do not turn up for a vote.

210,Mr BURKE,MOTIONS,This is great. I will take that interjection. The Leader of the House says that it has nothing to do with when people do not turn up. ,100
211,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The Leader of the House has had a speaking opportunity.,100
212,Mr BURKE,MOTIONS,"Let me read the proposed amendment to standing order 132. It says: (a) If confusion, or error concerning the numbers reported by the tellers, occurs and cannot be corrected, the House shall divide again. (b) If a division has miscarried through misadventure caused by a Member being accidentally absent or some similar incident, any Member may move on the same sitting day, without noticeThe reason that this is being pushed forward today without agreement, when he is unwilling to deal with the issues that were put forward in the joint letter from the opposition and the crossbench, is simple: the Leader of the House had a humiliation last Thursday and he is determined to be able to promise the Prime Minister that it will never happen again. What he is trying to do in this motion and the motion we will deal with next is change the rules to cover the fact that the members of his own side cannot be guaranteed to be here when votes are taking place. ",100
213,Mr BURKE,MOTIONS,"I do admire that the Leader of the House will claim that they have a working majority, when the problem is they have a majority who will not work. I admire the gall of the Leader of the House in claiming that rushing this one forward today has nothing to do with the fact that it is about trying to make up the numbers after the event when a government has lost a vote on the floor of the parliament. I admire the fact that the Leader of the House is willing to come in here and argue black is white in such a good mood. In fact, I admire that he is able to smile at all when there has never been a Leader of the House more humiliated in the last 50 years than happened to that man the last Thursday that this parliament sat. I commend the opposition's amendment to the House. The amendment also deals with issues relating to the Selection Committee, and the member for Grayndler will go through those. The reason the government originally gave for not allowing the Selection Committee to have the same formation it had from 2010 to 2013 was on the basis that they had a working majority. Well, they do not. If you have a working majority it means that, when the votes happen, you persistently have a majority. That has not been the experience of this parliament. That has not been the experience under the leadership of the Leader of the House that we currently have. The amendment that I have put forward deals with making sure both sides have to agree if we are going to conduct a division a second time round. It also deals with the fact that the Selection Committee should take the same form as the parliament had from 2010 to 2013. If it were ever going to be argued that that should not happen because the government had a working majority, that argument absolutely collapsed the last time the parliament sat on that Thursday afternoon. Those opposite remember the date. Those opposite remember their moment in history. Those opposite remember their humiliation. But the answer is not to change the rules; the answer is to turn up for a vote. The answer is to turn up to work. You do not try to change the rules to manufacture a victory when you have not had one. What you do  is you get your members of parliament to bother to turn up to work. The government has not been able to deliver that. Today is simply a shallow attempt to try to change the rules so that, if it goes wrong again for them, he can come through with his feather duster and try to clean up everything after the event. The Australian people see these changes for exactly what they are: a government in chaos with a Leader of the House and a Prime Minister who do not have a working majority in the House of Representatives or their cabinet or their party room.",100
214,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Is the amendment seconded?,101
215,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS," I do indeed second the amendment. I do so with some level of surprise that the Leader of the House has brought forward such retrograde changes to the standing orders. I remember well, after the 2010 election, the group hug when Christopher Pyne, on behalf of the coalition, signed the document, Agreement for a better parliament: parliamentary reform, on 6 September 2010. That is what our amendments go to with regard to the selection committee. During the period 2010 to 2013 we had literally hundreds of debates and votesdeterminations-by this parliament about what the members of the House of Representatives thought of issues that were relevant to their electorates and issues that were relevant to the nation. At the time, the Leader of the House said this in a media release the day after the event: The 'Agreement For A Better Parliament' negotiated between the Coalition, Labor and the Independents will amend parliamentary standing orders to establish a more independent Speaker, limit the power of the executive, increase the ability of parliament to scrutinise legislation, enhance the role of private member's business and the committee system and make question time more useful and relevant. Now, which of those positive enhancements has the Leader of the House decided is not convenient? As a result of the changes that occurred through the selection committee and through private members' business-I quote from the preamble, which was signed by Christopher Pyne, the Leader of the House, on behalf of the then opposition: … there will be a need for recognition by all to allow more MP's to be involved in various roles and debates, to allow more community issues to be tested through private members voting … These were indeed very positive amendments. They were also amendments that gave respect and standing to the crossbenchers to more fully participate in the activities of the parliament. In my view, that resulted in very good legislation, because you had consultation and you had engagement. As a result of that, we were able to pass some 595 pieces of legislation through this House without losing a single piece of legislation during that period. It was a result of a cooperative approach that respected the fact that each member of this House is representative of their electorate, has a mandate to carry out those duties as the representative of their constituency and should be treated with some respect. When I was leader of the government in the House of Representatives, with 70 votes on my side on the floor of the House of Representatives, we did not lose a vote. In three years we did not lose a vote. This mob with 76 could not survive three days without losing a vote. That is what this shabby rort of changes to standing orders are designed to do. It is a shabby  manipulation of the standing orders, so that, as the Manager of Opposition Business indicated, even if they do lose a vote, they will come back to it at another time. We know, in terms of the wording of that particular standing order, that it refers to a new division in the case of confusion, error or misadventure. We know they are confused about their policy approach; we know that they are committing errors and we know that it is a misadventure when you leave the parliament while parliament is still conducting its business. We saw that on the last sitting Thursday. I can understand that the Leader of the House, the whip and others who missed out on voting in those procedures on that Thursday are embarrassed and humiliated. I feel their pain. I went through three years being concerned. I needn't have bothered, because we on this side were organised about how we ran the parliament. People were happy to turn up to work and turn up to vote. We consulted and we organised legislation, but those on the other side have proven themselves to be incapable of doing so. I do think that the Leader of the House should perhaps reconsider some of the more draconian measures that are being put forward in these standing order propositions. After all, given the Senate performance yesterday, his performance on that Thursday looks good. I am sure he has sent a card and a note to Senator MCKenzie, thanking her for taking some of the pressure off him about his performance of his duties. So I say to the Leader of the House, if you think it is smart to get a political outcome through a manipulation of rules, you should think back to the geniuses who came up with the Senate reform proposals that resulted in there being fewer coalition senators, fewer Greens senators and more crossbench senators and that reinvigorated the One Nation party in the other chamber. Think about what happens when you think you can put in a political fix rather than engage in issues of substance and negotiate your position. You should have the confidence in your position to be able to argue things on their merits; you should have confidence in your own party room, that your members will actually turn up to votes; and you should have confidence in the power of your arguments not to be frightened of having a Selection Committee that operates properly, that chooses private members' business in an appropriate way, chooses motions to have votes on and allows for a determination in this parliament of issues that have been brought by honourable members. You should not be frightened of being able to test the power of your case, if you actually have an agenda. For a government that had no business in the Senate and has no sense of purpose-that does not have an agenda-I would have thought that voting on private members motions and bills through a Selection Committee process might help you out. It might give you something to do. You might get that sense of purpose from non-government members. If you do not proceed like this, what people will do, what you will find, very simply-it is not up to me to give advice to the crossbenchers or other members, but I have had a bit to do with them over the years-is that private members' motions get converted into private members' bills, and they will end up being just a lot of bills before the parliament. That is what will happen. Whenever you try to do a manipulation and a fix you find that there is always a way around them. I note that my friend the member for Kennedy had two private member's bills before the parliament this week. He has worked it out-he has been around this place for a whileand other people will work it out too. There are ways of getting the same outcome.  I will conclude with this: so opposed are the government to ideas that they have even knocked off the Library Committee. I await the reason for knocking off the Library Committee, but that just shows that this is an attack on the independence of this parliament, because the Library plays a very important role. (Time expired)  wish to speak briefly to the amendments moved by the Manager of Opposition Business to the motion moved by me in relation to the standing orders. He has created a great canard which needs to be dealt with, that the idea that the change to standing order 132 was conceived because of the events of September the first, as we call them on this side of the House. The events of 1 September had absolutely no bearing whatsoever on the changes to standing order 132. I proposed on 30 and 31 August to change standing order 132. I sent the proposed changes to the standing orders to the office of the Manager of Opposition Business. My office was in communication with his office about these machinery provision changes, the vast majority of which were proposed by the Petitions Committee and by the Procedure Committee. The Manager of Opposition Business responded on several of the changes-things that he regarded as noncontroversial-which we implemented. He has not responded to the rest of the changes since that time, giving the lie to the idea that the opposition wishes to cooperate in this parliament. For the first time ever, the opposition is not even giving leave for the third reading of bills that they support. Clearly, the opposition's claim that they want to cooperate is simply mealy mouthed words, because if they did want to cooperate they would continue to do what they have always done and what we did when we were in opposition, blessedly for only six years, and give leave for third reading debates. They are not doing so, because they are not trying to cooperate. That is relevant because they are not cooperating. I see that the member for MCEwen, who is in the chamber, is looking for the connection. It is relevant to this debate because, similarly, the Manager of Opposition Business has not cooperated in relation to talking to me about the machinery provisions-changes to petitions and to procedures-proposed by the Procedure Committee, which are quite clearly noncontroversial. In fact, as a mark of my good faith, I said to the Manager of Opposition Business and to the crossbenchers in the first sitting week that, even if the government did not want to propose any more changes to standing orders, we would still allow a debate on standing order reforms so that the opposition and the crossbenchers could move amendments to the standing orders, and we would facilitate that debate. So all the way along I have tried to show my cooperation with the five crossbenchers and with the opposition",101
216,Mr Albanese,MOTIONS,"You're a saint!  saint, particularly by the member for Grayndler, but the truth is that we are trying to cooperate with the opposition because we want the 45th Parliament to be a constructive parliament that is good for Australia and makes the changes that Australians need, to ensure they have jobs, to ensure growth in our economy and to do the social reforms that are necessary in our society, including marriage equality through a plebiscite, which is our policy. I have dealt with the canard of the Manager for Opposition Business that this has been as a result of 1 September. Some of the crossbenchers believe that the definition that I am seeking  to reform in the standing orders would allow the government to recommit motions in the event that people miss divisions-for example, because they have left the building. The truth is that misadventure is well understood as a convention in this building. If somebody misses a division here or in the Senate because of misadventure, like, for example, being stuck in the facilities in the building, which has occurred in the past-on that occasion, unfortunately, because the member thought a door was a push-pull door when it was a sliding door-that is clearly a misadventure. The person will remain nameless. They are no longer with us, happily. They are still alive, I should say, but they are not with us in the chamber any more.",103
217,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"The Leader of the House is getting into task. But misadventure is clearly when a member of parliament, through some error or misjudgement, misses the division. It is not because they did not have a pair and left the building. That has been very clear as a convention of this place and of the Senate for a very long time, and the government is not proposing to change that convention. I would also remind the member for Grayndler, who seems to have forgotten this particular important vignette, that the change I am trying to bring to section 132 of the standing orders is exactly the same way that the standing orders were before the 43rd Parliament. And for three years, as Leader of the House, he thought that was perfectly appropriate. He never made any attempt to change the standing orders in the 42nd Parliament to reflect his new-found love of democracy in the House of Representatives. He was forced, kicking and screaming, by the crossbenchers at the time to change standing order 132 in the 43rd Parliament. Now, of course, we face different circumstances, and it is very important for the management of the democracy in which we live, and the House of Representatives, that the will of the people be reflected in votes. That is the purpose of standing order 132-that the will of the people at the election be reflected in the votes in the parliament. Therefore, if a member, through misadventure, fails to attend the chamber but would otherwise have been here to vote either aye or nay, that vote should be recommitted, and the government should have that capacity in the standing orders, under section 132, to do so on a simple majority. That is the purpose of it.",104
218,Mr Albanese,MOTIONS,Under standing order 66,104
219,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The member for Grayndler has the call.,104
220,Mr Albanese,MOTIONS,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Under standing order 66, I would ask for an intervention to ask a question of the Leader of the House.",104
221,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,The member for Grayndler will resume his seat. This is not an order of the day; it is a notice. The Leader of the House has the call.,104
222,Mr Albanese,MOTIONS,He was on board! ,104
223,The SPEAKER,MOTIONS,"I am not letting him accept it.  believe in them firmly.  The Library Committee has been a very important part of the furniture of the parliament for a very long time, but the view has been formed by the officers of the building that the usefulness of the Library Committee is no longer such that it should be accorded priority as a committee of the parliament. The committees of the parliament, as outlined by the motion that I have moved, deal with the key issues that Australia expects us to be getting on withagriculture, communications, economics et cetera. And there is, of course, the selection committee, the Petitions Committee and so on. So there is absolutely no purpose for the Library Committee to continue and, as a consequence, we are pruning the Library Committee from the list. I have now spoken to the Manager of Opposition Business's amendment, and I obviously do not support it. I would encourage my members to continue to support the government's agenda in terms of the standing orders, and I hope that the crossbenchers now have an explanation for what the government is proposing.",104

I am assuming this will be extremely popular with the members because it will move the dinner break from 6.30 pm to 8 pm to 8 pm to 9.30 pm. This is a very important and significant change. It means 8 pm will be a hard finish-the House will rise at 8 pm. But it does not mean that the government or the House loses any time for government business or private members' business, because in fact we are increasing the hours in the Federation Chamber for private members' business.",108
248,Unknown,MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY,"Honourable members interjecting particularly delighted. He is not only relegated to the backbench, he is now relegated to the Federation Chamber. Mr Albanese interjecting  on the passing of Eoin Cameron. Many parliaments around the world are moving to second chambers and copying the Australian example. It is a very good way. In fact, Labor initiated this change. It is a very good idea to be able to have non-controversial legislation, committee reports, delegation reports, condolence motions et cetera in the second chamber. And the second chamber has been used very effectively, over a lengthy period of time, for members' 90-second statements, the grievance debate and adjournment debates. By having a hard finish at 8 pm-which is simply moving the dinner break to 8pm to 9.30 pm, which is obviously 1½ hours-and by extending the hours in the Federation Chamber for committee business, government business and private members' business, we will actually be adding an extra 1½ hours of sitting time a week across the two chambers. But the timing of 8 pm is much more sensible management of the parliament. When I first came to this place, we used to rise at 11 pm, which was never sensible. It was bad for our health. But now, in a much more modern era, people now care about their health, which they should, and they care about their families, which they should. We have many more younger families in this building represented in the parliament. Our own Minister for Revenue and Financial Services has a young family of her own. There are members on both sides of the House who have babies. I think the member for Adelaide missed one of the divisions earlier because she was tending to her young child. So these hours are much more family-friendly and sensible. We already work a very long day. But what this means is that members will be able to stay in the building and keep working past 8 o'clock. Certainly the cabinet usually sits past 8 o'clock. Committee meetings can still be held at any time. In fact, we had backbench committee meetings on our side of the House at 9 o'clock last night in relation to the plebiscite bill. The parliamentary joint standing committees can meet after 8 o'clock. Nobody would ever accuse MPs in this buildings who come to Canberra for our sitting weeks of slackening off during the week. Our members work very hard on committee work, whether they are on the front-bench or the backbench, and this will ensure that those hours are reflected in the standing orders. As I said, we will be sitting an extra 1½ hours during the week, but we will be better managing our time. This is a very significant change that should be welcome on all sides of the House. I will be very surprised if the Manager of Opposition Business opposes it. I am sure every one of his colleagues, either backbenchers or frontbenchers, would be surprised to be dragged into that particular 'Hellfire Pass' of voting against this 8 pm hard finish.",113

Each Member may speak for no longer than 90 seconds. The duration of the whole period for responses shall not exceed 10 minutes. Everything that the Leader of the House just put is inaccurate for this simple reason: we changed the sitting hours last week. What the Leader of the House just implied is that what was there beforehand, in the previous parliament, is still in the standing orders. That is not true. Last week we changed the standing orders so that on Monday and Tuesday nights the dinner break begins not at 6.30, as the Leader of the House just said, but at 7.30. The Leader of the House is trying to appeal to his backbench by saying this means you can go home at 8 o'clock. Under the current rules, if you are not speaking in a debate, you can leave for the dinner break and not have to return at 7.30. It is not about what time people leave. We dealt with that last week in a change to standing orders that the Leader of the House just completely ignored when he misled us with information about what time the dinner break currently occurs. What he has just told the House is factually wrong because he moved the change the last time the parliament sat. So why would he actually want this change? There are two things in front of us. One of them is that the adjournment question will never be put to a vote. Why do you reckon the Leader of the House might want to make sure that the adjournment question is never put to the vote? I do not think it is to do with the good health of members opposite. I think it is to do with the health of the Leader of the House, because he has had an absolute shocker ever since he became the first Leader of the House in half a century to lose votes on the floor with a majority government. That is what he has had, and now, instead of saying to the Prime Minister, 'It won't happen again, because I can make sure our members turn up for work,' or, 'It won't happen again, because we've got some party discipline back,' he is saying: 'It won't happen again, because I'll change the rules so that nothing gets put to a vote. I'll change the rules so that the parliament shuts down.' If a school has a problem with truancy, it does not decide to fix it by just shutting the school down. They have a problem with truancy on the other side, a huge problem which caused humiliation for those opposite, and they have decided to try to deal with it not by fixing the actual problem but instead by providing false information to the House-pretending that it is something to do with the good health of members opposite and that the changes that passed through this House unanimously in the previous sitting week never actually  occurred-and putting to the House a position which is about making sure that the adjournment is never voted on and that we lose another three hours a week of parliamentary time. This parliament does not sit very often, but this is a government whose members do not like the concept that, when the parliament sits, they hear different voices. When the parliament sits, they do not like the fact that different points of view are put. What they really do not like is that, wherever they go, they hear an attack on the government. They come into the parliament; there is an attack on the government. They go to their party room; there is an attack on the government. They go to a cabinet meeting, and the government is being attacked as well. Everywhere they go it is the exact same situation. That is why we have a government that does not want the parliament to meet. It does not want to schedule weeks for the parliament to meet, and when we are here those opposite want to make sure that they can take off out of here as soon as they possibly can. That is not a new principle. Those opposite decided to not even wait for the end of parliament when we were last here on the Thursday. But I love that the Leader of the House presents this to the House as though nothing happened-as though that Thursday afternoon is just so yesterday. What the Leader of the House needs to acknowledge, and what he will refuse repeatedly to deal with, is that this government, as I have said before, does not have a working majority. All it has is a majority that refuses to work, and that is what those opposite are delivering to this parliament. The Leader of the House should know this: every time you change the rules, every time you use that bare majority that you have to try to crunch through a change, do not think it will not come back another way. Last night-the spectacle of it! For more than an hour at the end of the day yesterday, the Leader of the House and the Chief Government Whip came into the House and just sat here watching in case something happened. They just sat here. They did not make contributions but just watched in case there was something that they had not quite thought of that suddenly took off in the parliament so that they were here on the spot, on the site. This was the same day that the Leader of the House had already briefed government staffers to let them know to cover all eight exits of Parliament House, to be there making sure that members of parliament could not escape the building.",114

255,Mr BURKE,MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY,which members of the parliament will leave this building and the circumstances under which they leave. Mr Dutton interjecting,117
256,Mr BURKE,MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY,"I also have an amendment which I move. There is a boom mike over there, mate. Just calm down. I also move an amendment, which is seconded by the member for Grayndler, to establish a 'take note' debate at the end of question time. The Senate has a 'take note' debate. This amendment allows members of the opposition, sometimes government  backbenchers when they have asked questions about their electorate, and certainly members of the crossbench to make 90-second statements in response to what has been said in question time. How many times have we seen answers given in this place that involve complete misrepresentation of the facts? But, because they do not involve a personal misrepresentation, there is no form of the House currently to be able to set the record straight. The Leader of the House should support this amendment. Why? Because previously he advocated for it. When the Leader of the House held this job, when he made his speech at the Institute of Public Affairs and he went through the different changes that should happen to standing orders, one of the changes that those opposite promised to bring to the House on coming to government at the 2013 election was to establish a 'take note' debate at the end of question time. So I put it to the government. We are asking no more than for the government to support a change that they previously have advocated. We expect that the government will look at this. There is no shortage of issues where we have dealt with the government coming up with a position that is the opposite of what they previously argued, but this is one where the Leader of the House has something in the exact form that he personally had previously proposed, and not only proposed but put forward as an election commitment at the 2013 election. So I urge the government members to support the Leader of the House as he was in 2013. The incarnation of what he has become in 2016 is something that only he can answer for. There is no doubt that he is a diminished figure since what happened that Thursday afternoon, but at the very least, on this amendment, we are asking the government to support no more than what they have previously advocated. Our objection to the substantive change being put forward by the government is very simple. People, when they come to Canberra, should be able to debate legislation. There is nothing about members being able to leave the chamber or leave the building that is in any way threatened by the current standing orders, because that issue was fixed last week. The only reason for the substantive amendment that has been put by the Leader of the House is this: the government is in chaos, its backbench is a shambles, and those opposite would rather abolish votes than risk having to rely on their own members to turn up for them.",117
257,The SPEAKER,MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY,Is the amendment seconded?,118
258,Mr ALBANESE,MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY," I do indeed second the amendment moved by the Manager of Opposition Business. We have had barely a week of sittings, and the parliament has been reduced to a shambles by this mob opposite. We had three years of minority government; it functioned well. We were in control not just every day, not just every hour and not just every minute but every second-every second of every sitting day we controlled the agenda in this House. The other mob: three days and it fell apart. So upset were they with each other, they were running for the doors just to get away from each other. I thought to myself, 'What is the precedent of people running from parliament?' I say this in the hope that those brilliant producers at Insiders will be listening and will get out the footage of the gazelle who ran away from a division to try to avoid voting during that parliament. They ran away from the parliament. Yesterday we had scenes in the Senate where people were not running anywhere, but perhaps they should have been. I think Senator MCKenzie regrets not running from the parliament. That embarrassing performance-the depiction of a government without an  agenda and whose senior members were incapable of giving a stump speech about their achievements one year into the government-said it all. The real problem here is that the Leader of the House and the Government Whip and the people who missed the vote missed the vote. They missed a vote. What should have happened then? Should there have been some punishment for the Leader of the House? Perhaps. Should there have been some punishment or penalty against the Chief Government Whip? That has happened. That is a rotating door. She is the third one they have had during their first term of office, so we know there are lots of precedents for that. No, they have not done that. There was no action against the Leader of the House, no action against the Chief Government Whip, no action against the ministers who missed the vote and no action against the backbenchers who missed the vote. The action is against the parliament itself. They come in here and they say, 'We know the way to avoid missing a vote in parliament: we will stop the parliament sitting!' This year we will sit for 51 days in total. We sat for three days-one day of which was ceremonial, and the second day of the actual sittings did not work out too well. So we are back here this week and then we are off again for another three weeks. This is a government in search of an agenda and in search of a reason for existence. 'What is the purpose of Malcolm Turnbull?' is what people are asking.",118
259,The SPEAKER,MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY,The member for Grayndler will refer to members by their correct titles.,119
260,Mr ALBANESE,MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY,"The current Prime Minister. They are asking: what is the purpose of a change in prime ministers if the agenda is exactly the same as the former Prime Minister's and if there is nothing new coming through? During the last parliament we sat here and had debate after debate about the unprecedented, so-called proroguing of the parliament. We came in here and we had speeches, just to fill time, about the Governor General's speech in this chamber. The Federation Chamber, which is usually used for such purposes, was not even used. We have this pretence of a new government, to the extent of having had that proroguing of the parliament. But the Leader of the House has had very different views. This is what he used to say: The people of Australia expect us to serve our electorates and legislate, not to spend 18 weeks here when we should be spending 20 or 21 or 22 weeks. That was the Leader of the House, the member for Sturt. There are too many things he said, really, to go through. One of them was: … the first point to be made is that, yet again, this government is squibbing on transparency and accountability and trying to avoid the parliament. Well, it is all coming back now, just like, in the past, when he said: Why doesn't it have to sit? There are two reasons. Firstly, it does not have a plan for the future for the Australian people. Secondly, it cannot rely on its numbers in the House. That was the member for Sturt. Well, we did all right starting at 70. They start at 76. Imagine how bad it would be-just imagine it! They would struggle to get through prayers in the morning. The Leader of the House is a big supporter of reform when he does not have to do anything about it. This is what he said to that esteemed institution, the Institute of Public Affairs. Now,  you would not say something that was untrue to the Institute of Public Affairs, because they would pick you up on it. On 30 January 2013, he said: I have long articulated the need for the creation of a 'take note' session to follow Question Time. The session would consist of a thirty minute period following Question Time which would allow a number of Members to speak on the significant matter of the day. That is what he had to say at that time. He made it very clear, and he spoke about it complementing the matter of public importance. So, I say: today is an opportunity to make that vision of the member for Sturt a reality. He can do it. He can do it by voting for it-voting for what he said very clearly on the record. He, of course, has also backed other reforms such as supplementary questions. He has backed a range of reforms. We are not putting them all forward here, but we are putting forward the best ones. He should take up this opportunity. What is good about it is that he can even claim credit for it. He can say, 'I thought of it first.' This is an opportunity, member for Sturt, to be in the vanguard of reform because the truth is that this is a parliament that is in need of some proper reform. We have got the Seinfeld Senate over there-a Senate about nothing, meeting about nothing, with no business. We have got an agenda here one sitting week after we dealt with standing orders to change the sitting times and introduce reforms so that people could essentially leave and there would not be votes, divisions or quorums called after 7.30 on Mondays and Tuesdays-something that was not controversial and something that has been welcomed. Probably government members are not aware that that change actually took place. If you are going to fix the problem, the position of the Leader of the House does not really fix it, because it is 8 o'clock and the problem you have got is that you cannot keep people till 5 o'clock. So, if you are going to solve the problem, we really should be knocking off straight after question time! I have got a bit of Italian heritage and the concept of a nap in the afternoon in Mediterranean countries is very civilised. La dolce vita. Get on board, member for Sturt. I challenge him to actually go the full hog-do what is necessary. You then will not lose a vote. But your heart is not in this half-hearted measure. Be a reformer. Be a visionary. Have some ticker and vote for the Pyne vision.  have now seen why the member for Grayndler, not the member for Maribyrnong, should be the leader of the Labor Party. We have now seen why the member for Grayndler is the people's choice of the Labor Party membership. We have now seen why the member for Grayndler is staying in the parliament. He is staying in the parliament because he wants to be the leader of the Labor Party. We have just seen a 10-minute audition by the member for Grayndler for the leadership of the Labor Party. We know that after the last election in 2013 the member for Grayndler contested the leadership of the Labor Party against the member for Maribyrnong and won the vote. He actually won the vote of the Labor Party membership and he was done in by Senator 'Kim Il' Carr. He was done in by his own faction, by the Left. But the people wanted him and that is why I dubbed him the people's choice. He still carries a candle for the Labor Party leadership. I think a lot of people on this side of the House would think he would be a much more entertaining leader than grumpy Bill.",119
261,The SPEAKER,MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY,The Leader of the House will refer to members by their correct titles.  ,120
262,Unknown,MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY,Opposition members interjecting you. Good on you. Stay here and listen to my speech. The member for Grayndler left out some key facts in his lovely reminiscing through the past glories when he was the Leader of the House.,121
263,The SPEAKER,MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY,So the Leader of the House is coming to the amendment now? ,121
264,The SPEAKER,MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY,"I have been listening to the preamble, but you are coming to the amendment?  so-called history as the Leader of the House and Manager of Opposition Business and what I apparently said in the past in various speeches. I am now returning to the subject of the member for Grayndler's reminiscing-how the standing orders apparently used to be in his period of greatness. I have in my hand not a list; I have in my hand the 61 votes that the member for Grayndler lost when he was the Leader of the House in the 43rd Parliament. In fact, he lost a further 13 when they did not reach the required 76 to be passed. In fact, in that period of time he lost 74 votes on the floor of the House, where the government was outvoted by the opposition and the crossbenchers, or just the opposition. Seventy-four votes in the 43rd Parliament were lost by the member for Grayndler as the Leader of the House, so it is rewriting of the history. All the new members of the parliament who are here listening at the feet of the member for Grayndler",121
265,Mr Fletcher,MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY,"It is Orwellian.  Infrastructure says. If you keep repeating a lie over and over again, people will believe it. The member for Grayndler would have you believe that he never lost a vote on the floor of this parliament. He lost 74 votes on the floor of the parliament-61 outright and a further 13 that did not reach the required 76. The member for Grayndler had a little trip down memory lane, reminiscing about the period when he was the Leader of the House. It reminded me very much of Pa Kettle. Pa Kettle used to stand on his veranda and ruminate. Do you have a point of order, member for Indi?",121

Earlier in the debate today, the Leader of the House referred to a letter that had been sent to him containing a number of proposed amendments to the standing orders that have the support of the crossbench and, indeed, the opposition. He said that some of those were under consideration and might be considered further in the future. We have had a number of opportunities to debate standing orders, so I say to the minister for innovation: the future is now. Now we have the opportunity to pass some of these amendments that will make this parliament work better. In the previous minority parliament, the 43rd parliament, there were a number of amendments that had been agreed to by the now Leader of the House. Those amendments included the prospect of private members having greater opportunity to not only bring their motions and bills on for debate but also have them voted on. That was signed up to by the Leader of the House at the time. They were referred to as being excellent reforms. Excellent reforms they were, because they allowed issues that might otherwise not get ventilated to be brought to the fore, debated and voted on. I can give you an example of the kind of things that happened only because we had those standing orders in place. We found out during the last parliament that there were firefighters who were dying of cancer and they were not getting access to compensation. When they were turning up to WorkCover, or the like, to ask for compensation they were told: 'No. Unless you can tell us which particular fire you contracted your particular cancer at when you inhaled those toxic chemicals and toxic smoke we're not going to give you compensation.' So you had firefighters on shifts filling in for other firefighters while they went off and got chemo and radiotherapy. It was an appalling state of affairs. I introduced a bill that was co-sponsored by the member for Kennedy, and other members of the House, that said we will change that. We will change that so that firefighters who get cancer are presumed to have contracted it from their work, because that is what the science said would be the case. We had the capacity to bring that on for a debate, so, when it was brought on for a debate, the government at the time-the Labor Party-thought that was a good idea, and they signed up to it as co-sponsors. Even more so, the opposition-the Liberal National coalition-also looked at it and said, 'What a good idea. Let's sign up.' We ended up with a co-sponsored bill that had the support across the parliament, and that passed the parliament with the unanimous support of everyone-no-one dissented. Everyone supported it saying, 'This is a sensible change.' It was something that, despite the years of government work on both sides and years of committee work, had been overlooked. It took a private member to bring it here and say, 'Let's have a debate about it.' Why were we able to have that important reform that has made a massive difference to the lives of many firefighters and their families? There were two reasons: one is that we had the time to debate it. We had the time to debate it because a selection committee said, 'We want crossbenchers' bills to be debated in this parliament as well as opposition bills and government bills.' But, crucially, we had the opportunity to have it voted on. In this parliament you have 150 members who each represent their electorate-a point that the member for Sturt, the Leader of the House, made in that very same speech to the IPA that the  has a job to do to represent their electorate.' We had the capacity to vote on it, so we were able to achieve meaningful reform. But it would be very gravely disappointing if we lost that in this parliament. What this amendment proposes is that there is greater time to debate private members' bills-not at the expense of government business, but in addition to government business. We have greater time to debate those private members' bills. That means the crossbenchers in this parliament can have more time to have their bills debated. On a Thursday morning-here is a very simple amendment that should be supported by the government-we will have a short period, as we did in the last parliament, where votes on private members' matters can take place. On the Thursday morning, we can move very quickly through a series of issues that have been debated elsewhere and then vote on them. If they go down they go down. But what you might find is that some of them get up, just as they did in the last parliament. I do not understand what the opposition would be to doing this, because government business would still continue to be the majority of what takes place not only on a Thursday but, indeed, during the whole course of the parliament. We have not had a response yet from the Leader of the House to this proposal that was put to him some time ago. I hope that what he is going to suggest now is that the answer is: yes. In the same way that he agreed with that very sensible amendment moved by the member for Kennedy, we have the chance now to say, 'yes' to that as well. There are a number of other amendments that are included in this bundle. If the Leader of the House wants to segment those out, I am open to that discussion. I move them all as a bundle, because this will take us back to the procedures that were in operation in the minority parliament. What is becoming crystal clear after a fortnight is that the minority parliament worked better than this parliament. It would be a very good idea if we adopted the standing orders with respect to the last parliament. I would hope that the government would consider the bundle of amendments, but, in particular, that one that will allow private members' business to be voted on-hopefully in conjunction with a selection committee-that will allow private members' bills, and especially  those of the crossbenchers, to be debated and then brought on for a vote. In this parliament, the number of seats in this chamber are a reflection of the fact that a record number of the Australian population chose not to vote for one of the major parties. There is a great desire in the Australian population to have third-party voices heard. When we come here we want to not only move bills and move motions but also have them voted on, because sometimes those motions and those bills will be so good that they will succeed. I commend the amendments to the House.",125

The SPEAKER (18:54): Before I call the honourable member for Braddon I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech, and I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",132
276,Ms KEAY,BUSINESS," Thank you, Mr Speaker, and congratulations on your election to your position there. I acknowledge the Ngunawal and Ngambri peoples, the custodians of the land on which we meet, and pay my respects to their elders past and present. I also acknowledge the traditional owners of the land which Braddon encompasses today and pay my respect to their elders past and present. I rise here before you today as the proud first woman elected to the division of Braddon. It has taken some 61 years. However, I am not the first woman to represent the people of the north-west coast of Tasmania in this place. Sixty-five years on, I proudly follow in the footsteps of one other woman: a member for the former division of Darwin, the first woman elected to the House of Representatives and the first woman in federal cabinet, Dame Enid Lyons. In her first speech she said: I hope that I shall never forget that everything that takes place in this chamber goes out somewhere to strike a human heart, to influence the life of some fellow being, … Dame Enid has left a rich legacy in my electorate. She was the wife of Tasmania's only Prime Minister, Joe Lyons, and Devonport is privileged to have a Prime Minister's residence, Home Hill, just up the road from my house, with Dame Enid's personal touches gracing every inch of this wonderful family home. From her election in 1943, Dame Enid-at that stage a widowed mother of 12 childrensuccessfully led the way for women in federal politics. As she said in her first speech: I am well aware that, as I acquit myself in the work that I have undertaken for the next three years, so shall I either prejudice or enhance the prospects of those women who may wish to follow me in public service in the years to come.  We have come a long way since Dame Enid in terms of gender equality. A photo of the 1949 cabinet that you can see at Home Hill is a stark reminder of that. In a sea of dark suits stands Dame Enid, the only woman, wearing a wide-brimmed hat. Unfortunately, many governments since, and even of recent times, have not done much better in ensuring there is more than one woman in cabinet. I am proud to stand here as a member on this side, surrounded by talented women. However, from my view here, looking at the other side reminds me somewhat of that cabinet photo of 1949. I wish to thank the people of Braddon for having faith in me and my ability to represent them here in the federal parliament. Without their support I would not be here, and I will not lose sight of that very fact. The people of King Island and the north-west and west coasts of Tasmania are a resilient lot. We genuinely care for each other, across our towns and cities and our regional, rural and remote communities. We come together in times of crisis; whether they be raging bushfires, devastating droughts or tragic floods, we are generous in nature. It is said there are six degrees of separation; I contest-and dare I say-that in Tasmania there are about three. We all know each other, just about; we are willing to pitch in when someone is in need, and we will do whatever we can to help. Imagine if you can, the deep, dark forests of the World Heritage areas of south-west Tasmania: pristine and still rivers that mirror the land and sky; wild beaches of white sand and oxidised boulders on the edge of the world; coastal and rural towns and cities brimming with friendly faces and built heritage; breathing in the cleanest air in the world; eating the best steak you have ever had from the grass-fed cattle; drinking the purest water and devouring the best vegetables from the richest volcanic soils; and for seafood lovers, delighting in the world-renowned salmon, ocean trout and shellfish. Our natural beauty, our wonderful, humble people and our innovative industries and products create our clean green image. This is our competitive advantage that no other place can rival and which needs to be protected at all cost. We can have balance in what we do, how we interact with our environment, how we can have sustainable development, jobs, industry and business-trading on our competitive advantage, using the Tasmania brand to access markets many others cannot. To go to either extreme, to lock or unlock everything, can only result in damage to our reputation, our economy and our way of life. We are unassuming, we are unpretentious, we do not boast, yet we should be shouting from every rooftop just how wonderful our products and our people really are. As the years go by, others are doing that for us. I think that is what makes us so special. I believe I live in the best electorate in Australia, but I know the people of Braddon will tell you if you are doing something right and they will tell you when you are doing something wrong. Whether on local or national issues, Braddon has been a marginal seat for 20 years. I would like to pay tribute to Brett Whiteley, the former Liberal member, and Sid Sidebottom, the previous Labor member, for their commitment and dedication to serving the people of Braddon. I would also like to thank Sid for his advice and guidance during the campaign. To know what we stand for as aspiring politicians, to articulate this to our electors, we must first understand where and who we come from. I am a twin to Damon, a boilermaker welder, and born to Terry and Tresna. My mother, who is here today, spent most of my early childhood volunteering at the P&F and at the local Migrant Resource Centre. I thank her for  instilling in me fierce independence, a touch of feistiness and a desire to contribute to my community. Thank you, Mum, for being there for me and my family over this campaign and for the sacrifices you made so that my brother and I had opportunities. I know I have made you proud. My father was a seafarer, a ten-pound Pom who fell in love with the sea, joined the merchant navy and then became a steward on the Princess of Tasmania, the Empress of Australia and finally the Abel Tasman, the passenger vessels connecting Tasmania to the mainland, on which he passed away at sea when I was 10 years old. He was a strong union man, and many of his past workmates have told me of his passion for helping others in the workplace, whether on the ship or on the wharf, regardless of what union or association they belonged to, in order to make it a safer place and improve their working conditions. This was before the unions amalgamated to form the MUA, a union that I feel a deep connection to; a union and an industry that supported my family growing up and a union that supported me during this campaign. I feel truly honoured by and hold deep gratitude to the members of the MUA for their belief in me and their passion, fighting to keep an Australian shipping industry that supports so many families with stable work and decent pay. I would also like to thank the union movement, in particular the CFMEU, AMWU, ASU, HACSU, SDA, CPSU, United Voice and CEPU, for their support for me and for working Australians, who are disgracefully and continually attacked by conservative governments. In addition, many thanks go to EMILY's List for their support of me and progressive women in politics. My values of equality, fairness, equity and justice I know I received from my parents. These are the values that have guided and will continue to guide me as I make decisions on behalf of the people of Braddon. As an elected alderman on the Devonport City Council for nearly seven years, my decision making on behalf of the residents was based on these values. I believe most reasonable people share in these values. I have a vision for our country to espouse these values in how we interact with each other and how governments and institutions practice equality and fairness; a vision of a society that treats everyone as equals regardless of who we are, where we come from or who we love. Is this a utopian world? I hope not. I want my children to live in a tolerant world. I want them to have choices, not barriers. As a University of Tasmania graduate in the mid-1990s, at a time in Tasmania when many of my age were leaving the state, I took the first job I could get, working in television. It was not glamorous, it paid terribly, but it was a job. I eventually left Tasmania, not because I wanted to but because I felt I had to. I moved to Perth, WA, to study at Murdoch University, continued to work in television, and after three years was desperate to come home. Perth is a fantastic place-far too hot for me-but it is not Tasmania. I do not want my children, Ethan, Alex and Oliver, to feel they need to leave Tasmania to have opportunities. They are the reason I chose to contest local government elections. They are the reason I contested a state and a federal election. I want to be part of creating their future and the future of all Tasmanians. I do not look in the rear-view mirror but always ahead. I live by the motto 'Where there's a will, there's a way.' I thank my boys for their understanding of what I do and that I may not be around as much now. To the two of them  who are here today, Ethan and Alex: dream big, as you can do anything! Please do your homework, and remember how important education is to your future. I love you all. Returning from Perth some 14 years ago, I never thought of being involved in politics. With bachelor's degrees in geography and history, another in environmental impact assessment and a postgraduate diploma in environmental management, I managed to secure a job with the environment minister, Bryan Green, former Deputy Premier and now leader of the state opposition. Bryan gave me the confidence to contest elections and gave me the priceless opportunity to work for the people of Braddon. He also gave me the opportunity to work overseas, allowing me to return to my job when I needed to come home. It was in London, working for the British civil service in the area of constitutional affairs and at the time of the London bombings, that I met my partner, Richard, some 11 years ago. I brought him back to Tasmania with me, and with that I gained an extended family across the oceans in South Africa. Thank you, Bryan, for your faith and belief in me. Bryan, Senator Carol Brown and former senator Kay Denman said to me about eight years ago that I would be a good parliamentarian. I hope I prove them right. I have seen the best and worse of politics, and the latter does have a lasting impact. Putting my hand up to contest this election was not done lightly, yet I had one advantage. In many years helping the people of Braddon as an electorate officer and campaigning for many elections, you soon get to know the people in the electorate, but not everyone. Yet some of the comments I received from voters this election made me question my decision to run: 'You are all the same, only in it for yourselves.' 'You'll go in with the best intentions and come out as bad and corrupt as the rest.' I felt saddened that people felt this way about me; that they tarred me with the same brush as others who behave this way, yet did not know me as a person. None of this comes as a surprise, as I have been around politics a long time, but I say this because daily I heard stories of a community let down by their last representative. We know the profession of politician is not considered by the general public as one that carries a lot of trust and respect, but it should. Yes, we are human; we are fallible. We make mistakes and at times demonstrate poor judgement. However, there are many examples over many years of politicians who inadvertently, because they are so out of touch with broad public expectations, or deliberately, because of a sense of entitlement, meet and exceed the cynical perceptions of politicians conveyed to me by such comments. I know there are many in this place, and in the past, who have worked tirelessly to improve our country in a positive way without seeking massive public recognition or media attention. These are the politicians and the work that the media need to promote more. I realise this would not be as interesting as divisive political commentary by those fuelled by ignorance and fear. Mitchell is a volunteer for Labor. He is a recipient of the NDIS. Before the NDIS, Mitchell would not have spoken to people he did not know, let alone speak in public. But now he has spoken at conferences, had radio interviews and has come door-knocking on my campaign. Mitchell and his family are extremely thankful to people like Bill Shorten, Jenny Macklin and Julia Gillard for the NDIS. This is the type of work we do here that changes people's lives. I am very privileged to know many on this side of the House, and I am in the company of passionate, compassionate and talented people who I know are here for the right reasons: to serve the people they represent and to help make our communities better, guided by their values. Yet it is a reminder to us all that our ability, desire and actions to listen to the people  in our communities, to truly listen, are how we can stay grounded. It is how we can develop good policy and have conversations and interactions that are meaningful and that make a positive difference. The moment we forget how we came to this place and who we serve, or the moment our actions or inactions do not allow us to engage in a meaningful way with people from all walks of life-not just our core base-we will fall foul of and live up to the cynicism that was echoed to me during this election. I say this to put it on record, as a reminder not just to myself but to all, and especially to the electors of Braddon: I will listen; I will do my best to understand. I truly do care, and I respect what you tell me. We may not agree, but I will respect you. As some wise politician once said: you can never keep everyone happy all of the time. Yet to treat our electors with contempt, to not have our doors open to them and to refuse to engage is a sure way to electoral defeat. That is my commitment to the people of Braddon, and I know they will tell me if I stray away from this. I am also reminded of a comment a dairy farmer said to me at a farmers meeting just after the election. He said: 'See that bloke with dirt on his boots? He has the same number of votes as the one in the expensive suit.' It is clear that the policies Labor took to the election articulated the priorities of my electorate and many others. That is because we listened, and we understood what was important to people. In my electorate we have a high burden of chronic disease and low educational attainment. We have a growing prevalence of chronic conditions, yet it is clear that better health care has driven down mortality rates. Better and targeted investment in preventative health measures will further reduce preventable diseases. My electorate is very acutely aware of the importance of health funding. So, should health be a policy and funding priority? I strongly believe it should. Tax breaks for the banks and big business at the expense of health funding just will not cut it in my electorate. Similarly, education as a funding and policy priority is just as important. Not only does educational level influence health behaviour, it can also influence socio-economic status. By not investing in appropriate evidence based models of education funding, we will tragically let down future generations. I heard some of our opponents during the campaign say that we cannot afford Gonski. Well if you cannot afford to invest in a proven model of education funding that puts the child first and is not based on need, which is Gonski, then you should not be in government. Needs based funding will result in families placing more value on education as fewer children fall through the cracks because they receive the attention they need in our classrooms. I will continue to fight for a better return in education for Tasmanians. If we do not, we set up our country for failure as we will not have developed the next generation to a level that allows them to participate in a global market and have the skills for the jobs of the future. We also have high unemployment, high underemployment and low workforce participation. During the campaign I gained funding commitments for infrastructure projects that will grow our local economies, grow jobs and improve the liveability of our towns and cities. Unfortunately, not all of these projects received bipartisan support. They are priority projects for local government-the level of government closest to the people, and a sector I have a great passion for. They are projects that communities want to invest in as the economic and social returns to them are immense. The coastal pathways project will link our communities along the beautiful north-facing coastline, which cycle tourists will flock to and  which will drive private investment and jobs-and this is one such priority project. I will continue to fight for this project, and the many others that support our communities and our economy. I will also continue to fight for a better NBN. Tasmania led the way for fibre-to-thepremises NBN. Yet now some of our cities and towns, particularly in my electorate, will receive the second-rate fibre to the node. We will have, whenever the NBN is delivered in Tasmania in full, an inequitable essential service, with many centres in my electorate unable to compete for new IT industries or population growth, as many mainlanders will inevitably move to our island state but will be less likely to move to my region. We will be constricted by a broadband network that is not futureproofed. What has resulted in the NBN during the previous term of government is nothing short of a national tragedy. Mental health needs to become a long-term national priority, and I know this is very important to the people in my electorate. Earlier this year I graduated from Monash University with a graduate diploma of psychology, which will serve me well in this place, and I have developed the understanding and passion for better mental health services for Braddon. This will be a focus for me during this term. People need and deserve better access to responsive mental health and allied health services in our cities and towns. These are just some of the challenges and opportunities for my electorate. I will continue to listen and learn from the people of Braddon as I have done during the election campaign. But I was, and will continue to be, helped by a group of passionate people wanting positive and progressive change for Tasmania. Without their help, I would not have been able to communicate and interact as broadly with my community. I want to thank Senator Anne Urquhart for her unwavering support as my mentor and sounding board, guiding me, advising me and just being there. To my campaign team-John, Julie, Donna, Amanda, Lyn, Bec, Ali, Sharifah, Melissa and Gemma-thank you. I am grateful to every person involved in the campaign-the many volunteers who door-knocked and made phone calls and staffed pre-poll and polling booths in the freezing cold and relentless rain; 15-year-old Sam, who phoned voters; my older volunteers in their 70s and 80s; and everyone in between. They are the true believers of what we do and who we are. This is a team effort, a sum of all parts. I am overwhelmed at the support from the Labor branches in my electorate and I thank each member for their belief and confidence in me. It is not over; we have just begun and we have many, many more conversations to make. To my Tasmanian federal colleagues-Julie Collins and Senators Carol Brown, Catrina Bilyk, Helen Polley and Lisa Singh-thank you for your friendship and support. To the state parliamentary Labor Party-especially Bryan Green, Michelle O'Byrne and Rebecca Whitethank you for your belief in me and the wonderful work you do for Tasmania. Thank you also to my friend and acting secretary Karelle Logan and to Alex Manning, from Nat Sec, George Wright, Paul Erikson and Sebastian Zwalf. What a formidable team of exceptional Labor people! I was very privileged to have had many visits from shadow ministers over the past year who gave their time to speak with many individuals and groups within my electorate, and for that I am truly thankful. Thank you to Anthony Albanese for launching my campaign in a field of strawberries at the Berry Patch at Turners Beach-he remembers that fondly! Thank you to Tanya Plibersek, Catherine King, Andrew Leigh, Jason Clare, Jenny Macklin, Brendan  O'Connor, Stephen Jones, Joel Fitzgibbon, Sharon Bird and Senators Doug Cameron, Claire Moore and Kim Carr. And, of course, I thank Bill Shorten. He visited my electorate a number of times. He demonstrated a keen interest in and commitment to regional Tasmania and its people. Thank you. I would also like to thank my previous colleagues in local government and at Devonport City Council for their support and friendship despite our political differences. I gained a nickname at the council-'VS', the Velvet Sledgehammer! I hope I can live up to that reputation in this place when I need to be a strong voice for the people of Braddon. Finally, thank you to my staff, my wonderful friends and, of course, my family here and in South Africa. To Mum and my stepdad, Ray: thank you for your belief in me and all you do to support my family. To the Keay family in New South Wales and beyond: thank you for telling me my dad would be proud that I am a chip off the old block. It means so much to me to hear that. And to my partner, Richard, who cannot be here today: thank you for coming on this journey with me. It may not always be a straight or flat road that we will travel; it will be one of hills and gullies, of richness and opportunities, of challenges and obstacles, but together we will have a great journey. Thank you Braddon for the opportunity you have provided to me. If we have belief in what we can achieve, if we tackle our challenges together head on, we can continue to be proud of who we are and we can grab with both hands many opportunities to advance our piece of paradise. Thank you.",136
277,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS," Before I call the honourable member for Maranoa, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to him the usual courtesies. I personally would like to welcome my northern neighbour. We share a boundary of about 800 kilometres.",142
278,Mr LITTLEPROUD,BUSINESS," Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is truly a great honour to stand in this nation's 45th Parliament representing the people of Maranoa as their 10th representative. I am extremely proud to stand here today as the third consecutive generation of the Littleproud family to serve the people of Queensland in all three tiers of government. My grandfather, George Littleproud, served at the local level as deputy mayor of the Chinchilla Shire; my father, Brian, served at the state level as Minister for Education and the Environment; and now I have ascended to the federal level, an achievement that my family and I are incredibly proud of and humbled by. Maranoa is one of Australia's 75 Federation seats and the nation's fifth largest electorate in land size, spanning more than 730,000 square kilometres across Queensland, encapsulating some of our country's most diverse and productive land and, more importantly, some of its most resilient, hard working and resourceful people. Maranoa extends along more than 90 per cent of the Queensland-New South Wales border, all of the Queensland-South Australia border and nearly half of the Queensland-Northern Territory border. From Stanthorpe in the south-east to Birdsville in the far south-west, and from Winton and Bedourie in the north-west to Kingaroy and Blackbutt in the north-east, Maranoa covers more than three-times the size of Victoria. It is managed at a local level by 17 regional and shire councils and seven state seats in the Queensland parliament.  Before I go any further, I acknowledge the 37 traditional owner groups across Maranoa, covering the Eyre, Riverine, Kooris and Murris regions. I acknowledge their elders and the significant role they play as custodians in the preservation and advancement of Australia's first people's culture in Maranoa. Maranoa, by reason of its sheer size, is a diverse electorate of industry and opportunity, ranging from mining, with the development of the gas and coal industry, to manufacturing, primarily in the value-adding of our agricultural products, to the increasingly important tourism industry. Tourism continues to mature in Maranoa as our brand develops and travellers gain an appreciation of our unique lifestyle. Tourism continues to play an important part in the diversification of our small communities and their economies, particularly through drought. However, agriculture is the common thread that links each and every community across Maranoa together; it is the major contributor to every community's economy in terms of employment, returns to producers, and support to small businesses in each of our communities. I am proud to say I have lived and worked in Maranoa all my life. I grew up in the little town of Chinchilla some 3½ hours west of Brisbane. Growing up in Chinchilla was the quintessential childhood in a small country town-plenty of mates, cricket, football, tennis, swimming, fishing and camping. You were raised not just by your family in Chinchilla but by the entire community. My pulse always lifts when I go home to Chinchilla; it is the knowledge and comfort that you are in the familiar surrounds of family. Chinchilla made me who I am today, and I am forever grateful for the investment the community of Chinchilla has invested in me. Professionally I was fortunate enough to forge a career in banking, living and working in many parts of the electorate such as Miles, Nanango, Charleville, St George, Stanthorpe and ultimately Warwick, where my wife and I now live and raise our three boys, Tom, Hugh, and Harry, who are all here tonight. My wife and I have not only made the ultimate investment in Maranoa by bringing our family up there but also invested in our own small business in Warwick employing local people, because we believe in the future of our community and Maranoa. I do not want to spend my time today talking about my life story; instead I would like to take this opportunity to talk about the people who have entrusted me to represent them, and the challenges we face-but more importantly the great opportunities that lie ahead of us in Maranoa. Fundamentally I believe a federal government's responsibility is not to impose in the daily lives of Australians but to create an environment and the infrastructure around them so they can generate their own wealth that subsequently builds healthier communities. Preparing for this speech today, I took the time to read the maiden speech delivered in May 1990 by my predecessor, the Hon. Bruce Scott, who passionately and diligently represented Maranoa for more than 25 years-and I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Bruce for his dedication to Maranoa and its people. It is interesting to note that, in that speech, Bruce described the hardship some parts of the electorate were suffering after devastating floods. Ironically, today many parts of Maranoa face a greater threat from years of enduring  drought. The drought in central western and south-western Queensland over the past five years has been an economic, environmental and human catastrophe and it continues to unravel before our eyes. While recent rain has created cautious optimism, it will take more than a few rain events to allow communities to recover in full. But to reinforce the resilience of the people of Maranoa this glimmer of hope is enough for them to continue on. Some would say it is a country thing, but I say it is a pride thing-pride in our communities and pride in our families. Nelson Mandela once said, 'The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling but in rising every time we fall.' That is exactly what the people of Maranoa are doing. Whether it is flood, fire or drought, the people of Maranoa have forged livelihoods but, more importantly, communities that have in turn nurtured some of our country's finest. All my professional life has been involved in business, and I have therefore built a strong passion for economic development. I believe economic development not only creates opportunity for individual wealth but, more importantly, builds healthier communitiescommunities where you can educate your children, receive good health care and have good employment prospects, and that you can travel the world from and, above all, call home. The trade agreements that this coalition government negotiated over the last three years are fundamental to setting the right environment for Maranoa. The direct impact-particularly for agriculture-has been profound, with those benefits finally being realised at a profit and loss level now. All across the electorate I have been listening to people who tell me of the tangible benefits of these agreements. Three weeks ago, I was told by one of our beef producers that only two years ago he was receiving $400 a head for his steers but today he is receiving more than three times that amount. This is putting money into the pockets of every producer and, importantly, flowing back into our local communities and stimulating their economies. But perhaps the most salient reinforcement that these trade agreements will deliver for all of Maranoa came from feedback I received this year when I visited a drought-affected farmer in central western Queensland. In the depths of financial and emotional despair after four years of debilitating drought, when asked whether they saw a future in agriculture, the response I got was that the only person important to them in politics in Australia was a man called Andrew Robb, our then trade minister, because they knew that when it did rain all the hard work they had done for years keeping their breeding stock alive would be worth something and there would be a future for them and their children. In this producer's moment of utter despair and helplessness, the appreciation of the benefits these agreements would provide them and the fact it became a beacon of hope that gave them the strength and courage to fight on is a moment I will never forget. Trade agreements have been criticised by some who falsely yearn for the perceived comfort of economic policies of yesteryear, but the world has moved past them. In simplistic terms, we have a population of 24 million but produce enough food for 75 million, so if we do not engage the world we will not have communities like Longreach, Charleville, Roma, Kingaroy or Dalby. We in Maranoa need to embrace the global economy more than anybody. We have what the world wants and our language and our actions need to reflect that; we are now global players. We need to engage the world like we never have before, because the opportunities are boundless. The people of Maranoa are not victims. We are not some economic backwater.  Instead, we hold the keys to our own and the nation's prosperity. It is a matter of us grabbing it. While the coalition government has done an outstanding job in creating the right environment around the people of Maranoa in negotiating trade deals and providing small business tax cuts to the 25½ thousand small-business owners in Maranoa, to take advantage of these opportunities it is imperative that we, as a federal government, complement this with the tools of the 21st century. The great innovators of our country and adopters of technology and science have always been in electorates like Maranoa, because we have to be. Our history in this space runs deep, with the humble beginnings of Qantas nearly 100 years ago in the outback of Maranoa. To this day, Qantas is the only airline in the world to have built its own aircraft. In a small hanger in the outback town of Longreach, commercial aviation in this country was born because of the vision and the need of those who pioneered this great country. Fast forward this to today, where cutting-edge scientific research and technology has seen the development and production in Stanthorpe of the Queen Garnet plum, a fruit with the highest levels of antioxidants and anthocyanins in the world. Using the best minds and hands in Maranoa-amongst the best in the world-they are changing the shape of food and health globally. So, when you define the strategic infrastructure needed to continue to forge Maranoa ahead and to complement its people, it comes down to one word: connectivity. It is a continual investment in telecommunications and transport infrastructure that connects our products to the world that will create the innovation and wealth that will make Maranoa a community of choice for people to live in and do business. Rolling out the NBN to more than 68,000 households and businesses right across Maranoa over the next two years is paramount, but complementing this with mobile phone connectivity is essential. The businesses of Maranoa are operating multimillion dollar cutting-edge technology that requires connectivity to engage in a global economy. It is not just about the economic benefits of providing these digital tools; there are social responsibilities that need to be met by us as a government. The benefits of telehealth have huge potential for not only improving health outcomes in regional and remote areas but also saving money for patients and taxpayers by reducing significant travel and hospital costs. More importantly, telehealth will allow people to be treated closer to their loved ones and homes. In education, the coalition government's commitment to creating designated data plans for distance education students is another initiative that every Australian should be proud of. It is abhorrent to think that the quality of education for children in Maranoa and other regional electorates is determined by their postcode. This initiative keeps families from having to leave the regions and, invariably, secures the precious human capital we need to be the most productive to build better regional communities. Physical connectivity needs to complement our investment in the digital economy. Our roads and rail are the arteries of Maranoa. While I acknowledge the social and safety benefits of the coalition's $1.6 billion investment in the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing, the real beneficiary is Maranoa. The connectivity this infrastructure will provide in building efficiency  into our exports will be profound and return real dollars to towns right across Maranoa. Coupled with the inland rail, which is one of the great visionary builds of our generation, it will build the framework for innovation and investment that will deliver further opportunity to Maranoa. It will create an Australian export hub right on our doorstep. These two key infrastructure assets will be further complemented by the new Wellcamp airport, which will see Maranoa's produce exported around the world and again provide Maranoa the tools of the 21st century. The story of Maranoa from an agricultural perspective is that of 'just add water'. While, ultimately, that lies with Mother Nature, there are a number of man-made initiatives that can also play a key role in developing Maranoa and inland Australia. The Murray-Darling Basin plan has had a significant impact on communities in Maranoa. The balance has been weighted disproportionately, without an understanding of the social and economic impacts on our communities. The responsible stewardship of our water is something every Australian takes seriously, and now we have an opportunity to reset the triple bottom line. The coalition's commitment to the $2.5 billion water fund is a significant step in acknowledging the power of water to local regional economies. This initiative has set the foundation to reset the mindset around water usage to one predicated on science and technology and not a blind green agenda. The coalition government has committed to exploring two projects that could potentially transform communities across Maranoa. Transferring the nearly 150,000 megalitres of recycled water a year from Brisbane to the Darling Downs could potentially contribute to addressing the triple bottom line sought in the Murray-Darling plan. Building a business case for the Emu Swamp Dam will potentially also give just as much significance proportionately to the Stanthorpe and Granite Belt region. Having worked in banking in Stanthorpe, I can assure you of the value that a megalitre of water can contribute to not only the agricultural sector but the entire community. Water infrastructure will not only stimulate Maranoa; it will build resilience for dry times. There are many locations in the central west and south west where water infrastructure opportunities are limited. But the coalition's investment in dog fencing is also building the resilience of and the opportunity of diversification for many graziers affected by drought. The economic return to not only the producer but also regional communities is exponential, but so too are the environmental gains. The protection of vulnerable native fauna is something that this initiative has also achieved and should be supported further. Continued infrastructure investment that connects us in Maranoa to a global economy is critical. I believe any investment by government in Maranoa would not be a handout but something that could be prosecuted on an economic case that we can demonstrate will progress not only Maranoa but the entire nation. Maranoa contributes more per capita GDP than the Gold Coast, Toowoomba or Townsville. Three regional councils in Maranoa alone contribute more per capita than Brisbane city. Maranoa's unemployment rate of 2.62 per cent reinforces our economic credentials, our resilience and our work ethic. It is important to remember that this contribution to our nation has been achieved through one of the worse droughts in living memory over the last four years.  It would be remiss of me before I close not to pay tribute to the party people who have guided and counselled me over so many years for their tireless work during the campaign. I thank Phil and Arngel Sturgess; Jen Tunley; Denise Jeitz, who is also here today; Dawn Scrymergour; and Fiona Gaske, to name a few, for all their work. I am humbled by their support. To run a campaign across such a vast electorate with 119 booths was nothing short of a herculean effort. To Gary Spence, the LNP President in Queensland, I offer my sincere thanks for his support during the campaign. He is a friend I have truly gained through this. I thank my good friend and mentor Lawrence Springborg for his support, friendship and guidance over so many years. I can only hope that in some small way I can emulate the dignified and statesmanlike way he has held himself over a long career in public office. I thank my National Party parliamentary colleagues, both here and in the Senate, for their congratulations and support. I am in admiration of the collegiate and nurturing culture that they have preserved as custodians of this great party and to which I now commit myself. But above all I look forward to working with each of them to progress regional and rural Australia. In closing I would like to pay tribute to my family. My wife, Sarah, and our three boysTom, Hugh and Harry-are a constant pillar of support for me and for that I am truly grateful. I also pay tribute to my parents, Brian and Peta Littleproud, who have shaped me into the person I am today. I have had a privileged upbringing not in a material sense but in that I have never wanted for anything that I have needed. For that I am eternally grateful. I am proud to say that I am the product of Maranoa. It has allowed me to build a career, start a business, travel the world and, above all, raise a family. No matter how long I am given the privilege to represent the people of Maranoa, if the only thing I achieve is to provide those same opportunities to our current children and the generations to come I will have succeeded, and that is all I ask. Thank you.",142
279,The SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Before I call the honourable member for Mayo, I remind the House that this is the honourable member's first speech. I ask the House to extend to her the usual courtesies.",147
280,Ms SHARKIE,BUSINESS," It is indeed a great privilege to give my first speech in this great place as the member for Mayo. Mayo stretches from Springton at the southern tip of Eden Valley along the length of the Adelaide Hills, down the Fleurieu to the mouth of the mighty Murray and across the south coast, including the southern vales and the jewel in the Mayo crown: Kangaroo Island. In total it covers over 9,300 square kilometres, encompassing more than 35 townships, seven wine regions, highly arable farmland and incredible wildlife. I am the first woman in 115 years to represent my region that has been known as Mayo since 1984. It was previously part of the former seat of Angas. This is a great honour bestowed upon me by my community of Mayo and I will remember this opportunity each and every day that I am our member. I am the first member of the Nick Xenophon Team to be elected to the House of Representatives. We represent the sensible middle ground where decisions are made through community engagement and the application of common sense, not partisan political ideology. As I stand here I am reminded of a speech given in this place by the Hon. Don Chipp in March 1977 after resigning from the Liberal Party. He said:  The parties seem to polarise on almost every issue, sometimes seemingly just for the sake of it, and I wonder whether the ordinary voter is not becoming sick and tired of the vested interests which unduly influence the present political parties and yearn for the emergence of a third political force, representing middle of the road policies which would owe allegiance to no outside pressure group. Although spoken nearly 40 years ago, I believe those words are more relevant today than they were back in 1977. I look forward to more diverse representation, a growing crossbench and a vision of this place returning to what the Fathers of Federation intended: a place that is the genuine contest of ideas on how best to safeguard the future prosperity of Australia for all Australians. We must as representatives of our nation move away from short-term fixes to sensible, informed and evidence based planning. The long-term prosperity of our nation depends on it. We must as a nation move away from language that is divisive and hurtful. 'Lifters' and 'leaners', the 'taxed' and the 'not taxed'-this language does not bring us together; it divides us. It is not helpful, true or necessary. I was a single mum for many years. Parenting is, I believe, the hardest job in the world, and single parenting is doubly so. I was so busy trying to make ends meet, picking up as many hours as I could to keep a roof over our heads and food on our table. I would have been heartbroken at that time to think that my government did not see value in me and my family, that I was not earning enough to be a contributor to our country. We must remember that the greatest group of 'not taxed' in our nation is our senior citizens, who continue to 'lift' and contribute enormously to our nation. We must remember that our senior citizens have already paid their fair share of tax. They, like any other Australian who happens to be at home or at work, are completely undeserving of such a label. Each of us has capacity to contribute to the nation, and that contribution should not be valued or devalued based on how big the dollar figure is on our taxation return. As a South Australian, I want to talk candidly about the challenges facing my state. We helped to build this nation, and the manufacturing industry helped to build our great state, providing a great livelihood for many hard working South Australians. My beloved South Australia is at a precipice. I am an avid student of our history and I do not believe there has been a more challenging time for South Australia since the Great Depression. South Australia was once the industrial powerhouse of Australia. We made the steel, built the fridges, washing machines and even clotheslines for generations of Australians. We built the ships and the submarines, and we built many of the cars too: Chrysler, Mitsubishi and Holden. My dad worked at Mitsubishi's Lonsdale factory until it closed. He was very proud of the cars he made and earned a wage that ensured that my sister and I had a good education and everything we needed. Sadly, the era of being able to purchase an Australian car from the assembly line at Holden is coming to a close, and I believe it is an untimely close that was exacerbated by politics, particularly the politics of 'free market, no matter the consequence'. Gone with the ability for Australians to build and purchase an Australian car is the financial stability and livelihoods of thousands of South Australians. The impending closure of Holden is premature in the sense that there has been little time or opportunity for South Australia to successfully transition to new industries. Should Arrium's Whyalla Steelworks also close, it will be disastrous for South Australia and Australia. We must, as a nation, continue to manufacture steel; to not support this industry is risking our nation's ability to build quality infrastructure into the future.  I would like to draw to the parliament's attention the issues facing rural Australia and, in particular, rural South Australia. In recent times, the political narrative has emphasised the need for Australia to be more agile and to be innovative. I believe rural Australia and in particular primary producers have led the way in innovation and ingenuity. By way of example, Kangaroo Island in my electorate is a place where, despite the enormous challenges brought on by its remoteness and geographic isolation, the businesses and community have shown themselves to be entrepreneurial, through collaboration and through the pursuit of excellence. As a result, they are leaders in artisan food production. And so our regional farming communities must be supported to be part of the future investment in innovation; the 'ideas boom' must include a regional and rural focus. There is enormous potential for young people, in particular, to develop new business opportunities in farming and food production, and I would urge the government to ensure that investment in innovation is not solely concentrated in our eastern capital cities. By the year 2050 our world population is predicted to be 10 billion. The continent of Asia, our nearest neighbour, is expected to be 5.2 billion of this global population, with a growing middle class. With a global population of 10 billion, Australia's ability to continue to produce some of the best quality food in the world will be our greatest asset. For South Australia and, in particular, Mayo, the growing global population will provide enormous opportunity, particularly given our diverse agricultural, horticultural and viticultural industries, which include apples, pears, cherries, grapes, dairy, grains and beef cattle production to name just a few. In South Australia our dairy industry has shrunk from more than 667 farms to just 250 farms since deregulation. Dairy farmers work seven days a week, even at sunrise and sunset. Previous governments advocated for dairy deregulation and we now have an industry that is suffering for a multitude of reasons. I believe it is incumbent upon government not just to offer loans to farmers, which encourages more debt, but to properly assist this industry to have a sustainable future. In recent years the value of South Australia's agricultural industry has been overshadowed by mining. However, it is worth noting that in 2015 only 12,700 people in South Australia were employed in the mining industry, compared to more than 40,000 people in the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries. Challenges for our farmers will include increasing food supply, encroaching urban sprawl and competing demands for water. We need to ensure that the policies implemented support rural Australia and do not make it harder to remain on the land. With a growing global population and the world looking to feed its own countries, we will face increasing pressure of foreign purchasing of our most arable farm land. Whilst the Foreign Investment Review Board threshold has recently been lowered, I believe that the threshold is still too high and fails to protect our sovereignty. I am not against foreign investment in Australia, but investment and ownership are two different things, and once we sell the farm it will be near impossible to buy it back. The other major challenge facing our nation is our aging population. A decade ago Australia had a population where 14.5 million people were aged under 50 years. Only 1.6 per cent of the population were aged 85 years or older. By the year 2050, the percentage of Australians aged 85 years or older is expected to increase to nearly seven per cent As a result,  we will be faced with the challenge of a declining total workforce participation rate. Also, a decade ago we as a nation had five working people for every person aged over 64 years, and this will shrink to just three people. For South Australia, the oldest mainland state, we will feel the effect of this even more, and, for my electorate of Mayo, we will feel it the most. Victor Harbor is the town with the biggest population of over-75-year-olds in South Australia. Goolwa and Mount Barker are also within the top 10 of South Australia's most elderly populations. Whilst I have talked extensively about the high-quality farmland and produce within Mayo and the value of farming to our nation more generally, it must be highlighted that the agricultural industry is also an aging industry. Australian farmers are considerably older than other workers. In 2011, the median age for farmers was 53 years of age, and just 13 per cent of farmers were aged 35 years or younger. We need to ensure, as an industry, that it is attractive for young people to enter primary production. We need to ensure there are entry points for young people to build primary production businesses, that they are rewarded for their work and that they have confidence in their ability to farm into the future. Most importantly, this includes certainty in being able to access water. On that note, I would like to touch upon the future of young people in Australia. I am a firm believer that, if the first experience a young person has when leaving education is to end up on the unemployment queue, then we as a nation have failed them. South Australia has the highest unemployment rate in the nation and the highest youth unemployment in mainland Australia. In the Adelaide Hills our official youth unemployment rate is more than 17 per cent. However, this is really a hidden number because, once a young person is in work for just a couple of hours, they are no longer counted as unemployed. Realistically, when you combine youth unemployment and underemployment, you are talking about one in three young people not working as much as they would like to or are able to. The tragedy for South Australia is that we are losing our best and brightest young people. And even when they do not want to go, they are being pulled interstate because that is where the jobs are, and few ever return. This is unacceptable. A sustainable community, a vibrant community, let alone a sustainable state, cannot haemorrhage so much of its youth interstate. To ensure that this issue is properly addressed, we need to have a dedicated minister for youth. To not have a dedicated minister for youth in this parliament is an opportunity lost. The reality is: if we value older Australians being looked after well into their retirement, we need to ensure we have full youth employment, not youth unemployment at more than double the mainstream unemployment rate. It is simply future-proofing. Contributing significantly to our youth unemployment rate is the reality that every year fewer and fewer entry-level jobs exist. When I left school, if you wanted to get a job, you did not need experience or qualifications; you could be a filing clerk or a junior hand. All were a good start. All led to something if you worked hard. Those jobs do not exist anymore. We are also setting up young people to fail. University was free for young people in the 1970s and for most of the eighties. Now young people face huge costs to attend university, and the threat of deregulation of the sector and expensive course fees hang over their heads. This parliament must tackle housing affordability and all those policies, including negative gearing, that are making home ownership an elusive dream for too many young people.  In this parliament we need to address the lack of opportunities for young people if we want to address the effect of our aging population. Even simply providing traineeship opportunities in each and every one of our electorate offices and Senate offices would provide more than 650 career starts for young people over the term of a parliament. To quote author Jennifer Rayner in her book Generation Less: A country that makes no room for the young is a country that will forfeit a fair future. This must not become Australia. Fewer than 1,200 people since Federation have had the privilege of standing in the House of Representatives on behalf of their community. No person gets to this position alone, and so I have many people to thank who tirelessly supported me since my announcement as a candidate back in December 2015. Firstly, I thank Senator Nick Xenophon, who is here today, who not only gave me opportunity to run as a candidate but has been and continues to be a great mentor and a good friend. I thank my husband, Nathan, my confidant and best friend. I would not be here if it were not for your love and support. To my three children, Edward, William and Evelyn, thank you for your patience and understanding and also for believing in me. I thank my parents, Tina and George-they are here tonight-for their courage to immigrate as a young couple with a baby on their knee to this great country. With little money in their pockets, they left their families and all they knew in the hope that they could give that baby, me, a better life. Thank you for picking South Australia as our home-although I do smile when I think that my mum selected South Australia from a map of Australia and thought the salt lakes of South Australia's outback, especially Lake Eyre and Lake Torrens, would be good places to picnic on Sundays because they reminded her of the Great Lakes surrounding Michigan and Ohio in her home country of the United States. No matter what your methodology for choosing, you made the best choice. And I thank the many hundreds of volunteers who stood in the rain for me and a special group of campaign volunteers who met with me each week to strategise and share ideas. I am grateful for your tenacity, political knowledge and vision, and I know for many of you it was at great personal sacrifice after decades of allegiance to a different political party. Finally, I thank the people of Mayo. Thank you for coming out to the community forums I held across the electorate, to the sausage sizzles in parks in summer and the community centres we filled during winter and every country show. Thank you for sharing what matters to you; what matters to us. This is the start of our conversation and I very much look forward to continuing this dialogue that will lead to action for our community. Thank you for taking a chance on me, for changing our political landscape. There is no greater honour than to represent you in our nation's capital. I will do everything I can to keep democracy as close as possible to our communities so that your voice is heard. My focus, my energy, my heart will be dedicated to making Mayo matter.
