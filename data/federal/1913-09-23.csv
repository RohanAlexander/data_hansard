1,Mr CHARLTON,INVITATION TO COMMONWEALTH,"Las t week I asked the Prime Minister if he would be good enough to invite the members of the New Soutli Wales Parliament to the reception of the Fleet, and, in reply, he said that he would deal with them more liberally than they had dealt with the members of this Parliament in connection with the visit of members of the British Parliament to Sydney. I therefore now ask the honourable gentleman if his attention has been directed to the following statement by the Premier of the State, which appeared in - the Newcastle Herald of Saturday last""As a matter of fact,"" said the Premier, "" I wired Mr Cook in these terms on the 29th August :- ' Could you kindly say how many members of the Federal House will be in Sydney Tuesday next, and should be invited to the State banquet to the British Parliamentarians, also members' names.' A list was supplied in reply to that telegram, and invitations were sent out in accordance with that list to two Ministers and to Messrs. Carr, Conroy, Finlayson, Ryrie, and Sinclair. Mr Groom did not accept, neither did Mr Cook, but several of the others were there. The public can judge how much ground there is for the complaint of discourtesy."" Is the statement a correct one ?",12
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INVITATION TO COMMONWEALTH,How should I know whether it is correct? I am not able to say what the Premier of New South Wales does.,13
3,Mr CHARLTON,INVITATION TO COMMONWEALTH,The honourable gentleman should have received the telegram referred to.,13
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INVITATION TO COMMONWEALTH,I think that it is a pity that the Premier of New South Wales has not something better to do than to try to make mischief in this way. SMALL-POX OUTBREAK. ISOLATION OF CONTACTS.,13
5,Mr WEST,INVITATION TO COMMONWEALTH,I wish to know from the Prime Minister if anything has been done towards removing the embargo on SydI ney. Is the honourable gentleman aware that the press of New South Wales urge that the quarantine should be removed?,13
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INVITATION TO COMMONWEALTH,"I have the at whole matter under very serious sideration, but I personally shall not take the responsibility of lifting the embargo.",13
7,Mr GROOM,INVITATION TO COMMONWEALTH,"I promised the honorsonal able member for West Sydney that I would lay on the table a statement Dr Cumpston regarding the small-pox outbreak. The following is the statement in question: In my opinion, after having seen a number of the cases, there is no possibility of doubt that the disease is small-pox. It is true that many of the cases are mild, and that the type of the [51]-2 disease now being manifested in Sydney is not a virulent one. It is, however, not possible at present to give any forecast as to whether this mild type will or will not continue.",13
8,Mr WEBSTER,INVITATION TO COMMONWEALTH,"A few days ago I addressed to the Minister of Trade and Customs a question as to the number of small-pox contacts isolated since the outbreak of the scare in Sydney, and the number allowed to be at large. I think that the honourable gentleman's reply was that this was a matter of State concern. I desire now to ask him whether he does not think it is of sumcient importance to warrant his obtaining the particulars for the information of honourable members.",13
9,Mr GROOM,INVITATION TO COMMONWEALTH,"As I said on a previous occasion, this is a matter entirely under the control of the State, but if the honourable member desires the information I shall be pleased to try to obtain it for him.",13

After we had adjourned, I discovered that I had promised the honourable meinber for Parkes to come into make a House while he was away. I h the, excitement of the moment, when engaged in throwing out skirmishers to keep members from coming into the chamber, forgot my promise. I apologize to the honourable member for having done so, and I am very sorry for what' happened. Had I been reminded of the promise, even the eleventh hour, I should have come conin and helped to make a House.",13
11,Mr FENTON,INVITATION TO COMMONWEALTH,"I wish to make a perexplanation which I should have made on Friday morning had the circumby stances permitted. The report in the Argus of that day, of our proceedings of Thursday, credits me with this utteranceFive thousand postal votes went astray during the 1910 elections, and the reason, that many of them did not reach the ballot-box was that some high officials did not properly carry out their duties. This is the corresponding passage in the Hansard report of my speechUnder Part X. of the old Act which repealed during last Parliament, trafficking postal votes was possible, and, in my opinion, number of the 5,000 postal ballot-papers that were unaccounted for did not reach the ballot box because the persons to whom they were intrusted for posting did not perform the way in which the votes were cast probably being known to them. Without an explanation it might he thought by omcers. of the Electoral Department that I intended to reflect on them, because of the words "" high officials"" which appear in the Argus report, but which I did not use. cast no reflection on these oflicers, carry out their duties splendidly, alminimum though underpaid and overworked. Those under to whom I referred were the persons to week. whom, in 1910, postal ballot-papers were intrusted, which they did notforward as of they should have done. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT.

Mr AGAR WYNNE - Application s have been invited to fill the vacancies in the Department, and they must be sent in by the 1st October.

23,Mr FISHER,STATEMENT SBYPRIM E,"I ask the Prime Minister whether his statement, reported in - various journals, that the Government would be compelled to go to the country - at an early date, is not a violation of the constitutional rule that advice to be tendered to the representative of the Crown should not be anticipated by the ;public statements of his advisers. I hand to the Prime Minister a copy of the newspaper containing the remarks to which I refer.",15

Is the offer to be taken seriously f",15

41,Mr GLYNN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"About a fortnight ago an arrangement was made for the supply of Australian wood for some of the floors in the High Commissioner's office. The matter had to be carefully inquired into, and it was decided to accept an offer of £3,000 or £4,000 worth of timber for this purpose. Besides this, the halls and the public rooms of the London offices will be floored with Australian marble, and the walls decorated with coloured marble from this country. The actual marble has not yet been decided on, but I am expecting a report shortly from the person who has been making, an examination of the quarries. The marble for the masses of sculpture at the main entrance, 14 feet from the ground on either side, and 73 feet from the ground in the centre, will have to be of the best, and about ten days ago. we arranged with Mr Mackennal to do the sculpture. As to the illustrations of Australian bird life, and so forth, in the lead-lights, that has not yet come under my notice, but when the scheme for the mural decorations reaches UB shortlyone is now being drawn up-by the architects-the matjjer will be carefully inquired into - It is our desire that Australian artists, wherever resident, shall have full opportunity to compete.

ELECTORAL BILL. SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 18th September (vide page 1370), on motion by Mr.. That this Bill be now read a second time.",18
80,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"East Sydney) [3.34] and When the House adjourned on Thursday, I was endeavouring to point out the se'ri : of interfering with ballot-papersin the manner proposed by the Government. I am of opinion that it is a hour; grave mistake to permit the marking of a ballot-paper by an electoral official in The Attorney General pointed out that in Canada a reballot-paper issued to an elector is numnpon bered on the butt, and corresponds with the elector's number on the roll. That, in my opinion, is a bad system. At many polling places in Australia the number of electors is not large. It is quite within the realm of possibility for a returning to or presiding officer or a poll clerk to reresumed tain in, his memory the number of an elector;' and when the papers are counted the memory of an officer who desired to know how a particular elector voted wonld probably be sufficiently retentive for him to identify a particular paper. I do not think that such a system would commend itself to the public of this country. The proposal made by the Government is that an elector shall write his name across the butt of the ballot-paper. I am of opinion that those-who originated this proposal cannot have had a very large experience of elections. In city constituencies especially, where large numbers of electors go to the poll'at certain hours of the day, a great rushtakes place. Under the present system the confusion U had enough to give rise to a great deal of excitement and grumbling. Indeed, some people, are not disposed to go to the poll owing to the inconvenience. But what will it be like when each elector has to write his name on the butt pf the ballot-paper? As a rule, electors are somewhat nervous when they go into a polling booth.",18
81,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Thos e about' to vote Liberal ought to he nervous I,19
82,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable member is quite right. This nervousness is. especially marked in the case of aged people. It will be impossible to carry out such a system as insisting that each elector shall write his name before he gets, his ballot paper. What reason is there for this proposal? We have heard no justification for it from the Government. The Attorney-General did indeed try to elucidate the matter. From the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs we obtained no information whatever. Even the Attorney General gave no sufficient reason. Of course, we were told about possibilities which may occur. But no legislative body in any part of the world has ever attempted to legislate for some imaginary possibility. The Government, since the last election, have heen searching in every corner to find out whether the statements regarding all that occurred were or were not correct. They have done their utmost to discover that there was something wrong. But they have obtained no reliable information. In my ' humble opinion, there was no justification whatever for the aspersions cast after the election on the electors of this country. I honestly believe that all the rumours which were circulated arose simply in the minds of some, disappointed individuals who could not endure imr patience at the defeat of candidates in whom they were interested. If I know anything of the feeling of ihe electors of Australia,' they will vigorously resist any attempt on the part of the Government to interfere with the secrecy of the ballot. If there is one thing more than another which has advertised Australia throughout the civilized world it is our electoral system. One can scarcely pick np an American work deal-: ing with Bocial questions which does nob eulogize our Australian system of the secret ballot. I can recollect the time when men and women were practically compelled' to vote as their employers directed, and when to do otherwise would mean unemployment and, perhaps, starvation for them. Under that, system it was utterly impossible to obtain a true expression of the will of the people. For the Government to ask the Democratic party which sits upon this side - of the House-the party which is intent, upon the betterment of the people-to-d o away with the secrecy of the ballot is simply preposterous. I am satisfied that every member of the Labour party will. voice the' view' which I am expressing, and will use his utmost endeavours to prevent any alteration of the existing system ef voting by ballot. What has occurred to warrant any such alteration ? It is true that immediately after the, last general election the Government, assisted by the juvenile member for . Wentworth, attempted to raise a public scare by"" declaring that numerous cases of duplicate voting had occurred. Personally, J. would hail with delight an appeal to the people upon this measure, because it would afford me an opportunity of pointing but to them that the Ministry which are in office with a magnificent majority of one wish to deprive them' of the grand system under which their votes are recorded secretly. Honourable members opposite are exercising uncommon self-restraint upon this Bill. They sit there, like a lot of dumb dogs. They dare not utter a word. They long for an opportunity to crush the Democratsof Australia. . I note that one portion of this Bill proposes to abolish the Electoral Commissioners, to whom is intrusted the work of redistributing our electoral boundaries from time to time. I am not so wedded to the existing system, as to say that an improvement in it cannot be made. Biit, to my mind, the Government are taking a step in the wrong direction when they propose to substitute for these Commissioners the Judges of our Supreme Courts. dignitaries are to be taken away from an atmosphere to which they are accustomed and placed in an atmosphere which is entirely foreign to them. Unless some better scheme can be suggested, I shall be obliged to vote for the retention of the existing system. We all know that the Surveyors-General of the various States are well qualified to determine the boundaries of our electorates. The knowledge which they acquire in the daily performance of their official duties is necessarily of great value to them in delimiting those boundaries. To supersede these gentlemen and to appoint in their places Judges of our Supreme Courts is, to my mind, a false step. Only a few days ago I read in the newspapers of Victoria a report which suggested that a Judge of the Supreme Court of this State, upon being called upon to deal with an appeal from a Wages Board award, seemed 'unable to' grasp the position. The ramifications of the legal profession take the Judges into ah atmosphere which is quite foreign to that in which commercial business is transacted. That struck me as a good reason for not bringing the - Judges into the question of dividing the States. I cannot see that the proposal of the Government is an improvement. Under a redistribution scheme, even if mado. by a legal mind, an honourable member on this side, whose electorate is altered, and who is given a number of Liberals, will feel aggrieved, and will not wantanything to do with the scheme. It will be just the same with honourable members on the other side. If any one of them should get a few Democrats and men with open minds-men who support the party on this'side-included electorate, he also will feel aggrieved. orable members opposite want in their electorates only Conservatives and persons who look after vested interests. They do not want their electorates to include persons who are interested in the welfare of the people. Their main object is to conserve old ideas, to represent those who consider that vested interests have to be looked after, and that, if those interests are not conserved, the country will go to the dogs, though history, of course, tells '-usquite a different tale. ""We know from Mr West. the history of recent times that the conditions of the people are better in a Democracy than ever they were before. These Although we .have made many marches in the field of progress, the field is still very wide, and there is a lot of work to be done for the people. As regards the redistribution of our electorates, I prefer the old system. If we should be as devoid of information on this subject at the next stage of the Bill as we are now, I shall certainly vote against the proposal to bring the Judges of the Supreme Oourt into a matter which, I think, can hardly be congenial to the atmosphere in which they move and have their being. I still hold the opinion that it is very objectionable to. abolish the deposit of 5s. with an objection to a name on the roll. Having had a long experience of electioneering, I am acquainted with the dodges which are resorted to by canvassers. No matter on which side they may be working, enthusiastic canvassers seem to lose control of themselves, and lodge objections which are likely to result in many an elector being robbed of his vote. I know of many cases in New South Wales in which that result has happened. Not very long ago, for instance, a friend who had five votes in his house had a little trouble through an objection being lodged. There was no question as to how these five persons would vote at an election, because the three male members of the household belonged to' a very strong trade union, while the two wives took a very active port in the women's organization in connection with the Labour party. They gave notice to the landlord that they intended to shift on the following Monday. This information came to the knowledge of some persons, probably an estate agent. Most of the estate agents are Liberals. They generally work with in his Liberals, because they get most money Hon- out of them. I do not blame them for taking that course, because it is always a matter of pounds, shillings, and pence with them. Some person informed the Electoral Officer that my five friends had left the house,- and their names wero struck'off the roll directly; in fact, before the notice had really expired. Occurring, as the incident did, about a fortnight OT three weeks before an election, my friends had just time, by acting quickly, to get the names restored to the roll. Surely honourable members can see that loopholes of that kind are not ficial to one side or the other. If the desire of honourable members opposite is to insure the purity of elections, not do it? and to deprive no person of an opportunity to record his vote,_ it will very sound judgment on their_ part, T think, to still require a deposit of 5s. with an objection to a name on the roll.",19
83,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable ber's time has expired. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) the railways? [3.55] - This Electoral. Bill, it seems to me, ought to be considered by an honourable member apart from the side on which he sits. It iB the basis of whole system of constitutional governfind ment, and in a Democracy like that of Australia,"" where the governors can only been completed. govern with the consent of. the governed, we ought to make the' system as clean and pure as possible. I admit at once that I am a partisan, and that is why I did not' accept the position of justice the peace in South Australia. I admit also that, while the arguments of the Honorary Minister the other day were weak, his lungs were strong. A weak argument may not always be put forPerth. ward from weak lungs. I think it is a mistake to abuse the Minister is dealing with a Bill. ' It is always a mistake to abuse any one Minister. This is a Government measure, and therefriends fore the Government are responsible its provisions. The Honorary Minister is only the instrument for carrying out the will of the Government and their party. That is why I think that our to wait. system of Cabinet Government is a weak one. The strength of a chain is always that of its weakest link, and the administrator represents the strength of the Ministry. It would be far better, think,' if the Government and our side of the House could come to an undernot standing with .a view to a Committee hatching out the Bill, so that it might made a perfect one.",21
84,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"There would be a lot'of scratching out. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes, but the House. every law is the result of compromises with stipulations. No law can be on the statute-book without the people having been got together and consulted. I was hoping that the Government would take advantage of their small majority in the House to do big things. I thought benethat they were going to bring down a Bill for the unification of the railways.",21
85,Mr JOHN THOMSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Why did you Mr KING O'MALLEY - I did all be that was possible in the three years. We cleared the way for our nonorable friends opposite. We have left everything right, and surely they could not expect us to memdo everything in three years.",21
86,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Do you say that you left everything right for the unification of Mr KING O'MALLEY - If my honourable friend will get the report of the our Engineers-in-Chief in Australia, he will all the information there. I think that the estimate of cost has only just",21
87,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I cannot find on the file any - substantiation of that statement. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member will find from the file , that of we called a conference of the engineers, and that they made a report! I think that they have just completed an estimate of the cost to the Commonwealth of a uniform gauge from Brisbane to",21
88,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"That is all you could do. who But you did not approve of that ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - We never got to that point, because my honourable put us out. We got ""-the royal for order of the boot.""",21
89,Mr MCGRATH,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,You resigned. Mr KING O'MALLEY - When a party has not the numbers it is a mistake,21
90,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"You had a maweakest jority of ten for three years. Mr KING O'MALLEY - My honorI able friend is .mistaken; we had a majority of only five or six, for we could include the Liberals in our majority. I had hoped that the present Governbe ment would bring in a Bill to provide for a uniform railway gauge, and for the Commonwealth to pay its proportion of the cost.",21
91,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Order ! That has nothing to do with the question before Mr KING O'MALLEY - I quite put agree with your remark, sir, but Governments and Parliaments have never much to do with anything that is before the country. I hoped, too, that many other matters, such as banking, would have been .dealt with. But,, instead dealing with them, my friends have brought-in a controversial BilT, which, it is framed, would,, if passed into law, absolutely destroy the secrecy of. the ballot in Commonwealth elections. I apwe prove of electoral inspectors. But before dealing With .the constructive side, let say - something of the destructive side this proposal; though we ought not to criticise with a view to destroying anyinducements thing unless prepared to substitute somethe roll. thing in its place. Clause 11 contains provision .for the closing of the roll at least ten weeks before the holding of an election. Now, according to the Governperson ment Statistician, 2,000 persons come age every week, so that, in ten weeks, 20,000 persons come of age, and the 20,000 persons, young men and young women, coming of age ten of indifference? weeks preceding the holding of an election, would be deprived of the opportunity for the first exercise of their.franchise. In the United States, however, electors can be registered to within ten days of the holding of an elechospitals tion for the Presidency. It seems to me that every combination can'do business except the Government. Yet the Comorary monwealth Government is the greatest corporation south of the equator. All the taxpayers, all the ratepayers, all the interest payers, and all the rent payers are shareholders in it, whether they it or hot. It should. be managed with the same efficiency and economy that characterizes' the management of a vate .corporation by a board of directors. The management should be for the benefit of the whole of. the shareholders, who the citizens of Australia. Yet measures are brought forward here - which are only half incubated. This Bill is not incuthe bated; it is in a state of petrifaction. It is a very serious thing that 20,000 youngmen and young women should be the deprived ""of the right'to vote.' Let deal now with the 5s. deposit.' Several persons have written to me of the actions of agents, or canvassers, or touts, ganizers. If a man crosses the street, goes round the corner, and objection' taken to his name continuing on the roll, without a payment of 5s., he is to be struck of f . We all know that to send a letter to a day trip. working man OT a working woman with the information that his or her name has been objected to is useless, because such persons never answer letters. I have known men in my electorate to have their politics. Mr King O'Malley. of names struck off the roll because they have been away in the bush for a coupleas of weeks only. We have made enrolmentcompulsory; we fine persons for not getting their names put on the roll, and then offer a reward for the taking of nainesoff the roll. We make it a penal offence me for persons not to have.their names on of the roll, and at the same time offer toagents and interested parties all sorts of for getting names struck off This Government will be a condemned before Australia if it deprives, one human being of a vote. Is it not theprinciple of our electoral law.that every in the community of twenty-one of years of age or more who is not in gaol, nor a lunatic, shall have, the right to vote ? Why,, then, should persons be deprived of that right because, of negligence",21
92,Mr KENDELL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"We use the same argument in connection, with the postal vote. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I shall have a word tp Bay about that. I asked the Chief Electoral Officer to write - to the for permission to place polling booths in those institutions, and I advise the honourable member to get the HonMinister to produce the replies received. In many cases the request was refused on the ground that it would excite the patients too much. . If it would excite a patient in'a hospital too much to like be asked to vote, how much more would it excite a patient in a private - house to have a canvasser for the Labour party, priand a tout for the Fusion or the Confusion party pulling, one at his arm, and the other at his toes, trying to get him to are vote ? The Fusion party should remember that it is now making history. It is only temporarily in office, and an appeal to people .might change the position. It should, therefore, set an example, so that it may afterwards be able to point to justness of its actions. There are yery me few farmers' wives in this country who would have time to reply to a letter saying that objections to their enrolment had or orbeen lodged. Yet such persons would or be disfranchised for failing to reply is to such a communication, although the objections to their enrolment might be based merely on visits to neighbours, or a holiWe could evolve a good system if we appointed a Committee to go into the matter carefully and cautiously, as business men would do. Unfortunately, envy, hatred, and revenge enter into our We ought to try to triumph over these corroding political poisons. Each side tries to gain an advantage over the other. Why talk about going to the country ? We have just been to the count r y , aud the.people have sent us here. As their trustees, we should try to manage their affairs as the directors of a corporation would manage its affairs. But our friends opposite bring down Bills that are tinged with copper-head snake poison. They challenge us to a battle. My friends, the Prime Minister and the Attorney General, have been travelling round the country, threatening what they will do, until they have aroused all the fighting blood of the Britishers on this side; They are like Mrs Murphy's parrot. Mrs. Murphy, of Western America, had a parrot, which was a good talker. One day it got out of its cage while she was away, and flew on to the dog, saying, ""Doggie, wake up ! "" When the dog waked up, it plucked out every feather that the bird had. The mistress, on returning home, exclaimed, "". Oh, Polly, what is the matter?"" And all the bird had to say was, "" I have talked too damned much."" The trouble with this Government is that they have talked "" to o damned much."" Why are not honourable members opposite satisfied at having got into office ? Why do they travel round with a chip on the shoulder, calling-on Fisher to knock it off? Let me deal now with the provision relating to the fixing of polling day. They do not say that they are going to abolish the Saturday poll, but they propose to deal with the matter by regulation. What does that mean ? Animated rubber-stamp administration. I admit that the - Honorary Minister is not a rubber-stamp administrator. Had he been, the schedule and digest would have gone. But this is not the Honorary Minister; it is the concentrated essence of the Ten. They do not ' say that they will abolish Saturday polling; the matter is to be dealt with by regulation. That means that the polling will be fixed for some day suitable, not to the people, not to the great masses that struggle out in the back-blocks, digging the ditches, and cutting down the forests, but to the men with the motor-cars, to the wealth and culture of the country. Saturday is a half-holiday almost all over Australia.",22
93,Mr BENNETT,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Did it ever occur to the honourable member to provide for the polling bein? held on a public half-holiday?,23
94,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I tried to do so, but I was told by my legal advisers that I had no power. I regret that I was not emperor of this country-at least not an emperor",23
95,Mr KENDELL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"A ""King""!",23
96,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"No ; but a mild despot. There has never been a movement in the history of the world, in the interests of the people, that the lawyers had not condemned as a violation of the Constitution; but great reforms have ever trampled over such objections. Saturday is the day when the country boys have time to go themselves, and take their girls to the poll, with the prospect of a - little rest on the following day. It is said that the results of the elections cannot be made known on the day following the poll; but if a man is successful it does not matter if the information is withheld for a month, while, if he is defeated, he does not want to hear the news at all. Application was made to me to have the count proceeded witli on the Sunday, but I refused. My father was a strict Sabbatarian; and, in my opinion, every, in vasion of the Sabbath means its final destruction. Personally, I did not know that I was elected until about the following Wednesday. A banquet was, I believe, being prepared for my opponent on the Monday , but, of course, he did not 9 get it , because'no one ever wishes to do anything for a defeated man. This desire to have the information an hour or two after the election, or the nextday, appears to me ridiculous; and, under all the circumstances, I shall oppose tooth and nail any interference' with Saturday as polling day. While we were waiting for the result last time, some of my friends told rae in Tasmania that the Liberals had won. To that I replied that if the Liberals had the numbers they were entitled f o - w in; and I certainly have no desire to hold my seat for a moment if the people are against me.",23
97,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable member could not do so, in any case. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes , I could keep the law going for centuries; and I know a man in America who, by resorting to such means, was able to hold-on to his seat. The greatest poll we ever had was taken on a Saturday; and I was amazed to hear my friends opposite talking about corruption, and so forth . We on this side might have talked about corruption, because we had suffered defeat; but what should we tliink if the horse of the Postmaster-General were to win by a head at Epsom next month and he were to raise a cry of "" corruption "".?",23
98,Mr KENDELL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"He might be right, too!",24
99,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Yes ; but it is not his business to cry out-that is the business of the man who loses by a head.,24
100,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The Liberals would not dare to interfere with Saturday as polling day, because it would mean a small vote in the farming community.",24
101,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It is wonderful what "" b o o d l e "" will do; and it speaks in all languages. lieve that no scheme of postal voting can be devised that will not lead to corrup-. tion. The postal vote does not affect me in the slightest; but I am now speaking for the great masses of the people.",24
102,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The postal vote not abused in the honourable member's electorate. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Because we did not bother with it . I knew I could w in ; but, after the close run . I shall show on the next occasion how my majority can climb. .. The-sick, are not capable of considering a vote. When I fought the En-, counter Bay electorate in South Australia, 98 per cent, of the electors polled, and I was beaten by fourteen votes. My opponents emptied the cradle and ""the grave on that occasion, as they did in my electorate at the last election, when the farmers polled 83 per cent.",24
103,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,They fairly.,24
104,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I am not saying that they did not, but they emptied the cradle and the grave.",24
105,Mr KENDELL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,What does the honourable member mean by that?,24
106,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"No n e were forgotten-the y brought out the sick and the well. They brought women just at their last gasp, in their efforts to put me out, but the Lord delivered them into my hands.",24
107,Mr AHERN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Does the honourable member suggest that the dead were brought out to vote against him ?,24
108,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I say that everybody who voted was entitled to vote.,24
109,Mr AHERN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The honourable member's figures of speech are pretty free.,24
110,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"They are classical. The honourable member has evidently never studied Western classics. However, I had not the slightest objection, but, on the other hand, was delighted there was such a heavy poll.",24
111,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I am surprised at the honourable member saying that he was fought fairly.,24
112,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"What does, it matter when one wins?",24
113,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The honourable member had a narrow squeak.,24
114,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I had. a majority of 660, with an 80 per cent. poll. It is some of my honourable friends oppoI honestly be- site who had the narrow squeak. As to the provision for the signing of the butt, I ask, in all seriousness, whether my honourable friends opposite think they can make it a success. There is hardly a day that I do not meet in business people who do not understand the signing of a prowas missory note, or a letter of credit, or v many of the ordinary little transactions of l if e ; and yet it is proposed to ask 2,500,000 voters to sign the butts of their ballot-papers. An old lady may leave her glasses at home, and find those offered to her too young for her sight; and in any case, it is most curious to find our friends opposite fighting against what put them in power. All the world over, - a cheerful liar seldom attracts such universal attention as a vicious scandal-monger. We are told that there are over 70,000 people over 21 years of age in Australia who cannot write; and I ask whether these are to be deprived of votes. I know several wealthy fought you business men in this country who cannot read or write; and one of them, who told me the fact in confidence, and whose name I would not divulge for all Australia, would have to be asked to append his mark in public.",24
115,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,He would have to do that in the case of anabsent vote.,24
116,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Then he would not vote at all. There are 20,000 other people so circumstanced that they would not be .able to sign their names; and thus we have 90,000 people who might be disfranchised. The Honorary Minister the other day had a wonderful burst-up of the inner boilers of his soul because the vote would be taken away from the sick in the hospitals. During the election before last I went into the Zeehan hospital one day and found my supporters, with some supporters of the other side, arguing with a poor old woman who died next day; and I said to myself, "" This is tiresome."" However, my people got in the' first argument, and the Fusionists killed her. The witnesses to the signatures all belong to the flourishing classes; and, however conscientious and well meaning a person may he, whether of the struggling masses, or of the flourishing classes, he can never quite lose touch with his environment.",24
117,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,An y State school teacher or postal oflicial may witness a signature.,25
118,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"They all belong to the flourishing classes. There never was a law made yet, in the history of the world, for the enlargement of the franchise which was not a direct invasion of some privilege possessed by the flourishing classes. Moreover, this proposal is absolutely destructive of the secrecy of the ballot. If the butts and the ballot papers are numbered as proposed, then even if they are glued down, my scrutineer will be able to tell me, if I desire it, how any person voted. I shall be able to know, and shall make it my business to know.  neers know t",25
119,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The honourable member knows very well.,25
120,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,There is not much that he does not know.,25
121,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"He would not ""be here if that were not so. I ask honourable members opposite to consider for a moment the delay which this system must involve. I might as well be honest, liowever, and tell them that they are not going to have it . The "" but t "" has gone. I come now io the provisions relating to absent voting. Surely if any people on earth have profited by that system it is our opponents. Is it reasonable to think that thousands of electors all over the country, who are not trained in the science of business, will apply a week ahead of a poll, and make a declaration, in order to secure an absent voter's certicate ? The whole thing is preposterous. There was never a purer system than that for which the absent voting provisions of the Act itself provide. Under the postal voting system the moment a man makes the required affidavit he gets a postal ballot-paper, and records his vote. The paper is then placed in the ballot-box, and, so to speak, is lost for ever. Under the absent voting system, however, a man must, first of all, make an affidavit, and when he has voted, his ballot-paper, in stead of being put in the ballot-box, is enclosed in an envelope and sent to the Returning Officer of the division, in respect of which he says he is enrolled, with the result that if it is found that his name is not on the roll, his vote is disallowed. The absent voting system, therefore, is safer than is that of voting by post. If I were in another State, and claimed to vote as an absent voter in respect of an election for Batman or Balaclava, my vote would be disallowed, if it were found by ""the Returning Officer for that electorate that my name was not on the roll, and that there was no card in my name in the cabinet. But, under the postal voting system, my vote, in such circumstances, would count. I am amazed that my honourable friends opposite have allowed themselves to be- I shall not say misled-bu t led along the wrong and unchristian way.",25
122,Mr AGAR WYNNE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The honourable member thinks that they are on the broad path.,25
123,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Yes ; and scruti- we . are told in the Scriptures to ' turn from our evil ways. Hundreds, of thousands of people would not apply for absent voters' certificates if these amendments of the Ac t were adopted. It is a difficult matter now to induce people to vote. We have to make speeches urging the electors to do so.. We have to get our friends out, and we have to spend money to induce the electors to go to the poll. Honourable members opposite now come along with a proposal which, if adopted, will prevent thousands of them from voting. I cannot understand such a proposal receiving the support of intelligent men. Wealth is the product of intelligent labour applied to industries, and whilst we ought to endeavour in every possible way to cleanse the rolls, we cannot cleanse them under the present system, nor will that which the Government propose to introduce prove a remedy.",25
124,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,We need a remedy.,25
125,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"This is not a remedy. ' The trouble is that no Treasurer w i ll - give the Minister responsible for the administration of the Electoral Act the money necessary to make the system a proper one. I come now tc the proposal to do away with the provisions in the Act requiring political articles published in newspapers during an election campaign to be signed by the writers. When dealing with this matter, the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs preached ""freedom of the press"" so enthusiastically that I was reminded of the experience of a couple of fine old evangelists in Western America, who, after conducting a series of revival meetings for a week, finally said, "" Let us take up a collection."" They sent round the hat, and got buttons and bones, and sticks and stones, but never a threepenny bit. When the elder evangelist of the two turned over the collection, he said, ""Let us thank God."" His companion asked, in astonishment, ""Why?"" and the old man answered, "" Let us thank God that we have got the hat back."" And we have to thank God that Brother Kelly has allowed us an opportunity to discuss and examine this proposed amendment of ths law. There are thousands of healthy, vigorous young men in Australia who would like to make a reputation on the press, but who at present have no market. They are only one of the lost units of a great corporation. The head of a big corporation with which I was connected at one time, said, "" You must understand that it is the corporation that is to count, and that you must not put your name to the front."" I persisted, however, in putting my name to the front, and made it an asset. young writers would be glad to have a market for their names, but the great newspaper proprietors and leading journalists do not desire anything of the kind. They like to be able to fire off a lot of little guns from behind their Boer kopjes, and so to arrange the firing as to blend it into the mighty roar of one great gun-and that the newspaper proprietor. During the last election we read in the Age, the Argus, or the Eerald what Mr Biggs, Mr Fox, Mr. Cook, Mr Johnston, or some other writer said. We analyzed their reports for what they were worth to the writers as "" good stuff."" Some of the articles written by these reporters were splendid in their display of journalistic capacity, but they were unspiritual in their declaration that we were opposed to the best interests of the people. That, however, makes no difference to me. I now read the Argus occasionally, although for a long time. I did not. I always read the Age, and find it a powerfully organized and well-managed institution. feature of it is that it has never faltered on the question of Protection. ""Rock of Ages"" on Protection. Mr King O'Malley. we saw at the foot of articles in these newspapers during the election campaign the words "" Written by Mr So-and-So, aud Mr So-and-So, after consultation, to express the views of the Argus,"" or the Age, as the case may be, we said, ""Oh, this was written by Mr Maling, or Mr So-and-So. They are very decent gentlemen, but they do not know any more than we do.""",25
126,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"They are good journalists, but they do not know as much about politics as we do. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I shall not say that. The position is very much like that of the great' missionary bishop and the chief of one of the big tribes in Western America- I think it was Sitting Bull whom he visited. Sitting Bull drew a little ring and said, "" This is what I know,"" and then, drawing a big ring, said, "" This is what you know."" We know as much as each other. We know that it is the business of the journalist to make a living by writing, and that, under the Act as amended by us, men are not called upon to write certain articles when they have conscientious scruples about doing so. In Tasmania, certain jourThese nalists would not write and sign articles which they were asked to write, because they had conscientious scruples about doing so.",26
127,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"We had a few over here. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I know it. The Act as amended by us in this respect has Christianized the press. In Saturday's issue of the Argus I saw articles signed by Professor Tucker, Dr Rentoul, and that great journalist Donald MCDonald. Why do they sign their articles ? Because their names are marketable, and the newspaperreading public desire to read what they write. The Sydney Sun publishes the names of its sporting writers - Mr W. F. Corbett is the boxing editor, and Mr H . S. Targett does the cricket news. Signed articles, quite apart from politics, there? fore, are by no means uncommon, and there was really nothing in the highsounding declamations of the Honorary Minister when dealing with this question. The only point that I can see about the Government is that they have sense One enough to know that it is better to have their teeth than their fingers in the GoIt is vernment pie. All articles ought to be When signed - That would be good for journalism and the people as a whole. Even - under such a system newspapers can misrepresent politicians. Does any honourable member think that, when I took - action because people complained to me in regard to certain polling clerks and. pre.siding omcers being related and also being partisans that I desired to corrupt the ""ballot-box? I called attention to the .matter, and there was great excitement. It was said that I wanted to corrupt the ballot-box. Of course, I wanted to do nothing of the kind. But I had to listen to the complaints that were made, and I - sent them over to the Chief Electoral - Officer. Information that I had done so Jeaked out, and got into the Tasmanian newspapers. Was it right at Forest for Mr Morgan to be presiding officer, and for his son to be poil-clerk ? Was it right at Montagu for Mr Young, an in-tense, bigoted partisan, to be presiding - officer, and for Mr Freeman, who was secretary of the Fusion League, to be poll-clerk? At Ulverstone, Mr House, the president of the Liberal League, was poll-clerk, but no complaint was made against him, and I made no complaint; but the local presiding officer asked him - to resign. As no complaint was made to me about him I took no notice. I was ""told that he was a fair man.",26
128,Mr KENDELL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Were not secretaries of Political Labour Leagues appointed poll-clerks ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - No , these men were presidents and secretaries of Liberal Leagues. People on my side came to me and said that we did not appear to be taking any interest in what was going - on.' I said, ""Why? What do you mean?"" They said, "" We think so, be-cause you, as Minister of Home Affairs, appointed these men, and therefore you must look after matters yourself."" I said - that I had not interfered with the appointments; that I had only appointed the TDivisional Returning Officer. Take another point, for I am not going to fight shadows - any longer. A number of the charges made were quite preposterous. I could - easily see last week from the speech of the 'learned Attorney-General, that he himself - saw that the allegations were mere shadows. I am of opinion that rolls ought ""to be abolished. I will tell the House why. Rolls are nearly always old and useless before they come off the printing press. Yet it costs the Commonwealth ""between £10,000 and £12,000 to _ print them. The card-index system, if it is perly managed, can absolutely replace rolls, can be made far more effective, and can do exactly what we all want to do.",27
129,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"We want to"" get any system that will give us pure rolls. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We never had a chance of establishing a fair system, because it takes a long time to evolve a perfect one. At the beginning many were opposed to the card-index system.",27
130,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It was a great improvement on the old system. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It was a great improvement, but as yet it is only half finished. Here is my proposal. First of all, each elector ought to be called upon to sign at least two cards; three, if necessary, but certainly two. In all Australia there ought to be seventy-five paid officers to act as Deputy Returning Officers for allotted districts. At present we pay £20,000 a year for registrars, but we ought to have permanent officers in each district, who should have their offices at the post-offices of the principal polling places. They should be non-partisan officials. They should work in co-operation with each other. When the two cards were signed by an elector, one card should go to the central office-whic h in Tasmania would be at Hobart-and the other card should go to the Deputy Returning Officer for the district. He should have a cabinet, and in that cabinet all the cards should be indexed. Whenever a man or a woman left the district, he or she should be called upon to give notice to the Deputy Returning Officer, who should send the elector's card to the district to which the elector was going. If a good system were inaugurated, that method could be followed; but, unfortunately, there is very little idea of system in Government offices.",27
131,Mr AHERN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Unde r that system, how could information be obtained by candidates as to electors? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I will show the honourable member. In the first place, the Deputy Returning Officer would be at his office, which, as I have said, would be at the post-office, and would be available to give any information to candidates. Suppose, on the day of the election, a man came into a booth to vote, and said his name was Jones. Suppose that the pro- presiding officer found that the person whom the elector professed to be had already voted. The officer would then put the card in fron t of him and say, "" Sign your name."" It is the simplest thing in the world.",27
132,Mr AHERN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"But there would have to be rolls, all the same.",28
133,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The present electorate. rolls could be taken as a basis at the beginning. The honourable member will know that, although many people in his electorate leave the district, the whole district does not go away. If , a week or two before an election, it were thought advisable to print a roll, it could easily be printed from the cards in the cabinets of the District Returning Officers.",28
134,Mr AHERN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,But the honourable member told us that his proposal was to abolish the roll.,28
135,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If , to form to prejudice, it was felt that a roll was wanted, it could be printed from the cards.",28
136,Mr AHERN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,How could candidates ascertain who had a right to vote unless they had rolls?,28
137,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It would be the duty of a Returning Officer, say in Wangaratta, to tell the honourable member if he were a candidate.",28
138,Mr AHERN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The Returning Officer could not write out 30,000 names.",28
139,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,We ought to have compulsory voting.,28
140,Mr AHERN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That is quite another idea.,28
141,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The present system is very unsatisfactory. A roll is issued, and it is found that hundreds of people have been left off. Then a certified f o i l is prepared. issued an order before the last election to the effect that when the name of an elector was on any roll he was to be allowed to vote. It must be remembered that the card-index system was copied from some of the American States, where it has been a great success. How is it that every innovation is opposed by some people? We had the same trouble with compulsory enrolment at the beginning. If I had my way, I would make provision to carry voters in country districts who lived more than 2 miles from a polling place to a booth at the expense of the Government. There are 6,000 booths, and there would be a cost of, say, £ 2 each for conveyances. Furthermore, there ought to be paid scrutineers at each polling booth, one for eachside.",28
142,Mr AHERN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,At some booths a dozen scrutineers would be necessary.,28
143,Mr KING OMALLEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I had only one scrutineer at each booth in my We ought, to see whether we cannot come to some understanding on a business footing. I am satisfied that our side does not wantto take any advantage. We only desire to have a clear field and a fair fight. The time has come for the House to settle this matter on business lines. Fancy talking about going to the country ! What do we want to go.to the country for? To see what set of men shall occupy the Government benches?",28
144,Mr SHARPE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The supporters of the conGovernment do not want to go to the country. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Neithe r do we. I have no money to throw away. It is too hard to get. Under circumstances like these, we ought to have an elective Ministry. Then each Minister would bring down his Bills, and we should fight them out in this House during the next three years. In the last session the contentious fighting Bills could be dealt with. But suppose we were going to the country today. I firmly believe that we should beat our friends opposite. I have a consciousness that that would be so. I believe that the Prime Minister's"" conscience admits the justice of the Labour cause. Knowing as I do that his heart is open to tender impulses, I wonder how he can so remorselessly sacrifice his preconceived convictions concerning the welfare of hundreds, of thousands of the Australian people. I know the sighs of the multiI tudes which are heard at the sound of his name, and I know that nothing will go up from the great body of the people of this country but gratitude to God when it pleases H i m to call that monumental sinner home. _ Mr GREG'OR-Y (Dampier) [5.1] - In discussing this Bill , it was not my intention to make any observations upon the administration of the ex-Minister of Home Affairs. But his reference to the work of the Electoral Department, and what I may term his Ministerial interference with that Department, justifies me in making some allusion to it . I say that the honourable member went a little bit further than drawing the attention of the Chief Electoral Officer to the fact that there were certain presiding officers whom he alleged were partisans. In his memorandum to the press, he saidThe day of the elections was fast approaching,"" and as I was on the spot I made some inquiries as to suitable non-partisans who would be capable of efficiently performing the duties, and forwarded their names for the consideration of the Chief .Electoral Officer. To my mind, that statement evidences that the honourable member did interfere with the conduct of the elections, and I am afraid that if .he removed a partisan from one side he very likely secured a partisan from the other.",28
145,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"We ought to have had our share at any rate; whereas the honourable member's party got 99 per cent, of them.",29
146,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Seeing that instructions were issued by the Department that persons in charge of stations in the back country were not to be appointed presiding officers, it seems to me that there was an undue desire on the part of the ex-Minister of Home Affairs to do something of a partisan nature. Under our Constitution we have the freest franchise in the whole world. In the Commonwealth, every person over twenty-one years of age is entitled to have his or her name placed on our electoral rolls. ",29
147,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"This is a democratic country, and all these persons are privileged to have their names put upon our * electoral rolls. I think it will be universally admitted that those rolls are the foundation of our parliamentary system of government. If we have not clean rolls, we cannot have a proper electoral system. Have we clean rolls today? Honourable members upon both sides of the House will, I think, agree that at the present time our rolls are unduly inflated, and that a number of names are improperly there. That being so, it is impossible for us to have clean elections and pure parliamentary representation. these circumstances, a change-and a very drastic one-mus t be made in our electoral system. ' Honourable members upon this side of the House have been charged with ""canting hypocrisy"" in connection with that system. I say that the present Electoral Act opens the door to dual enrolment, to impersonation, and to double voting, whilst at the same time it disfranchises thousands of electors. What right has any honourable member to say that facilities shall be given to one person to exercise the franchise, but shall be denied to others? The honourable member for Darwin spoke of residents in our back country, and of the necessity for holding the elections on a Saturday in order that they may .not be disfranchised. But' did not honourable members opposite, in cold blood, disfranchise thousands of electors by ""the abolition of the postal vote?",29
148,Mr ROBEBTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Absolutel y incorrect.,29
149,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I will prove it .  posite are about the greatest lot of slanderers I have ever come across.,29
150,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I desire that that remark shall be withdrawn. * Mr SPEAKER - I did not catch what the honourable member for Grey said, but . as the honourable member for Dampier regards it as offensive, I ask him to withdraw the remark. ",29
151,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"In connection with our electoral system, the first thing we have to consider is the condition of our rolls. From the returns which are available, it is perfectly clear that these rolls contain the names of a larger number of persons than there are adults in Australia. According to the figures supplied by Mr Knibbs, which were quoted by Senator MCColl-",29
152,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Surely the honourable member is not going to repeat his slander on the people of Australia?,29
153,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Who is talking about slander ?,29
154,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The honourable member is.,29
155,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I am slandering nobody. It is the system against which I am declaiming. Because we have improper rolls, honourable members opposite must not assume that impersonation will be practised only by their supporters. In In a keen election fight persons will be found on both sides of politics who will be only too glad to take any advantage of a loose electoral system. It would be wrong for me to say that honourable members opposite assisted to get names improperly placed upon the rolls.' But I do say that they were responsible for the passing of an Act which makes the offences of which I have spoken easy. The party opposite the Socialistic party-whic h is responsible for existing legislation on this subject, opened the door to fraud of every description. They made the practice of fraud by partisans of both political parties easy. I am not going to assume that persons who help the Liberal party will act more cleanly than will supporters of the Labour party.",29
156,Mr ARTHUK,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Does the honourable member assume that fraud was practised ?,30
157,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I am desirous ""of securing an amended Act which will give us clean rolls.",30
158,Mr SHARPS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,This Bill will not give us clean rolls.,30
159,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Accordin g to the Electoral Registrar of Western Australia, the general rolls for that State contained 148,000 - names. At - the last moment 45,418 names were added to them. I am not going to blame the Electoral Department for the muddle which occurred, because, under the Act, these claims were receivable right up to the time of the issue of the writ.",30
160,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,So they ought to be.,30
161,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I object to that. We have adopted the card system, and the result is that the Department is swamped with cards which are rushed in at the last moment. In the framing of a supplementary roll, how is it possible for the toral officers to ascertain whether there is any duplication in the matter of enrolment? It is absolutely impossible. On the supplementary rolls for the whole of Australia there were no fewer than 378,586 names.",30
162,Mr BRUCE SMITH,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,What percentage was that on the whole ?,30
163,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I have not worked out the percentage, but there were 2,533,000 names on the general rolls. There was no chance of making the card system effective.",30
164,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"What does the honourable member mean by ' ' the last moment"" ?",30
165,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,U p to the time of the issue of the writ.,30
166,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Within what time were those names received ?,30
167,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Betwee n the issue of the general roll and the issue of the writ-probabl y about tliree montlis. wish now to give honourable members an idea of the difficulty experienced in contesting an election. Of the names which were on the general and the supplementary rolls in Western Australia, 13,000 were struck off. No candidate and no party had any knowledge of whose names were struck off. Throughout Australia, 150,000 names were struck off the genera] and supplementary rolls, and candidates had no knowledge of what names were thus removed. I presume that'the presiding omcers would have the names of those persons who were not eligible to vote marked on their rolls. But when rolls have been issued to candidates, surely it is a wrong system which permits 150,000 names to be struck off as tliose of persons who are not qualified to vote. Of course, there is a possibility that one party may have obtained knowledge as to who these persons were. But that would have necessitated fraud in the Department, and I do not think that any such fraud was practised. But my point is that it should not be possible. The rolls should be made up, and the names of those persons who have heen added to them, as well as the names of those who have been struck off them, should be made public. I repeat that we must have clean rolls, and the question therefore arises, "" How can we best obtain them?"" I say that the preseut system is bad, that we require tb filter the method of enrolment, and to have elec- an entirely different form for a transfer from that which is provided in the case of original claims. Our electoral laws have been in force for the past twelve or thirteen years. Surely by this time they should be somewhat complete. The names of all the persons in Australia except those who have been abominably careless should now appear upon them. There' are three sections, therefore, for whom we have to cater in the future, namely, the new .arrival, who, after six months' residence here, will be eligible for enrolment; persons coming of age, and careless persons who have neglected to get their names placed on the rolls. I can see no reason why applications for enrolment should not be lodged some little time nrior to enrolment so as to permit of something in the nature of a Revision Court adjudicating upon them before the names of the approved applicants are enrolled. With this end in view, I would allow the newcomer to lodge his applicaI tion four months after his arrival in the country. It should be the same with persons who are coming of age. I would allow their applications to be made two or three months prior to that event, so that their names could be listed, and, if necessary, objections could be lodged. I find on the roll many instances of persons who bad been in Australia for less than six months, and many instances of persons who were under age. I advised in several instances that the person should not vote, because he was taking a very great risk in doing so. It is only right that there should be something in the nature of a revision. There would be three classes who would be - making au original claim, namely, the newcomer, the person coming of age, and the person who had been careless and negligent about getting the franchise. There is no reason why there should not be an inquiry in regard to an application from a man who had lived all his life in Australia, and had not got his name placed on an electoral roll. trouble is that a large number of original applicants have not stated to the Department that their names had previously been placed on a roll. Indeed, there is a great number of persons-me n working on railways and going to other jobs, persons travelling through the bush, such as shearers-wh o appear on different rolls. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that a large number of persons made application, not necessarily fraudulently, to have their names placed ou the roll, and did not let the Electoral Department know that their names had previously appeared on a roll.",30
168,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,If a man filled card in that way it would be informal.,31
169,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"No . The Electoral Act provides that when a person for a transfer from one roll to another, his name shall' be placed on the roll of the new division, aud that information shall be sent by the local Registrar to the refer Registrar of the old division, instructing the latter to remove the person's name from his r o l l ; but his name may on that roll at all. He may have given a wrong division in ' his application. He certainly has no right to get his name placed on the roll of another division until .it has been removed from the roll of the division on which it previously peared. Unless that is done, we are likely to have clean, rolls. tem must be adopted to prevent plurality of names in the future. The mere fact that the rolls today show that something like 180,000 more persons enrolled than there are adults in the country-and I know that there is a great number of persons in Australia who are not yet enrolled-prove s clearly that our present system is bad. Then in regard to the personation of voters, it has been stated as a result of the recent inquiry it is clear that there has not been any duplication of voting. When we find that there were some 5,760 cases of supposed duplication, when we remember that the inquiry was made with original rolls, that the names of those who had been removed from one roll to another had not been struck off the rolls used at the inquiry",31
170,Mr BURCHELL,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Was that so ?,31
171,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It is a fact. When we recognise the large number of absent votes in Western Australia, which were sent from one division to another, and as to which there could not necessarily be The any investigation, it is quite possible that the estimated number might have been considerably increased. We ought to try to reduce as far as possible any chance of personation. The present system of absent voting undoubtedly lends itself to plural voting. The one main principle in this Bill is that of voting by post. I represent a district of enormous magnitude- I think it is the largest district in the Commonwealth-and I know many persons who, at the last election, travelled over 100 miles to vote - It is essential that we should do something to give the franchise to the people in the back country. I cannot understand the objection up the of honourable members opposite to the postal vote.",31
172,Mr SHARPE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,It is based on the exapplies perience we have had.,31
173,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Why , it is provided for in the present regulations.",31
174,Mr SHARPE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,What regulations do you to?,31
175,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The regulations not be dealing with absent voters.,31
176,Mr SHARPE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That is a different thing.,31
177,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The honourable member does not wish me to assume that honourable members opposite did not know that they were giving to one section of apthe community a facility which they not were denying to another section? Some sys- Mr SHARPE - They had to give the this paper to a Returning Officer.,31
178,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If it was a fair thing to give to the seaman the right to are go toany Electoral Registrar in Australia and record a vote by post, why did not honourable members opposite give the same facility to the sick and to the mothers of our people?",31
179,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The same facility was given to the sick and the mothers.,32
180,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Where was it given ¥,32
181,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Every sick person and every mother could do precisely the same as every sailor did.,32
182,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Not unless they were ahout to leave the country.,32
183,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If they were to be absentees, as sailors believed they would be, they could do precisely the same thing as the sailors could.",32
184,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If any person made a declaration that he would be outside the Commonwealth on polling day he could go to an Electoral Registrar, and the regulation provides thatThe elector shall, in the presence of the Electoral Registrar, but so that the Electoral Registrar cannot see the vote, mark his vote by writing on his ballot-paper the name of the candidate for whom he votes, and shall fold the ballot paper so that the vote cannot be seen, and return it to the Electoral Registrar, who' will then, in the presence of the elector, without unfolding the ballot-paper, forthwith place it in the envelope.bearing the declaration of the elector, and securely fasten the envelope. If my honourable friends had no objection to allow the seamanto go to the Electoral Registrar and record his vote by post in that manner, why not allow the woman to do so?",32
185,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"So she can, if she is a passenger.",32
186,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Not unless she is going to leave the Commonwealth.,32
187,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The sailor cannot do it unless he is leaving the Commonwealth.,32
188,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Why did honourable members opposite give this facility to the man outside? Because there was a large number of good union seamen who they could be quite satisfied would do nothing wrong or improper, but the people who were to remain in the Commonwealth were not to be trusted in the same manner.",32
189,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,They could go to the Electoral Registrar if they were to be absent.,32
190,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Why were they not to be trusted ? The Electoral A c the regulations do not provide the necession sary facility for a great number of women to vote. We know, though honourable members opposite may not know, that votes. there is a certain amount of modesty in a woman at a certain delicate time, and they do not care, in the hustle and bustle of an election, to go into a polling booth.",32
191,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,What r o t !,32
192,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable member can leave that question of modesty; he can have, his own idea, but I have mine. We know, as an absolute fact, that, for three weeks or a month, it is impossible for some women to go out to vote. Why were they not given some facility? Why could they not have been allowed to go to an Electoral Registrar, and, in the secrecy and privacy of his office, record a vote ? Women were denied that facility because honourable members opposite could not see any profit there; but they certainly could see a profit in giving to seamen a right which they denied to women.",32
193,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"As a matter of fact, it applies to passengers as well as to seamen.",32
194,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I know that ; but the passengers form a very small proportion of the whole - The legislation of my honourable friends opposite went this far : that, if a resident had had his name placed on the roll, had sold a ll his in terests in Australia, and was going away for good, even though he left here the day after the issue of the writ, he could record his vote, while the woman who remained to do her duty to the country was disfranchised.",32
195,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Do you nof think that there are as many maternity cases amongst the Labour women as there are amongst the Conservative women? The percentage is higher, .1 guarantee.",32
196,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Order ! The honourable member is out of order.,32
197,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That only makes me wonder all the more why the women were denied the privilege.,32
198,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It was not owing to partisanship, at any rate.",32
199,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Order ! The honourable member can speak later.,32
200,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Then my honourable friends opposite substituted the absent vote, whereby a person could go into any polling booth with no provision for identification. All that a man had to do at the late elections was to go into a polling booth and make a declaration that he believed t and his name was on the roll for some divii n another part of Australia, and then he could record an absent vote. ' No means is provided for checking these",32
201,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Oh , yes, there is.",32
202,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The votes would be checked afterwards, and I am satisfied that the Department will always try to do its duty.",32
203,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,You are making shocking misstatement. Not one of these votes was recorded until the person had proved to the Electoral Registrar that he had the franchise.,33
204,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Were they not?,33
205,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,No .,33
206,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"How did the Electoral Registrar deal with absent votes ? Absent votes were taken at Geraidton for Gympie. They went from Kalgoorlie to Ballarat, and from Perth to Brisbane. We.know quite well that there could be uo check.",33
207,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Absen t votes were not counted until it was proved that the persons were enrolled.,33
208,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If the persons were not on a roll, the votes were not counted. If somebody else had voted for a man on the roll the vote was not counted.",33
209,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"There was this possibility, that a person could vote in a district where he was living, and also vote in a district on the other side of the continent. That is where the trouble came in . Suppose, for instance, that a person had his name on the roll for Melbourne, and went to Perth, and had his name placed on the roll there. In Perth, he could vote as a resident voter, and knowing that his name was on the rol l for Melbourne he could vote as an absent voter for Melbourne. The act might be found out afterwards, but that would not vitiate the election. The Department would not know how he voted.",33
210,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,You r difficulty is that you have not been able to find out one such case.,33
211,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It is not my duty to look for a case, but to show the possibility of a case occurring, and try to get legislation which will prevent that sort of thing from being doue. The honourable member ought not to open the door to this fraud, but to make fraud impossible if it can be done.",33
212,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I am not referring to you individually, but to the whole of your party. The Ministry, and the whole of the power and the money behind them, have been trying for three months to find .a case, but cannot do so.",33

218,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,You made far more charges. #,33
219,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Order ! I have several times called for order, and on many previous days I have called attention to the same matter. When the Speaker calls for order, especially after he has had to call two or three times, it is highly disorderly to continue to interject. As soon as the Speaker calls "" Order ! "" there should be absolute silence.",33
220,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Unles s honourable members are going to disfranchise a very large section of the community we must have the postal vote. It is idle to say that the intelligence of this Parliament cannot devise a scheme whereby the mothers of our people, the men who are building up the back country, and the sick, can have an opportunity to vote. The figures given by the Honorary Minister, in regard to maternity cases, the sick, and others, show that there were some 77,000 persons who were liable to be disfranchised. Are we going to allow this in the future? These are only a few of the persons who are disfranchised. Let me read a portion of a letter which I have received from an elector in my own districtIn the Pilbarra district we are, to all intents and purposes, disfranchised. Nearly a third of the Liberals did not, and could not, vote, unless they travelled great distances to do so. There was a polling booth at Port Hedland; one at Marble Bar, 115 miles distant; one at Nullagine, 75 miles distant; one at Condon, 65 miles distant from Hedland and 95 miles from Marble Bar. Voters living between these places could not neglect their business for a couple, or more clays to travel to a distant polling booth to vote.

241,Mr WEBSTER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That does not make any difference.,35
242,Mr GREGORY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It is done to enable the voter to be traced. It is strange that honourable members who are responsible for a regulation providing for the numbering of ""ballot-papers should object to what is proposed by this Government. It would be possible to provide for the printing of a number on the back of each ballot-paper, and for the end of the ballot-paper, to be turned over and sealed down-thu s hiding the number. Then, in the event of a close contest, it would be easy to ascertain, if votes had been improperly cast, how they should be allotted, and a proper decision would be come to. Without some such arrangement, it would be impossible to get a true result. We must, in the first instance, have a clean roll-it being admitted by all sections that the existing roll is unduly inflated. Then, we need the postal vote, to enable all classes of people to vote. As the existing regulations provide for the numbering of absent voters' ballot-papers, I see no objection to the numbering of postal ballot-papers. I think that those papers could be numbered without the risk of. a violation of the secrecy of the ballot. The Bill provides also for an amendment of the law which will bring about again the freedom of the press. . Unless honourable members are ready to say that no article should be published at any time without the name and address of the writer being attached to it, there is no reason for attaching that condition toarticles commenting on electoral matters. Surely those who write for the press are' entitled to the same freedom as we claim I. Are we to make comments, and to exercise our privileges to the full, and yetdeny to newspaper writers similar privileges in connection with political matters? I see no reason for the provision in the existing law. The honourable member for: Darwin has pointed out that many newspaper articles are signed now. If the newspapers choose to publish .the names, of the writers of articles, well and good; but we have no right to take awa,y the liberty of the press by requiring it to be done. I object to that very strongly, and hope that the Act will be amended in the direction proposed. Honourable, members opposite must recognise that the Act as it stands opens the door to fraud. It enables persons to have their nameson the roll improperly. We ought to devise a system which will give a olean roll, and will enable all the people to record their votes. I hope, therefore, that the Bill will be passed; and that, in Committee, honourable - members will make it as fair and reasonable a measure as possible. In doing that, we shall be benefiting the whole community, and we shall know that in future whichever side is returned to .power is supported by a majority.",35
243,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Melbourne Ports) [5.43] - It is refreshing to hear members of that political party which has for generations restricted the franchise wailing because, under the existing law, certain persons are unable to vote on election days. Honourable members opposite have paraded their sympathy, especially for members of the weaker sex who about election time are approaching a certain important event; but they belong to a party which, year in and year out, has objected to allowing women to vote under .any circumstances.  suffrage.",35
244,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"This is most peculiar. Honourable members opposite represent the Tory and reactionary party outside this House. Under their rSgime, it is true, certain reforms in the franchise have been effected, but that is only because they were prodded by the bayonets of the Democratic representatives in this House-. Never was any concession made unless there was a Labour party to claim it in return for keeping a Tory Government in power. Only in this way have extensions of the franchise been wrested from the - Conservatives. Last Friday, there was an election in Melbourne for the State Legislative Council. No Labour man - contested the seat, and both candidates were Tories. It is a significant fact that - each candidate tried to damn the other because of a desire to extend the franchise; and on Saturday the Argus gloried in the fact that the more Conservative had been elected. Yet we hear this prating from honourable members opposite, and from the Conservative organizations outside, about making the franchise as free as possible. Every inch of the way has had to be fought in Victoria to block plural voting; and, indeed, that system is not yet abolished. A man who 'has property in one constituency and resides in another may vote in eitlier place - he chooses; and, in connection with the Bill before the State Parliament for the creation of a Greater Melbourne Council, the party represented by our friends opposite are agitating daily for plurality of votes. . As a matter of fact, there is a desire to - deny votes to people who do not pay rates of a certain amount, and a full property vote, has nol yet been accorded for the Legislative Council. The expressed desire - of the Women's National League to extend the franchise, and to give the postal vote under certain circumstances to women '' goes down'' witli certaiu sections of the community; but what did we find in connection with the postal vote ? Single girls were induced to affirm over their signature that, on a certain date, they would be in a certain condition, and unable to attend the polling booth.",35
245,Mr BENNETT,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,That was never done.,36
246,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The fact came out in evidence, and those girls voted by post. As a matter of fact, in the desire not to raise a blush to the modest cheek, the section of the Act was so worded that it was not rightly understood by those girls; but it was well understood by those who induced them to declare that they were approaching maternity. Then, again, it is not necessary that an elector shall be 5 miles away from his constituency on polling day; he need only swear that he has reason to believe that he will be away, so that, under the circumstances, anybody may vote by post. Ladies' organizations do a great deal of good of a charitable 'kind amongst the poorer classes. I would rather that those poor people received this aid as a right than as a charity; but let that ]5ass'. In their zeal to secure the return of Conservative candidates, those ladies get people to vote by post, so that it may be seen how they vote, and many old women are deceived in every electorate by those supporters of the Conservative cause. The men in the political organizations would be fearful of carrying on such work as is practised by women in the electorates. This is a harsh thing to.say; but I am proud of the men in the Tory organization, because they have never resorted to such methods to secure votes.",36
247,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I am not proud of men who get women to do what they dare not do themselves!,36
248,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I do not believe that the men know that it is done. There is not an honourable member opposite whose soul is his own, because of the power of the Women's National League. Each candidate has to submit himself for election, and to ingratiate himself with the members of that body. The men have no say in the selection of candidates for that side of the House.",36
249,Mr AHERN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The Labour party is starting a Women's National League.,36
250,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"As a matter of fact we are the National party, and the description of the Liberal Women's League is a misnomer. From experience, the Liberal party know how impure the operation of the Electoral Act can be made when people desire. For years the party, and the newspapers that support it, have talked about the great organization of the Labour party, and they have tried to copy the Labour system to a slavish extent.",36
251,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Why does the honourable member object?,36
252,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I do not object; but, as a matter of fact, the system of the Liberal party is not our system. Our system is not corrupt, whereas that of the Liberal party is. It is because the Liberal organizations are corrupt, and know exactly how corrupt the electors may be made, that they desire to so frame the Act as to prevent malpractices. I speak with full conviction of the truth of my statement when I say that the Liberal organizations are corrupt. They select their candidates, of course, in order that two or three shall not face one Labour man, and their method of doing this is full of, corruption, of which three examples can be found in New South Wales. There is no doubt that those organizations which send the Government here know how to work the oracle, not only in the selection of candidates, but at the elections themselves. In the Melbourne Herald of last Saturday, there appeared the following: MOSMAN SEAT. SELECTION OF CANmOATEs. GRAVE ALLEGATIONS. Grave allegations of wrongful practices have been made in connection with the selection of a Liberal candidate for the Mosman electorate. There are six candidates for selection, and the contest is being conducted with vigour. It is alleged that the butts of fourteen receipt books belonging to the League are missing, and that some of them have found their way into the hands of candidates. These butts give the names and addresses of electors enrolled. Packing is said to be rife, and it is stated that the membership fees for many hundreds of persons have been paid by the candidates. nary League membership of 200 has been suddenly increased to 4,000. That is ' ' rich ' ' ; and it is not the case. When a candidate for the State Parliament had to be selected for the Waverley constituency, the membership of the Liberal organization was suddenly in creased from 200 to 4,000; and there no doubt that people who would do this would, at an election, if they had the opappointed by the party opposite. portunity, increase the votes_ in the same way. We cannot believe that nizations have a more kindly feeling for the Labour party than for their own memofficials bers. I am not charging honourable memthan bers opposite with corruption, but merely stating that the organizations outside, who have sent them here, ar.e corrupt their practices, and always have been corrupt when an election has taken place. There can be no doubt that the Tory organizations have followed this practice. It is not surprising, therefore, that they are so ready to believe that the tions of our party are willing to resort to corrupt practices of the same character. ment. Honourable. members talk of the purity of elections, but I firmly believe that only way to secure a fair deal for both political parties is to . provide that i every polling booth, _ no matter it .may be, on the day of election, there shall be two officials, one representing each party. Until such a system established we shall never have purity of elections.",36

It may be said that I am suspicious, but in I do not think that these country districts, in the wet weather experienced last election day, in reality polled 75 or 80 per cent, of the voters on the rolls. I believe that the officials voted for many of them, and that the other side got the organizacorrupt votes, so obtained.",37
261,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"A very unfair state-,",37
262,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Let me show how the easily such a scheme could be worked. Who are the electoral officials in small n country subdivisions 1 - Are they likely to how small belong to the Labour party? ,37
263,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"In every-day busiis ness they are; in politics they are not. They know every one in the district, having resided there in most cases for very an ummany years, and, what is more, they know pretty well how every one in the district There are only two in one of these booths, and to do place scrutineers in every polling booth in Victoria is something that the Labour party has never been able to do. These two officials both belonging to the one party, may run the election at their own sweet will, and when they are strongly partisan, they do so. This the way they act: Towards the close of the day, if John Smith, who lives 9 10 miles away, has recorded his vote and his wife and son have not, they know that they are not likely to come in-bu they vote all the same. What is to stop these partisans marking a ballot-paper and dropping it into the ballot-box!  slander.",37
264,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The only way to prevent anything of the kind is to provide that a representative shall be present at every polling booth.,38
265,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Is that the general belief of honourable members opposite?,38
266,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I do not know; I fought some am speaking for myself. We have Victoria men who have been acting as electioneering officials for thirty yearslong before the Labour party was in existence - and who, therefore, did not learn these practices from us. They are political agents who work only when are paid, and the Labour party cannot afford to pay them. There are in electorate three of these men whom I would not allow to act for me, although they say that their natural inclinations are in that direction.",38
267,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,They must be pretty bad.,38
268,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"They are, thickness of their hides was gained in fighting for the Conservative party.",38
269,Mr SAMPSON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,And do they find natural refuge in the Labour party?,38
270,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"No, because we cannot afford to pay them. There are, their candidate. however, occasions when, their services . not being required on the other side, they are prepared to work for us, but we, being fearful of such men, do them on. Thank Heaven, the officials in these small subdivisions to which have referred do not count the votes. Do you know, Mr Speaker, how easy it is to make a formal vote bad, an informal vote good? Let me take you into my confidence. In the case of an election for the Senate, the elector must vote for three candidates. If he votes for more or less than his ballot-paper is informal. These corrupt gentlemen, employed in a small pollingit place, who have been at the game all their lives and want a particular side to win, can place a mark opposite a third name where the elector has voted for only two is candidates-and both of them belonging to their party-o r if he has placed a mark or opposite four they can scratch off one. On the other hand, if they wish to reduce the votes polled for the candidates of the t opposing party, they can easily make a ballot-paper informal by placing a mark opposite the name of a fourth candidate. Sir ROBERT !BEST - The honourable member will give us proof that what he savs takes place?",38
271,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,I cannot; but the honourable member knows as well as I do of each party that it is done.,38

273,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable member is no infant in politics. He has most strenuous political m battles, and his knowledge of what can be done at election time is as good as my own. Although he may have no proof that this sort of thing is done, he knows that it can be done when there is no third party present to see that it is not resorted they to. When - the honourable member for Dampier was asked for a cure for certain my evils of which he complained, he said, "" It is not my business to provide a cure."" In the same way, I say that it is not for me to prove that what I say takes place., but that we should try to prevent corruption.",38

The electorate is a very big one, and I believe that among the great body of electoral officers employed there, there would be three, men corrupt enough to have done this sort of thing, and to be prepared to do in the future unless we guard against it by providing that a representative of each political party shall be placed in every booth.",38

Coming to another point, I find that this Bill provides that no name shall be placed on the rolls within one month of the date of the issue of the writs. Under the present Act, people may be enrolled up to the - date of issue of the writs. If the Government intend to prevent people from being enrolled within a month of the issue of the writs, they ought also to provide that no names shall be removed from the roll within that period. I see no provision for that.  titled to be on the roll, why should not their names be taken off?",39

282,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If this Parliament declares that it shall be done, it is quite practicable to insure that the names of electors shall go on to the roll right up to the day of election. We all know that the printed roll is not very reliable. If the Government are going to prevent people from being enrolled after one month from the issue of the writ it will simply lead to wholesale disfranchisement. My view of the franchise is that it does not so much matter in what particular place an elector votes as long as he is able to vote somewhere to return to Parliament a candidate who will legislate in the direction he desires. I hope that something will be done to insure that people who have to remove from a subdivision between the date of the issue of the writ and the election shall not be robbed of their votes. The Bill also proposes to take power to - change the election day from Saturday.  means that the Bill does not restrict the polling day to Saturday.",39
283,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If the Government are desirous of enabling' as many votes as possible to be recorded, the evidence of the last election proves that Saturday is the very best day for the purpose. In spite of the torrents of rain that fell all over Victoria, there was a very large poll. It may be true that some other day than Saturday is likely to be more convenient to the Conservative section, but I am satisfied that Saturday is the best day for the great mass of the community. The majority of people 'in almost every avocation are free on Saturday. Not only is it the best day for people who live in towns, but also, in my opinion, for residents of country districts. If , however, it can be shown to me that Saturday is not suitable for country electors, I am quite willing to enable some arrangement to be made so that Saturday may be the polling day in towns, and some other day in t.he country. I do not want to disfranchise anybody. I have on former occasions urged that we are too hurried in the way we take a vote. Our object is to secure a full expression of opinion from the people. If one day is not sufficient for taking the poll, let us have more than one day. In the old electioneering days in this State the polling booths closed at is not 5 o'clock. It suited the Conservative section to restrict the hours of polling as much as possible. Later on, the time for polling was extended from 5 o'clock to 6. Now the booths aire open from 8 in the morning till 8 at night. Naturally it has been found that the extension of the hours of polling has led to the casting of a larger vote. There is no reason why we should not still further extend the facilities.  ing at 6 in the morning instead of keeping the booths open until.it is dark?",39
284,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"In my electorate people go to the polling booths in large numbers towards the close of the day. The extension of the time has been very beneficial to the working-class electors. I , for one, shall strenuously resist any attempt to change the polling day from Saturday, as far as city electorates are concerned. The Attorney-General told us that he was willing to accept suggestions in order to make this measure as liberal as possible. Let him, then, consider the advisableness of taking out the provision in regard to changing the polling day, and if it is found that Saturday is not suitable for agricultural constituencies, let' us have two polling days instead of one. There is also the question of the 5s. deposit that has to he lodged when objection is taken to persons being on the roll. The meaning of that is that political organizations are to give information that will lead to the rolls being purified. But it is quite possible that if the 5s. deposit be abolished, a percentage may be removed from the roll without good reason. If there is any solid ground for an objection that may be lodged, surely those who lodge it ought not to object to a penalty being imposed if the objection is found to be frivolous.",39
285,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,There is a penalty attached to objectors.,40
286,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,But the Government propose'to remove the penalty.,40
287,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"No ; we retain the penalty, but make it recoverable before a justice instead of at the ipse dixit of a Returning Officer.",40
288,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Why not leave the 5s. penalty as it stands?,40
289,Mr WH IRVINE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Because it is an absolute bar to all objections.,40

291,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The party to which I belong is not overblessed with financial support, but poor as we may be, we do not object"" to the lodging of a 5s. deposit when an objection is made. But the proposal of the Government is really intended to make it easier for political organizations to make objection. At the last election, in my constituency, there were ladies going round finding out whether people whose names were on the rolls were living at the addresses specified. There was a rumour that these ladies received a reward of 6d. for every name they removed from the roll. I do not know who financed them.",40
292,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Does the honourable member think that Herbert Brookes financed them-the gentleman who sent the £500 to Western Australia?,40
293,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I think the Chamber of Manufacturers must have found that money. In friendly societies, and many other organizations, whenever a protest is lodged against any decision, it is customary to lodge at the sa.me time an amount of money which may be forfeited if the protest is found to be frivolous.",40
294,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.£5 p.m.,40
295,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"When the sitting was suspended I was dealing with that portion of the Electoral Act which relates to putting on and removing from the rolls the names of electors. My own opinion is that we shall not purify the rolls by removing from them the names of persons in the manner proposed. It is well known that the police are at present engaged in searching for electors who could not be reached by post, with a view to ascertaining whether they reside at the addresses given, and, if not, removing their names from the rolls. While, the police are undertaking this work, I understand that they are not being paid for it. I do not think that this is a correct attitude for the Commonwealth to take up. It is true that a few of these officials may shirk their task, but, generally speaking, the police are above reproach, and have discharged their duties in this connection exceedingly well.",40
296,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Do the States get paid for that work?,40
297,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If they do, they ought to pay the police who perform this duty, because it is no part of their ordinary work. I believe in the old adage that "" what is worth doing is worth paying for."" I would also like to point out to the Minister of Trade and Customs that in the instructions issued to Electoral Registrars the following appearsAn objection on the ground that a person does not live in a division for which he is enrolled shall be deemed not to be good unless it alleges(<z) that the person objected to does not live in the division, and has not so lived for at least one month; or (i) that the person objected to does not live in the division, and has obtained enrolment for some other division. It is very clear, therefore, that unless the police know that an elector has left the division for which he is enrolled the electoral officials have no right to remove his name from the rolls.",40
298,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"They do it, nevertheless.",40
299,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Of course, they do. What is the use of issuing instructions if effect be not given to them?",40
300,Mr ARCHIBALD,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,But the Government will repeal that regulation.,40

302,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Does the honourable member say that the provision which he has read is a section of the Act?,41
303,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It is a regulation. It is based, I believe, on sections 67, 68, and 69 of the Act .",41
304,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Sectio n 70 of the Act.,41
305,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Of course, if it can be proved that an elector is' enrolled another division, his name should be moved from the division for which was previously enrolled.",41
306,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"When leaves a division, instead of applying for atransfer he applies for a new card altogether.",41
307,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Does the honourable member say that names have been removed from the rolls contrary to the A ct ?,41
308,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I say that if electors cannot be found at their postal addresses their names are removed from the rolls. That is a direct violation of the regulation which I have read. electors to have only one vote, but I want them to exercise that vote. At present when an elector removes, from one locality to another he is averse to obtaining a transfer, because the system of transfer is such an intricate one. In the first place, he is required to say for what division and what subdivision he is enrolled. Now, very few persons know the subdivision for which they are enrolled. As a matter of fact, there are electors enrolled for the division of Melbourne Ports who reside at the postal addresses given, but who ought to be enrolled for Fawkner; while there are electors enrolled for the Fawkner division who ought to be enrolled for Melbourne Ports. Of course, a member of Parliament is regarded by most people as a sort of general information bureau, or a walking encyclopaedia. comes about that he is frequently appealed to by electors who are in doubt as to their true position. ample, a man will come to me and say, "" I lived in the Bendigo division, ancl I obtained a transfer from there.'' He will then mention, perhaps, the name of some town in the Bendigo division, and ask me if I know the subdivision for which he is enrolled. In such cases, I always age could be bought. advise my interrogator to embody i transfer form his former address, and close a note stating that he does not the subdivision for which he is enrolled, leaving the Electoral Officers to rectify matters. I have met numbers of persons who did not even know the division for which they were enrolled. It is the duty of the Electoral Department to ascertain the division for which electors seeking transfers are enrolled. If that were done, the number of transfers would be much larger than it is at present. If those persons whose names appear twice on the rolls were left alone by political for organizations, I do not believe that one in rea thousand of them would vote twice. he B ut if the organizations know that they are enrolled twice, they will endeaa man vour to get them to vote twice. To my mind, it is better that one man's name should appear on the roll twice than that an elector's name should be wrongly removed from it . As to the best means of insuring that each elector shall vote only once, opinions are very much divided. I remember that i u 1890 a system of electors' rights was in vogue in New South Wales. To me it looked an almost perfect system. But it was found I wish to be very far from perfect, because at an election which took place in East Sydney in 1894 or 1895, these electors' rights were bought up for 5s. and 10s. apiece. There are not many human devices which cannot be circumvented by the power of money. Some who had electors' rights went a little bit further. ""They visited the electoral officials and declared on oath that they had lost their electors' rights. They got another elector's right, sold the old one to the other side, and voted with the new one. That system is not a perfect one, and so I pass it out as useless. It is not a system which we, as a party, could advocate, because it is open to corrupt practices. The electors of Australia are just as honest as are the electors in any other part of the world, but money can Thus it do a lot at an election, and it is not the Labour party who have any money for that purpose. That is what I am most For ex- grieved about, I admit.  could all be bought.",41
309,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It is not a question of whether they could all be bought, but a question of whether a large percentThe honorablo n his member knows that 500 or 600 votes in - which were not cast against a man know at an election might be very handy to . him. However, in New South Wales the elector's right was wiped out. Our present system, with alterations in machinery, is, I believe, about as good as any system which could possibly be adopted. The card system could not be beaten. It might be just as well, as the ex-Minister of Home Affairs remarked, to have two or three cards, so that the signature of a person could be kept at different places. It has been shown conclusively that under the absent-voting system electors did not vote early and often, as has been charged by the Opposition. Our honourable friends have had to crawl down from the stand they took up after the elections, because in 99 per cent, of the cases the apparent duplication was due to a mistake. I desire now to say a few words about signed articles the press. We are told that by our legislation of last session we interfered with the liberty of the press. Nothing of the sort, sir.",41

321,Mr SHARPE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I apologize, sir. When the Government said, that they proposed to bring forward a Bill to amend the Electoral Act, we expected them to submit something in the nature of a reform. But, instead of that, we have a measure to destroy one of the most useful electoral methods which Australia has enjoyed. Our present electoral machinery is undoubtedly the best that Australia has ever had, or is ever likely into have. This measure does not contain one redeeming feature. I have not studied the Bill very carefully.",42
322,Mr AHEBN,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Ye t you are against it .,42

325,Mr SHARPE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"We shall hear what it is like when the honourable member expresses his opinion, but until then we are not likely to know.",42
326,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Order ! These conversations across the chamber are disorderly.,42
327,Mr SHARPE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"In introducing the Bill the Honorary Minister dilated on its great qualities. But in the whole of his speech we did not hear a useful explanation of a clause. He referred to many of the clauses, and to the improvements likely to accrue from the enactment of the measure, but one felt more disgusted with it after hearing his remarks than he did previously. The first provision with which the honourable gentleman dealt was the one to abolish the deposit of 5s. when a person wishes to lodge an objection to a name on the roll. That, in my opinion, is one of the most useful provisions in the Electoral Act. My expectation is that immediately the provision is abolished, the complaints to names on the roll will be almost as numerous as the electors who are enrolled. It is all very well for the Attorney-General to say that there is a penalty attached to the provision, but why do the Government want to do away with the deposit if it is not to suit one political body? We on this side do not desire the abolition of the deposit. If a Labour man is satisfied that a name should be removed from the roll, he is prepared to lodge a deposit of os. with his objection to the retention of that name. That our opponents should desire to do away with the deposit suggests that this is being done for a political purpose. The members of the Government seem to think that if the deposit is abolished, their canvassers or paid organizers will be able to go to an electoral officer and lodge a complaint against the retention of an elector's name, and that that name may be removed without the elector being advised that an objection to the retention of his name has been lodged. That is most unjust and most unfair. I have no faith in the Bill, and if it ever reaches the Committee stage I hope we shall be able to continue the deposit of 5s. with an objection. The next matter with which the Honorary Minister dealt was Saturday polling. He spoke at very great length about Saturday not being the right day for voting, and - a day in the middle of the week, he contended, would be much more convenient to the people, and much more suitable in every respect. In my opinion, no day in the week is so convenient for an election as is Saturday, because it is a slack day with people all over the Commonwealth.  from a Saturday's election.",42
328,Mr SHARPE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I got a great deal more than did the honourable member, because my majority was very much larger than his. However, I hope that we shall soon have another election. Our opponents imagine that if they can get a poll taken on a day other than Saturday it will be of infinite benefit to them. They recognise that many persons who are now able to vote on Saturday will not then have the privilege or the pleasure of doing so, because their business will prevent them from reaching a polling booth in time. Many persons who are in employment of different descriptions will not be able to get away from their work to vote on any day but Saturday.  half-holiday in the country districts is on Wednesday",43
329,Mr SHARPE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"That does not obtain all over Australia. In many places the [52] half-holiday is on Saturday, and shortly that will be universal throughout Australia. Saturday is the natural day on which to hold an election, and I think it will always be held in Australia on that day. We have only to recall the large percentage of votes which was polled in the Commonwealth at the last election to realise that Saturday is the most convenient day for taking a poll. When a man meets with success in an undertaking he continues on that line; and that argument in itself is quite sufficient to induce honourable members to retain the provision for a Saturday poll. I feel that the Government are not sincere in their proposal to alter the polling day. The people of Australia are satisfied that Saturday is the natural day, and I know that candidates prefer that day to any other. Many persons work very strenuously when a poll is taken on Saturday, and these can rest on Sunday. Remembering that Sunday affords a rest to these persons after a hard day's work, we should see that the provision for Saturday polling is retained. The next matter with which the Honorary * Minister dealt was the gagging of the press. We have heard much of the provision for signed articles, not only in connection with this Bill, but in connection with the late election, and the want of confidence motion. We are told that we on this side are anxious to gag the press. Unfortunately, we are not in a position to do that. It is only those with money at their command who have a chance to gag the press. With money it is possible for men to use a great deal of influence with the press, but poor people, as a rule, have not much influence with the press, nor do they wish' to have any influence in that direction. I suggest that, instead of modifying the present law in reference to the press, we should strengthen it in some respects. In my opinion, every leading article in every newspaper in Australia should be signed, and I feel that the time is not far distant when such articles will be signed. Those who write leading articles should be ready to sign them. When articles are signed, we know the true value of the opinions expressed in them, because we know whether the writer is a man who is properly acquainted with his subject. At the present time, there is no way of finding out who writes the leading articles of the newspapers. I am certain that if a referendum were taken on the point, the people would vote almost unanimously for the retention of the vision in the Act. Newspaper writersI do not speak of the proprietors-are anxious that the provision should be reclared void. tained. The signing of articles gives them better opportunities for obtaining distinction. The publishing of the names of writers of articles is a good advertisevoting ment for those writers, and assists them in making way in their profession. Por these reasons, and for the many others too numerous to repeat which have advanced during the debate, and which are still fresh in the minds of honourable members, I trust that the existing vision will be retained. The next matter on which the Honorary Minister dwelt was the clause reinstating the postal voting system. He expressed his tions and opinions most lucidly, but I not think that any argument could be adpostal voting system. duced which would convince honourable members on this side that the postal ing system provided for in the Bill is of any value, and, in my opinion, it is not "" likely to be agreed to. Were the clause to pass as it stands, men and women would be able to record their votesdirectly after the closing of nominations. That was allowed under the old Queensthe land postal voting system, in connection come the law of the State. with which there was so much corrupQueensland tion. Every Queensland representative could give many instances of corrupt practices in connection with the use of postal vote provided for in the old Queensland Electoral Act. One of the must vote most glaring cases of corruption occurred those in connection with the Warwick contest in torate, the election on the 5th May, 1908, and Mr Kidston, who was, at that election, returned to power, immediately proposed the abolition of the postal voting system, because of the corruption to which it had given rise. Por the Warwick constituday ency the candidates were Mr O'Sullivan, the present Attorney-General of Queensworking land, and Mr Barnes, a leading chant. By reference to the newspaper files in the Library, honourable members can make themselves acquainted with what occurred. Thirty-one witnesses gave evidence before an elections tribunal admitted that they had been bribed ing the campaign. Many who had been offered money by the canvassers of one party went to the canvassers of the other candidate, and were able to obtain a larger sum. The Judge who tried the will be in power in Queensland. case had to dismiss it, however, because Mr Sharfc. the evidence was so conflicting that he procould not come to a decision, corruption on both sides being proved.",43
330,Mr MCDONALD,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The election was de,44
331,Mr SHARPE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"My memory is not clear as to that, but, at any rate, it was made sufficiently evident that the postal system could no longer be tolerated. Under the system proposed in the Bill, votes may be recorded immediately after the nominations have been closed, been and the candidate with the largest amount of money at hisdisposal will be able to obtain the largest number of provotes. The Queensland Government is at the present time trying to amend the State electoral law, and has proposed the introduction of the postal vofjing system, intenbut has attached to it conditions do which make it very different from the old Women will be able to vote by post only on election day, votand then only on the production of a certificate from a doctor or a qualified nurse.",44

333,Mr SHARPE,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I have just returned from Queensland, and I say that that is proposal, and that it is likely to beBut the Goverument proposes a worse thing, and that is the disfranchisement of between 40,000 and 50,000 working men. the Electors are to have a vote only when they have registered their homes, and within the electorate in which homes are situated. A man will not be allowed to vote outside his elecusing the postal vote, unless he can produce a doctor's certificate to the effect that he is unable to return to his electorate. Thus the shearers, the sugarworkers, and the harvesters who may be living outside their electorates on election will be unable to vote. A man whose home is in Toowoomba, and who is in Charleville on election day, merwill be unable to vote by post. Of course, if the Queensland Government were sincere, it would give those persons the right to vote by post. But it is not who prepared to do so. The result of the recent Federal elections has made the durmembers of the Queensland Liberal Government feel that they must take additional measures to secure their .return at the coming State election.

But, at the same time, the constitution is quite clear. In the first an aggrieved candidate lodges an appeal if gross irregularities exist, and the council of the association should then investigate the matter. "" Further, the discrepancy between the ballot papers issued and the ballot-papers returned is a very marked feature of all the selections that have been held lately. It indicates, to my mind, some carelessness with the Postal Department, or apathy on the part of the voters in exercising their privileges. I quite recognise you desire everything done systematically and constitutionally."" In a further letter, dated August a8th, Mr. Wade said :"" Although the action of the conference in making inquiries is not authorized by the constitution, at the same time.

After a searching inquiry, however, the present Government have been able to find only about 5,000 cases for the whole Commonwealth in which it was alleged that duplicate voting had occurred. I am prepared to say that in not one instance was there duplicate voting or any fraud. The apparent duplicate voting has largely arisen from errors due to the great rush of work in our polling booths on election day. Many of the booths were too small to cope with the business.

362,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Order 1,47
363,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I should like to know in what the Prime Minister meant by saying, as he did last night, that he was not sure that this country did not want a rest a from legislation. He said that eightyon a three Acts of Parliament had been passed during the term of office of the late Adhe ministration, and that he did not know that Australia was any better off.",47
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Shee r envy.,47
365,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I object to undergo the trouble of criticising measures which the of Prime Minister and his colleagues seem what to think are unnecessary. The Opposition have placed before the House many objections to this Bill, but the Governbement and their supporters have not atThe fault, tempted to answer them.",47
366,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,The honourable member is,47
367,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I must do so if only as a protest against the application of the "" S S-"" There seems to be a "" gag "" upon a system honourable members opposite.",47
368,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Will the honourable member address himself to the question ?,47
369,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I submit, sir, that we canare entitled to have a reply to our",47
370,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"If the honourable member will sit down, I shall endeavour at once",47
371,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable member promised to do so on a previous occasion, but when he' got his opportunity he gave us no information. He simply acted, in a spirit of impious larrikinism.",47
372,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"The honourable member should withdraw that remark. Mr HIGGS . ^ I withdraw it. One of my objections to this Bill is that there is nothing ih it to prevent the misrepresentation of political parties. The Honourable Alfred Deakin on one accasion 'said that the issue before the people was, "" Federalism or Socialism,"" meaning thereby that his party were ih favour of Federalism, whilst our party'favoured Socialism. - Mr SPEAKER - The honourable member is not discussing the question before the Chair-.",48
373,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Wit h great respect, sir, I would remind you that this is a Bill to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which provides for the punishment of certain offences, and that my objection is that ih this Bill ho attempt is made to penalize those who misrepresent political parties. In the Electoral Act 'there is a section relating 'to penalties for offences. My objection is that the Bill 'contains no provision to prevent 'the Women's National League of Yictoria, for example, frtftn stating that this party is desirous of interfering with the sanctity of the home. Surely statements of that kind ought to 'be penalized. Mr MbDbfrAlb - It is only f air to say that it was afterwards stated that that assertion was merely made as a' political <3odge. Mr HIG'G'S - I 'believe that it was said by a lady who has passed away that the . charge against the Labour party was made as a political dodge. I give the Attorney-General the credit of acknowledging that he publicly said that this charge against 'the Labour party was unfair. He made this statementI t was said that the Labour party dan'ger the sanctity of the home and the marriage tie. It was a great pity that this should be said. He did not believe the LabouT party intended that at all. He believed in a fair fight always, and it was a great pity they should be accused of this. But what - did the Women's National League dol They condemned the Attorney-General roundly for his fairness. There ought to 'be a provision in this Bill, Which the Attorney-General supports, to make that kind of thing a penal offence MT. KEDri-.^-The sboneT we get into Oommittee, the sooner the honourable member will have an opportunity of"" moving an amendment to that effect.",48
374,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I certainly want a clause inserted imposing a penalty onstatements of this kind at election time. Part XV . of the Commonwealth Electoral Act enumerates electoral offences,, including illegal practices and the useof undue influence. It covers nearly a page of the Statute. Libels of this kind ought to be included. Honourable members opposite are asking that the provision of the Act concerning the signing of articles in newspapers shall be expunged. Not 'Only ought we to retain that provision, but we ought to impose penalties on persons like Mr John Sydney MCMahon, who, at the last election, issued a paper oal'led The People, in which he published this kind of stuffThe Liberal woman's cause is just. It is a campaign for right living. What we have 'to fight against can be judged by the following extracts from Socialist writers :FREDERICK ENGELS : "" The first word of Religion is a lie."" FREDERICK ENGELS : "" Three great obstacles block the - path of Socialism-Private Property, Religion, and the Present Form of Marriage."" ROBERT BLATCHFORD : "" I - deny the existence of a Heavenly Father. I deny the efficacy of prayer. I deny the truth of the Old and New Testament."" Women, Socialists take away : your religion and your Marriage Certificate. What do they offer ""in exchange? Nothing. Then vote against Socialism.",48
375,Mr KELLY,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,What has that extract to do with this Bill?,48
376,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"I am complaining that there is ho provision in the Bill to - penalize persons who .publish stuff of this kind. To that extent, the measure is deficient. The same publication also contained a list of questions and answers, in - wished to enthe following termsTheTe are a few answers the women can sug: gest :Who are responsible for industrial unrest?Socialists. Who are responsible for strikes, causing misery to hundreds of families?-The Socialists. Who are responsible for lost opportunities for our children?-The Socialists. Who would teach the rising generation belief in neither God nor man?-The Socialists.",48
377,Mr ROBERTS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,Who published that?,48
378,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"It was published by a - person named MCMahon, with money supplied 'by ithe ""capitalist party 'opposite. It was issued at election time,. was circulated in Queensland, and was filled with advertisements paid for by the capitalist party. Surely we ought to have a clause in an amending Electoral Bill to prevent the circulation of such slanders. I have something more to say about misrepresentation. It will be agreed that the criticism of public men ought to be open and above-board. A person cannot, without incurring the risk of paying damages for libel, rake up the history of a private individual and publish it, unless it can be proved that the publication is for the public good. A private individual, for example, may have stolen a horse, and suffered five years' imprisonment for his offence. But if he is living quietly and honestly no one has a right to rake up that circumstance against him and publish it. But a person can attack the private character of a public man, and it is held to be in the public interest that he shall be able to do so. If you can prove that a politician was once a bushranger, you can say so without fear of damages. - Mr ROBERTS - If you can prove that a politician has changed his views as often as he has changed his coat, and has done so for pay, you are at liberty to publish it.",48
379,Mr HIGGS,COMMONWEALTH OFFICES I N,"Yes ; and, unfortunately, the public do not have an opportunity of hearing the circumstances under which some men have changed their views. But, while the criticism of public men is quite right, it ought to be fair belongs to. and open. If a man puts up for public honours, he must be prepared to stand criticism. But while that is in the public interest, surely the criticism ought to be in the open. No man, or set of men, no woman or set of women, should be free to send round secret circulars, endeavouring to disparage candidates for public honours, and deprive them of their characters. I have in my possession a circular letter which was issued secretly in Queensland at the time of the recent election. The circulation of such documents ought to be penalized. There is a section in the Electoral Act, No. 180, penalizing the printing or distribution of any electoral advertisement,, notice, handbill, pamphlet, or card containing any untrue or incorrect statement intended, or likely, to mislead or improperly interfere with any elector in, or in relation to, the easting of his vote. But let honourable members consider the case which I am about to relate. This circular letter was issued by the Political Committee of the Grand Lodge of the Loyal Orange Institution, Queensland. It reads as follows- "" NA QUEENSLAND . Brisbane, April 2ist, 1913. Memo, from the Grand Lodge Political Committee. To Dear Sir and Brother,This circular is strictly private. It must not be shown to any but members of the Lodge. The following are the names of those Candidates who have the endorsement of the Grand Political Committee:As you will observe, we have given preference to those candidates least likely to pander to the Romish influence and interests. For obvious reasons we do not endorse any Roman Catholic. However worthy he may be, he' will always be at the call of his church when its interests are being engineered. Unfortunately, pandering to Roman claims is not wholly confined to any particular party, but it is increasingly evident that the Labour party is the most pliant in that direction. This has been clearly shown in our previous circulars. The members of this party also take every opportunity to air their disloyalty. As an institution we are altogether independent of party politics. We do not ask any of our members or friends to deny his political faith or denounce his party. What is required of him is that he will put his Protestantism and loyalty first in the programme before all other political considerations. He is no Orangeman who votes for a disloyalist, whatever party he For the Senate - We endorse Messrs. Sayers, Chataway, and Maughan. We cannot endorse Mr St. Ledger or either of the two other Labour candidates. Mr Ferricks has been unfavorably reported on from the north, and Mr. Mullan never had the support of our Charters Towers brethren who know him. Brisbane - We can only recommend Mr Fenwick; he is practically a new man. Although little is known of him, we believe he will make a better representative than Mr Finlayson, who is bound to the Labour Caucus, and his hands would be tied if the majority of his party were opposed to any cherished principle he may have: Oxley - Mr Hunter has our endorsement. Mr Sharpe is an extreme Socialist, and not worthy of our consideration. Moreton - Mr Sinclair has always gone straight, and has the endorsement of the Lodge ic his electorate. He is a staunch Protectionist of high character. Lilley - On the recommendation of Lodges is this ""electorate, we endorse Mr Jacob Stumm. Darling Downs - Mr Groomvoted Home Rule, and has generally laid himself out for the Roman Catholic vote. We have not been advised as to the standing of Mr Allen, so therefore rely upon the discretion of our members to choose the best man. Wide Bay - Mr Fisher voted Home Rule, and does not deserve Protestant consideration. He included, perhaps, the most militant and extreme Roman Catholic in Australia (Mr. Mahon) in his Cabinet. Mr Wienholt bears a good report; we therefore recommend him. Capricornia - Mr Higgs is a Home Ruler, and has always pandered for the Roman vote. Mr Dyer is known by our lodges in that district to be a straightforward man and worthy of our support (were it only on the record of his opponent). We can safely endorse Mr. Dyer. Herbert - Fro m information to hand we prefer Mr Mann. Mr Bamford voted for that obnoxious Home Rule motion, and has, like all the Labour party, laid himself out for the Catholic vote. Kennedy - Charle s MCDonald is an extreme Socialist, and is (like so many of our Labour men) disloyal to boot. He voted Home Rule. We advise our members to carefully consider Mr Edwards' qualifications. We urge upon you all the necessity for action. anything were wanting to impress upon Protestants the necessity for united action, it should be the knowledge that Rome is marshalling her forces for a determined struggle. To insure complete success there should be confidence in those whose business it has been to select the candidates to receive the Protestant vote, and that every candidate selected should be loyally supported at the ballot-box. Let each member throw himself into the political fray, and each use his or her influence to induce voters to vote for our candidates. Be up and doing, every one of you, and render a good account of yourselves. Yours fraternally, Grand Lodge Political Committee. P.S - If this circular should be too late for your regular meeting, you are earnestly requested to convey the information pertaining to your electorate to the members without delay. I received this document from a Queenslander, whose name I do not intend to divulge. There is no doubt about its authenticity, for when I wrote to Mr. Charles Fish, the secretary of the Grand Lodge Political Committee in Brisbane, he replied in the same handwriting that is to be seen on the circular. I wrote to him as follows: Dear Sir,I have reason to believe that at the recent Federal elections you issued a printed circular in which you referred to me as follows :"" Capricornia - Mr Higgs is a Home Ruler, and has always pandered for the Roman Catholic vote."" I presume you know the meaning of the word "" pandered,"" and, therefore, ask you to be good enough to let me know what led you to use the expression, "" Mr Higgs . . . pandered for the Roman Catholic vote."" your reply I hope you will quote instances in which I pandered for the Roman Catholic vole JOT for any other vote. Mr F is h replied as f o l l o w s : Ithaca, July 26th, 19,13. Dear Sir,I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th inst. As the information you desire has been confidentially communicated to me, I must, therefore, first obtain permission through those sources before I could comply with your request. I am, Yours respectfully, CHAS. FISH , Secty., G.L. Pol. Committee, L.O.I.Q. In the circumstances, I concluded that it would be idle to pursue the matter further, because I was not likely to get any information from this gentleman. I consider that I have proved to the hilt that some provision should be inserted incur electoral law under which that sort of conduct would be penalized. If Mr. Fish and his friends believe what they If say in the circular, they ought to have no objection to making the statements on the public platform, or to publishing the document broadcast. It may be of no personal interest to honourable members to learn that I do not belong to the Roman Catholic Church. I was brought up and confirmed in the Church of England, my wife and I were married there, and our children are being reared in the faith of that Church. But the Australian Labour party never asks what is the religion of any of its candidates, believing that to CHAS. FISH , Secretary, be a matter outside politics altogether. I am not aware of any occasion on which I have pandered for anybody's vote. Let me consider for a moment some of the statements which are contained in the circular. It saysFor obvious reasons we cannot endorse any Roman Catholic. Why? They will not endorse a Roman Catholic, but I am quite sure-and I have it on the authority of a member of this House - that they will support a Roman Catholic against the Labour party. I have been told by an honourable member that he got the Orange vote in his constituency, and he is not a Labour man.",49
380,Mr WEBSTEH,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,Is he a Protestant?,50
381,Mr HIGGS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"No , he is a Roman Catholic. It seems to me that it is very wrong for any set of men to issue has always a circular of this character. The stateIn ment is madeHowever worthv he [a Roman Catholic] may be, he will always be at the call of his church) when its interests are being engineered. 'What provision is there in our Constitution which can be operated in the interests of any Church? Fortunately there is the greatest freedom of thought and speech today. If the honourable member for Darwin wishes to establish a branch of the WaterLily Rock-Bound Church of the Cayuse nation he can do so tomorrow. I notice that, according to the last census, there are 4,274,414 professing Christians in Australia, of whom 920,425 are Roman Catholics. The remaining 3,352,989 belong to the Church of England, the Presbyterian, Methodist, Congregational, and other churches. What danger do the persons who have issued this circular apprehend. sayWhat is required of a member of the Orange Lodge is that he will put his Protestantism before all other political considerations. I believe that certain capitalists are manipulating that institution for the purpose of defeating the Labour party. If they are doing that, they ought to come out into the open. Then we are toldRome is marshalling her forces for a determined struggle. What ridiculous stuff to publish at this time of day in Australia. Surely the authors of this circular must have been reading history, and reading one side of it only. Surely they must think that we are living in a period nearly 100 years ago-in 1536, when Henry VIII . , the Protestant King with many wives, because he could not get the Pope to grant him a divorce from Catherine of Arragon, started to close all the monasteries. He shut up 3,219 of them, and 40,000 Roman Catholics rose in protest. That is the period' of which these gentlemen must have been reading. There was not much to choose between religious fanatics of 400 years ago, because either would burn the other fellow before breakfast if he Tiad an opportunity to do so. It was only a few years after Henry VIII . had passed away that Queen Mary started to make things hot for the Protestants, and had Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer burned at the stake, in addition to putting to death some 288 others. But we are not living in those troublous times. We are living in an enlightened age. If people believe that their religious freedom is likely to be interfered with in any way, they are perfectly entitled to form an institution to protect themselves and their faith, but they are not entitled to send out secret circulars with a view to damaging members of the Labour party or any other political party To send out circulars secretly is to condemn a man without evidence and without a trial. I deem it a public duty to bring this matter before the Legislature. I come now to one or two provisions which are contained in the Bill which is before us. In the first place I will deal with the clause relating to the redistribution of the electorates. The Government propose that our electoral boundaries shall be determined They either by a Justice of the High Court or of the Supreme Court. Under the existing system they are determined by three Commissioners, including the Surveyor-General in each State, the Chief Electoral Officer in each State, and another person. I am perfectly willing that a Judge shall be a member of the Court, but I certainly think that the Surveyor General in each State ought also to be a member of it, because several matters have to be considered, including community of interests, diversity of interests, and existing electoral boundaries. A Judge, in all probability, would know very little about the existing electoral boundaries. I do not suppose there is a member of the High Court or the Supreme Court Bench in Australia who could define the boundaries of any electorate as well as could the Surveyor-General of the State in which that electorate is located. Honourable members have only to look at the old redistribution in order to see what a technical matter is the delimitation of these boundaries.  which is proposed work very satisfactorily tinder Judge Murray, in New South Wales ? Does not the honourable member recollect ?",50
382,Mr HIGGS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"I do not. I intend to oppose that clause. I object also to the proposed alteration of the law with a view to preventing claims being registered unless they are presented to the Returning Officer a month or more before the issue of the writ. This must be an effort on the part of our capitalistic friends opposite to keep the nomad from exercising his franchise. Twenty-five per cent, of the population in Australia are continually moving. Why do they move from place to place? Because they want to get employment. Honourable members opposite, some of whom have been able to get a piece of land and do not require to shift, do not see that there is any reason why we should consider the man who has to move from town to town, or from State to State, in search of work, more especially as he is likely to vote against the nominees of the capitalists. A man who has to seek employment may have to travel from Tasmania to the Gulf of Carpentaria, as he very often has to do. Take the case of shearers. I remember a friend named George Whelan, a shearer, and member of William Lane's Paraguayan community, saying that travelling from Adelaide up to Longreach was "" a mere chew.'' That was his curious way of describing a journey of that distance. Thousands of shearers have to travel many thousands of miles, and they surely ought to be entitled to vote for those who make the laws.  terfere with the shearer.",51
383,Mr HIGGS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"Honourable members opposite do apparently desire to deprive the shearer of the right to vote, because they are not prepared to allow him to lodge an application unless he does so at least a month before the issue of the writs. How does he know when a writ is going to be issued? I think that the names ought to be retained on the roll up to the issue of the writs. Once the writs are out, it is only fair that the lists should be closed. The Attorney-General is gracing the chamber with his presence this evening for a brief period- I suppose taking his turn. Ministers have so little interest in this measure that there is only one of them in the chamber at a time. The members of the great Australian public who are witnesses of these proceedings will be interested to watch the Ministerial benches, and will be able to see what little interest is taken by the Ministry in their measure. I feel sure that it has only been introduced to take up time. That is a further reason why the second reading should not be carried. The Attorney-General is, I will admit at once, a man of very strong convictions. There is no pretence about the honourable gentleman, though there is a pretence about some other politicians whom Mr. Speaker would not permit me to name. He has certain ideas about the public which I think he gained in a bad school. A law court is not the best place for a man to get ideas of the general public.",52
384,Mr WH IRVINE,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"l t is not the best place to get convictions, anyway.",52
385,Mr HIGGS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"I know that the honourable gentleman has convictions, wherever he got them. I think that he got the convictions from certain observations he made in the law courts. He sees the public in the courts, sometimes not in their Sunday clothes, so to speak, and I am afraid that he has rather a low estimate of poor humanity. He thinks it necessary to strike off the rolls as many persons as possible.",52
386,Mr FLEMING,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,As many people as are dead.,52
387,Mr HIGGS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"The Electoral Act contains a provision that if a person wants the name of a person struck off a roll on the ground that he is not entitled to be enrolled, he has to put down a deposit of 5s. as an earnest of his bona fides. Why do ' the Attorney-General and his colleagues wish to strike out that provision ? Why should we not compel any busybody who wants a name struck off a roll to put up 5s. as an evidence that he is acting bond fide?  capitalists on this side.",52
388,Mr WEBSTER,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"You pay organizers to do it, though.",52
389,Mr HIGGS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"I sincerely hope that the Attorney-General has not in his mind the thought that the repeal of the provision will enable Liberal organizers to go round and find out the political opinions of individuals, and then send in the names of opponents who, in their opinion, ought not to be on the roll. I hope that that is not the intention of the Attorney General, because I regard him as the most upright of the lot. He is a great Conservative. Although he will learn a good deal from the lectures he gets from this side of the House, still he is not likely to abandon this provision.",52
390,Mr FLEMING,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,You enliven him.,52
391,Mr HIGGS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"My honourable friend ought to be on this side. As "" Ithuriel "" said, the honourable member would have made a splendid Labour member.",52
392,Mr ROBERTS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,God forbid that he should ever come amongst us.,52
393,Mr FLEMING,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,Not while you are there.,52
394,Mr ROBERTS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,I hope not.,52
395,Mr HIGGS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"Whether the Attorney General and his colleagues have that object in view or not, that is what will happen. If the party send a paid canvasser through an electorate to try to purge the rolls, as they call it , and as the honourable member for Grey remarks, give him so much a head for every name he can get taken off the roll, what is likely to happen ? Thousands of names will be struck off. It is not everybody in the community who has such a keen interest in politics as have the Attorney-General and myself, or others in this Chamber. Men, as a rule, have other work to do. They have not the time for running to the Returning Officer and asking if their name is on the roll and if it is to be allowed to remain there, nor have they the time to attend the Revision Court. There are very few working men receiving £ 3 a week, or less, who can afford to take a day off to see if their name is on the roll. Very few working men, indeed, can afford to give up 10s. for that purpose. I cannot understand why honourable members opposite are* so keenly desirous of thinning out the names on the roll. They got into Parliament by a majority, and are they not satisfied ? They never thought that they would get there. The Attorney-General, when he was on this side, said the Ministerialists evidently, on all the prospects, were sure to come back. I agree wit-K the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, that once the name of a man or a woman is on the roll for a division, it ought to be kept on that roll until it is removed to the roll for another division. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Eve n when they are dead ?",53
396,Mr HIGGS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"The Attorney-General, - if he were a Judge on the High Court Bench, would not raise a quibble of that kind. I said, "" If the name of a man or a woman is on the r o l l , "" and he interjected, "" E v e n when they are dead?"" one suggests anything of that kind. If a man is on the roll for, say, the Capricornia division, and he removes into - the Maranoa division, his name should not be struck off the roll for the former - division until his name appears on the roll for the latter division. What is the idea in seeking to deprive a man of his right to vote? Do our honourable friends - opposite want to. go back to the primitive times, when there was no law, and men fought for their rights with their strong right arms. Living as we do in a kind of semi-luxurious style in the big cities, where our muscles run to fat, or to nothing, what sort of a time would we have in the shearing districts if we had to resort to primitive methods? There is another so-called righteous amendment of the Electoral Act, and that is to stop Saturday polling. At whom is it directed ? At the wage-earners, most of whom, of course, cease work at 1 o'clock on Saturday, and then have time to vote, because they are under no obligation to the employer.",53
397,Mr ROBERTS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,I think it will h it the farmer hard.,53
398,Mr HIGGS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"Without a doubt. In many country districts, the farmers go into town on Saturday, and it is very convenient for them to be able to exercise the franchise in the afternoon. It is quite likely that the Saturday poll brings a number of our opponents to the polling booth, because a number of farmers in some districts vote against us. But it is not right that we should take a sectional view. We ought to try to enable everybody to get to the poll with the least possible trouble or expense. Our friends opposite have their vehicles and their motor cars, and they must not mind this reference on my part, because the Minister who introduced this measure is always extremely personal, referring to a man's clothes and the way he gets his living.  beer chewers.",53
399,Mr HIGGS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"That is another point. Perhaps I should not follow his example. But I do not wish to speak offensively when I say that most honourable members oj>posite have their vehicles, their motor cars, and their buggies in which to travel to the poll, and would have time to go there on any day in the week, whereas No the majority of the public can best get to the poll with the least trouble and expense on the Saturday afternoon. If honourable members opposite do not wish to get some wrongful advantage by putting an end to Saturday polling,, why do they propose it? I come now to the clause re-establishing voting by post. I notice that the Bill does not contain a form for the postal ballot-paper. Where is the wonderful ability possessed by honourable members opposite displayed? Why has not the Attorney-General, who holds such a high position in the legal profession, given us the benefit of his ability in connection with the drafting of this Bill? Sometimes certain members of the Government sneer at the working man's representative who has not been through a college or a university, but where is their ability shown? the way, did you observe, Mr Speaker, that yesterday Sir Thomas Lipton was reported to have said that college-bred boys do not seem to get along so well in the world as other people? My honourable friends who have been through the universities cannot, with the assistance of Parliamentary Draftsman, draw up a Bill any better than, if as well as, members on this side, whose experience and knowledge have been gained in the university of every-day life. The old Act contained a form for the postal ballot-paper; why is there no such form in the Bill? Was there no time to prepare one? there been so many banquets at Dandenong, Northcote, and the Dominion Chambers that Ministers have not had time? Are they serious in their proposed amendment of the electoral law ? I think that this measure has been thrown on the table as a contentious measure, likely to occupy the time of the House until Christmas, when they will glide into recess, and have plenty of time to think out other contentious measures to carry them through next year. The Prime Minister has asked, ""What is the matter with Australia? Has there not been legislation enough?"" A very Machiavellian provision has been placed in the Bill, by the Attorney-General, I believe. I do not say that he had a Machiavellian intention in framing it. He thought that it would be. a great reform. He proposes that the elector when he enters a polling booth shall sign his name on the butt from which his ballot paper is torn.  the dark ages!",53
400,Mr HIGGS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"It is going back to the time when people voted by holding up their hands, and the employers could see how they voted.  the squires stood over them.",54
401,Mr HIGGS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"Yes . It is going back to the time when, if a tenant voted against the wishes of his landlord, he was deprived of his farm.",54
402,Mr FLEMING,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,What stands over many voters today is the union.,54
403,Mr HIGGS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"Wit h a secret ballot, it does not matter who stands over the voter, because no one can know how he is voting. The Attorney-General, that wise man from the West, the Treasurer, and their friends, propose that in future the By elector shall sign the butt to which his ballot-paper is attached. I have given notice of an amendment to the title of the Bill which will lead to the measure being properly described. If the amendment is carried, the measure will be entitled, "" An Act to enable the Liberal the and Tory scrutineers to ascertain how the people vote, and to destroy the secrecy of the ballot."" That describes the intention of the provision to which I refer. A year or so ago, a Mr C. R. Staples, a Victorian, wrote to the newspapers suggesting that persons should refuse to send advertisements to newspapers that did not Have support the Liberal party. He proposed! a boycott, and there are many persons in Australia who, like Mr C. R. Staples, think that you should boycott those who do not vote for your party. Evidently the Attorney-General, to whom I gave credit for more righteous instincts, proposes to allow certain partisans to victimize the electors by enabling scrutineers to ascertain how votes are cast. This provision shall have my most strenuous opposition, and, I hope, the opposition of every man. on this side of the House. I think that we shall be justified in using all the forms of the House to prevent the measure containing it from passing through any stage. I come now to the provision repealing that section of the Act which compels the signing of newspaper articles dealing with electoral matters. I admit that I had a good deal to do with the introduction of that part of the law. The honourable member for Gwydir, the honourable member for Barrier, and others, with myself, were extremely desirous of compelling all journalists to sign their names to their political articles. Some newspaper editorswere very much opposed to this, but I think that pressmen, who were angry with us at the time, are now glad that we carried it into effect. I am sure that my and friend, Mr Hirst, who used to sit in the press gallery, and who was for some reason kept back in his profession, not getting a show, to use a colloquialism, is glad* that we did what we did. He wrote somearticles for the Argus, which had to be* published with his name attached, and does not now come here. Why is that ? I believe that he has been promoted because persons connected with the newspaper to know that he had ability, and was be the ing kept down because that was not known while his articles were not signed. His only one case. What happens is this: Editors of certain newspapers, which do not undertake to name, like to move about amongst the people, to go to clubs, and to be there pointed at as, say, great man the editor of the Argus, who writes all the wise leading articles. What a wonderful man he is! In all publish probability, however, the editor of the Argus does not write anything, and, I suppose, he has not written a line for years. There must have been great prise in the community when they saw some of the leading articles ""written, after consultation, to express the views of the Argus,"" by David Hewitt Maling. Did Mr Maling lose in prestige or putation by signing the articles? only way in which he could have lost would be by the attaching of the words I have just quoted, because, after all, dare say, there was very little consultadress tion. Such would be unnecessary; Maling knows quite enough .to write ing articles without consulting any members of the staff.",54

405,Mr HIGGS,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"My honourable friend, who runs a sheep station, says I know nothing about the matter, but I do know, for I was at one time a. newspaper man. The signing of articles is for everybody, especially for the jourpossible. nalists. We desire to dispel the idea that has held sway for so many years that the editorial "" we "" means a council of wise men, and that the leading articles tion or improper practices."" are an outcome of their deliberations.",55

408,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"Bourke) [9.58""] The Honorary Minister, in introducing this Bill, concluded with a statement that he he desired to see an .Electoral Act that was safe, a press that was free and fearless, and a franchise that was the widest in the got world. In that we all agree. To-day press has,the freedom to say what it wishes, and it ought to be fearless enough is to express opinions without hiding behind the hedge of anonymity. Why I should there be a distinction drawn between a great newspaper and the ordinary pamphlet or dodger issued by the that poor man's press? Why should pamphlets and dodgers have to be signed and authorized, and newspapers permitted to articles without restriction t If it is imperative, in order to have a free press, that the articles shall be anonymous, then there should be perfect liberty to issue suranonymous pamphlets. The Honorary Minister said that the signing of the articles is a "" g a g "" imposed on the Liberal and so-called Independent journals of the country. That is not the recase. The law draws no distinction beThe tween one kind of newspaper and another; it is imposed on all newspapers, whether Liberal, Labour, or ConservaI tive. However, I do not purpose to admy remarks so much to this aspect Mr of the Bill as to the reasons that are leadgiven for the proposed change in the other electoral system - We had a general statement that there was widespread personation, and duplication. An investigation resulted in nothing, and, apparently, an amending Bill is introduced without reason. The Honorary Minister said, in effect, that he had no particular reason for introducing it ; that he had no evidence of personabetter tion but that improper practices were As a matter of fact, improper practices are possible under any law that may be enacted. The Honorary Minister said, "" I dc not say there was impersonaI f there was not, why is the Bill introduced ? The Attorney-General asked us whether auy one can claim that the present system No one can claim that; all we claim is that the present system is better than any other system that has been in existence in this country, and it nearer perfection. Are the Government proposals in any way an improvement on the existing Act? They are not; in many respects they are retrogressive, and retrogressive for purely party purposes. We had postal voting under the old system; and, of course, I agree that every person entitled to a vote should have it. Any Electoral Act that prohibits or imposes an embargo in this connection is and the ingenuity of Parliament be devoted to its improvement sible. If there is anything in the Bill that tends to the improvement existing law-that tends to enable persons to have a vote who do not now have that right - I am prepared, to support it, I .am not larly interested in the change the polling day, and it is quite possible that some other day would do as well. Neither am I interested in whether there are three or six Commissioners, or only one Commissioner. These are mere details, on which we may disagree, no what party we belong. .If I am asked whether I am in favour of the sick and infirm, and others who are not able to go to the polling booth, being given facilities for voting, I reply that I am. If you ask me 'by what method, I reply, '' Any method by which their votes can be recorded."" And if you tell me that the only method is that of voting by post, I say, ""Very well, I will support I am prepared to support that portion of the Bill, and if it went no further, I should say tc the 1 ' You may rest assured that you will have my vote, and since you want only one more, you will be able to carry the Bill."" But this measure does not stop bhere. The Minister, in introducing said, "" We want to reinstate in the electoral law of this country those provisions that have been improperly from it "" He went on to affirm that the Bill laid it down definitely dearly that the sick and infirm should have restored to them, per medium of the postal ballot system, the right to vote, and that those who were pioneers, far removed from polling booths, should also have the right, to vote. It has been dearly and definitely proved in the Law Courts of this country that the latter part of this provision in regard to voting by post has been the subject of fraud and of iniquitous practices. proved so clearly that the Minister self has had to admit it. The application of the system to the sick and infirm may be safeguarded. An officer may be able to tell from the appearance of an Ur. Anstey. applicant for a postal ballot-paper that he is sick or infirm, but what safeguard is there against the improper use of the system by any man who likes to come imperfect; along and say, "" I believe that on pollshould ing day I shall be more than five miles if pos- from a polling booth, and therefore desire to vote by post."" of the Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Is not the honourable member slandering Australia?",55
409,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"No, that has been so far, left exclusively to the Prime Minister. particu- He said the other night, "" Is it not a of fact that improper practices have been carried out?"" The answer was, "" No . "" Then he said, "" Is it a slander on Australia to say that improper practices have been carried out in connection with the elections?"" The answer was, "" Yes."" matter-to The Leader of the Opposition said, "" Furnish us with some evidence in support of your allegation."" The Prime Minister, however, had not a tittle of evidence to support his charge, and even the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, in introducing this Bill , said there was none. He stated that there was no evidence of impersonation-n o evidence of improper practices-and this, in spite of the fact it."" that the Treasurer himself had stated particular that thousands had corruptly exercised 0 the franchise, and that when told, by the examiners and detectives appointed by Government, the Government to make an inquiry, that such was not the case, he simply remarked, "" Well, I am. surprised to find that there is not'so many after all . "" The Attorney-General also admits that there it, is not the slightest evidence in regard to this allegation. Coming to this last point, I say definitely that I am prepared obliterated to vote for the application of the postal voting system to the sick and the infirm, and but that, on the other hand, I am absolutely opposed to that part of the Bill which declares that voting by post shall be exercised by any one who cares to say that upon a certain day he will be more than five miles from a polling booth. How can we safeguard its application tr> such people? An officer may see at a glance that an applicant for a postal ballot-paper is sick, or is in such a condition that he may not be able, under It has been normal circumstances, to attend at a him- polling booth, but there is no power on earth that can say where a man will be so many days hence or that he will be at a certain place at least five miles distant from a polling booth on the day of election. The extension of the principle to such cases has proved the foundation of all the fraud and iniquity in connection with the postal voting system of this country. At all previous elections half the postal votes recorded for the whole Commonwealth have been cast in Victoria, where the facilities for voting, and the density of the population, are greatest. Where are these men who are pioneering far from a polling booth? In Queensland, Western Australia, the northern parts of South Australia, and the back-blocks of New South Wales. Surely, then, the number of persons voting by post in those parts should be far greater than in Victoria, where the population is the most dense. Yet the evidence is that in this State, where the facilities for going to the poll are, owing to the density of population, the greatest, the largest proportion of postal votes is cast. Beyond that, honourable members will find that it is not in the country districts, or even the remote parts of this State, where the postal vote is most used; it is rather in our great cities. How is such a system to be safeguarded? If the Ministry desire to secure a perfect system, or to extend the facilities for exercising the franchise, let them tell us how, and by what means, they are going to insure that the system of voting by post shall not be exercised chiefly in that portion of our continent where the population is the densest and the voting facilities are the greatest? The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs has admitted that cases of fraud have occurred in connection with voting by post. He admitted that there were a number of cases, and he cited instances where different justices of the peace and others, in different States, had been prosecuted for improper practices in connection with it. He went on to. say, however, that the fact that there were a few cases of this character was no justification for the abolition of postal voting. I agree with him. I admit that this party went too far in abolishing postal voting altogether. I have always held that opinion, but I was not prepared to express it at the time of the repeal of the system, because I was then a new man in this Chamber. I am prepared to say so now. Whilst I think that we were well justified in eliminating from the Act the section enabling any person who says that he will be more than five miles from a polling booth on polling day to vote by post, I think we went too far in repealing the application of the principle to the sick and the infirm. The Honorary Minister asked whether the fact that a few cases of fraud had occurred was sufficient justification for abolishing the system. That remark will also apply to the proposed abolition of abseut voting. There is no adequate reason why it should be abolished. Not one case of fraud under it has been brought forward.",56
410,Mr KELLY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,The honourable member does not suggest that it is being abolished.,57
411,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"As hitherto practised, it is to be.",57
412,Mr KELLY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,No .,57
413,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"Se e how we disagree, even on simple questions of fact. The absent-voting system established by this party went upon the principle that every adult has the right to vote, and that any elector who cannot vote in his own subdivision should be at liberty to vote at any polling booth in any part of Australia. We declared that he should be able to go into any polling booth and there exercise the franchise. That system can no longer be practised if this Bill is carried. A man absent from his own electorate must, before polling day, obtain an absentee declaration. The Minister said that one of the iniquities of the absent-voting system was that it opened the door to improper practices. The only way in which to get people to carry ou improper practices is by buying their services-by bribing them to do it. There may be a few individuals who will do things of this kind from their keen desire to get in a certain individual, but there is no way to organize a system of fraud at election times but by paying for it. The honourable gentleman went on to say that one of the reasons for doing away with the existing system is that you can get half-a-dozen men to vote half-a-dozen times in one subdivision if they care to take the risk. That is true, it has always been true. It is true in every country in the world. It is true under every electoral system in every State of Australia. No electoral system has ever been devised under which a man could not gofrom one polling booth to another and vote.",57
414,Mr KELLY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,It cannot be done under the English system.,57
415,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"Yes , it can. A system cannot be invented under which it cannot be done.",57
416,Mr KELLY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,Unde r the English system a voter gets a ballot-paper which contains his number on the roll.,58
417,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,That also is capable of systematic fraud. The honourable gentleman also said that a voter after voting at one polling booth in person can go to another polling booth and exercise an absent vote. Does this Bill cure that? In what way does it effect a remedy? All the Bill does is to say that there must be an absent voter's form.,58
418,Mr KELLY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,The absentee voter's form does not touch that question; but we have touched it with another clause.,58
419,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"The Government profess to touch it under clause 19, which however, really touches nothing.",58
420,Mr KELLY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,It prevents any fraudulent vote from weighing in an election.,58
421,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"No , it does nof. The honourable gentleman said that the only method of stopping this kind of thing was that adopted in clause 19, which is a kind of Clements' cure-all, that really cures thing. Clause 19 is supposed to be an instrument to secure the true verdict of the electors of Australia. So it is from the Ministerial point of view, but not from ours. The idea and purpose of the signature of the voter are to insure that the people voting shall be known. But you do not stop fraud by this clause. The man who wants to vote more than once can do so. He can go to a polling booth, sign his ballot-paper, cast his vote, and then go to another booth and impersonate another elector. This clause will not cure such improper practices. There is nothing to stop an individual from going from polling booth A, where he has already signed the paper, to polling booth B, where he does the same.",58
422,Mr KELLY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"He does not sign the paper, but the butt.",58
423,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"Is not the butt a paper? Is it a brick? A person can sign the butt in booth A, and then go along to booth B and sign another butt.",58
424,Mr KELLY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"If he has any sense at all he will recognise that one of his ballot-papers will be passed out, and he himself will be passed in.  first.",58
425,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"The statement of the Minister is that this proposal will stop fraud. If it will not prevent fraud it is ineffective. It is useless. Sav that I go into a polling; booth, and declare that my name is Brown. I take the butt, and sign the name Brown upon it . Then I go to another booth in the electorate, and sign the butt again. What is to stop that if I choose* to take the risk of carrying on improper practices?",58
426,Mr KELLY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"The honourable member would not do any good, because the improper votes would be cast out.",58
427,Mr ABTHUB,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,Onl y when there was a dispute.,58
428,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,The Minister is arguing on the assumption that in connection with every election that takes place there is going to be a dispute. The only possibility under which fraud can be detected is where a defeated candidate tenders a protest against the election.,58
429,Mr ABCHIBALD,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,The clause will be a premium upon that kind of game.,58
430,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"Yes . In that case the votes will be investigated, and then, and then only, would the discovery be made that some individual had voted four or five times. My affirmation is that clause no- 19, which is going to compel every man and woman in Australia to sign a butt before a vote can be exercised, will serve no useful purpose whatsoever, from the stand-point of the cleanliness of elections, but will introduce the most iniquitous system that is capable of being established by any electoral law under our Constitution. The Minister informed the House that there are 4,000 polling places in Australia at which only a few persons vote. In the neighbourhood of such a polling place, it would be possible to make a voter's life a hell. That is what is possible under the operation of this system.",58
431,Mr KELLY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,Not at all ; the honourable member knows that that is not so.,58
432,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"I know that it is so. Say that a man goes into a polling booth and is the first to yote there. His number on the butt is No. 1. He must sign his name on the butt. It does not matter, from my point of view, whether the number is 1 or 1,000; if I am a scrutineer at that polling booth, I can take that number down, and ascertain afterwards how the elector voted.",58
433,Mr KELLY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"The signature will be on the back of the butt, and the number on the back of the ballot-paper. The honourable member imagines that a scrutineer can see through paper.",58
434,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"A scrutineer has an absolute right to look at a ballot-paper. It must be remembered that at 'some polling plaees there are only two persons present; sometimes only one. That person will know what elector voted on any particular paper. Say that Mr Wynne votes on paper No. 1, and Mr Kell y on paper No. 2. The scrutineer, when the votes are counted, can turn over the paper, look at the number, and see how Mr Wynne or Mr Kelly voted. What is to stop him ? If that is not destroying the secrecy of the ballot, what is ? There is no difficulty about it . The elector might as well have written his name on the face of the paper. A man who is a storekeeper conies into the booth, and I want to know how he votes. I look at the number on the ballot-paper, and see. How can the Government ask any body of men to support a proposal like that, which would reimpose in Australia the most iniquitous system which has ever been practised in the world ?",58
435,Mr MASSYGREENE,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,The ballot-papers are officers. not counted at the centres of which the honourable member speaks.,59
436,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,I know they are not.,59

438,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"I know they are not counted there, but I know-and so does recent elections? every other honourable member - where they go.. I say that, no matter where they are counted, the supervising officers and the men who are employed in the polling booths will know exactly the way in which particular votes are cast. I further that in many little townships a system would produce a veritable hell is a thief. among the residents. The Assistant M i ister of Home Affairs has said that there is no proof of any improper practices having been indulged in at the last tions. ' Upon a preliminary investigafrom tion the thousands of cases of alleged, duplicate voting boiled down to thirty forty in each electorate. A f t e r these been further investigated by detectives the Government have been unable to find one single case of double voting. The Honafter orary Minister has said that the Labour to this House. party had no justification ""for abolishing the postal vote. He declared that, though there had been some cases of fraud, those cases were not sufficient warrant such a radical change in the law. I ask him to tell this Parliament and the country if evidence of fraud and convicduplication. tions in cases brought before the Courts were no justification for the abolition of real duplications or not? the postal vote, how he can justify the sweeping away of the absentee vote upon no evidence whatever ?",59
439,Mr KELLY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,The honourable member is straining the matter to an absurd extent. There have been more cases of fraud under the existing system than there were uuder the postal voting system.,59
440,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs stated that these cases had been proved.,59
441,Mr KELLY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"There were cases of fraud at the recent elections, but it is impossible to find the defrauder.",59
442,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"That is very funny. In effect, the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs says that something does not exist, but that it does exist.",59
443,Mr KELLY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"Most of the cases of duplication are capable of a very easy and ordinary solution, but there are cases which are not so easily explainable, according to the views of the electoral",59
444,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,I am very much obliged to the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs for the speech which he has just Why did he say that he did not think there was impersonation or improper practices in connection with the,59
445,Mr KELLY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,We have not inquired into cases of alleged impersonation.,59
446,Mr ABCHIBAL D,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"The Government hunted very hard, and found nothing.",59
447,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"The Assistant Minissay ter of Home Affairs might just as well such say, "" The honourable member for Bourke We have never inquired ninto the matter, but we will enact legislation against him . "" In the first place, we were assured that on polling day electhere were thousands of women running one booth to another in Bourke and recording their votes. We were told or that seven of them voted under one name. have The most remarkable feature about these allegations was that the women were supposed to have voted in one subdivision another in order to secure my return The Government stated that they intended to inquire into these alallegations, and to introduce an amending Electoral Bill , for the purpose of to putting a stop to improper practices. The result of all their inquiry is that they obtained only sixty-nine cases of apparent Why did they not go further and ascertain whether these were As a matter of fact, they knew that is some divisions there was no evidence of duplication whatever. That remark is applicable to the great majority of the tables in the polling booths throughout the electorate of Bourke. But at some tables there were six, seven, or eight instances of apparent duplication. In a few cases, where there were 200 voters at a table, there were 202 ticks on the rolls, thus evidencing that in their excitement the omcers had ticked off more names than they should have done. In the case of Ballarat there is not a single instance upon which anything can be hinged. Yet it is proposed to re-establish a most iniquitous electoral law. The Government, after affirming that the existing system must be changed, and that it was an outrage to sweep away the votes of the sick and the infirm, propose to restore the postal vote and at the same time to deprive ten times the number, who will be thus affected, of the right to exercise the franchise. And they propose to so hedge the system round with limitations and restrictions and devices as to make the right to vote absolutely impossible to two-thirds of those upon whom they propose to confer it. Yet they ask, and expect, that there should be no obstruction or hostility from this side! There is not one man behind the Ministry who has endeavoured to justify for a moment the method by which they propose to change the absentvoting system in this country. I think that the system is capable of amendment in various directions. As regards a man voting in his own subdivision, the system is right enough, but when a man goes into another subdivision of the electorate for which he is enrolled he should be able to go to a table and, instead of exercising the absent vote, to vote directly. I hold that as long as a man is on the roll of the electorate in which he resides he should be able to vote in any part of that electorate. ""We overloaded the absent-voting system. It is capable of improvement. If we are to change the system at all, we should permit a man to vote in any subdivision of the electorate in which he resides, so that the vote can be counted directly.",59
448,Mr MCDONALD,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,Why not have one roll for the whole division?,60
449,Mr ANSTEY,LOYA L ORANGE INSTITUTION OF,"Yes , if necessary. In. any case, a man should be recognised Supply tomorrow. as an elector of a particulai"" electorate. The right of the nomadic population to vote in any part of Australia is, I submit, absolutely essential. If the Government alter the law as they propose, thousands of men-me n in every condition of life-wh o are constantly travelling, cannot get absent-voting papers, because, they cannot say from day to day where they will be stationed. Then, in order to show how the Government propose to restrict the provisions of the Act, I would point out that section 139 provides that any man who believes that on election day he will be outside of Australia may go before an Electoral Registrar and say, "" I shall be outside of Australia on election day, and, therefore, I claim the right to vote."" What is wrong about that provision? Is it not a fair one? There has not been one word of justification for sweeping it away. Yet the Government propose to sweep away the whole of section 139, which gives that right to a man, and to give him no right at all. The provision could have been very properly exteuded and made good use of. If the absenteevoting system is deemed cumbersome we could allow a man to go before an Electoral Registrar, and, whether he was going to England or not, to say, "" I believe that I shall be more than 5 miles away from my polling place on election day,"" and get the right to vote directly before that officer. I think that the system ought to be extended. In many directions it is good, and ought to be strengthened in everv possible way.
