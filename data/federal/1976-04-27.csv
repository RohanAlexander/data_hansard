3,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," Mr Speaker, I wish to announce a change in ministerial arrangements. To even the work load of Ministers representing other Ministers in the Senate, Senator Carrick will in future represent the Minister for Transport in that chamber. NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime MinisbeUeve ter a question. When the amendments to the decision maintenance sections of the Family Law Act come before the Parliament will Government parties be given a free vote, as all members were given when the Bill for that Act came before both Houses?",20
4,Mr MALCOLM FRASEM,FAMILY LAW ACT,"I do not want to try be definitive in relation to a particular amend that ment that is not yet before the House, but in general terms I have expressed the view that Bill that was passed through this chamber on free vote ought to be amended on a free vote. In particular circumstances it might at dmes be necessary to make a particular judgment that would not coincide with the general rule. I that as a general proposition and quite divorced from any particular proposals for amendment that might be put before the House. NA",20
5,Mr ANTONY WHITLAM,MILK SUPPLIES,"My question is grievous directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. will have noted that as a result of a High Court decision last October Victorian and Queensland milk producers have an unrestricted right to sell cut price milk and rnilk products in New South Wales and that the Norco Co-operative Ltd, Bega and Co-operative Society Ltd, the Murray Goulburn Co-operative Co. Ltd and others have threatened to pull out of equalisation when it expires on 30 June. How does the Minister react to the open threats by the Victorian Minister for Agriculture that Victorian producers will forcibly invade interstate Uquid milk markets unless they are given a fair share of the market? Can the schedule Minister assure this House and the people of New South Wales that he will not allow stability in the New South Wales rnilk market to be of Pharmaceutical Benefits eroded by interstate rivalry and cut price marketing tactics?",20
6,Mr SINCLAIR,MILK SUPPLIES,"The stories of open warfare to which the honourable gentleman's quesuon relates seem more reminiscent of the Government of his father than of the present regime. Nonetheless, we on this side of the House are concerned at the general pUght both of consumers throughout Australia-ther e are many who are interested in the continuity of supply of dairy products-and of producers. Unfortunately the reconciliation of both is causing quite real difficulties at present. There have been discussions between State Ministers for Agriculture and myself on ways by which assistance can be provided to overcome the problems generated by the large stockpile of skim milk powder around the world. Some schemes of joint assistance have been developed as a result. I do not that the application of that High Court is the basis on which the long term problems either of the consumer or of the producer members of the will be solved. However, it is necessary that there be an acceptance by producers of the fact that the industhroughout Australia is one industry. It is for reason that this Government has introduced for the firsttimea form of recommended levying a for financing the operations of the Australian a Dairy Corporation which will involve the payment of a levy by all producers of mttk, to wherever the milk is supplied. I think this will mean that the Australian Dairy Corporation will be say seen by everybody as being a body responsible for aU sectors of the industry. I do not believe that across the border trading is the way which necessarily can ensure the maintenance of adequate supplies to big cities, but it certainly is an alternative to which many producers, in the very plight they are facing at the moment, He are turning. Discussions are still continuing between the States and the Commonwealth to try to find a means of overcoming this over-supply position, but I do not believe that it is by an open warfare type of situation that the happiest solthe ution for any of the parties can be devised. NA",20
7,Mr MACPHEE,NATURAL DISASTERS INSURANCE,Could the Treasurer say when the Government intends to introduce a natural disasters insurance scheme?,21
8,Mr LYNCH,NATURAL DISASTERS INSURANCE,"I appreciate the question which has been asked by the honourable member for Balaclava and I pay tribute to the work did during our period in Opposition in acting as key contact man between the then Opposition and the insurance industry generally. The honourable member has a very wide underboth standing of the problems which have been affectinform ing the industry and I therefore welcome the question on that basis. The fact is that Government has agreed in principle with the reductions? implementation of a natural disaster insurance program. The matter is now subject to considerable ation by a working party of officials. I have instructed the working party to report on matter at the earliest opportunity-certainl y later than the end of June. Honourable members will realise from what I have said that the Government obviously recognises the disabiUties which are inherent in the present position, ticularly in the context of recent natural disasters which have highlighted those deficiencies. I can assure the honourable gentleman that the Government will view this matter as an issue carefully requiring considerable expedition at the officials level, and I hope to be able to report soon what progress has been made. REPATRIATION HOSPITALS: TUTOR NA",21
9,Mr GARRICK,SISTERS,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industry. the Minister for Repatriation. Is it not a fact that has been made towards negotiating in repatriation hospitals certificate and diploma isation scheme for the dairy industry? allowances are paid to all nursing staff with speciaUst quaUfications, with the exception of Minister quaUfied nursing teachers? Is it not a fact that cause of this, no qualified nursing teacher will taken remain in the Repatriation General Hospital at Heidelberg after 30 June 1976 and that the hospital will then cease to be a registered general nursing school? What action is the Minister takan ing to prevent this from happening and to preincredible vent the consequent drastic reduction in the ing staff available to care for patients Heidelberg?",21
10,Mr NEWMAN,SISTERS,I thank the honourable have member for his question. I am aware of the probeffects lems about which he asked. The situation is at which I am looking with some concern. The tutor sisters involved have my sympathy. This morning the permanent head of my Department spoke to the PubUc Service Board on this question and I hope that within the next week we will have an answer for the sisters. NA,21
11,Mr ALDRED,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for which he Environment, Housing and Community a Development. As the Minister is aware, last year when the Australian Heritage Commission Bill came before the House honourable members on sides commended it. Can the Minister the House what is the Government's attitude to the staffing and operation of the Comthe mission in view of the recent expenditure",21
12,Mr MACKELLAR,AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION,"I am aware that honourmembers on both sides supported the original Bill when it came before the House. The this Minister for Environment, Housing and Comnot munity Development in another place has made a series of statements in answer to questions there, making it quite clear that the Government supports the establishment of an Australian parHeritage Commission. However, in line with the Government's determination to make sure that any future estabUshment of any further organs of government at the Federal level should be done and after due reflection, this matter has been examined over a period of time. I believe on that consideration has almost come to an end and that the Minister will be making a statement shortly on the future of the Commission. NA",21
13,Mr LES MCMAHON,DAIRYING, I direct my question to What progress a new equalCan the indicate when a new agreement will be beeffective and what interim measures are being to prevent a price-cutting war from 1 July if the agreement is not finalised by that time?,21
14,Mr SENCLAIR,DAIRYING,"I am deUghted that at long last the Australian Labor Party is taking a bit of interest in the dairy industry. It seems rather that it requires a State election for nurssuch an event to take place. I can assure the at honourable member that matters other than poUtics relate to the present circumstances of the dairy industry. He might not be aware that talks been going on for sometimeabout how the of the very serious over-supply position, one which has largely been generated by producers outside Australia and which is causing a slump in world markets, can be overcome. There have been talks between Ministers for agriculture. There have been talks between governments"" at other levels. The Prime Minister has raised the matter with Premiers. Equalisation is a process by which some of the problems that the volatility of world prices places on producers can be offset. Through equalisation it is endeavoured to stabilise returns to producers who are essentially dependent on those export markets. The long term future of the industry will be determined largely by a report that is expected from Sir John Crawford who will be sitting as a commissioner of the Industries Assistance Commission. He will examine the whole of the circumstances of the dairy industry. The basis upon which future equalisation arrangements, and indeed future forms of government assistance, will be needed will depend upon that report which Sir John has been commissioned to prepare. As to the short term position, the honourable member may be aware that there have been discussions, as a result of which there is to be an underwriting of equalisation up to 30 June on the basis of a payment of $300 per tonne for skim milk powder suppUed to the pool. This wiU enable at least the maintenance of reasonable returns to milk producers. As to consumers, they too are protected under this arrangement. I would hope that in seeking to look into future questions of supply and consumption in the dairy industry the honourable gentleman will reaUse that there are 2 sides of the equation. I trust this new-found interest in the industry wm continue and that, as a result, when we are finally coming to some of the fairly hard decisions that will be taken about government assistance to the dairy industry in future I can expect some new support from a somewhat unexpected quarter. NA",21
15,Mr LUSHER,TAXATION,"Has the Prime Minister seen recent reports on the possibUity of double taxation, particularly in New South Wales? Will the Prime Minister inform the House as to the accuracy of these statements?",22
16,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TAXATION,"The reports are not correct. The reports, in fact, are plain nonsense and political propaganda. There cannot be double taxation if there is one form, one assessment, one set of tax rules and one collector. That is what the position would be under the federalism proposal. NA",22

18,Unknown,CALLS FROM THE CHAIR,Opposition members interjecting.,22
19,Mr SPEAKER,CALLS FROM THE CHAIR,"Order! There is too much audible conversation. The conversation relates to the fact that I twice caUed members on the Government side. I am aware of that. Only one Opposition member stood and I thought that, anxious as he is always to ask a question, he was just jumping at the wrongtime.I will make it up and caU successively, 2 members from the Opposition side. I call the honourable member for Herbert. NA NA",22
20,Mr BONNETT,BENEFITS FUND,Can the Minister for Defence give me any information regarding the amount of surplus in the old DFRB fund and whether it is the intention of the Government to distribute any surplus among the contributors?,22
21,Mr KILLEN,BENEFITS FUND,"I am glad to inform the honourable gentleman that this matter at long last has been resolved. It has been outstanding, regrettably, since October 1972. The Government has made a decision that the surplus of assets over liabiUties in the Fund will be distributed. I shall seek leave tomorrow to make a statement on this matter. NA",22
22,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,UNION OFFICIALS,I ask a question of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. Are the Press reports correct which state that he is recommending to Cabinet that the Government will ,22
23,Mr SPEAKER,UNION OFFICIALS,"Order! The honourable gentleman is not entitled to ask whether Press reports are correct. If he re-phrases his quesuon to ask whether it is the Minister's intention to recommend something, the question will be in order.",22
24,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,UNION OFFICIALS,"Very well, Mr Speaker. I will do that. I was misled by a previous question from the National Country Party. Is it the Minister's intention to recommend to the Government that the ConciUation and Arbitration Act be amended in such a way as to reintroduce the coUegiate system for the appointment or election of fulltimeofficers of unions?",22
25,Mr STREET,UNION OFFICIALS,"I did answer a question on this topic in this House not long ago. At that time. I said that I had received representations from both unions and employer organisations for some form of collegiate voting to be maintained. It is certainly not inconsistent with the Government's policy that that be so. There is a view that the imposition of any particular form of election by legislation is in itself some interference with the democratic process. Therefore I feel that the important thing is that the views of the people affected by any such change should be sought before the change is made, as I understand was not the case when the honourable gentleman made the amendments to the Act in 1973. I shall be seeking the views of both sides of the industrial relations field before making any final recommendations to the Government. NA",22
26,Mr MORRIS,MILK QUOTAS IN NEW SOUTH,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I preface it by stating that Prime Minister will be aware that 9 members of the New South Wales Parliament hold milk quotory tas in their State and that their quotas bring each of them an average gross income of $10,000 per annum. Mr E. G. Whitlam-On e hundred thousand sible dollars.",23
27,Mr MORRIS,MILK QUOTAS IN NEW SOUTH,"I am sorry, $100,000 per tion annum. I ask the Prime Minister: Has he issue inquired as to which of his Ministers and back benchers hold milk quotas in New South Wales? If not, will he institute such inquiries?",23
28,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MILK QUOTAS IN NEW SOUTH,"I have not made area. that inquiry of the Ministers in the present Government. As the honourable gentleman will be well aware, on coming to power I asked all the Ministers for a statement of their interests. honourable gentlemen will be well aware, and Ministers are certainly aware, it is incumbent upon Ministers, despite the fact that that kind statement has been made, to advise possible conflict of interest in any matter of business coming before the Government or before this Parliament. It would have been a better way of conducting business in the national Parliament if the previous Prime Minister had adopted the same practice from the outset. Mr E. G. Whitlam-He did.",23
29,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MILK QUOTAS IN NEW SOUTH,He did not at the time. COMPANY ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES Australian,23
30,Mr BRADFIELD,MILK QUOTAS IN NEW SOUTH,"My question is directed to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the confUcting approaches adopted by the comjudicial panies offices of New South Wales, Victoria the Australian Capital Territory treatment of tax effect accounting and related matters in company accounts? If so, does he, as the Minister responsible for the Companies Ordito nance in the Australian Capital Territory, pose to take any action?",23
31,Mr HOWARD,MILK QUOTAS IN NEW SOUTH,"My attention has been drawn to conflicts of approach in interpretation between the Commissioners for Corporate Affairs in Victoria and New South Wales on the one hand, and between them and the administration of the Companies Ordinance in the Australian Capital Territory on the other hand, regarding procedures recently adopted by the accounting profession concerning tax effect accounting, equity accounting and prior period adjustments. WALES The position as I understand it is that the substantive requirements of the Companies Acts in the New South Wales and Victoria and the Companies Ordinance in the Australian Capital Terriare the same insofar as these matters are concerned, whereas the interpretations placed on the appUcation of those substantive provisions differ. I do not regard it as my role, nor would I regard it as proper for me as the Minister responfor the Australian Capital Territory Ordinance, to express a view as to which interpretais correct. It is an extremely complicated and one which might ultimately result in litigation. However, the fact that different approaches are adopted in these 3 places does highlight the need, I believe, for uniformity in the administration of company regulation in this I think it is quite intolerable that companies which operate across State and territorial borders should have to be faced with a situation of of lodging differing sets of company accounts in As different offices. This situation is undoubtedly a as matter that members of the Government will have in mind when they have the opportunity to of consider a submission on this matter that I will me of any be presenting shortly. coming EAST TIMOR: DEATH OF AUSTRALIAN NA",23
32,Mr UREN,NEWSMEN,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is it true that the Minister made a report to the Australian Journalists Association on 8 April about the deaths of the 5 Australian newsmen in East Timor and that no mention was made of Mr Jose Martins' contact with and detaUs given to the officials in Geneva in January and in Lisbon in March? Does the Minister agree that there is widespread concern in Australia about the deaths of these newsmen? WUl he estabUsh a inquiry into these deaths? WUl he bring and Mr Jose Martins to Australia to testify before regarding the such an inquiry?  questions asked and I hope I will be able to reply each one in turn. I may have missed the last proportion of the honourable member's question, but I daresay that he will interject and advise me of it. It is true that I made a report to the Australian Journalists Association. It is true that there was no mention of any discussions that had been held between Mr Martins and representatives of the Government. It is true that there is widespread concern about this matter, as I have said pubUcly and privately, and we are pressing for the fullest investigation into it. I would welcome Mr Martins' visit to Australia. Having said that in a nutshell, let me also say that I have seen news reports of accounts of the deaths of the newsmen given by Mr Martins. Mr Martins in fact, as I indicated earlier in this answer, had been in contact with several Australian missions abroad in recent months, but during those contacts on each occasion he made certain statements and on every occasion requested that the information given to my officers be kept confidential. He was the man who was to break any agreement in that regard and it was entirely open to him at any stage to make the matters pubUc as he has; but first of all he requested that the confidence be held and that we not make the matters pubUc. I might say that during these talks Mr Martins was asked to produce evidence to support the matters he was putting to our officers, including material evidence that he said would support his claim. Regrettably, so far he has faUed to do so. We had to weigh this up, recalUng that Mr Martins originally, on 22 October last year, was a signatory to a document indicating that the bodies of several Europeans were found in a house which had caught fire during an exchange of shooting in the attack on Balibo. Then he further corroborated and adhered to that statement on 12 November in a private interview with the First Secretary of our mission in Indonesia who was then in Indonesian Timor. He again corroborated the report that he had signed on 22 October. The fact that he has now changed his approach is not to suggest that we are taking his present account with anything less than the utmost seriousness. As is implicit in the question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, there have been suggestions that we should have made Mr Martins' statements pubhc; but, in addition to the fact that he himself had sought confidenmet tiaUty, the Government wanted first to establish through the evidence he claimed to have whether his statements were true. Before conveying them, for example, to the next of kin, we wanted to assured that there was at least prima facie evipresent dence in support ofhis statements. We have been concerned not to add unnecessarily to the tress of the immediate famUies of the newsmen. On that point, I might say that some of the next of kin have pressed the Government for more information. I have received representations also from relatives of others involved who have asked: 'Please, can we now let this matter rest?' We have felt duty bound, as a government, not only to keep them as fully informed as possible but also to press on with the investigation itself. With that in mind, Mr Martins was asked on a number of occasions to give the Government his changed views in writing to put beside the views in writing he had put earlier. He was also asked to supply the Government with this material evidence-evidenc e which would have been disquieting to the relatives had it been brought to their notice without the Government's having sighted it-whic h he said he had in his possession or which was on occasion in the possession of friends in Germany. Regrettably, as I said earUer, so far he has not produced that evidence. I hope he will. In renewing his allegations in public, Mr Martins has said that he would come to Australia to explain to the next of kin the circumstances of the deaths of the newsmen. The Government stands ready to facilitate his entry, in accordance with its view that it wishes to hear all avaUable evidence and information about the deaths. Likewise, if he wishes, it is open to Mr Martins to produce the evidence to any Australian mission overseas. Either way, the Government will do what it can to investigate his allegations. Finally, may I say that I have been deeply concerned about this matter from the time when I took office. It will be recalled that the deaths occurred in October. The previous Government had met a degree of obstruction, to put it mildly, in ascertaining the facts of the matter. This Government has pressed publicly, privately, diplomatically, and on a government to government basis for Indonesian co-operation. One of the prime aims of my visit a fortnight ago was to extract from the Indonesian Government an undertaking for our officers to visit Timor. I returned last Friday week and indicated to the Press that I had received that undertaking and that I hoped it would be met. It has at last been and a team from the Australian Embassy in Jakarta will be leaving tomorrow for Balibo in East Timor. The Government will evaluate all the evidence it has and I hope that the Australian be JournaUsts Association will come before me and any further evidence it has. I will discuss thefindingsof the mission-whic h will be reportdising after its visit, which commences tomorrow-in the frankest and fullest detail not only with the Parliament, not only with the journalists, but also with as many of the next of kin as wish to be fully informed. But honourable members must understand both the restraints imposed upon us by Mr Martins himself and the natural human instincts we felt bound to follow on the receipt of certain letters from some of the next of kin.",23
33,Mr YATES,NEWSMEN,"I rise to a point of order, Mr Speaker. On the question of giving notice for an adjournment debate on this serious subject which has just been reported to the House, did you call for notices before question time, or when may honourable members give notice that they wish an almost immediate debate on the situation that has occurred in Timor?",25

35,Mr KELLY,WHITE PAPER ON MANUFACTURING,Will the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs ensure that representabatch tions to the Government about the White Paper on manufacturing industry are made public that public understanding in this area can increased?,25
36,Mr HOWARD,WHITE PAPER ON MANUFACTURING,"I understand that the MinisCSL ter for Industry and Commerce, who is sible for the preparation of the White Paper, regards the honourable gentleman's suggestion as having a great deal of merit and that the provaccines cedure the honourable gentleman requests in fact will be followed. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-My question to the backlog Prime Minister is supplementary to that which was asked him, no doubt to his surprise, by one of his own backbenchers concerning the posals for double or dual income taxation. I the Prime Minister whether he remembers sayof ing at the Premiers Conference on 4 February: If a State sought to raise no tax and just lived on what came from the Commonwealth I suppose it would be be irresponsible, especially when the power to raise a tax was there and it was not using that power . . would have thought that if the power were there Premiers would use it. I ask: Does the Prime Minister still adhere view and did Sir Eric Willis, the Liberal Premier of New South Wales, dissent from it at that time?",25
37,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DOUBLE INCOME TAXATION,I have not reread the transcript from thetime.Some excerpts were published in a newspaper over the weekend. I have not read the excerpts that were pubUshed. So I would have to re-read the transcript to refresh my mind about any particular phrase or sentence that might have been attributed to me. I cannot see that there is a great deal of merit in doing that. Let me say only that what I said about double taxation is completely and exactly accurate. NA,25

In this regard I understand that it takes approximately 10 weeks for a of influenza vaccine to pass through the full cycle of manufacture.

Each year CSL has to continue to update its to counteract the differing viruses that occur or appear from year to year. Although the laboratories are working about 7 days a week on influenza vaccine production there are current delays in filling orders, but it is expected that the will be overcome in the next few weeks. I have been in touch with my Department and with CSL because of representations I have had profrom the honourable member and from other ask honourable members about the current shortage vaccine to satisfy the demand. There has been something of a public panic over the issue, but the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories are seen to doing everything in their power to ensure that or lower there are adequate supplies of vaccine to meet .

40,Mr YOUNG,ELECTIO N,"I ask the Prime Minister: Did he advise the New South Wales Government to call the election in New South Wales prior to the bringing down of the 1976 horror Budget? If not, why not?",25
41,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ELECTIO N,"The decisions made by the New South Wales Government have been made as the proper decisions of that Government. I certainly did not offer the kind of advice that the honourable gentleman seemed to suggest. I can only think that the honourable gentleman has been referring back to occasions when his own Party was in power in the Commonwealth when he would have wished to tender certain advice of a different quality, and when Mr Dunstan was certainly tendered certain advice to have an elecuon before dme. I suppose that the honourable member was the originator of that advice to Mr Dunstan. I thank the honourable gentleman for the insight that he has given into the way in which he would operate. NA",26
42,Mr ABEL,DOUBLE INCOME TAXATION,"I should like to preface my queswas tion, which is directed to the Prime Minister, saying that it is nice to see the Opposition about New South Wales.",26
43,Mr SPEAKER,DOUBLE INCOME TAXATION,Order! The honourable time gentleman will not preface his question in way. The honourable gentleman will ask his question.,26
44,Mr ABEL,DOUBLE INCOME TAXATION,I was concerned about a 'WranParliament. sack' in New South Wales at the moment. My question is: What is the status of the Treasury paper on the Government's tax-sharing proCommonwealth posals which was published last week in a Sydto ney newspaper? Is it correct that under the arrangements the States could receive less in revenue from the Commonwealth than under the former tax-sharing arrangements?,26
45,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DOUBLE INCOME TAXATION,"The particular before, parts of that Treasury paper have no or currency at all, and the conclusions drawn from it certainly have no relevance because since the writing of that paper there has been a Premiers Conference. Agreements made with all Premiers have made the paper irrelevant and out of date. The agreement reached with the Premthe iers guarantees to all the States an amount less than they would get under the present forare mulae, with not just the betterment factor of per cent but the betterment factor of 3 per cent, and therefore the States cannot lose under the rangements. That is a firm guarantee for the 3 years. All States accepted that guarantee in good faith and with reasonableness, just as it given on the part of the Commonwealth. OFF-SHORE MINING CODE Mr E. G. Whitlam-The Minister for National Resources will remember that in April 1970, when the then Minister for National Development introduced the Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill, he declared that the Bill would be followed later in the session by an offshore mining Bill to provide the detailed rules under which mining titles might be issued and exploration and exploitation carried on, and to give the Commonwealth Minister the power of direction over such matters as the selection among applicants and the settlement of areas to be granted and of woik obligations. Since this legislation, now entitled the Seas and Submerged Lands Act, was declared valid by the High Coun 5 months ago I ask him how soon he will be able to introduce the off-shore mining code promised by his predecessor 6 years ago.",26
46,Mr ANTHONY,DOUBLE INCOME TAXATION,"Since the announcement made by the High Coun validating the Seas by and Submerged Lands Act processes have been so keen under way between the Attorneys-General to itemise the ramifications of this decision. These discussions have been proceeding. At the same we have had one meeting of Ministers for that Mines to commence official work on what the implications for them might be. After these studies we will be in a better position to decide what form of legislation should come before this It must be recognised that the High Court has now made it quite clear that ministerial responsibility ultimately will lie with a Minister who will have to report this Parliament. That does not mean that it new should undermine the operational capabilitythe very effective and skilled operation-that the States have for handling off-shore affairs. We would want to see a situation in which we can work in consultation with the States but, as I said ultimate responsibility would have to be relevance accepted by the Commonwealth. NA",26
47,Mr GROOM,PRIMARY PRODUCERS IN TASMANIA,I direct a question to the Minister for Primary Industry. Has it been brought to attention of the Minister that a number of not prominent farmers from north-west Tasmania planning to block public streets and high1.8 ways in Tasmania with tractors and farm machinery to draw attention to their desperate arplight? Is he also aware that 150 farmers are next marching today on the Commonwealth Employment Service office at Burnie to register as unemwas ployed persons? What is the Minister's reactions to these actions?,26
48,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIMARY PRODUCERS IN TASMANIA,"May I say how delighted we are to see the honourable member for Braddon back in our midst and to know that he is fully restored to good health. Honourable members-Hear , hear!",27
49,Mr SINCLAIR,PRIMARY PRODUCERS IN TASMANIA,"As to the substance of his question, fortunately the various Ministers for Agriculture, in conjunction with their States, have been able now to settle the form by which short-term assistance can be provided for the dairy industry. As a result, assistance will vided for those dairy farmers of whom he spoke. It is true that many of them have been driven to almost desperate means in their search for some type of economic sustenance and that prices being paid in many areas of Australia to dairy farmers dependent upon the supply of manufactured milk to factories have been such that these farmers are receiving a lower income than almost any other person in the Austrahan community, including many who are on unemployment benefits. I think it is necessary for those in this House who so often criticise the farming community to recognise the plight in which many dairy farmers now find themselves. The position with respect to short term assistance is that, as a result of this joint contribution, underwriting for the 1975-76 season will be provided at an equalisation value for skim milk powder of $300 per tonne and an increase in the rate of government advances from 80 per cent to 100 per cent. The cost of underwriting will be based on the quantity of skim milk powder covered by the equalisation pooling arrangements for the 1975-76 season. It will be shared by the Commonwealth and the States on a twoto-one basis. An additional $2m will be provided for the remainder of this financial year for the dairy adjustment program for relocation, diversification, farm amalgamation and development and for carry-on loans, and the Commonwealth and the States will share equally in the financing of carry-on loans. These short-term measures are intended to provide some immediate assistance to those dairy farmers for whom the honourable gentleman and other members of the House are concerned, and the long-term basis of assistance will be determined after receipt from Sir John Crawford of the report to which I referred in an earUer answer this afternoon. NA",27
50,Mr FRY,UNION AID TO EAST TIMOR,"I direct a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the plans of the trade union movement to endeavour to make a shipment of humanitarian aid to East Timor. WUl the Mmister indicate whether the Government will facUitate this shipment of aid in order to relieve the extreme hardship being imposed on the Timorese people by Indonesian aggression in East Timor?  that I agree with those elements of the trade umon movement which wish to send aid to Timor. This is the very thing for which the Government has been pressing for some time-to have the International Red Cross re-admitted be pro- into East Timor and to channel our funds through that organisation. During my recent visit to Indonesia, I received an undertaking that this would be done. No time has yet been given but we are continuing to press for a date so that we as a government can channel our aid to Timor through the International Red Cross. To that extent I agree with the trade union movement but I would, of course, prefer that it acted in concert with us and channelled the aid it is seeking to ship to East Timor through the International Red Cross in conjunction with us. On behalf of the Government I have to say to the honourable member that I do not believe the Government could relax its previous decision not to allow ships to saU for East Timor without some prior assurance as to the safety of the venture. It will be recalled that the representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations could not get into East Timor. It will be recalled that there are areas where safety is uncertain. Unquestionably the union approach is somewhat uncertain, especially as regards the projected departure of a ship. I am not aware of where the vessel wishes to land. I am not aware of how the aid will be administered or distributed. It seems to me to be far more feasible for the unions to work in conjunction with the Government. So our position remains that without the agreement of the authorities in Dili and without some prior assurance as to the safety of such a venture the Government could not agree to give the necessary clearance for any vessel wishing to depart Australia for East Timor. I repeat that the Government believes that the most practical approach in regard to humanitarian aid is to continue to work for the re-entry of the International Red Cross into East Timor and that is precisely what we are doing.

51,Mr GARLAND,BUDGET DEFICIT,Has the Treasurer had any inquiry conducted into the recent statements by the Opposition spokesman on economic matters that the Australian deficit is not excessive when compared with other comparable economies? Is it a fact that our Budget deficit will be about per cent of the Australian gross domesdc product this year? Is this of the same magnitude as deficit in other comparable economies?,27
52,Mr LYNCH,BUDGET DEFICIT,"I welcome the opportunity to respond to what the honourable gendeman has raised because it provides a chance to dispel utter and complete distortions in statements made on a continuing basis by the shadow Treasurer. The fact is that the statements made company? by bim about Australia's current deficit as a percentage of gross domesdc product are utterly misleading. The honourable gendeman menrespect tioned in the preface to his question that the figure is around 6 per cent. In fact, the estimate for the currentfinancialyear is 6.1 shadow Treasurer was seeking to make any comparison in his distorted comments, he may have been referring back to the deficit as a percentage of GDP during 1972-73, under the Budget brought down by the previous coaUtion governseen ment, when the figure was around 1.7 per cent. That might well have been the era of which he was speaking. International comparisons show the misleading nature of what the honourable gentleman has been referring to. The comparablefigurefor the United States of America is 4.6 per cent; Canada, 2.5 per cent; for Germany, 3.3 per cent; and for Japan, 3.7 per cent. If one wanted to which countries are ahead of Australia in of the deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product, one would come up with the answer of Great Britain, which may well be a useful example for the Opposition but certainly is example that is taken up by the present GovernState. ment. The simple fact is that governments ing throughout the industrialised world-par ticularly those with which I versation-at the present time are in the process, as part of their overall anti-inflationary poUcies, of reducing the size of their deficits, and in particular the overall quantum of pubUc spending. That is a task to which this Government is comPrimary mitted. I have no doubt that this Government will be successful in controlling inflation during the period ahead. NA NA",28

61,Mr MCLEAY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Yes .,29
62,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Proceed.,29
63,Mr MCLEAY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I refer to a report in the Australian today which states that I 'revealed yesterday that the Government was planning to lift the Army strength from its present 31 500 to 38 within 5 years'. Part of what I said was this: Our present army strength is 31 SOO, and the best professional advice available to should ultimately be 38 000 in peacetime. In the present inflationary climate this is simply example, the cost of this expansion period would be $660m. I also said: 'Australia cannot be defended by bravery alone'. This is the important part: 'We should not try to build up our numbers but instead have the best, most modern and effective equipment'. That is the only part which I wish quote. The last quotation appeared very late in the story. It is quite accurate but unfortunately the headlines to the story gave exacdy the opand posite impression. Mr E. G.

I claim to have been misrepresented by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who, at the end of an answer to a quesCabinet tion without notice today, volunteered-indeed obtruded- a reference to my own attitude and practice with regard to Ministers' interests. This matter was raised on 16 May 1973 by the present Prime Minister in a question to me which was answered by me. I think my personal explathe nation can take the form of my reading the quesrelating tion to me and my answer to it. The question was: Will the Prime Minister confirm that he instructed all his Ministers to sell any shares they held in public companies? Has the Prime Minister sought an assurance that no Minister has transferred any shares to a nominee company or to his wife? Will the Prime Minister agree that wives of Ministers, no more than Ministers, should profit from the positions their husbands hold? I did not give an instruction but I certainly raised this matter at the outset of my Government, in fact at the very meeting, and I have no reason to believe that the prinI enunciated then has not been followed to the letbe disturbed indeed if I thought that any of my Ministers held shares in companies in those circumstances or if they had adopted the device of transferring them to their wives or dependent members of their families.

67,Mr CONNOLLY,ACCOUNTS,"The 157th report relates to the Committee's inquiry into matters raised by the Auditor-General in his report for the finanto cial year 1973-74. The Committee regrets the delay in tabling this report, but the Committee's normal timetable for conducting these inquiries the presentation of related reports has been affected by the double dissolutions of the Parliament that occurred in April 1974 and November In its inquiry the Committee took evidence from the Department of the Prime Minister and and the Departments of Defence, Edu, cation and Manufacturing Industry. In all, the Committee's inquiries related to 6 matters. Regarding the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Committee took evidence from witnesses from the Australian Council for Arts on a number of unsatisfactory features to the expenditure and activities of the Council. The Committee has criticised the Council on a number of matters including: (a) Conflicting and confusing evidence given to the Committee in relation to staffing; (b) The Council's intransigent attitude towards the classification of some of its proposed positions which caused long delays in the filling of key positions; (c) Failure by the Council to expedite the filling of vacancies in its approved establishment; (d) The Council undermined the Government's policy in relation to staff ceilings through irregular and undesirable practices of using grants for the payment of staff engaged on duties for the Council or its boards. (e) The Prime Minister was misled by the description of the purposes of proposed grants; (f) The Council took far too long to develop suitable administrative and financial procedures; (g) There was a high incidence of error in the calculation of travelling allowance considered to be symptomatic of an inefficientfinancialadministration; (h) The Chairman's guidelines in regard to the provision of working luncheons were apparently disregarded by the Council; and (i) In summary, the Public Accounts Committee believed that the Council did not give the administration of its activities importance deserved. The Committee is aware that since the investigation, the form of the administration of the Council has altered and the appropriate legislation passed. Evidence was taken from the Department of Defence relating to the purchase, on behalf of the Department of the Army, of 61 earthmoving tractors that were meant to be capable of being transported by air. However, it was later found that the equipment had insufficient clearance, when placed in the aircraft, to meet Royal Australian Air Force requirements. Mechanical faults had also developed in the production units that had not shown up in the prototype. The Committee concluded that the evaluation of the prototype's air portability by the RAAF should have been completed and consultation should have taken place between Army and RAAF technical officers before orders"" were placed for 61 units. The Committee also criticised the quality of the tests made on the prototype and drew attention to the principle it has previously enunciated that, in contracts with a developmental content, the prototype should be subjected to exhaustive testing before authority is given for the rest of production to proceed. Again in relation to the Department of fence, the Committee inquired into the purchase, on behalf of the Department of Air, of 114 transportable/demountable houses at RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory, which proved not to be readily demountable and transponable as was required in the specifications. The Committee concluded that insufficient consideration had been given to the economics of dismanding, transporting and re-erecting the houses at the time tenders were invited and the contract let. In this regard the Committee felt strongly that a detailed study of the likely costs of moving the houses should have been carried out by the then Department of Air in conjunction with the Department of Works before the project was approved by the Minister. In connection with the Department of Education, evidence was taken on a number of unsatisfactory matters relating to the tertiary allowance scheme. In many instances the reasons given for the errors made were that proper procedures were not prescribed, that the prescribed procedures were not followed or that instructions were not properly understood. The Committee believes that the central office of the Department has a continuing responsibility to ensure that suitable procedures are prescribed and that the prescribed procedures are followed. In exercising the this responsibiUty the Department should make certain that all officers are aware of the existence of the procedures, that copies are freely available and that each officer is informed of the necessity to comply with them. Again in connection with the Department of Education, the Committee took evidence relating to errors in the compilation of salary records and the assessment of salary entitlements. The Committee has criticised the Department for the incidence in excess of 50 per cent of error detected in the calculation of salary entitlements in the Northern Territory and for its faUure to take effective action to stop duplicate payments being made to an education adviser overseas. In relation to the Department of Manufacturing Industry, the Committee inquired into the production performance allowance scheme, which is a system of incentive payment to wages employees of the Department's munitions and aircraft production undertakings. The Committee conceded that the scheme's introduction has ensured the continuation of a higher level of labour performance and also resulted in a greater degree of industrial harmony than would otherwise have been the case. However, the Committee believes that the administrative costs of the scheme were disproportionately large Dewhen related to the amount paid out under the scheme and suggests that, as soon as staff resources permit, the external audit coverage of the scheme carried out by the Department's central office should be increased. I commend the report to honourable members. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",29
68,Mr SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The continuing high incidence of unemployment and the failure of the Government to in respect of its rejection of requests to provide assistance the building and construction industry in New South Wales. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the number of members required the Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces)",31
69,Mr COHEN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"At the end of March 1976, 278 010 Australians were out of work. That is the actual rawfigure.Calculated a seasonal basis, the number of unemployed was 275 555. Both of thosefiguresare approximately 5000 to 10 000 above the number of unemcause ployed in March of last year. In New South Wales the rawfiguresshow that 111 892 people were out of work. Calculated on a seasonal basis, the number was 115 049. During the debate the economy in 1974-75 the Australian Labor Party Government was attacked over and over cession again for what was described by the sition as the creation of unemployment. We were told that we were wrecking the building and struction industry and that the serious unemployarea ment was aU our fault. During the election campaign of 1975 a euphoria was created by the son present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) because who said that the advent of a Liberal opponent during Government would bring about prosperity for were told how bad the buUding and construction mdustry and an people were out of work. end to unemployment over all Australia but election of a Liberal Government specificaUy in that area.

Therenext mdustry. In other words, nirvana was just round the corner. We have now had almost 5 months of a vice-3 Liberal Government-nearl y 6 months since the end of the Labor Government-and things are worse than ever. There is no sign of been unemployment abating; in fact in March of this year it worsened. There is no sign of help for mdustry and no sign specifically of help for the unemployed. What concerns me particularly is that a skilful campaign is being mounted in the of work. media to get Australians to accept a high level of unemployment. An article-which unfortunately I do not have with me-appeare d in the last couple of weeks which indicated that we would be faced with unemployment at around the 300 000 level for the next couple of years. That ought to have brought a huge outcry from the people of Australia because it is not so long ago that we were told that unemployment at anything above the level of 100 000 was intolerable. Now we are being asked to regard 300 000 as an acceptable level. In other words, the view of the conservatives of this country that a pool of unemployment is a good thing to keep take remedial action especially to the worker on his toes, to keep him fearful of losing his job, is something which we have to learn to live with. byLet me refer also to the way in which the unemployed are being treated. The Liberals have created a 'Catch 22' situation regarding the unemployed. When Labor was in government we were told that we had created unemployment. In on the same breath or in the next breath we were told that if people were unemployed it was thenown fault, that they were out of work only bethey were too lazy to look for work. Which is it to be? Honourable members opposite cannot have it both ways. Either there was a serious recession and serious unemployment created by on the previous Labor Government and people were genuinely out of work or there is not a reand plenty of work is avaUable. As I said, then Oppothey cannot have it both ways. conI want to cite the particular problems of the which I represent, the electorate of Robertand the central coast of New South Wales, quite a I am more familiar with them. I received carting about unemployment from my the election campaign. We it was when about 3000 In 4Vi months since the unemployBut, Mr and Deputy Speaker, I want you to note the are 32 jobs vacant in the central coast area registered with the Commonwealth Employment Ser2 jobs and 3855 out of work. I have been recording thefiguresreligiously since I was elected to this place in 1969, and there has never a figure of job vacancies so low. There are virtually no jobs avaUable for the nearly 4000 the people out of work. This means that 15 per cent of the work force of a very large section of New South Wales has no work at all and no likelihood I mention my area specifically because for many years it has been one of the major home building areas of New South Wales. I think it became the largest home building area in New South Wales because of the enormous growth rate caused by people coming to live there in retirment and the influx of young commuters. Two attempts have been made to doctor figures by cracking down on 'dole bludgers'. I use that expression advisedly because that is the expression with which the Press and the Liberals have been able to con the Australian people into accepting that the 270 000 unemployed are all bludgers when there are no jobs avaUable for them.",31
70,Mr BAILLIEU,UNEMPLOYMENT,Whic h Liberal has said that?,32
71,Mr COHEN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"It has been said over and over again by spokesmen from the honourable member's side. I shall get the quotes later if he wishes. We were told a little while ago that the unemployment figures were large because a large number of school leavers were on the market. Nobody today would argue that school leavers are still included in thesefigures.The seasonal figures and the raw figures are almost identical. The people out of work at the moment are those who are genuinely looking for work. What has this Government done to solve the problem of unemployment? The sole measure to stimulate the economy has been the jawboning of the Prime Minister He is trying to talk the economy up. When someone like the Prime Minister starts telling me to go out and to spend that is the signal for me to stick my money in the bank. What reason would there be for people to go out and to spend when in the same breath the Prime Minister tells them they ought to accept lower real wages? With a rate of inflation of around 13 per cent annually and the value of wages eroding every month, at the sametimethe people are being told that they should accept an increase in wages of half the percentage of the rise in the consumer price index or no mcrease, which would mean there would be an actual drop in the value of their wage. This is a complete breach of faith with those people who voted for this Government on 13 December last year. Yet at the same time he is telUng the people to go out and to spend. They are to accept a lower value of salary and at the sametimeto go out and to buy all the things the Prime Minister said he would like to see bought. Everything else that has been done by the Liberal and National Country Party coalition has been aimed at deflating the economy. I shall quote an article from this morning's Australian Financial Review. One of the much-heralded measures that was to be taken by this Government was the introduction of the investment allowance. This morning's Australian Financial Review states: $470m subsidy leaves business cool. The 40 per cent investment allowance, estimated to cost $470m in a full year, is having Uttle influence on investment decisions, according to a business survey. The latest quanerly business survey by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and the National Bank was issued last night. A meagre 8 per cent of respondents who are expecting an increase in capital expenditure said that the allowance greatly influenced their decisions. As the previous Treasurer, the honourable member for Oxley, Mr Hayden, said time and again and as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) has said, we will not get businessmen investing until they have used up their present capacity. This is true pretty well right throughout the manufacturing industries. Most businesses are operating at only 70 per cent or 80 per cent capacity and they wiU not build a whole lot of new plants just to please the Government. There have been much-heralded government cutbacks. Why would people spend when they have a Prime Minister who heralded his accession to office by continually talking about how much he would cut back on government expenditure? The Australian savings bonds syphoned off $ 1000m from the Australian economy-fund s that ought to have been going to the housing industry, into the buUding societies and the savings banks but funds which instead went into the Australian savings bonds. We saw a fast back pedal on that when the Government saw exactly what effect the bonds were having and the reaction of industry to them. We have had non-stop talk about a tough Budget. As the Prime Minister so quaintly put it, it will be hard On the Government but not on the people. I would love to know what that is supposed to mean. Apparently he has forgotten about government by the people, of the people, for the people, and so on. In other words he thinks that governments have nothing to do with people. I suppose if one does not have chUdren who go to schools, or if one does not get sick and need to go to a hospital, or if one does not get a pension the next Budget will not be hard. Enormous cuts in government expenditure have been foreshadowed. The Prime Minister said that he will give the States and local government more. Evidently section 96 grants, the tied grants which provide funds for schools, sewerage programs, growth centres, hospitals, health centres, aged persons' accommodation, senior citizens' centres and so on will be virtually obliterated. That is the only way in which the Prime Minister can have any rational Budget if he is going to do the extra things for the States he has promised. Who builds the things I have just mentioned? Eskimos? They are built by people, by Australians, by people in the building industry. If these people are to face those sort of cutbacks on top of what has already been cut back out of the Hayden Budget of 1975 things must worsen. It is natural therefore that business will not invest and the people will not go out and buy. I think the Prime Minister has been told by the Treasury to stop painting pictures of gloom and talking of cutbacks in government expenditure and to start, as I said before, jawboning up the economy. He is surprised and disappointed that people are not rushing out and spending every cent they have. I am not surprised after the talk from the Government over the last few months since it came to office. I would Uke to quote from an article that appeared rn the Australian Financial Review on 23 April written by Christopher Jay, a very prominent writer on economic matters. It is headed: East coast building may face prolonged recession. The article states: In its relentless determination to allow no relaxation hardline anti-inflation approach, the Federal Government now looks like forcing the east coast building and construction industry into a prolonged recession. Figures on major construction projects in Australia in March, prepared by industrial economists John Jackson and Associates, confirm that the slight upturn suggested in the December quarter of 1975 has been dissipated. In addition, the April bulletin of the Building Industry Advisory Council of New South Wales confirms a continuing drop in building industry employment, work done and new approvals, as shown on the accompanying graph. Further on the article states: The non-housing sector has usually accounted for 60 per cent of the total building work in New South Wales with Government work usually accounting for about 15 per cent of the total. But with the various ministries in Canberra perfectly well aware of the severe problems uon should be shifted to the unnecessarily severe line being enforced to debar assistance to construction. 'Whilst a floor seems to have been reached to the downturn in building and construction in view of the relative stability of commencements in the past 6 months, the fact remains that the intake of new work for the March quarter, 1976, is down 39.7 per cent in real terms compared with 1974 and this indicates the magnitude of the current underutilisation of resources . . . 'The request for aid put forward by the various organisations in the industry and rejected by Cabinet on April 13, has been well documented in the national Press . . . The need to axe unproductive expenditure is obvious and should have been apparent to the previous Government. But rejection of the application for special aid ignores the differentiation between capital investment and current expenditure. It fails to recognise that building and construction goes much deeper than its direct contribution of about 8.6 per cent to the gross domestic product, and that there will be a multiplier effect in reverse throughout the various supply industnes.' I condemn this Government for not making any attempt at all to provide unemployment relief funds. We do not even have the awful schemes that existed under the MCMahon Government such as those involving painting, clearing fire traUs and mowing lawns, the benefits of which disappeared altogether after rain. We know the Government's hatred of the Regional Employment Development scheme because it was a Labor initiative but it provided an amazing amount of work for a large number of people. In my own area some 850 people had jobs under this scheme.",32
72,Mr BAILLIEU,UNEMPLOYMENT,Why did you stop it?,33
73,Mr COHEN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"There is a dignity about work that the honourable member for La Trobe ought to appreciate. We slowed it down; but I believe that at this time, with the present rate of unemployment, there would have been moves to reintroduce it. There is a need once again to provide unemployment relief, particularly in the areas of in its high unemployment, such as the area I represent, Wollongong, Newcastle and other parts of the State, as well as in the rural areas in which there is high unemployment. Nothing is being done by this Government and nothing is being done by the States. I think the Government stands condemned.",33
74,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,33
75,Mr MCLEAY,UNEMPLOYMENT,"In thefirstplace the Government rejects this proposition out of hand. In the second place the Government rejects the assertion by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) that honourable members on in the building industry, attenthis side of the House initiated the use of the expression 'dole bludgers'. If he can find for me any evidence to show that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) or anybody else on the Government side of the chamber initiated the use of that expression I will offer him some hospitaUty in some other place. We acknowledge that there has been a downturn in the building and construction industry and that there is unemployment in the industry. There is unemployment in almost every industry in this country. We acknowledge also that it is worse in New South Wales than in any of the other States. But let us make quite sure that we know, once and for all, who is responsible for this posiuon. There is no way in the world that anyone in his right mind can possibly pin the blame for that onto us. After all, the 3 years that the Australian Labor Party was in office were probably three of the greatest wrecking years since Federadon. The downturn in the building and construction industry relates directly back to the end of 1973, 1974 and last year. There were boom conditions. Associated with those boom conditions there was a series, and still is a series, of quite irresponsible industrial disputes. One must give some considerauon to those disputes, which force up prices and force people out of work. The power struggles between the Gallaghers, the Mundeys and the Clancys of this world are where a lot of the unemployment has been created. The leaders of some of the unions actually have been pricing their own members out of work. Let us not skate over the real facts of this issue. I have in front of me some figures concerning this matter. In fact, one of the surveys that honourable gentleman mentioned confirmed that over $600m of private investment in this field is being deferred right now. Private investmonwealth ment is what we want to get going in order to this country back onto its feet. Why is that vate investment not going ahead? The reason is perfectly obvious. People who have money to the invest are not going to invest it in an industry which there is no idea of how long it is going take to build a particular building or what going to cost at the end to do so, if in fact any end to it. It is really quiteridiculousfor the Australian Labor Party to try to blame the present Government for the current situation when it has been in office for only 4 or 5 months. Let me take the amount of office buUding as an figures. example. The value of office accommodation buUt by the private sector as at June 1969 was $ 11 lm. In 1973, which was the beginning of boom period, the spending in this area rose $403m. That was not simply the result of inflafigures tion. There was real investment in office accomrose modation in Australia in those years. A great deal of it, as the honourable gentleman knows, was in the city of Sydney. I suspect-in fact, think it is as plain as the nose on my face-tha there was too much investment in office accommodation in those years. It is going to take another year or so for the avaUable office accomvate modation to be mopped up. One of the prophas ositions put forward by the Deputy Leader of Opposition (Mr Uren) as a solution to the probin lems is that this Government-h e would have done this if the Australian Labor Party had been in office-shoul d encourage the buUding of more office accommodation to keep the construction industry going. How ridiculous can one be? At this moment one can lease any quantity of office accommodation one wishes in Sydney and Melbourne, and to a lesser degree in Adelaide and Brisbane, at $6 a square foot. The office accommodation that the Opposition wants to be built would cost $15 a square foot. That is an example of the hairy way in which the Opposition thinks about the construction industry. As I have said, the Government acknowledges that the position is worse in New South Wales than anywhere else. I would like to take up the point that the honourable gentleman first discussed-the one about unemployment. The position is that in February the actual number of registered unemployed fell by 40 200 to 303 000. After seasonal adjustment the number of unemployed declined by 2700 to 254 000. The number of unemployed, excluding school-leavers, on a seasonally the adjusted basis fell by 6700 to 231 000.1 direct the attention of the honourable gentleman and the House to the figures released by the ComEmployment Service. I am sure that get we all have access to the same sets of figures. priDealing with New South Wales alone, the figures show that in September oflast year, when Labor Party was in office, the total number of in unemployed was 122 606 or 5.5 per cent of the to work force. The Februaryfigures-the latest set it is of figures I couldfind-show that the total there is number of unemployed fell to 107 911.",33
76,Mr COHEN,UNEMPLOYMENT,What about the March figures?,34
77,Mr MCLEAY,UNEMPLOYMENT,I am talking about the figures to which I have access and which are up to date.,34
78,Mr COHEN,UNEMPLOYMENT,We will give you the March,34
79,Mr MCLEAY,UNEMPLOYMENT,"We will have a look at those the directly. The honourable gentleman mentioned to also the unfilled vacancies. According to the I have before me, the unfilled vacancies from just over 9000 in September to over 11 000 at the end of February. So there is at least a trend in the right direction. No one is going to I say that the unemployment position will go away t suddenly, because obviously it will not. Dealing with the private sector, I would like to enlarge upon the point I have made about priinvestment. The private sector traditionally commissioned about two-thirds of all the the building and construction work done, although the years about which we have been talking thefigurewas almost three-quarters. Let us look at the position concerning the building industry in all sections except the civil engineering section. One of our problems is that statistical information is not readUy avaUable. I presume that both sides of this House are in agreement on that point. In fact the figures in this respect very often are 9 months late and by the time a government has taken some action to correct a problem the problem has gone or is infinitely worse. The total buUding industry in all sections except the civU engineering section represents about 10 per cent of the gross national produa. Of the 386 000 people employed in the buUding industry when it is at full capacity, 17 450-odd were unemployed in January of this year. That means that 4 per cent of the work force in the buUding industry was unemployed at that stage. That is fractionally above the national average. As we all know, a reduction of $ 137m in program of Commonwealth projects has been announced. That in fact has not been the drastic reduction in the work load that industry leaders and the sort of media coverage that we have heard quoted today suggest. Of the $ 137m in ferred projects, one job alone, which was to be Sydney, was to the value of $47m. That takes great big lump out of the total amount of the projects deferred. Only a very small amount that $ 137m could have been spent this financial year-somethin g Uke $6m. In fact, when the figures are determined at the end of this financial year it will be found that, in spite of the ments and the so-called Government cutbacks and Hayden cutbacks that the honourable gentleman mendoned, an amount of $7.5m more than anticipated has been spent.",34
80,Mr COHEN,UNEMPLOYMENT,So you are spending more than did.,35
81,Mr MCLEAY,UNEMPLOYMENT,"We have been stuck with an talked about. awful lot of problems. It is a great shame that we did not get into office about 12 months earUer. As I have said, we acknowledge that there has been a downturn in the mdustry. We were warning then Government about that 2 years ago, as were industry leaders throughout the country, archivided tects and engineers. The Labor Government did not seem to understand the long lead times that are involved in the construction industry, certainly in the non-residential side of the struction industry. After one decides to buUd something one has to do 12 months of planning before letting the job go to tender. So most the reasonably sized jobs can be expected to take years and up to 6 years to complete. Let us face it, although the building and construction indusbudgeted try is in severe difficulties it is not the only industry that is in trouble. What about the beef industry, the fruit industry, the dairy industry and the shipbuUding industry? It is easier to find an industry that is not in trouble. I suggest to the honourable member for Robertson that what we should do is to acknowledge that there is a problem in the building and construction industry but let us put the blame fairly and squarely where it belongs, and that is on the people who sit on the Opposition benches. I can remember prior to the 1972 election the Leader of the Labor Party, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr E. G. Whitlam) promising in his poUcy speech to reduce interest rates. What happened? He increased interest rates by 50 per cent.",35
82,Mr COHEN,UNEMPLOYMENT,So have you.,35
83,Mr MCLEAY,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Not by 50 per cent. In fact they the have been reduced. The Leader of the Labor Party promised to reduce the cost of a house by from $2,000 to $6,000. Everybody knows that the cost of a house since that time has almost doubled. It has certainly doubled in New South deWales which is the particular area under disin cussion at the moment. It is the policies of the a former Government that have put us in our present position. There has been an expansion in of public spending. Converting expenditure in the last 3 months of last year to an annual basis, 40 per cent of the gross domestic product was taken up in public spending, and that is a situation that deferwe wish to reverse. The previous Government went flat out on the pace-setter principle in increasing the size of the Public Service and introducing maternity leave and paternity leave. They are all, perhaps, desirable things but someone has to pay. Unemployment benefits were we increased. Certainly we need all these items which the honourable member for Robertson",35
84,Mr COHEN,UNEMPLOYMENT,I did not mention them.,35
85,Mr MCLEAY,UNEMPLOYMENT,"You mentioned the retraining the scheme and the Regional Employment Development scheme. They are all great schemes prothe country can afford them. We say that the country cannot afford them. This is an area in which we are cutting back expenditure. The Opand position seems to have a phUosophy that the connon-workers should be paid as much as the workers. The only area in which the Opposition cut down expenditure when it was in office was in area of defence, to its eternal discredit. It is 3 true that the Hayden Budget did attempt to introduce some cutbacks but the then Treasurer for a deficit of nearly $3,000m. In spite of the fact that we have applied economies and prevented waste and saved an amount of $360m, as everybody knows the deficit at this moment is $5,000m. It would be not impossible-bu t I think unlikely-that the deficit could have been double what the Labor Adrninistration expected. I wonder-and I ask the honourable member for Robertson-wha t the Budget deficit would have been if the Labor Party had got those 21 Bills through the Senate. We would have been headed for a banana republic inflation situation. We take the view that inflation is the No. 1 enemy. It is absolutely fundamental to our cause that we reduce inflation by cutting down public spending and waste, restoring confidence in private sector of the economy and not putting taxes. These are the only ways in which we can do this. We do make the point that we cannot do it alone. We need the support of the States. We need the support of other authorities and we need the support of those who lead the work increase. force. The combined public spending of the States and their authorities is greater than the spending of the Commonwealth Government. very, We make a plea to the States to do the same thing as we in government are doing, that is, ting back waste. We make a plea to the leaders the trade union movement to show restraint demands for wage increases. Everytimewages for employees in a particular union go up other people are put out of work. This is the area in which we need co-operation. The Government maintains that we have given a responsible lead in these matters. We have frozen the Umit on size of the PubUc Service. In my own DepartIndustrial ment there has already been a reduction of about 500 people. We have not retrenched anybody. People have retired and not been replaced. Every penny that is spent in every department today is looked at very carefully. Let me consider the position of my own State of South Australia. Eighty per cent of the pubUc spending by the South Australian Government involves day labour. Nobody in South Australia, includmg the honourable member for Port throughout Adelaide (Mr Young), who is smUing and nodwer ding apparently in agreement, knows what it costs for public works. Nobody knows what it cost to put up that jetty at Port Lincoln because the work was done by day labour and there pubUc accountabUity.",35
86,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT, is happening Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,36
87,Mr LES JOHNSON,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The obsession honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) with should be congratulated on bringing to the attenverting tion of this House as a matter of urgency the deteriorating state of the construction industry and in particular the very unfortunate situation that prevaUs in the State of New South Wales. There is very Uttle doubt about the fact that the election date in New South Wales was set in consideration of several matters. One was that the election had to take place before the next federal Budget was brought down and another was that it had to take place before the secret report on the construction industry became public. The fact is-and I have this on the best of authoritythat the Government holds a confidential report about the state of the industry. The report, comthe prising 150 pages was prepared by the Departup ment of Employment and Industrial Relations and is extremely comprehensive in its analysis. It says in effect that unemployment will prevail in this country at a level of about 300 000 until the month of June 1976 after which it will steadfastly So we have confronting us in Australia today a very serious situation and it is at a time when the Cabinet has rejected a recommendacuttion by the Minister for Environment, Housing of and Community Development (Senator in Greenwood) that a rescue operation should be invoked to do something not just about the construction industry and the housing industry but about aU the other industries that rely upon those primary industries. So I believe it is extremely significant that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm the Fraser) and the Mmister for Employment and Relations (Mr Street) have so far refused to comment on this secret report. There is no question that if that report were released before next Saturday's election in New South Wales it would have a very significant effect upon the result of the election. The fact of the matter is that we have listened to the Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay) who heard from the honourable member for Robertson a detailed account of the deteriorating employment position especially in New South Wales and Australia as a whole. His simple ansto this is that there is trouble in every industry. All industries are in trouble, he says, but unfortunately the industry for which he is responsible is getting the same indifferent treatis no ment as all the others are receiving. What has happened in this country and what now is to a very large degree the result of this Government's laissez-faire approach, its uncaring attitude because it has this with reducing deficits. It is concerned the curtaUment of public spending. It is difunds away from the construction industry to Commonwealth loans by raising interest rates to 10Vi per cent thus attracting something like $757m which would otherwise be available to the public sector of the economy which in turn would stimulate the industry. It is this Government which has reduced the money supply from 20 per cent to 12 per cent. It is this Government and, indeed, the Minister for Construction who are responsible for the deferment of 250 government contracts valued at about $137m. It is this Government which has curtailed the allocation of funds for public housing through the State housing authorities. Whereas the funds made available in 1974-75 for housing commission activity were $385m, the allocation has been reduced to $364m in the current year. The honourable gentleman might say that that is a product of the former Government's budgeting arrangments, but he omitted to say that that Government also held in hand an additional SlOOm to stimulate pubhc housing if it became necessary. It is this Government which has destroyed confidence by attacking the 6.4 per cent national wage increase. It is this Government which has undermined the concept of indexation. It is this Government which has mutilated the concept of tax deductibiUty of mortgage interest rates. Does anyone believe that buUders will be encouraged to buUd houses for people when the Government has already announced its intention to take away from hundreds of thousands of home owners the benefit of tax deductibUity of mortgage interest rates? The Australian people do not know yet that many of them are going to lose $6 to $8 a week because of the Government's decision to restrict this scheme to people who are buying theu first house, and then for only the first 5 years of purchase. So the predominance of people-peopl e rearing young families and incurring famUy costs- are going to lose the benefit. Is that an additive, a stimulus to the housing program? One has good reason to doubt it. It is this Government which has put the kibosh on the Regional Employment and Development program which under the Labor Government was running at the rate of $135m. That labour intensive scheme took up the slack in unemployby ment and caused unemployment figures to be lower than they otherwise would have been. It this Government which has shown a declining interest in the development of growth centres. It is this Government which has cut the Australian Government's $150ni per annum program for sewerage in Australia, a program which certainly has a great deal to do with the buoyancy of construction industry. It is this Government cern, which has abolished the Australian Housing tive Corporation, which received a budget of $29m and which was to be a catalyst for stimulating the mdustry wherever it appeared that that stimulation was required. As the Minister for Construction, who is sitting at the table, must readUy acknowledge, this Government has no office buUding program, despite the fact that something like $16m a year is being expended on the leasing of offices for Public Service purposes. There are many other matters for which the present Government has to bear responsibility. The buUding society liquidity crisis has a great deal to do with the Government's monetary policy and the drawing off of available investment into the Commonwealth loans area. This Government has to take responsibility for retarding the Darwin reconstruction program by some $52m. It is this Government which has to bear responsibiUty for the cut of $31m in the budget of the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development. Where is the area improvement program, which in terms of the last Budget amounted to some $17m? It has been another casualty under the Fraser Government. Where is the enthusiasm and the continued support for the program to assist local government, which in Labor's last year in office ran to an amount of $79m? No matter in what direction we look we find that the Government has failed to take any positive action, and in fact has initiated actions which are extremely damaging, extremely discouraging, to the Australian investor, be he an investor in the heavy construction area or in the housing area. The Minister for Construction, who proceded me in this debate, obviously does not know much about employmentfigures.He could find only the Februaryfigures,but let me tell him that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) has made availablefiguresas late as 9 April, and those figures are readily avaUable in the Parliamentary Library. The effect of them is that there are 278 010 registered unemployed in Australia, or 4:6 per cent of the estimated labour force. In seasonally adjusted terms, unemployment increased over the month 20 947. Unfilled vacancies fell by 8036, and more than half the decline in actual terms ocis curred in the State of New South Wales. AU the avaUablefiguresshow that New South Wales is leading this trend to disaster, and there does not appear to be one solitary redeeming feature in the policy of the present New South Wales Government, led by Sir Eric Willis. That the Government has not shown one skerrick of conone bit of indication that one solitary initiais to be taken to cope with the present crisis.",36
88,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,38
89,Mr CADMAN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The House is debating a matter of public importance in terms identical, almost to the letter, to a matter that was debated in this House 3 weeks ago. The Opposition has raised the matter again on this day, suspect, purely because an election is to be held shortly in New South Wales. It is regrettable that the Opposition has failed to advance any new arguments or any additional facts. It has had 3 weeks to work on a proposal that it tried to hatch up 3 weeks ago, and has produced no more facts, no more figures, no more indication of real concern for people who are unemployed, for people who are trying to build homes, or for the building and construction industry of this nation. Instead the Opposition has homed in on what it considers to be a politically ripe area. I am sure that the people of New South Wales and of the nation will understand that the presentations of facts and figures, so called, on the area improvement program, funds to local government, and all those sorts of arguments have nothing to do with the topic under debate and nothing to do with the Government's programs. The Government's programs will continue to improve and to provide for the people of this nation, particularly the people of New South Wales, a better way of Ufe, a way of Ufe that they themselves can control, a way of Ufe that will not be directed from Canberra, a way of life that will allow them to exercise their freedom and the democratic right that all thinking people value. That democratic right will be demonstrated in the forthcoming election in New South Wales, when the WUUs Government will be returned with an outstanding majority. But let us go back through some of the facts. WhUst honourable members on the other side of the House are fairly long in cooking up motions to bring before the House, they are very short on historical facts and mformation related to the very motions that they put forward. Let us go back through history and have a look at the high level of construction in the buUding industry, the high levels of employment, maintained by a Liberal-National Country Party Government over a long period oftime.Too late the people Australia recognised that they had made a misHousing take in their decision in 1972. In fact, it took them only 3 years to decide to reverse that cision in the most massive way. The high levels of construction, the high levels of provision home ownership, the high levels of employment in this nation stand as a record and a tribute to changeprevious Liberal-National Country Party Governments. Let us consider inflation, which stood at 4 per cent and was decreasing in 1974. When Labor went out of office after its brief period of 3 years in government it had managed to lift inflation to 18 per cent-somethin g of a record. In the period it was in office the Labor Party managed to double, almost treble, unemI ployment. It is a crime and a shame that the Party which claims that it acts and speaks for the workers was so dismal in its performance in the very areas where it claimed that it had policies to assist the average individual in the nation. Look at interest rates. Anybody considering home ownership and the interest rate levels would have to look at the Labor Party's record when it was in Government. The then Government quickly reversed the situation where the average working person could purchase his own home, could save and plan and put aside a deposit and know that he could cover the interest rates and the repayments on his own home, to where we became a nation of renters, or of people who could not participate in the purchase of their own property or their own home. Then with the increase in these interest rates we saw a growing demand for welfare housing. People could not bridge the deposit gap. They found then, and they find now, that unless they earn over $200 a week they cannot pay off their own home. Interest rates are too high; they are declining. But, goodness gracious me, the honourable member who had the hide to raise this matter in the House today was a supporter of the Labor Government that brought about this very situation. It would seem that the old saw that applies to rural properties applies to government also. It is said in the country that it takes 3 generations for a famUy to buUd a property and to lose a property. But it takes a very brief period for that final stage of the loss of a property. What the Labor Party did in its period of office was to destroy the work of generations of saving and application to the job exercised by previous governments. Now honourable members opposite come into the House claiming that the present Government is the cause of all the problems that they themselves created. I should Uke to bring before the House a state of ment made, I think, by the previous Minister for but two; it may even have been further back than that, because the Minister did not last deall that long. But in September 1974, the then Minister for Housing, the honourable member for for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) said: For some time. I have been hoping that we could make this This is in regard to the savings bank regulation changeswhich is very imponant, because its effects are permanent and long term. That was before an absolute disaster set into the building industry and the home ownership propAustralia osition in this nation. The then Minister said he was very pleased and very sure that it would have a great effect in the building industry but said that we had to wait until the inflationary pressures on building resources which had been plaguing the industry for so long began to ish. That is an incredible statement made by Minister responsible for the housing industry, incredible statement for a responsible person to making. make right at the very time when it was most difficult, and increasingly difficult, for people purchase their own homes. I notice that shadow Minister at that time,now the Minister for Construction (Mr MCLeay), who is at the table, made a comment in relation ment by the then Minister for Housing. He was most caustic in his comment and I think very sucBanking cinctly and very importandy hit at the situation. proportion He said: The housing and economic situation in Austraha has reached a crisis. Indeed it has. Things are not good today, they are getting better. The cost of building materials and the cost to the average person buying a block of land are declining. They not going ahead with the rate of inflation.",38
90,Mr BRYANT,UNEMPLOYMENT,You put them up here in Canberra deliberately.,39
91,Mr CADMAN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"We have introduced a home osition loan savings program that the honourable memosition put ber's Party deigned to oppose. introduced some sort of scheme that allowed falsity of the claimsI made anybody purchasing a home to involve selves in. Commendable as the previous Governpoint of view, an unthinking pointan ment's program may have been, ours is more commendable. It allows the building industry to move forward; but more importantly it allows young people and young home builders to ticipate in the purchase of their block of land and to buy their block of land. I am sure Uving in New South Wales will appreciate this to a far greater extent when they reaUse that they will have a continuing Liberal Government that State to provide them with the security and a base from which they can continue to plan ahead April 1976and eventuaUy own their own homes. Honourable members opposite need to become with the facts. They had long enough in sition to become aware of the facts. They had long enough in government to become aware of the facts, but we get continuing sunshine talk from them about how good their Government was and how disastrous this Government has been in the short period that we have had the responsibUity of government. I am afraid that that sort of attitude is not convincing to the people of and I am sure it wiU not be bought by that the people of New South Wales, who have heard that talk for 3 years. What the people of New he South Wales are saying now is: 'We have heard that talk for 3 years. We were fooled twice; we will never be fooled again'. I think that the diminLeader of the Opposition in New South Wales a could take a leaf out of the Premier's book and an be more responsible in the promises he is I should like to recount to the House some of to the statements by the previous Government. the They so resemble the promises being heard today. In February 1975 the then Treasurer, in talking about the buUding mdustry and the home to that statebuUding industry, said: In early September 1974 the Government amended the (Savings Banks) Regulations to permit a greater of savings banks' funds to be invested in housing and at the same time the savings banks were requested to increase their rate of lending for housing. Following that, the Government legislated in December to provide SISOm to savings banks . . . but Now that was an incredible decision- a supposed stimulus to the home buying capacity and of home buUding capacity of the nation. It was abare solute disaster. The figures continued to go down. It was a disaster, and it got worse until December last year. January was bad, but I could see a definite improvement in thefigures.I know that the House will be aware that the propby those opposite is a fallacious propdesigned to influence voters in New His Government South Wales, who, know, wiU recognise the by those opposite. themTheirs is a narrow point of view, unconcerned of view.",39

93,Mr HURFORD,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) demonstrated in his statement of 1 AprU on foreign investment that at least in their attitude to foreign investment the Liberal and National Country Parties have come some way since the dark days prior to 1972. It is pleasing to note that in form, if not in intention, the present Government's policy has acknowledged the position of responsibiUty in this field taken by the Australian Labor Government. Most of our clothes have been taken over and are being worn second hand. However the position has not been reached where we could be said to have arrived at a bi-partisan attitude towards foreign investment in Australia. In fact wide gulfs still separate the Opposition and the Government in some vital aspects of this subject. Let me, before exploring these differences in depth, comment on specific parts of the Treasurer's statement. At the beginning of his statement the Treasurer ascribes the cause for the fall in the total inflow of foreign capital during the years 1972-75 to 'confusion in the minds of investors about the circumstances in which they could opned erate in Australia'. This is another example the simpUstic explanations this Government has for the problems which have confronted this country, and indeed the rest of the industrialised world, in recent years. Itrivals,for lack of undertralian standing and of depth of analysis, the Governgains ment's diagnosis that Budget deficits are the cause of our joint problems of inflation and cession. We heard this thesis repeated in quesmeasure tiontimetoday in an attack on me in answer to a question by the Treasurer. I stand, incidentally, by every word I have said on this subject deficits. It seems that this Government is now coming worried at its absurd attitudes to the explanation. deficit in atimeof unemployment. Let us examine some of the real reasons for the decline in the flow of foreign capital in recent years, if only in order to allow future debate on this important topic to take place on a more informed level. The Treasurer, in his talk on foreign private capital, has made no attempt to differentiate between various types of private capital. He gives the impression that all private capital entering this country, especially 1972, was of a stable variety having as its object investment in the establishment of productive, profitable enterprises in our country. But this not so. As well as stable capital there was that which has been roughly branded as hot money, namely less stable capital looking for quick returns in the stock and share market, real estate or in other booming sectors. A subclearly stantial portion of this type of capital obviously would have entered the country with the express purpose of gaining from inevitable exchange rate changes. The rest of the world, and most of Australia, had known for many years that the Country Party taU wagging the Liberal Party dog had ensured that Australia's currency had been drastically undervalued. Many empty high rise city office block constructions stood as massive and mute reminders of this flow of hot capital and of the Liberal-Country Party Government's misguided policies prior to that Government losing office in 1972. The high rate of this short term capital inflow resulted in intense speculation in real estate and the resultant price spirals in that sector of our economy. Obviously, when the Labor Party took office in 1972, the need for a realistic realignment of the Australian dollar had become of paramount importance, both in terms of diplomatic pressures from our major trading partners and cost pressures on the import consuming sectors of the domestic economy. The Labor Government took a responsible attitude to the problem and realigthe currency to a realistic level with revaluaof tions in December 1972 and September 1973. The speculators by this time had got what they wanted- a 12 per cent gain on the exchange rates, high rates of interest on funds lent to Ausbusinesses and, in some cases, vast capital fromrisesin property values. Having thus reaped their harvest they moved out to the next reprofitable pasture. Could this not to a large explain the fall in the inflow of foreign capital after 1972 rather than the petty political, posturing explanations of the Treasurer in the of statement we are debating this afternoon? Of becourse the explanation I have outlined is the real I bring these points before the House not as mere elements of debate but rather as a reminder that the topic of foreign investment is complex and the nature of various types of foreign capital is but one of these complexities. The simplistic view presented by the Treasurer in his statement as to the cause of recent falls in capital inflow must not be aUowed to cloud the real issues in the continuing debate on this topic of foreign investprior to ment in our country. I will now move on to actual policy implications of the Treasurer's statement which we of was the Opposition find of concern. On page 7 of the also Treasurer's statement he informs us that the Government's guidelines 'will place major emphasis on Australian participation in new projin ects but without preventing projects that are not against the national interest from proceeding'. I must admit that I would have found this assurance much more comforting if the projects not prevented from proceeding were clearly in the national interest rather than ones merely not against the national interest. This then is the crux of the Government's policy, the point from which we are to judge what the practical impUcations of the Government's form of words will be. It is no wonder that concern has been expressed by many who, like the Australian Labor Government, were perturbed by the extent of foreign domination of the Australian economy under the pre-1972 Liberal-Country Party regime. The Treasurer's words have all the appearance of setting the scene for an obvious out. Tbis Government, when previously in power, had hardly demonstrated a concern for a maximisation of Australian participation in new development projects. The consequences of the folly of its complete laissez - faire approach I outlined earlier. The Australian people have no decent track record upon which to judge this Government kindly. They have no reasons to assume the ideals spelt out by the Treasurer's words will be adhered to in practice. Is there any reason to assume that in the cold real world of intense special interest lobbying this promise of the Government will not go the way of many election promises it has been found inconvenient to keep? The Ust of broken election promises grows each day, each week in this Parliament. This Government's very preoccupation with the removal of substantial pubhc sector involseas vement in the development of the resources this country will only compound the problems it will have in adhering to its announced principles. vision While these guidelines, if adhered in many respects a reasonable approach to the there is nothing tobystop problem of foreign equity in Australian projects-the uranium guidelines are excepted in ects in the early planning stageand that wide statement. I have just made-the major working problem which will actually confront any new development project has virtually been ignored. It is covered in one page of the 22-page value document that the Treasurer issued. This probbring acourse lem is that of raising a sufficient amount of dompany. This estic capital to allow new projects to go ahead is not beyond and to conform with the guideUnes. In, as the ution to this problem. Treasurer would put it, the totality of the Ausple of the questions the traUan Labor Government's approach to probdoes not answer. It does not lems of developing Australia's vast natural concerning resources, due recognition was made of the probinvestment lems of raising domestic capital on the scale required. The Labor Government did not turn its back on a government's responsibUity regard. It envisaged a wide role for such instruments as the Ul-fated, as it happened, National Investment Fund and, indeed, the tralian Industry Development Corporation in ranging government-backed capital raisings and a direct role for government in uranium production. The present Government, however, has moved to restrict severely the role of government in developing Australia, yet it has failed to suggest a viable alternative source of development funding. It would appear clear that the Australian private capital market is capable of providing capital for but a small number of presently planned projects to go ahead under these guideUnes. This fact has been alluded to by many people recently, including the President of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association in his address to that body's recent annual conference. The Government must make its position clear. have WUl the faUure of the Australian capital market to marshal the necessary funds required for a new project to go ahead on a 50-50 basis simply constitute a case for bypassing the guidelines? If this is so, are these guidelines, therefore, under the Liberal-National Country Party Government, little more than a public relations exercise? The Treasurer really has a lot further to go than this statement in persuading us that he and the Government of which he is a member have a clear, comprehensive and workable policy on foreign investment which will ensure that Australian resources are not owned markedly overand we are not dancing to too great an of extent to someone else's tune. WhUe on this specific subject of capital proto, represent further Iclarification raise another point which requires the Government.

Surely it the wit of government tofinda solThis is just another examTreasurer's statement provide information in Australia. The Governmentforeign the real issues confronting must turn its energies towards policies which provide Australian capital or its guideUnes will be renin this dered nothing but empty words. As far as the technical aspects of the guidelines Ausare concerned, the Australian Labor Party of arcourse regrets the attitude the Government has taken to the development of Australia's uranium resources. My colleague the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who is the shadow Minister for Minerals and Energy, will explain our attitude to this question in greater depth later on in this debate. In fact, on examining the guideUnes in greater depth, one is left with the distinct impression that some changes have been made just for the sake of change. It would not seem that this has been done so that the present Government's attitudes, in the broader sense, did not reflect so closely those of the Labor Government. The apparent replacement of Labor's Foreign Investment Review Committee by what is virtually a parttimeboard appears to be one of these examples of mere windowdressing. In fact, a danger that the decision making process wiU be slowed down or even biased towards hasty development and profit taking because of the structure of the Board has arisen, in my view, in this move. What on earth do Mr Bede CaUaghan, CBE., and Sir William Pettingell, CBE, bring to this process that was not already present with the Foreign Investment Review Committee, apart from delay in decision making? I sum up by saying that the Australian Labor Party in no way rejects the notion that foreign investment has a large role to play in Australia's future development. The importance we placed on this role was spelt out in the statement made to this House by the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) on this subject on 24 September 1975. (Extension of time granted.) I thank the House for this opportunity to complete a speech on this important subject. The Austrahan Labor Party does recognise, however, that there are substantial problems to be overcome in arriving at a description of the most effective and beneficial role foreign investment will play. I have attempted to pomt out a few of these problems, especially those involved in raising sufficient capital locally. We need to harness the savings of Australians into worthwhUe directions. Further, the Australian Labor Party sees the role of government in Australia's future development being more than just one of a rulemaking overseer. The world is changing. Even Liberals and conservatives of the National Country Party have to getridof their ideological hang-ups and make sure that government enterprise plugs gaps which otherwise would not be filled. Labor sees joint participation between private and public sectors as one of the ways by which sufficient capital can be raised and the stake of Australians in their own country not further eroded. I believe also that there is a role for Government in marshalUng foreign investment capital which does not require equity security for its use. The concept of fixed interest loans from large overseas concerns, organised through governments or organised in other forms, is well worth pursuing. Now that the dust is settling from the hysteria dishonestly promoted by the present Government over the so-called loans affair, it can be seen that where foreign funds are needed for our further development it is far preferable that these should come in the form of loans rather than in the form of equity. We do not want so many decisions affecting the lives of Australians made in the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Japan or anywhere else outside Australia. We want those decisions made here in Australia, and that means that we want as much Australian equity as we can possibly achieve. The debate on this topic must be a continuing and informed one. The Opposition will not rest on its laurels after having convinced the Liberal and National Country Parties of their pre-1972 errors in this area but will attempt continually to raise what it sees as the problems of the future concerning the role of foreign investment in our country. I repeat: Australia is a developing country. We are not harnessing sufficient savings in this country for the necessary volume of investment. Furthermore, our foreign exchange reserves are not sufficient for all our future development needs; so inevitably there must and will be further foreign investment. The more of that investment which can come in the form of fixed interest loans the better; but it cannot and will not aU come in that form. So we must have guidelines. The Australian Labor Government charted the course. For the most part, our political opponents now in government are following our lead. But there are dangers that their actions wiU not conform to their words. There are dangers that this present laissez-faire government will not actively seek Australian savings for investment to minimise the need for overseas funds. In this speech I have raised some of these dangers.",39
94,Mr SHORT,UNEMPLOYMENT,"I believe that the subject of foreign investment in Australia is extremely important. I am only sorry, after listening to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), that it appears that the Opposition does not feel the same way. I welcome not only the detaUs of the statement by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in this House on 1 April but also the fact that it was made at all. In fact, it was the first substantive poucy statement on this subject to be the made in Parliament since the one made on 26 September 1972 by the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Lowe (Mr William MCMahon). Admittedly the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) when Prime Minister tabled in this House on 7 November 1973 the text of a policy statement on foreign investment which he had made in Tokyo on 29 October 1973; but he simply tabled it. In fact he had to follow his usual penchant for overseas travel in order to make the statement at all. He made it to a Japanese audience in Japan-th efirstdetailed statement of the Australian Labor Party's foreign investment pohcy after its election in 1972-and he made it only after a delay of 11 months. So much for the Labor Party's much vaunted ballyhoo about the importance of Parliament. So much for its ballyhoo about keeping the Australian people informed. Not only is the subject of foreign investment important; it also is one of the most misunderstood and one which arouses a great deal of emotionalism. Debate on the subject somehow seems to bring out the worse in many otherwise rational Australians. It brings out a trait phobia and jingoism that is not pleasant to see. Unfortunately we have witnessed this today in the speech by the honourable member for Adelaide. But even his speech paled by comparison with those of some ofhis colleagues when the Labor Party was in government. It is a great pity that in his speech today the honourable member for Adelaide touched only very briefly on the matters which are the real subject of the Treasurer's statement. For example, he talked about hot money. Hot money is essentially of a non-equity nature. It is equity investment with which the Treasurer's statement deals. The Opposition appears to be incapabe of recognising this fact. There can be no doubt at all that foreign companies operating in Australia have provided a major impetus to development over the past generation. Although on average only some 10 per cent of Australia's gross domestic capital formation over this period has been financed from overseas investment, this has been extremely important at the margin, in giving Australians access to a larger supply of goods and services than otherwise would have been avaUable and therefore faciUtating a more rapid rate of economic growth and a major broadening of our industrial base. The financial contribution of foreign investment has been a much greater proportion of total investment in the private sector than the figure of 10 per cent I have just mentioned. It has increased steadUy since the late 1950s and in the early 1970s reached 35 to 40 per cent. This investment has gone into a wide range of industries, initiaUy mainly into manufacturing and latterly into minerals-at least until the former Minister for Minerals and Energy, commonly known as 'the Strangler' applied the deathlock and strangled the minerals sector of this nation between 1973 and 1975. A major restriction on foreign equity investment in Australia in the foreseeable future would severely inhibit innovation and the growth of technology in Australia and would reduce our rate of economic growth and therefore the real standard of Uving of all Australians to below what it otherwise would be. Nevertheless, it is clear that most Australians are concerned, for various reasons, about uncontrolled further increases in foreign ownership and control of Australian resources. Since the late 1960s successive governments have taken various steps to restrict the further growth of such foreign ownership and control. Let it not be forgotten-the . of xenohonourable member for Adelaide appears to have forgotten it-that it was the Gorton and MCMahon Governments that first acted on this, not the Whitlam Government. For example, it was the MCMahon Government which introduced legislation to control foreign takeovers and which commissioned the Treasury to prepare a detaUed analysis of overseas investment in Australia which was pubUshed in May 1972 and which formed the basis for much further poUcy formulation in this area. The Whitlam Government further developed the policy and extended it more fully to cover foreign investment other than by way of takeovers; but, as was the case with so many other policy initiatives of that Government, it bungled this policy. As I said earUer, it took 11 months after reaching government to produce a statement and all that statement did was to confuse the issue and to lead to a great deal of uncertainty amongst foreign investors. As a result, and coupled with the Whitlam Government's determined efforts to wreck the Australian economy via the inflation route, overseas confidence in Australia as a stable and worthwhUe place to invest crashed to its lowest ever ebb. Nowhere was this more important and apparent than in the minerals sector which not only had the Labor Government to contend with but also was faced with a Minister who had grandiose pipe dreams for mineral development by the pubtic sector and who bullied the industry and refused to enter into any meaningful dialogue with it. He not only caused immeasurable damage to foreign mining comagain. panies but also he did much the same to Austhe trahan companies, particularly eral exploration area. Not only that, the Minister refused to enter into discussions with his State counterparts and was largely responsible for major disruption in Commonwealth-State relawe tions which occurred between 1973 and 1975. It is sometimes said that the policy of the eral and National Country Parties towards ditions foreign investment is little different frcm that the Whitlam Government. It is true that the guidelines are similar. But there ends because whereas the Labor Party's policy was hostile and negative in its approach to foreign investors the whole psychology and philosophy of the present Government's pohcy is positive and recognises the need for continuing foreign investment but on terms and conditions acceptable to the Australian community. As the Treasurer said in his 1 April statement, the previous Government was conscious of the costs foreign investment but was reluctant to acknowledge its beneiits. This shows through very indeed on a reading of the Whidam Governforeign ment's Tokyo statement of October 1973 and many subsequent statements which tried unsucTreasurer cessfully to unravel the confusion which statement caused. Foreign investors in Austraha now know much Parties more clearly where they stand under Labor. This is of the utmost importance. a major legacy of the Uncertainty breeds a lack of confidence. A lack of confidence breeds low levels of investment. Low levels of investment lead to lower proGovernment duction which damages the standard of Uving of all Australians. The estabUshment of the Foreign Investment Review Board will also be an imporvast tant step forward. This proposal involves leading businessmen in advising on a continuing basis foreign investment matters. The Board should contribute to greater understanding and knowlpercentages edge of government thinking and action in this area. The guideUnes for the acceptable degree foreign equity in mineral projects are clear, they have a desirable degree offlexibUity.I ticularly welcome the statement by the Treasurer that if the 50 per cent local equity sought in mineral projects cannot be obtained the project will not on that account be prevented from ceeding. This is a clear and unequivocal underTreasurer taking. In this it represents a major change from the Whitlam Government's obfuscation on this issue. It also marks one of the major differences between this Government and the former return Government. We want to get the economy In this we are not going to be hung up on same foreign bogy-man shibboleths of the those in the minWhitlam Government. The Treasurer's statement is a clear indication the to foreign investors that we welcome them; that recognise their importance to the future development of Australia; but that at the same time we want genuine participation between Libforeign and local investors on terms and conthat are clearly defined and that take full of account of the overall interests of aU Australians. many of I have much pleasure in endorsing the the similarity Treasurer's statement.",42
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT," Before I call the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) might I just give a Uttle bit of advice to the House. It is not in order in this House for any honourable member to refer to another honourable member by words such as 'the bruiser' or 'the strangler'. The form in this House is to refer of to any honourable member by his electorate. clearly Mr KEATING (Blaxland) (4.39)-The investment policies of the Liberalthe Country Party Government announced by the (Mr Lynch) are vindication of the that Labor Government's poUcies which were so much abused by the Liberal-National Country when in Opposition. Imitation is the sinthan they ever did Labor Partyof cerest form flatteryand we in the Australian can now point to these guideUnes as Labor Administration. The guideUnes represent a major shift by the from its pre-1972 attitudes where it considered that selling off the farm was the only way Austraha could industrialise and develop its resources. Following the lead given by Labor in the past 3 years, the Liberal-National on Country parties have now for thefirsttimeas part of their policy stipulated minimum specific of Australian equity in development projects. This poUcy has already caused some rumblings in the board rooms of Martin Place of and Collins Street and already a campaign to yet denigrate the Minister for National Resources parand Minister for Overseas Trade (Mr Anthony) is under way. He is being accused of being the new architect of the new policy. But the fact of the matter is that it was a Cabinet decision and the proPrime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the are just as responsible for its formulation and implementation. Because of the discontent within industry, the question now is how long before the pressure on Cabinet forces a in substance if not in form to the old going laissez-faire days of pre-1972? The major shift in policy as announced by the Treasurer is in the area of uranium mining and mineral exploration and production. Under the Labor Government's guidelines of 1975 the 50 per cent equity in all new mining projects was mandatory. This minimum level had to be reached or the project would not be given the goahead. However, under the guidelines of the Liberal-National Country parties the minimum equity requirement is discretionary. The requirement need be met at the discretion of the Minister for National Resources. The practical effect of this discretion is that Australian companies, notorious in the past for failing to risk money in large development projects, will have little trouble convincing the Minister that the equity target cannot be met. Without the mandatory requirement as to equity, foreign companies do not have to go out and 'sell' a project to Australian investors, but can be content with only a minor testing of the market. Obviously locating partners in a massive resource investment is a complex and wearying task as the Labor Government experienced with the Redcliffs petrochemical complex and the Hail Creek coal project. But without the mandatory Australian equity percentage provision who is to judge what efforts a foreign or Australian company has made to secure investment capital before it reports to the Minister on its lack of success? Obviously for the highly attractive investment projects there would be a persuasion for a foreign company to run dead in its efforts to bring in Australian partners. If the Minister then exercises his discretion in favour of the project going ahead without the requisite amount of local capital, he will be hard pressed to object to the next request for approval. The spirit, if not the letter, of the policy will be flouted. As I have mentioned, the Minister for National Resources has already been under attack in the Press because of this policy. The Australian newspaper devoted a whole front page story on this matter in its issue of Wednesday, 14 AprU 1976. The newspaper just editorialised-thes e remarks were not attributable to anybody. It stated: Until the Government adopts a more flexible and open policy towards resources development, Mr Anthony will continue to attract criticism. So far the criticism ship and ministerial performance has been kept within Government circles. It is the administration of the policy that is crucial to its effectiveness. The Government must understand that it cannot steal the letter of the Labor Party policy for its own political kudos and then get away with not administering the poticy. The Opposition will expect the Minister for National Resources to make public the decisions he takes in respect of these equity requirements and the reasons for the decisions. In respect of uranium, the Government, Uke the Labor Government before it, has demanded a higher Australian equity than for other minerals. Because of its importance as an energy source in a world fast running out of cheap energy and because of its strategic and foreign policy implications the Labor Government stipulated that there should be 100 per cent Australian equity in aU new projects. Without explanation the Liberal-National Country Party Government has reduced the equity requirement to 75 per cent Australian equity for all projects not already at the production stage. All projects other than the joint Atomic Energy CommissionPeko-Wallsend project will be affected by this poUcy. But the Government gives no reason for its change or for lowering the equity requirement. This modification is aridiculousdeparture from the policy of Labor. Surely there can be no cogent argument why Australia should allow foreign companies and in some cases foreign governments, through such agencies as the Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi which is commonly referred to as ENI, to participate in the exploration and development of this strategic material. Australia already has the largest tonnage of uncommitted uramum in the western world and it is of the utmost importance that its development and sale be under the strictest supervision. This can be guaranteed only if Australians own it. The Labor Party's view is that as all title to uranium in the Northern Territory is vested in the Commonwealth under the terms of the Menzies 1952 Atomic Energy Act, then only a Commonwealth agency such as the Atomic Energy Commission should be allowed to explore for it in the Northern Territory and any new deposits would then have the 100 per cent Australian equity. Australian equity in the discoveries already made would be the subject of negotiation between the Australian Government and the company concerned. If the Government makes the distinction with uranium and requires 75 per cent local equity, on what basis does it make the distinction? The Labor Party opposes this distinction ofhis leaderstrongly and calls on the Government to adopt the 100 per cent equity principle that has operated for the past 3 years. The major flaw in the Liberal-Country Party's poUcy is that it provides no mechanism for raising large sums of capital to meet the Australian equity requirements. The Labor Government tried to remedy this problem by introducing Bill to establish a national investment fund. was rejected out of hand by the Liberal and Country parties. The Petroleum and Minerals Authority which had an investment budget of only $50m, and was therefore not in the big league of investors, was also painted by the Liberal-Country Party while in Opposition as some form of nationalisation monster. Nothing could have been further from the truth, as a reading of its objects would indicate. Before was declared unconstitutional on a technicality had already made some profitable and worthtal while investments to protect the national interest. So the Liberal-Country Party Government has the pious intent of increasing Australian equity resource projects, but not the mechanism to do it. The Treasurer talked about the Australian Industry Development Corporation. He said: The Government believes that the Australian Industry Development Corporation has an important role to play in helping to mobilise funds required by Australian companies and in helping to bring together efficient Australian enterprises in order to foster Australian equity in local tures of national importance. The AIDC, since it was established, has hardly Australia. been a great mobiliser of capital. How it is to pervalue form this task the Treasurer has not indicated. years Australia obviously needs a competent the entrepreneurial body in the resources field. Other countries have such instrumentalities to superAs vise and encourage national private investment in major development projects. Australia singularly lacking. The Liberal and Country ties as usual go against thetide.There is a great vacuum in this respect in Austraha. The private enterprise answer-the Resources Bank-ha s proved itself a lemon and unable to marshal large slabs of capital needed to establish Ausrestrictive tralian control of large resource projects. The other associated aspect of capital formaseas tion where the pohcy is not only vague but negliprojects gent is the question of domestic borrowing foreign companies in Australia. Referring to foreign controlled companies, the Treasurer said: We expect such companies to give full consideration possibilities of raising additional capital requirements through equity issues in Australia as an alternative to borrowing. . . . He said that he did not need to lay down any rules to guarantee this. How naive is this view. a foreign interest wants its investment in the paid-up capital of an Austrahan company to long reflect a certain percentage, that foreign investment- I mean by that off-shore capital-shoul d be reflected as near as possible the total capital requirements of the project; a otherwise all that Austraha is getting from some It types of foreign investment is management, not capital, and rarely any new technology that has not previously been used in Australia. If one looks at history in Australia one finds that major foreign investors with the preponderance of control of a company have raised large sums on the Austrahan capital and share market while the parent company's original capital contribution to the Australian subsidiary has been a it huge percentage of a comparatively small level it of original share capital compared with the capifunds required for the running and expansion of the project. The Fitzgerald Report of 1974, a conscientious and serious report that was shamein fully attacked and discounted by the coalition parties, demonstrates that in respect to the example of Hamersley Holdings in Western Australia, and I quote directly: Of the remarkable increase of $552m in Hamersley's capital expenditures in the 7 years ended December 1973, three-quarters was financed by the retained cash flow plus the premium share issues to the Australian public. The remaining venone-quarter was funded by additional borrowings. By far the greater part of the necessary finance was generated in While the Rio Tinto and Kaiser groups have not added to their original capital subscription of $45m, the of the gross assets in their control has quintupled in 7 while the ratio of term liabilities owing to creditors to value of gross assets has been halved, falling from 66 per cent to 33 per cent. technology in the extractive industries in Australia by and large has been developed by is Australian companies and Australian inpargenuity-in some repects Austraha leads the world-in many instances the only consequence of foreign investment has been a pile of headaches for the Government in dealing with such the problems as inter-company pricing agreements, franchises and double taxation agreements. Foreign investment must be made to mean the investment of adequate levels of overcapital for the operation and expansion of coupled with appreciable advantages in by respect of foreign market access in the improvement in Australian technology. Without the full benefit of these aspects, foreigners are doing us no favours in bringing a small amount to the of money to Australia for share capital, then borrowing the major balance of development money in Australia and using Australian techniques long established to bring such projects to the production stage. This kind of help we can If well do without. In the extractive industries where the returns are great and extend over a period the contribution of foreign investors percentage of must be a genuine one. in Another important implication of foreign investment where the Government's new policy is silent, is the question of permitting our tomers to invest in resource projects which either supply or are associated with our own industries. For instance, Japanese investment in the coal industry permits the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry effective access to the costing assessments and pricing policies of that industry. Could anyone believe, for instance, that the Government of Japan would allow, say, Theiss Holdings to buy a major share of Nippon Steel-apar t from the fact that Theiss could not afford it and indeed would not want it-bu t the example stands. Japan would not tolerate an Australian coal producer having access to the market, cost and pricing information of a Japanese steel manufacturer. Yet previous Liberal-Country Party governments have allowed companies such as Mitsui into consortiums in Australia in industries that supply Japan. The present policy announced by the Treasurer does not deal with this problem-in my view perhaps the most crucial aspect of all in relation to foreign investment and participation in Australia. If the Government does not privately plan some administration of this aspect, I would be grateful if the Treasurer or the for National Resources would let the Parliament know. My view on this aspect is not directed against Japan or any other country for any motive other than I have mentioned. I believe the proprietary of certain investment prerogaget tives-investment s that suit the Australian interest taking into account the nature of trade between Australia and the country of gin of the investment. For instance, considering the imbalance of trade with Japan in our favour, it would not worry me if the motor car companies of Japan completely dominated the vehicle ket in Australia, at the expense of General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd and the Ford Motor Co. of Austraha. If this meant that Australians held employment in an industry with avoid rationalised efficiency, then acceptable franchise agreements would help Australian exports as Government. efficiency made these products more export competitive. If multi-nationals are to dominate certain industries let us be selective about whose multi-nationals they are and where our economic interestties.Foreign investment can militate in favour of reductions in trade imbalances, but selectivity is crucial. Let us not show our mercial hand to the world while the world plays its hand close to the chest. It is time we grew up on this issue, and I hope the Government will take some cognisance of this view.",44
96,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT," Before I call the honourable member for Ryan, I remind cus- the House that it is the honourable member's maiden speech. I hope that members will extend their usual courtesies to him.",47
97,Mr MOORE,UNEMPLOYMENT," I thank the House for the opportunity of speaking in this debate on the Government's foreign investment policy. The statement by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) was by far the most significant on Austraha's financial future for more than 3 years. Since the Australian Labor Party won office in 1972 mining companies,financialinstitutions and overseas investors have lacked a clear understanding of what the Australian Government wanted. As the Treasurer said in his statement recently, this lack of direction led to misunderstandings, confusion and a marked drop in foreign investment in Australia. Now at last the potential investors in Australia's future around the world know where they stand and where Australia is going. The Treasurer's statement is timely for these reasons. This fall off in investment in our country produced a standstill in the whole thrust of economic development in Australia. Little new major development work has taken place since we were last in office, and Minister this is what has wrecked our economy. I come to Canberra from Queensland, a State that has an immense future,richin resources but in poor in investment funds. The State is eager to on with the job. My electors are looking to the Government to Uft Australia out of its the inherited economic stagnation, to get our oridevelopment program going and to ensure the living standards of aU Australians. They are looking to the Liberal Party because of its record over the previous 23 years in the field of econmaromic management. Labor had some noble ideas and wonderful dreams, even if they turned out to be daydreams and Arabian nightmares. With this m mind the Government must be wary and the same pitfaUs. The decUne in economic activity is not just one of lack of confidence in the The principal spur to risk taking, entrepreneurship and investment is profit. No person will have the incentive to go out and place his money in any project unless he is assured of our stable poltiical and industrial conditions and a comprofitable economic climate. Entrepreneurial spirit and new capital investment thrive on profits, whether they be foreign or domestic. It is the noble aspiration of all people to own their own house, farm or company. Indeed everyone should be encouraged to have a stake in his own future. However, today in Australia there is simply insufficient capital to meet the demands for development. It is because of this that I welcome the Treasurer's statement that the Government wishes to encourage foreign investment. For too long it has been a bogy, with the resultant decline in economic activity. It is my experience that once government guidelines have been clearly set out business will adjust to meet them. Commercial planning can then be carried out with some surety of the future. The rate of development is in no small measure beset by the management of the guidelines. It is in this context that the role of the Foreign Investment Review Board is crucial. One of the features of the Labor Administration was that the people who made the decisions in these delicate areas were largely pubhc servants with tittle knowledge of the market place. It is there that deals are made, promoted and financed. The members of the Board will be well aware of this and I am sure that they will approach their task with a sense of commercial reality. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) asked what contribution Mr Callaghan and Sir William Pettingell would make. I assume that they would have a very real concept of commercial reality. In many cases it will be necessary to be flexible with the 50 per cent rule. There wtil be a need for quick decisions once a broad framework has been established for decision making. I believe that it would be helpful to the Board and to the course of future development if some further consideration were given to the role of foreign protfolio investment. At present it is planned to take this into consideration when considering foreign ownership. The present definition would affect many well known Australian compames, such as Thiess Holdings Ltd. I have always looked at portfolio investment, from overseas, as a very useful extension of the local secondary capital market. Without it in many instances over the last 20 years Australian compames would not have been able to raise sufficient equity capital. Many portfolio investors are not interested in being able to vote their shares but merely to participate in future dividend and capital prospects. Despite moves by the associated stock exchanges to eliminate non-voting shares I believe that a case now exists for their restoration. It is both administratively feasible and it would be a great help to a large number of well known Australian companies to participate in the future development. This brings me to the Australian capital market. As the Treasurer rightly pointed out, it is of limited size. Savings have many competing investment opportunities, not the least of which are government savings bonds. With rising interest rates and inflation, major savings managers have been put under increasing pressure to improve their returns. In many cases funds have been split between 2 managers to give a sense of performance competition. New funds developed by life assurance companies total $ 1,400m in one year. Of this, $440m is subscribed to government securities. Of the remainder, 10 per cent or $100m to $150m would be available for development projects, whether equity or debt. When it is considered that this is one of the major areas of savings in Australia it is not hard to see the need for overseas funds. One major project would use all existing funds in any one year. On past performance many fund managers will be reluctant to commit large sums of money over a period of time to a number of development projects. This record has been mixed. Robe River, North Australian Development Corporation, and Greenvale are just some of the development projects that are yet to show any return. There have been a number of investments in the rural sector which have been a total loss. Nationalism and money seldom make congenial bedmates. The record of the individual investors is even worse. Few of them have any long term view especially when looking at development works. There have been many examples of significant subscription shortfalls in proven development projects, the most recent being the Woodside-Burmah issue where the shortfall on the Burmah offering to existing Australian shareholders is likely to be 40 per cent. Utah Development Company- a company which is well known to the former Minister for Minerals and Energy-whic h was offering to the Australian public at $1.85, was not well received and fell to $1.60 a shorttimeafterwards. Today it is selling at the equivalent of $13.60. In reverse some of the overseas investors, the bogies, have been a disaster. One notable case has been the sale by the liquidator of Mineral Securities Australia Ltd of that company's holding in Queensland Mines Ltd to Noranda, Australia Ltd, a Canadian based company, for $ 19 a share. Today the price is $2.30. Money for exploration is very difficult to raise without tax incentives or a favourable stock market in which to sell. Indeed the only exploration work carried out in the last 2 years has been by major compames or foreign companies on a reducing scale. There is a disturbing trend in Australia towards many people being keen to see others risk money in enterprise or exploration while they themselves are unprepared to make a contribution. They are very keen indeed to take over once theriskhas paid off. They cannot have it both ways. Too many Australians want to back the horse after the winning post. Very few want to be on the horse when it goes to the barrier and even fewer want to buy a yearling. I am grateful to the Treasurer for pointing to the possible role of the Australian Industry Development Corporation. This body has had an indifferent performance from a privileged beginning. However, I believe that it can play a useful role in future development projects. It has a unique position as an international borrower. Because of this, large sums should be available to lend to projects. This would be particularly helpful to the smaller developments. In some cases it will be necessary to take up equity capital. This should be watched with care. It seems to be in the best interests to place a limit on the length of time any equity can be held-say , three to five years after completion of the project-profit s being added to the fund and losses crystalised. This would not only stop any creeping government ownership but it would give Australian participation every opportunity. It would similarly restrain blatant political use of this corporation. Any discussion on foreign investment also brings into focus the question of ownership and control. I believe that insufficient people recognise the importance of control. No matter who owns a particular company, that company must operate within the taxation system of the nation. Control is also exercised through export licences and Reserve Bank exchange controls. These 3 weapons of government economic management are far more significant than percentage ownership in a particular company. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), referring to the uranium deposits in Australia, said that only Australian ownership would be able to control that particular industry. I think that he has completely missed the point. This in itself brings us around to the very first question, that all investors must have a clear understanding of what Government policy is and confidence that the Government will carry through its commitments in this area. We now have a chance to prove to Australians and to investors around the world that we are what we say we are- a party of practical men. We must not be seen as small's' socialists ing to stick to Labor's moreflambouyantvisions. We must not be seen as another government of chauvinistic Australians, beating the nationalistic drum and demanding the lion's share in projects developed by theriskcapital of others. We must not be seen as the new Cassandras, predicting dire consequences unless we alone monopolise the resources of development. Rather, we must approach the future with a swagger, welcome those who are willing to spend and let companies make money so that people get jobs, security and a higher standard of living. We must illustrate that we are the antithesis of the previous Government, that our ideas are the opposite of theirs and that investors no longer need be frightened of government control of their industry or profit. As any man in the money market knows, taxes, both Federal and State, will pay handsome rewards to the men and women of Australia. Perhapsrightnow we have a greater responsibility to do this than would appear atfirst,for Australia recently has been seen to swing, as it were, tike a pendulum to the left in regard to foreign investment. In thesefirstfew months in office, therefore, we must illustrate early and clearly that the pendulum has swung back the other way and that eventually it will settle in a central position which will mean that both Australians and overseas investors will have a solid and happy working relationship, sharing the wealth that comes from resources and expertise. Let us then stop 'multinational' being a dirty word. Multinational compames are often the only ones with the knowledge and experience to do what has to be done in developing this nation. Some people who condemn multinationals in the same breath condemn nationalism and promote internationalism. These are international companies, a natural product of the growing specialisation in this increasingly small world. In this my first speech I make my most important plea: Do not let us, as the new Government the people so clearly wanted, carry any further the cause of socialist policy. Let us instead set our standard toward the biggest profit for the hardest worker and the best reward for the bravest investor. Then everyone in this country will benefit. Mr Deputy Speaker, I support the Treasurer's statement.",47
98,Mr CREAN,UNEMPLOYMENT," I congratulate the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) on his maiden speech. He certainly showed some courage in delivering it in a debate of this kind rather than choosing the path chosen by most of his colleagues, namely the Addressin-Reply debate. I commend him for what he try- said. The subject of foreign investment in Australia is intriguing enough, I suppose. I must say that I have been greatly intrigued by what are called the new guidelines. Having read the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) very carefully, I find it a little hard to know what is difference between the procedure now and what it was previously. I would say that the best guideline for any foreigner who wants to invest in Australia is still: First find a suitable Australian panner. There should not be any more go-it-alone type of foreign investment in Australia. For too long-it applied under previous governments for a longtime-did we allow the eyes of investment opportunity to be picked out by the foreign investor. After all, no foreigner invests in this country unless he believes that there is something in it for him. There is nothing wrong with that as an objective, as far as I can see. Equally, Austraha ought not to be interested in that foreign investment if there is nothing in it for us. So it is a 2-way street. Foreign investment should advantage the foreigner. Foreign investment, if allowed in Australia, should be useful to Australia. I have heard a lot today about the significance of foreign investment in Australia. I would not deny that Australian economic development in 1976 would not be what it is without the great deal of foreign investment that has taken place; but I do not think that should blind us to the reality that the majority of investable funds employed annually in Australia is found within Australia. The latest figures showed the Australian gross domestic product as running at about $60 billion. Approximately one-quarter of that, $15 billion, was investable funds. Of that $15 billion, something like two-thirds-that is about $10 billion-wen t into private investment and $5 billion went into public investment. Of course, foreign investment does not find its way into public investment; it goes exclusively into the area of private investment. When one takes out of the private investment part-the $10 billion-the part that is attributable to private dwelling construction, of course what is left is the beginning of the part that adds to the structure of industry in Australia. This is why I agree with the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Short) that the sums that have been invested overseas, whilst marginal to that total, perhaps have been unusually significant as far as the infrastructure or structure in industry is concerned. Of course, there was a difficulty with the legislation that was passed in this field. It was passed by the MCMahon Government in a great hurry a matter of a few months before an election and was a makeshift piece of legislation which we were not really able to amend until almost the end of the Labor Government's period of officenot that there was no intention to alter it but the parliamentary program and the resistance in the the Senate made it difficult. I must say that, makeshift and all as it was nevertheless that legislation served Austraha very well. We set aside certain fields in which we said there shall be no foreign investment. I still beheve that it is right that there should be no foreign investment in these fields. We had never allowed it in the area of aviation. We had not allowed it in banking. We had not allowed it in broadcasting. I certainly hope that no government in Australia in the future will ever allow any foreign investment in the media, whether it is Press, television or radio. I think they are things that should be owned entirely by Australians for Australia. I hope that certain Press gentlemen who have done well outside Australia will not attempt to buy Press in Australia. I hope that some day there will be legislation that will see that they cannot do so. The previous speaker referred to the word 'multinational' being a diny word. I back away from that sentiment. I do not regard 'multinational ' as a dirty word at all. As I said earlier, I believe that, had it not been for some of the multinationals operating in Australia, Australian industry in 1976 would be very much different from what it is. Most of the multinationals, so called, as they operate in Australia in my view are more 'national' than they are 'multi'. Let me put it this way: General Motors in Australia is more concerned about the Holden than it is about the Opel or some other car that General Motors makes somewhere else. Another factor is the vast amount of plough-back that now occurs. Multinationals operating in Australia are no different from Australian compames operating in Australia. Like everybody else, if they make a profit they pay tax. The tax is paid at the company rate in Australia. Most of them, if they are prudent, do not distribute everything that is left after they have paid their taxes; they plough some of it back. Sometimes the shareholder gets a bit by way of a dividend. I would think that much the larger part of the increment in foreign ownership in Australia in recent years has come from ploughed back profits or, if you like, has been taken out of the hides of the consumers in Australia, rather than from new capital from overseas, although it appears in the statistics as capital inflow. I do not know how difficult it would be to have one, but I think it is about time that some sort of register was made in Australia as to the overseas ownership of assets as equity in Australia. I do not know what the figure is, but in what might have been called the golden days of foreign investment it was running somewhere in excess of $ 1 billion per annum and it ran in that way for some of the last few years of the then Liberal-Country Party Government. I would think that the United States investment now in Austraha is probably as great as the United Kingdom investment. The United Kingdom investment began a long while earlier, mainly for historical and traditional reasons, but the relatively fast grower in recent years has been the American compames that are domiciled in Australia. I would hazard a guess that in aggregate the equity is probably well in excess of $10 billion. suppose that is a substantial enough figure, but one thing that I think ought to be remembered sometimes is that we have a great advantage in the mining area in that we are concerned not so much about equity alone as about the fact that we still own the hole in the ground. Whatever might be the book value of General MotorsHolden's, International Harvester and the petrol compames of one kind and another, they certainly cannot pick up the stumps and leave us. At least the assets are worth more in Australia than they are worth anywhere else. In fact, apart from their physical existence in Australia, I suppose they are probably worthless anywhere else. They cannot just sell themselves up. That is not likely to happen. But there does have to be some sort of accommodation with the realities of the situation. I think one of the weaknesses of the takeover legislation is that when it was passed there was not much left that was worth taking over. The damage already had been done. At least there is now scrutiny. I repeat what I said at the beginning. In my view the golden rule of advice to any foreigner becoming. still is: First find an Australian partner. I have never been a firm believer that the partnership should be on a 50/50 or 51 /49 basis. In my as Treasurer I used to say that it could be thing from 100 to 0 or 0 to 100, depending on circumstances. Each case was examined case by case. The same words as I used to use are still being used by the present Treasurer. The which honourable member for Ballarat might even Australia have heard me say that kind of thing in those secret days that he cannot talk about to some the people who used to come to see me. I do think there has been any shortage of people wanting to invest in Australia over the last years. They were just as prevalent in the last years as I believe they were in the previous years. I think some difficulties were experienced, and in my view experienced quite rightly, in mining area, but niining is somehow different from the rest. Whatever may be said about the capital that necessary to develop, say, iron ore on a large scale, I do not think the same sort of thing applies as far as coal is concerned. I believe Austraha has the technical capacity and the availability of capital to do coal extracting itself. As my colleague the former Minister for Minerals and Energy has said, we should be much more careful about the price we get than we have been in the past. But a curious idea somehow seems to exist in the minds of both the Japanese investors and the West German investors that somehow, unless they have part of the equity I they cannot be sure that they are going to get the goods. It is easy to disabuse them of that kind of thinking. We always said in the trading area that we were not closing our doors to those countries' access to iron, steel and coal but we were entitled to say to them, if we wanted to say it, that we did not want any of their equity in this field or that field but we may want it somewhere else. It seems to me that the problems are no different for the present Government from what they were for the Labor Government. Some great apostles of free enterprise have suddenly entered this House. I am already getting nauseated by the use of the phrase 'free enterprise'. I say again that if those who claim to beheve in free enterprise had shown a bit of enterprise Australia would not have been so overridden in some areas by foreign investment. I believe that foreign investment often has come about because no one in Australia was willing to take a risk. I think it is time that those who beheve in enterprise got off that sort of horse and got down to showing a bit of enterprise instead of just talking about it as a great political shibboleth, which I am afraid it is",49
99,Mr KATTER,UNEMPLOYMENT," I have the time utmost respect for the honourable member for anyMelbourne Ports (Mr Crean), who is a former the Treasurer, but he did make one or two remarks on which I wish to comment. At almost the conclusion of his speech he made the first remark I wish to examine. He said that no one in was prepared to take a risk. Of course no one was prepared to take ariskunder the conof ditions that existed during the 3 years of bad not administration by the Labor Government. Not only was no one prepared to take a risk but also 10 the whole of the giant mining industry came to a 3 standstill. The other point upon which I wish to 7 comment is the impression I gained from his remarks that he was saying that there was not the very much difference, taking into account the pressures and so on, between the position in the last 3 years and in the previous 7 years. I cannot is believe that he was serious about that; he is far too learned and far too honest. So I must take issue with him on those 2 comments. The previous 7 years, particularly five or six of those 7 years, were the most prosperous years and the greatest period of development in the whole history of the mineral industry in this nation. I can speak with some authority on this subject as I represent the electorate in which most of the great developments have taken place. That brings me to the matter of what is now the greatest mining complex of its kind in the world-Moun t Isa Mines Ltd. The people who have had a meaningful association with that part of the world and its growth may have been called a lot of clots because they hve in that part of the world and did not see very much happening, but they can look back with satisfaction at the progress which has taken place. A few attempts were made initially to take the great ore body in that area out of the ground and to get this great enterprise operating, but they were not successful. Attempt after attempt was made in this country to raise the necessary capital but those attempts were without success. Finally-and I give credit to the Queensland Government for this- a limited amount of about £500,000, I think, was made available to try to keep at least some life in this ore body, and then of course we began to attract overseas capital. Let me make one thing perfectly clear, and am terribly sensitive about this. I have from the moment I became a member of this House expressed my own attitude in clear and precise terms, and that is this: If we have the expertise, we have the capital available then we do not really want one cent from overseas. I again refer to the situation at Mount Isa and point out that is very doubtful indeed whether the mining to enterprise there would have got off the ground, let alone been developed to the position it is now in and which it has been for some years- I do want to stress the present position too much-bu for Australian initiative. For many years it has been completely controlled by Australian agement and Australian enterprise. The present position is that the majority of in Mount Isa Mines is in the hands of Australians and that is as it should be. Let us be sensible about this matter. If able members want a comparison let me deal with Chile where the great revolution took place and where the great copper mining industry of that nation was brought to its knees because denly the expertise disappeared, the incentive disappeared. The great experiment of socialisThat ation of that industry was another failure there was chaos. Anyone who studied the record would have nothing to do with trying to socialise and hand over to socialist control a mining enterprise of that nature. Whatever be our feelings regarding the politics of Chile we now see that it has again returned to prosperity, or to a I think much greater degree of prosperity than previously existed in that country, and we now find that this huge mining enterprise is operating efficiently. It has become quite common in this House and outside it for people who want to have a hard hit at someone to attack the Deputy Prime Minister, the present Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony). Let me look at his record in the short time he has held that portfolio. The first thing he did was to send a wave of confidence right through the mining industry. If some of the leaders of the industry find cause not to agree entirely with the policies of the Government and the policies of my Leader, I believe they will still readily admit that they are now breathing much more freely and that the great mining industry will be back to what it was, we hope in a very short space oftime.We should look at this matter sanely. The great gripe of people opposite, of course, concerns the 75 per cent foreign participation level. When I say the 'great gripe', I refer to the criticism that has been forthcoming. Uranium is one particular commodity that we I have in the ground which is of vital importance to Austraha. I am not going to go into the details because this has been said time and again. Would any sane Australian permit some foreign if country to come into this nation and take over our uranium resources? I suppose that Labor Party supporters will say that we on this side are it adopting their policy. In a moment I will get on the subject offisheries.Let me expose the policies of the Labor Party. Let me expose its attitudes in this field. It cannot claim credit for our not uranium policy because we above all had deep in t our philosophy and in our policies the defence and security of this country which are very much mantied up with uranium. This is one commodity which I feel must be regarded in a separate the shareholding category altogether. Let me examine the statement made by the Treasurer which was elaborated on by the honourDeputy Prime Minister in respect of participation in the mining of other ores and minerals. People conveniently overlook the fact that it has been stated time and time again by the Minister sudfor National Resources that no project will die because of any particularly inelastic guidelines. has been made perfectly clear. Honourable and member's opposite fear Doug Anthony. They fear this Deputy Prime Minister. That is why he is their target for attack. They know he is a man of immense integrity. They know he is a man The who is so honest that he says what he believes, stands by his convictions, he has a sense of tion and nothing will move it. People on the other side of this House fear a man of that character, but they do not get anywhere with their attack. I said that I would refer to fisheries. We do not have a great deal, if any, foreign participation in the fisheries of this country. We may have it fringe sort of way. But when one thinks of Australia's fisheries one thinks of the Gulf of Carpentaria. There was a great deal of squealing and going on by supporters of the previous Government about the sanctified waters of the Gulf being infringed, trespassed upon and so on. The Minister for Deillusions fence (Mr Killen), my fellow Queenslander, in the quickest possibletimemade sure there was vigilance in this area. He made sure there be a survey of those waters day and night. He took action to ensure that Taiwanese were not creeping into this country. I wonder whether there would be a great squeal from those posite if a boatload of Fretilin forces came over? It is extraordinary. The Opposition went to the extent of sending a man to the United Nations because its supporters are all upset over these poor Fretilin people. They are upset because they carry the great red sickle and hammer beimportance hind them. They cannot help themselves because they are so sensitive about this. One only has show a red sickle and hammer and these men up in arms and cry out: 'Ah, the poor wonder what those who sit opposite would say if the Fretilin people wanted to invest in our fisheries industry. Onefinalpoint I want to make relates to vigilthan ance and the closest possible examination of overseas control of our various industries. The Government's policies are set out quite clearly the statement by the Treasurer. I was the chairects. man of the Government's drought committee during the terrible years of drought. We were particularly vigilant to ensure that there would be no foreign investment whatsoever, and that no vultures would be hovering over our lands come down and buy at some giveaway price. It was the Country Party and the Liberal Party watched over this. The people who sit would not even know what I am talking about because they have never been west of the Great cent Divide except when they have come through hke panies, a brumby with his tail on fire, made some politinot cal comment and dashed back to the coast. We were the ones who were vigilant. We were the ones who watched over the possibility of the multi-nationals taking control of this country. Treasurer's statement is clear. It is lucid. It he sets out at long last a policy. The Minister for direcNational Resources has swept aside the doubts and confusion. He has set down guidelines. Some of them perhaps are not so popular but at least the industry knows where it is going, and under this Government this nation knows where it is going.",51
100,Mr JACOBI,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The question in a of foreign investment in the development of natural resources is more basic to the future prosperity of the people of Australia than almost any other issue. Although this question is dealt with almost as a side issue in the national Parliament, big business is certainly under no as to its real importance. Nothing less than a total sell-out will satisfy some multinational corporations and some sections of the would Australian business community which see an opportunity for private profit in a sell-out of the national interest. There are 2 key issues to be constructively assessed. Firstly, recognising that opmulti-national corporations cannot be relied upon to develop Australia's natural resources in the national interest, how is Australian ownership and control of new development projects to be achieved? Secondly, recognising the enormous potential future strategic and economic of access to natural resources, what is the role of the national Government in the field to of natural resources management, particularly in are relation to two basic questions- a resources Fretilin'. I availability and scarcity? The statement by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) lacks credibUity on the 50 per cent rule on 4 grounds. Firstly, the statement concealed rather revealed one of the key conditions of the policy. The 50 per cent rule is apparently only intended to reassure the Australian public and is into apply in respect of smaller development projAs far as larger projects are concerned, the multi-national corporations are merely required to make a gesture towards local equity before the Government flexibility allows projects to proceed with majority ownership and control. The to present Government's commitment lasted less than a week, when it was negated by a statement who made in Adelaide by the Minister for National opposite Resources (Mr Anthony). He said: Whilst the Government stands by its policy that a SO per equity participation must be offered to Austrahan comthe Government will be flexible where that offer canbe taken up to explore and develop new projects. AU that is required of the multinational corporations is that they convince the proposed Foreign Investment Review Board that they have failed to get the required level of Australian equity and then the project will be permitted to go ahead, provided it complies with the other criteria. This flexibility would seem less like pracucai abandonment of the 50 per cent rule if the second gap in the Treasurer's statement was less conspicuous. Secondly, the credibUity of the rule suffers from the failure of the statement to outline any procedure for overcoming the notorious faUure of Australia's present capital market and financial institutions to mobilise sufficient capital for majority Australian participation in major development projects. That is the fatal flaw. The submission by the Australian Industry Development Corporation to the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership and Control stated: . . . the general observation that, at least in the Austrahan context, the capacity in ownership and control of industries and resources much a function of the availabUity of funds, as of the presence of vehicles which can and will deploy funds to this end. Australia is about the twelfth most affluent country in the world, and it has one of the highest rates of saving amongst the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Recently there has been an increase in savings by households in Australia and elsewhere. In effect, household savings provided less than one-third of total savings in 1971-72 but more than half in 1974-75. Total savings over that period increased from $9,000m to almost $ 15,000m. Major development projects like the north-west shelf will require investment of the order of $ 1,000m to $2,000m, even though it will not be required all in one year. That investment is required from a society where the total amount of annual savings is between $ 14,000m and $ 15,000m and clearly points to the need for foreign capital to assist in the development of AvstraUa's natural resources. However, the policy issue is not whether we need foreign capital. Rather the question is on what terms should foreign investors be allowed to participate in the development of our natural resources. The concentration of foreign capital investment in foreign-owned and controlled enterprises in key sectors of industry has led to a grossly disproportionate degree of foreign ownership. Between 1964 and 1970 82.5 per cent of funds invested in the development of Australian natural resources was employed by foreignowned companies but, according to the 1974 survey by Professor MCKern, 25.7 per cent of the total funds invested, that is about $ 1,100m, was provided by the Austrahan capital market. Professor MCKern also noted that Australian companies were not prepared to undertake the risk of high debt equity ratios which subsidiaries of foreign multinational corporations were able to assume. Furthermore, the very size of foreign multinational corporations compared with the generally small Australian companies means that foreign subsidiaries are more attractive to Australian investors and Australian financial institutions than are Australian companies. The fact that foreign multinational corporations are able to compete on unfairly favourable terms with Australian compames to obtain loan funds in Australia raises the question of why this Government has not seen any need to protect the access of Australian controlled enterprises to the Australian capital market. Indeed, of existing financial institutions in this country, only the AIDC has a positive bias into have more local participation is not so favour of Australian companies. If the limited capital resources avaUable within Australia are to be effectively mobtiised for investment in Australian controlled enterprises, then it would seem logical to restrict the access of foreign controlled compames to local sources of funds and to require foreign subsidiaries to raise loans overseas. That would have a beneficial effect on our balance of payments and would reduce the distorting effect which the competition from giant global multinationals for scarce Australian capital has on the Australian capital market and financial institutions. Tnirdly, the fact that the statement lacks any proposals for a more effective mobiUsation of Australian capital means that the terms will be determined by foreign multinational corporations in their own interests. Professor Johns said in a statement to the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership and Control: If the foreign-owned mining companies are free to determine the extent of local equity participation and the timing of share issues to the Australian public there is Ukely to be little economic benefit to this country. Indeed, there may be positive disadvantages in a small Australian equity obtained at the discretion of an overseas-controlled concern. In other words, Australian investors are to be allowed the opportunity to participate, but at premium prices, and to be subject to the continued effective control of overseas corporations. The fourth ground is that the so-called 50 per cent rule is of dubious practicability because it provides no guarantee that the large input of Australian equity capital will result in effective control by Australians of the enterprise concerned. Accordingly, the rule makes no effective provision for the mobilisation of capital for investment in Australian controlled enterprises engaged in resource development. The fact that the compames which development Australia's natural resources are mostly foreign controlled means that Australia thereby loses the development of Australian-controlled corporate organisations. The fact that Australians participate as individuals in management, as technologists and technicians, does not make up for the fact that the organisations which employ them are in fact foreign owned and controlled. That might be called the 'lost opportunity' cost of the present pattern of mining of Australian natural resources. If Australian controlled enterprises are to be acquired on terms which are not prohibitively expensive or discriminatory, then it is essential that institutional means be established effectively to mobilise Australian equity capital and invest it in the coherent majority or plurality voting blocs of shareholders and directors, which are able to exercise control over the enterprise concerned. Neither existing institutions nor existing Government policy is capable of achieving the broad objective of Australian control. That is the fatal flaw. The achievement of Australian control of new development projects depends upon new organisational mechanisms for mobilising savings of ordinary Australian householders for investment in major projects. That was the purpose of the national investment fund proposed by the previous Labor Government, which was tossed out repeatedly by the Liberal Opposition, I understand basically on the ground that it was socialistic, although in fact all it did was provide means to secure and guarantee investment by the Australian public. The goal of Australian control of new developuranium; ment projects is objectively impossible to achieve unless an organisation or network of organisthe ations such as the proposed national investment fund is established to attract funds away from the existing capital market and financial instituoutlet, tions and channel them into major development projects. Otherwise, the required combinations of capital and entrepreneurial organisations simply do not exist. If the AIDC is to major role in the achievement of Australian control it needs access to more investment capital. It also requires authorisation to achieve Australian cisions control in each major project through the estabenergy lishment in each case of a specialised Australian holding company which will consolidate the Australian equity in the particular project so Australian control of the enterprise can be achieved and maintained. Ordinary citizens in nation of notorious gamblers may be prepared to take huge risks with relatively small sums quite realistically be unprepared to take smaller risks with their life savings. Ordinary citizens can hardly be blamed for not wanting to put their money at risk on the stock exchange when proper regulation of the securities and exchange industry will be abandoned by this Government. But even with a properly regulated stock exchange, the risk involved is too great for people to put their life savings on the Une. To mobilise capital from ordinary Australian households, a government-guaranteed nnanciai institution which presents attractive investment prospects to the ineffectively mobilised resources of household savings obviously is indispensable. I want to conclude with some remarks on the need for the use of Australian natural resources to be based on a national minerals and energy policy. The policy should set out priorities for the exploration and exploitation of our resources. It should in fact develop policies for our future needs both at national and international level. If the national government fails to regulate the use of minerals and energy in the national interest, multi-national corporations will use them in the interests of their world wide, vertically and horizontally integrated conglomerate structures. This has happened already in Canada, where United States' investment in oil and gas has reached the level of 90 per cent ownership. An article which appeared in the New York Times Weekly Review last January pointed out that 20 big oil companies control 94 per cent of United States oil reserves; the 18 largest oil compames produce 60 per cent of the natural gas supply; sixteen of the eighteen own oil shale interests; eleven possess huge coal reserves; sixteen have bought into three own solar energy companiesand the only geothermal lands in production in United States are owned by one oil company. In this way not only is each type of energy vertically integrated from mineral source to consumer but also all types of energy have been horizontally integrated into energy conglomerates. As a result, the price of coal is regulated by oil companies which already own 44 per cent of play a the privately held coal reserves. These oil companies make development defor the coal industry and other sources of to protect their investments in declining oil reserves by limiting competition from other energy sources. Eight US oil companies already that have across the board positions in every other fuel or energy conglomerate, in other words, a alternative sources. These energy conglomerates in North America are subject to neither effective but competition nor control. Changes in consumer behaviour do not regulate the energy conglomerates; rather, the energy conglomerates regulate the changes in consumer behaviour. We need 2 basic elements in a policy for foreign investment in Australia's natural resources. First, we need a policy goal of effecuve Austrahan control of all new development projects at the level of the individual enterprise. To achieve that goal we need new institutions to mobilise Australian capital and invest it effectively on favourable terms. Secondly we need an energy pohcy to regulate the use of our minerals and energy from the long-term national perspective of the national interest. Otherwise, Australian minerals and energy resources will be used in the interests of world-wide, vertically and horizontally integrated energy conglomerates.",53
101,Mr MARTYR,UNEMPLOYMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, it gives me particular pleasure to take part in this debate under your direction. I support the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). The question of foreign investment actively concerns, perhaps more than many others questions, the whole of the mineral industry. It cannot be considered without looking closely at the stringent Treasury ruling that there must be a 75 per cent ownership in uranium and not less than 50 per cent in other minerals. At present this seems an impossible target. A glance at the share register of even such an apparently Australian company as Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd shows that less than 12 per cent of the stockholding is Australian hands. I am very strongly of the opinion that the position to foreign investment in Australia is confidence trick of the present Opposition, previous Government. Where honourable meminefficient bers opposite got it from is anybody's guess-cer tainly they did not get it from anyone who has the best interests of this country at heart. propaganda against the multi-nationals and ton foreign investment became a catch cry for the ranks of the Opposition and unfortunately been swallowed elsewhere. I do not believe that multi-nationals and foreign investment are, per se, bad. I beheve that many multi-nationals are efficient, reasonable and sensible and are run men who, while they are interested finally in fit-and who is not-as o realise their reasonable obligations. I believe that Australia simply canoutback, not get its economy going again without massive injections of foreign capital, for the huge amounts of money needed to get development in projects moving are simply not available in this country. If the Treasury ruling is to stand must find ways and means of making it work, otherwise we shall probably continue to be same sort of mess as we were in under the previous Government. It is pleasing to note the flexibility of the Treasury in the recent Robe River deal. The Labor Party's pursuit of the ideal of Austrahan ownership without having a clue on how to achieve it is one of the principal reasons for our being in government now. The Labor Party's ideal was a high-sounding one. It thought that the way to achieve Australian ownership was by expenditure of vast sums of government money, the forming of the National Investment Fund, the enlarging of the powers of the Australian Industry Development Corporation and the borrowing of some $8,000m for government resource development-puttin g Australia into permanent hock to shady pawnbrokers of the world. That program, which culminated in the Khemlani affair, marked the end of the previous Government, but unfortunately it does not seem to have marked the end yet of some of the attitudes that were present at that time. Regrettably, the AIDC, for instance, is still with us. Mr BjelkePetersen said on 19 March: We could forget all about development projects for a long time to come. That applies to all States. That is just an instance of the legacy that the previous Government has left us. It is a major tragedy. Even worse, there is every possibility in that Australia will lose existing projects because the attitudes of mind which the previous Government had are still around. Some of the problem opstems from the very high royalties companies a must pay to States. Sometimes States burden the the mining industry with costly and sometimes rail services. For instance the Francis - Creek iron mine in the Northern Territory was forced to close largely because under the preThe vious Government it was being charged $3.88 a for carting over a distance less than that over which the average Pilbara private enterprise it has miner operates at a cost of 50c a ton. The outcome of all this is that capital, both Australian and foreign, is going elsewhere. In the by last three or four years, it has been estimated, prosome $7,000m worth of projects have been lost to Australia. Most new projects are in the lonely so almost half their capital cost is taken up providing infrastructure-ports , railways, towns, schools, hospitals and so on. In the past, the Pilbara at least, this has been provided by foreign capital to the extent of some $230,000 for then we every man employed. Those days are over. Further capital is not forthcoming. Places like in the Mount Newman and Paraburdoo are operating at a loss. Certainly no State Government can provide infrastructure. No Commonwealth Government ever will, and no multinational will do so in future. I do not beheve that the States will be able to carry the load, nor do I believe it would be good for them to put their States into huge debt at high interest rates to help to get the projects going. What then? I do not think that the AIDC can do it, because its money is too dear and its track record is not the best. The Japanese are certainly not enthusiastic about the AIDC. I have the feeling anyway that the AIDC is not really a free enterprise organisation. I suggest that the Australian Government should introduce immediately a scheme to guarantee the respective State governments in new projects provided they in turn guarantee Australian participants in a joint venture that they will cover the provision of infrastructure; that is, if Australians own 50 per cent of a venture in which 50 per cent of the capital cost is volved in infrastructure-this is normal-the n by means of government guarantee the Australians would be able to raise sufficient money to cover the cost of this infrastructure. This would mean that 50 per cent of the ownership of the project would remain in Australian hands. The Government of course should provide such a guarantee only for projects that have been proven economically viable by strict commercial standards. To put it into practical terms, and applying such a scheme to one of the giant Queensland coal projects at present in mothballs, it has been estimated for one such proposal that $ 1,000m capital is required, of which about half would probably be spent on infrastructure. To qualify for a government guarantee of that amount, firstly, the Australian interests would have to provide proof of a coal body and prove that say $10m had been spent on exploring and proving it. Secondly, they would have to have secured a long term take or pay sales contract so that the Government would have proof that the coal was saleable. Thirdly, they would have to give the Government an undertaking that the foreign element in the venture would put up its share of the capital. With all this done and a government guarantee, the 50 per cent Australian interest would have no trouble raising the capital it needs and in joint ventures with overseas interests providing the remainder, the project could move. The government would have ultimate security over the product proved in the ground as well as over the facUities that have been butit with the money borrowed, as well as first caU on the profitabiUty of the venture; that is, ordinary commercial merchant banking procedures would be followed. The next thing to be assured is the method of repayment. It is here that the State governments must co-operate as part of the total Commonwealth ideal. They should be wilting to ease their royalty demands. High State royalties are sometimes a bone of contention in the mining industry. Years ago excessive demands closed down mining totally for 10 years in one American State. It was started again only by the government not only subsidising the industry but also forgoing royalties entirely. We hope that it will not come to this in Australia, for there is absolutely no need for it if everyone pulls together to ensure the reasonable profitability of mining. It is from funds that in present circumstances would be earmarked for State royalties, together in with any royalty that may be forthcoming to the Australian share of a joint venturefinancedin this way, along with the first call on profits from the Australian sector that reduction of the debt should be made until it is fully discharged. State and Commonwealth governments would gain from having an eminently profitable, booming mining venture generating income through reasonable taxation. Government would have a solution to some of today's unemployment and the economy generally would benefit tremendously. Ultimately governments could become the owners of the enormous facUities buUt to get projects going. All this would be at no cost to the Australian taxpayers or the State governments because in forgoing future royalties they would be forgoing nothing in present cash. Minerals lying dormant in the ground are yielding nothing in tax, nothing in royalties, nothing in foreign exchange, and nothing in jobs for thousands of Australians. In fact, minerals lying dormant in the ground do nothing but constitute a grave defence threat to Australia. I congratulate the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), who is also the Minister for National Resources, for making this point clear so forcibly. The scheme I suggest need not enlarge one single government department. Does not that have an attraction in itself. It need never bog down in the bureaucracy or be ktiled by hidebound orthodoxy anywhere. The best way to implement it would be by Act of this Parliament-a n act which laid down in the simplest form the commercial criteria needed for any Australian venturer to qualify for the guarantee.",56

103,Mr CONNOR,UNEMPLOYMENT,"An abiding impression of the statement on foreign investment by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) is that like the curate's egg it is good in parts. Imitation, of course, is the sincerest form of flattery and it is in keeping with the tradition of conservative governments that they generally adopt at least a proportion of the policies of the Labor administration which preceded them. In this case there is naturally some joy in heaven because of the repentant sinners who at least saw the error of their ways to the extent of indicating that there was a minimum standard of Australian ownership which they would seek to achieve with, of course, some appropriate loopholes. The statement is a glib one, it is an artificial one and it skates over the major issue. No group of men on a committee, with all due respect to them, should be allowed to deal with some of the major issues which will undoubtedly crop up in relation to Australian resources allocation, particularly energy resources. By that I mean that even before this Committee can function a good deal oflegal work needs to be tidied up in relation to the impact of the High Court judgment on the Seas and Submerged Lands Act. As a matter of fact, the whole rickety structure of offshore oil and gas search, erected in 1967, which was criticised and attacked even by a former Liberal Prime Minister and a former Liberal Attorney-General, has collapsed as they and I and other Labor men since 1967 have persistently and repeatedly forecast. Today on the North West Shelf there is an admitted 18 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. If one takes the valuation of that at 4c per thermthat was the price that the Woodside-Burmah organisation offered me to sell our own gas to us-that would be a matter of some $18 billion; that is, if one takes into account the 760 miltion barrels of condensate which are there and which are equal to imported crude oil parity. From the High Court judgment emerges the salient fact that off-shore there is precisely 100 per cent Australian ownership. The sovereignty battle has been resolved and therefore we do not need to talk in terms of a SO per cent partnership at all. When the Australian Labor Party took office we inherited a situation in which my predecessor in office, Sir Reginald Swartz, had written to the Woodside-Burmah interests expressing his concern at the continued diminution of the 17 per cent Australian equity which was then held in their company. He asked that the situation be corrected. The only thing that we could properly do to serve Australia's interests was to see that the matter of sovereignty was adjudicated on and precisely that we did. We did it despite the criticism, the blackguarding, the opprobrium, the viciousness and the demonology that was gradually erected about our alleged malevolence and misguided approach. The hard fact is that we won and the even harder fact is- I am glad that the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) is here-that it is up to the Government to clean up the mess which we forecast, which exists and which it has inherited. Today the Burmah-Woodside company-at least the Burmah sector of it-is a lame duck company. I give it due credit for what it has discovered but so it should have done. I give it due credit for the money it has spend but the question is now: How does this Government, without getting into partnership, propose to develop what it, in fact, owns and ought to be developing on behalf of the Australian people? An issue of this type is one for consideration by the Parliament, not one to be handed to the members of the proposed investment committee however worthy they may be. National assets of this scale are not to be handed over for adjudication on and allocation by even the most worthy representatives of private business or the bureaucracy. It is to be noted very clearly also the delay in the delivery of the High Court judgment. Quite miraculously it came to light 10 day s after the election. Had it been delivered earlier it would undoubtedly have been a major issue but even allowing for the lateness of its delivery- I quote from what Barwick, C.J., said-the point is this: Once low water mark is passed the international domain is reached. The boundaries of the Australian sovereign States end at low water mark. They do not even extend out 3 miles beyond to the limits of the territorial sea. The power to legislate is a sovereign one, conferred by the Constitution, and is based on the external powers given in the relevant placitum of section 51 of the Constitution. From that, other things automatically flow. It means that the mirror legislation passed by the respective States as a counterpart to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act is in conflict with the Commonwealth legislation and therefore under section 109 is inconsistent and invalid. In other words, titles will need to be given by the Commonwealth in its own right and directly, and whether those titles are merely for further ration or for development it is not only the monwealth'sresponsibilityby also its prerogamyself tive and more than that it is a duty that it delegate to the respective States. I remind the House that the then Opposition, powers, which is now the Government, held up legispermits or production lauon which the former Labor Government of the expenditures that introduced which would have been effectuated by referendum and which would have given the Commonwealth power to delegate some of its Minister powers to the respective States. The Government Act is hoist with its own petard. own obstinacy and its own cussedness. The High Court held that the Seas and Submerged Lands Act was valid despite section 16(b). From that it follows also that under the terms of section 140 of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act that cisions, did not remedy the situation and again it is a matter of Commonwealth sovereignty and Comis monwealth sovereignty alone. I should like to hear from the Attorneymay General. I asked his colleague, the Minister for National Resources (Mr Anthony) whether he sation would table the advisings that he had received from the Attorney-General and from any other officer, presumbly the Solicitor-General, on this matter and the implications of the High Court decision. The people of Australia are entitled know. The Minister can go further than that. can also table the advising that I received Mr Byers, the Solicitor-General, in January of last year with respect to the status of the various State Ministers for Mines as designated authorioff-shore ties. I also remind the House of the recommendaposition tions of the Senate Select Committee of Off-shoregive Petroleum Resources and in particular of the paper delivered by Professor Richardson, the respected Professor of Law at the Australian National University, in which he pointed out that the constitution of the respective State Ministers for Mines was a derogation of the authority of the Commonwealth Minister and as such in the breach of the Constitution. We have come to a point where maverick States can no longer be allowed to usurp, and necessary to abuse, the sovereign functions National Parliament. I would be the last man in this House to deny the right,for example, Western Australia to the development of natural gas for its own purposes. But, having said that, we come to the further situation where the position Government nowfindsitself in a quandary as to how it can comply with the request of the Westwhich ern Australian Government to aUow the present situation to continue. It cannot do so. It should not do so. I suggest that we should have had exploproduced thefileof correspondence throughout Comthe period of the High Court hearing between and Mr Mensaros, the Minister for Mines cannot of Western Australia, in which I repeatedly pointed out to him that State's lack of sovereign the inadequacy of the conditions in respect of which the State granted exploration rightsand the inadequacy were sought from the companies concerned. I also suggested to the that there were sufficient powers within the terms of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) for the State to stall for a little whtie appliIt is the victim of its cations for renewal of exploration permits. The State refused to do so. It wanted to muddle up the position as much as it possibly could. Further resultsflowfrom the High Court deand I refer in this respect to therightsof the on-shore States to legislate in respect of what caUed peace, order and good government. In the absence of Commonwealth legislation there be some case for State laws in respect of criminal jurisdiction,fisheries,workers compenand civil contracts to continue. But this is a matter for negotiation. As an Opposition we do not want to see a repetition of an attempt by some means to subvert and to avoid the clear-cut terms of this judgment. That is precisely what to was implicit in the answer that was given today He by Mr Anthony to the Leader of the Opposition from (Mr E. G. Whitlam). The Government somehow wants to get around the situation and to give the respective States therightsto continue to operate and to givetitle.The States are not in a to givetitle.They are not in a position to permits. The most they could do-and this can be done only by ad hoc committees without any constitutional basis-woul d be to delegate the day to day powers of operation in respect of off-shore exploration and production. There is no inherent power remairting in the respective States in respect of the right to decide the areas, terms under which those areas are to be held and the period for which they are to be held. I do not want to see development held up. But if here we would be dealing with assets that could of the be comparable only to those in respect of uranium in the Northern Territory. They are forof midable assets. They need to be correctly handled. In the interests of the shareholders of the respective off-shore mining companies the will need to be clarified. I challenge the Attorney-General to state clearly the extent to he claims vaUdity for any of the titles that are being granted in respect of off-shore operations. I would not for one minute suggest in respect of Bass Strait, where there is competent development, that the companies should not be granted their full renewal of rights. But wholly excessive areas have been given in respect of the North-West Shelf. These areas have been far in excess of what is off-shore exploration practice in other parts of the world. They have been given on giveaway conditions. This is a matter of national importance. It is a matter that demands immediate decision and the fullest frankness on the part of the Government. We are entitled to debate it fully in this House.",58
104,Mr JARMAN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The question of foreign investment is one over which debate has raged for many years and one which has often been the subject of very emotionally charged arguments. I believe that the present Government has come closer than ever before to presenting a set of guidelines for overseas investment which are basically unemotional and which reflect the requirements and aspirations of the Australian people and the Australian economy. Still, I cannot in all honesty remain uncritically silent about them. The benefits of overseas capital are many and this seems to be now well recognised by all who bring serious consideration to the question. Clearly overseas investment has a vitally important role to play in the development of the Australian economy and perhaps more so now than ever before for in these times of inflation and high unemployment increased productivity and the development of new areas of production are very vital weapons in our fight against economic problems. Overseas capital brings with it new technology and managerial skills. It establishes new foreign markets. It generally enhances competitiveness and efficiency within our economy. Perhaps most important of all in a country like Australia it can provide large amounts of risk capital so essential to the future development of the Australian economy and so often lacking from within our own borders. We must all recognise that we can no longer remain economic nationalists. We are very much a part of the international economic scene and the living standards we enjoy in this country would most certainly not be possible without the benefits which foreign investment has brought in the past and will, I hope, continue to bring in the future. Unfortunately over the past 3 years of Labor rule these important benefits have not always been available to us as a nation. During this period there has been a drastic fall in the level of capital inflow into Australia. This was pointed out by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) in his statement of I April. It cannot be disputed that this fall was due very largely to the vacillating and the uncertainty created in the minds of foreign investors by the confused policy of the previous Labor administration. I commend the present Government for recognising the need for firm guidelines, thereby providing a frame of reference within which potential investors can make firm decisions. I wish to take the analysis of the previous Administration's poticy one step further to point out that this confusion and uncertainty came about largely because the Labor Government gave too much weight to the supposed costs of a high level of foreign capital investment in Australia. It concerned itself primarily with the question of how much Australian ownership and control was appropriate rather than with the question of what Australia had to gain in the longer term. It is because I fear that this same mistake could be made again in some areas of the new guidelines that I have risen to speak tonight. The areas to which I am referring are the mining industry and the development of our vast national resources which are so important to the economic future of Australia and to its people. The requirement of a 50 per cent Australian equity in any foreign capital funded mining project-7 5 per cent in the case of uranium-con tinues to reflect this preoccupation with and over-emphasis on the question of Australian control and ownership. They represent a preoccupation with giving too much weight to the cost to Australia argument and not enough weight to the benefits to be gained argument which, after all, is surely the essential one. They represent a continued hangover from the days when an overobsession with nationalism, a fervent desire for ever-increased independence at any cost and a vague distrust of multinationals and foreign capital were allowed to cloud our thinking, almost to the point of over-saturation. Surely it is time we were able to adopt a more realistic and mature approach and to relegate such considerations to their proper place. Mineral and energy resources are too vital a commodity in these times for the rest of the world to stand idly by waiting while Australia waffles and tries to decide what is in its best interests. It has been clearly demonstrated over the past decade that we cannot expect to enjoy that sort of luxury. After all, we are not the only nation with resources to exploit. Take the petroleum industry. When debate on foreign investment first began the world had not been confronted with an energy crisis. Australia seemed to hold an enormous promise, with vast resources of oil supposedly still untapped. Many of our resources remain in the ground still waiting to be tapped while the degree of our selfsufficiency in oil is dropping at the rate of 5 per cent per annum. This year we will import 35 per cent of our requirements simply because the previous Government's policy succeeded in frightening exploration away from our shores. I am afraid there is a grave danger that the new equity requirements could in some respects perpetuate this situation. Mining industry leaders unanimously claim that these requirements will do just that. They point out that never in the even in the days of the mineral boom, have Australian investors been able to come up with anything like 50 per cent of the kind of money needed tofinancemineral exploration, let alone exporation and development. No one in his right mind would deny that Austrahan investors should be given the opportunity to invest in any new project, up to and above the level set by the government of the day, but their failure to do so should not preclude overseas capital from financing such ventures which are so vitally needed in the Australian national interest. No matter what the extent of our natural resources, it is no use priding ourselves on them they are to stay in the ground. This is what have been doing, I am sad to say, in the recent past. We have seen the rest of the world taken to know. the cleaners, to use a well known phrase, over the past decade by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. I agree with Mr D. J. MCGarry, Chairman of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association, that the type of our independence about which we should be thinkAustralian ing is independence from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. That is the kind of overseas domination about which we should cases, be worried. I am convinced that the proper course that Australia should take is to welcome foreign investment, particularly for oil and eral exploration which, we should not forget, undertaken at great risk and in which, in past, Australian investors have shown a marked unwillingness to participate on any large scale. Adequate controls on overseas investment and capital exist already in the hands of government. The Government has the power to decide which areas may be developed and the priorities. It the power to decide what it will take in royalties and taxes. It can by legal means make provision to discontinue a project if it so wishes. more ways to kill a cat than by scalping it. There are many and more subtle ways to control overseas investment than to frighten it away by harsh and restrictive controls. Added employment of Australian citizens, particularly during the present unemployment crisis, the royalties and taxes extracted, together with the foreign exchange generated by exports, are all benefits to Australia and far exceed the profits enjoyed by foreign investors, no matter what is the amount of their equity. It is Australia which, and the Australian people who, in the long run come out as the winner. Surely we must do all in our power to encourage such investment when it is we, as Australians, who will reap the ultimate benefits.",60
105,Mr HAYDEN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"The statement past, of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) on foreign investment is, in my opinion, a very good one because it is almost exactly the same as the one which we made in September last year. The only significant qualification concerns foreign investment in the field of uranium. We established a condition that there had to be 100 per cent Australian investment. The Government of the moment has proposed that the Australian equity be a minimum of 75 per cent. I believe that the requirement of the Australian Labor Party Government of 100 per cent equity in the development of uranium is a reasonable one, given the crucial nature of uranium as an if ingredient in the development of probably the we most devastating weapon of destruction that the world has ever known and conceivably will ever Let me pass on to the matter before us-the statement of the Treasurer on foreign investment. The Government has effectively picked up best coat and is seeking to present it to the electorate as original thinking. I find it rather surprising that skilled, experienced journalists should have reported it, in many in that light when it was released. I invite them, I invite the House, I invite the public to compare the statement of the Treasurer with the minstatement of the Prime Minister of the previous is Government and to note the happy accord be the tween the 2 statements. What seems to have escaped the attention of many commentators in the community is the important achievement that there now appears to have been established a bipartisan policy on foreign investment. Might I say that it is a more enlightened one than any we have had previously. I had hoped there has would have been more enlightened debate on this issue and fewer attempts at trying to manufacture points for cheap political scoring in the There are course of this debate. Having said that, I must now attempt very quickly to score a couple of cheap points at the expense of the Government. I observe that when in Opposition the present Government deplored our statement of guidelines on foreign investment announced in September last year. Honourable members opposite now seek virtually to enshrine that statement as a Government achievement. I think it would better serve the community and rational consideration of the important topic of foreign investment in this liament if it were acknowledged that there is so tittle difference between the 2 statements that at last we have reached a bipartisan approach to foreign investment. One of the impediments to rational discussion of this topic in the past was that it was burdened with so many shibboleths. There was too much focus on the extremes. It seemed to me that from one side of the Parliament there was too often an uncritical supineness when the subject of foreign investment was raised and from the other side of the Parliament there was too often a rather brittle approach based on near enough to a total prohibition of foreign investment coming into the country. Our guidelines announced last year-thes e guidelines very largely-ar e a flexible response on the one hand to the reasonable national aspirations of the people of this country, of investors and of developers, and on the other hand to the needs of development of this nation. There is no need for any Australian to feel embarrassment that we should have some sense of national aspiration when it comes to the development of our natural resources and our industrial development. Those of us who are familiar with attitudes in the United States of America realise that that great country, which by and large is a strong proponent of freer trade in the world and freer movement of equity capital, in certain periods of pressure can exhibit as much nationalism as any of the other advanced countries of the world. The guidelines which the previous Government established, which are fairly faithfully replicated in the statement of the Treasurer, will allow development or our resources to proceed without undue delay. In both cases-this is contrary to some of the observations made by Government supporters-whil e a requirement was stressed of a minimum of SO per cent Australian equity in mineral development, with the exception of uranium which I have mentioned, it was also stated that development would not be delayed unduly because problems might arise in relation to the aggregation of sufficient Australian capital to allow Australian investors to participate in a particular development project. I will come back to that point in a few minutes; but I want to move on to the general principles of foreign investment. I think it is becoming a cliche-nonetheless , it is just as true for that-to acknowledge that there are great benefits from foreign investment for a country like Australia. I can accept the proposition, as least theoretically, that this country can do without foreign investment, but the Par- people who assert that proposition altogether seem to fail to recognise the costs, the difficulties and the unhappiness which would arise if we tried to achieve our development at the rate we have seen in the past without foreign investment. Let me use the example of 1971-72, the last period of the Liberal-Country Party government before this Government came to office. In that year there was $652m of new capital inflow to private companies; that is excluding investment from retained profits or portfolio investment. That represents about 2 per cent of the gross domestic product. It represents about 13 per cent of gross company profits. The last statistic is probably the more dramatic because it is an indication of the sort of strain Australian business would have to bear if it were expected that business should provide that sort of investment from its own resources. What it would mean if we had to do without foreign investment is that there would be fewer consumer goods for consumers to enjoy. They would have to delay replacing their motor cars, defer purchasing newrefrigeratorsor perhaps not have hohdays as frequently as they have in the past. For business there would be lower profit distributions. There would be higher investment rates for debenture raisings because there would be stiffer competition for the limited amount of loanfinanceavailable in the economy. That in turn would present its problems because the higher interest rates would flow through the economy and force up costs of loan money in a number of other fields in the economy-for instance, domestic housing. On the other hand, it is not without its costs. Not the least of the costs are the service debts which have to be paid out to investors year by year. Again from my reading of the statistical data which is available, I think that too much has been made of this point by some spokesmen fromtimetotime.It seems to me that that sort of service debt, to this point anyway, is quite manageable and it is more than offset by the benefits that we have been able to achieve for this country and for people in this country. Certainly it would seem to me that without foreign investment our growth rate would have been considerably lower even if we had struggled to try to increase the rate of investment which was raised from domestic sources. I realise that there seems to be some sort of conventional wisdom opposed to economic growth in industrialised societies. I frankly think that that proposition will not stand up to critical scrutiny. One can have economic growth and at the same ume within reasonable bounds preserve the environment, broadly defined, in which one Uves. Too often this sort of argument in opposition to economic growth is made by particularly articulate and welleducated people who have had reasonably abundant benefit from the advantages our society has been able to provide because economic growth has taken place. I refer to better education, the mobility of a motor car and a more satisfying experience in life, usually in a middle class situation. If we are not going to have economic growth there is a fundamental challenge before those people, namely, are they prepared to tolerate a situation in which there is still a very large proportion of our community who are nowhere near as well off as they are and who want to be and should be able to have a reasonable expectation of being as well off? Are they prepared to bear with the redistribution which meeting those reasonable expectations would involve? In real terms, would they accept a lowering of their living standards? I leave it to the imagination of honourable members to provide the answer to that question. Apparently there are some costs that can arise from the control of industry, and through that from the fact that some significant influence be exercised on the economy through the sort aggregation of economic clout which some investment can create. But I tend to think there has been some distortion of this propinvestment osition too. First of all, I believe that in this try, with its vast area and very of 13 miltion people, we have to recognise that we have great difficulty in maximising efficiency and productive output, that is, the greatest return for a given level of investment, or containing costs at reasonable levels so that people maximise their living standards as consumers and so that we can maximise our competitiveness as an international trader in goods. I repeat there are problems, in a country with the space that we have and with the sparse population that we have, in trying to achieve economies of scale. I believe that there is a compelling case for tructuring Australian industry, a case which impeded too often by special and selfishly based interest groups. Unless we can achieve that tructuring and maximise our efficiency we will increasingly suffer economic disadvantage in trying to maintain our competitiveness in international trade and to maintain our living standards comparatively to what is available in the advanced countries of the world. Accordingly, we need some concentration of economic power in certain sections of the economy. Where it is possible to provide competition through imports, that ought to be done. Where that is not possible-perhap s in some service industry areas-it seems to me that effective antitrust legislation is what is required. But it is trying to tive in the past, it is being unreal and it is not doing a service to the community to suggest that we can proceed with some sort of cottage industry approach, preserving every small producer who functions in the economy. I am not suggesting that there is not room for small producers, but they should maintain their positions on the basis of competition and efficiency and should not expect to be propped up at the expense of consumers and taxpayers to the disadvantage of the Australian economy. There is one point which I shall not have enoughtimeto develop fully but to which I feel I must refer and that is the Treasurer's reference in his statement as a throw away, a cheap point scoring observation, to foreign investment as a proportion of total capital investment in Australia. He rightly pointed out that it was nearly 3 per cent in the last few years-in fact it was nearly 4 per cent but it is hardly worth quibbling over that one percentage difference-as against, he said, about 10 per cent in the late can 1960s and early 1970s. He is not quite correct of there. ThefiguresI took out during the dinner break indicate a much higher dependence on that foreign investment as a proportion of total than he suggested. For instance, in coun1971-72 it was 15 per cent and in 1970-71 it was small population 18 per cent. The fact is that foreign investment was cut back rather consciously because of the difficult economic circumstances we had to handle when can we became a government. Revaluations were necessary. The imposition of variable deposit rates was necessary to brake the rate of capital that inflow because our exchange rate was unconscionably out of any realistic alignment and our resources were being sold out too easily. I repeat that we came into office at a time of the most resserious world trade slump that has been seen is since the Great Depression of the 1930s, epitomised inter alia by a collapse in the price of resmany basic minerals. While we had firm contracts the fact is that a collapse in the price and the general slackness in the international economy discouraged foreign investors from taking up investment opportunities in various countries. The situation now is that the Government has the challenge before it- a fairly difficult challenge. Perhaps a litde rational restraint in this sort of debate would allow one to express some sympathy with the Government at this difficult moment. Unless we can contain costs when the rest of the world is recovering from the economic slump I am afraid that our competitiveness will be such that we will not attract as much investment as we ought to attract.",61
106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,64
107,Mr BAUME,UNEMPLOYMENT,"It is always interesting to follow Queensland's only Labor representative, particularly after he has been engaged, with some skill, in a 'cheap point scoring' proposition. I am quoting him. At least one can say that under the inflation of his Government cheap political points became certainly cheaper as time went by because the value of money with which they were purchased appeared to be going down with remarkable speed. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) said that he thought the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) delivered a very good foreign investment statement because it is like that of the Labor Government. I was wondering what it was that made me uneasy about sections of this foreign investment statement. I am grateful to the honourable member for Oxley for having pointed out to me that it is because of those parts which could well be held to be not immensely dissimilar from the policy of the previous Government. It is similar for example, in the sense that a slow moving bureaucracy will examine commercial propositions with the same sense of urgency as bureaucracies have displayed in examining commercial activities and mergers and so on in recenttimes.This slow moving factor is a very serious one. It has forced Australian companies that may well have survived in partnership as a result of merger or acquisition in fact to go to the wall because mergers and acquisitions have either not been agreed to or have not been agreed to in time. I must say that I have a residual twitch about the excessive bureaucratic intervention in various parts of proper commercial activity. Having said that, I must stress that it is vital that in Australia's best interests there should be supervision of foreign investment in Australia. But I want to stress that I see this statement by the Treasurer as perhaps more of the skeleton of a policy than the flesh and blood of the policy. I look to the Foreign Investment Review Board to provide that body. I say that because the outlines within which the Foreign Investment Review Board is to advise appear to me to be the real guts of foreign investment. The debate on this matter on this occasion and on previous occasions has revolved around an emotional nonsense about what foreign investment is all about. The realities of foreign investement have been totally avoided, I presume, because the gentlemen on the other side of the chamber basically have not understood what they are all about, but secondly, I believe because the concepts are perhaps difficult to grasp. Let us recognise that the Foreign Investment Review Board will in effect determine the guts of the policy. It will look at inter-company pricing and profit arrangements, royalty and licensing arrangements, availability of technology, patents, etc, export franchise arrangements and the extent and nature of parent control of Australian operations. While everyone has been fussing about equity control, shareholdings and foreign proportions the facts are that many foreign corporations in Australia have been taking far more out in licensing fees, patent fees and management fees than they have ever taken out in dividends. Yet we have this obsessive involvement with the farce, the fiction of proportionate ownership. The companies could have a $2 paid capital and borrow all the money in Australia .and they could have differential interest rates and do what they like. There is nothing in this statement nor in the existing legislation to prevent it. To a large degree all of the legislation in this area, and particularly the nonsense that came from opposite, had an element of window dressing and political catch cry about it. Let us get to the guts of the issue. Let us look at what in fact would be the best way to control this sort of thing. I have generally taken the view that the best method of control is simply to reveal. If everything is forced to be revealed honestly and truthfully public opinion is the great controller. When we had huge dividends going to overseas and large foreign investments in real estate there was an emotional response locally. There was then pressure on politicians and as a result we got this kind of nonsense. But the public has not seen what are the licence fees, patent fees and management fees. I am putting to the House that it would be a good idea if we started to deal with what really matters-ho w much money is flowing out from this nation in payment for things that perhaps are overpriced by multinationals; perhaps, but we do not know because we do not see thefigures.We getfixatedabout dividends. I have a lot of reservations about this policynot, as I said, what it says. It is the framework, the bones, the skeleton of the policy. The reality is that the Foreign Investment Review Board will have to do the essential key job of determining what in fact will be the real rules about investment in Australia. So an independent board will create our policy out of a mass of uncertainty. We cannot go round the world, and have not been able for many years to do so, and say: 'This is Australia's policy on foreign investment', because whenever one has a board, a bureaucratic structure making decisions, creating the law in effect, one has uncertainty. When one has uncertainty one has a disastrous investment scene. I am suggesting that it is about time that both sides of this House recognised that we should face up to the realities of the problem of foreign investment instead of dealing with the shadows of it. I have been intrigued by the manner in which we-al l of us-respon d emotionally to the queson tion of profits in real estate. For heaven's sake, what policy impact does the ownership by which foreigners of an office block have on Australia? intrigues me to see Australians jumping up and down complaining about foreigners making profits out of office blocks when they apparently work. do not care so much about foreigners making major investments in major Australian resources. Surely it is in the areas where policy decisions matter, where policy decisions count and wherecourages pohcy decisions have an impact on our future that we should be expressing concern, rather than having this emotional response to the fact that some foreigners have made a quid out of trading in bits of land. Let us impose a differenAustralian tial tax on them, then. There are many things can do. But to respond in what I believe to be an emotional way about real estate simply because there was a boom, and to say that if foreigners made money out of that boom they must be naughty, I find to be a curious approach to government. I am much more interested in seeing in statement- I presume it will emerge from the programs. establishment of the Foreign Investment Review Board-somethin g about, for example, the pricing poUcies of multinational corporations ownits ing Australian resources. What is there in this statement, for example, to prevent a multiinvestors national corporation wanting to do so from sellthe ing its product to its parent at a phoney pnce? Sure, the Commissioner of Taxation can take a view on that and has done so. It has going on in the meat industry for years. But does that disadvantage Australia in foreign exchange terms? Should we be looking at areas of control of that kind? Should we have a differential tax structure to encourage multinational corporations to go into partnership with us rather than set rules the meaning of which is stUl to be determined to a large degree by the Board? I have referred to the matters of pricing policies, licence and patent fees and gearing differential tax structures, and on gaming-which , much to my disappointment, is not dealt with in this statement to any degree. It says:' We will not worry about that at this stage'. I hope we will worry about it. I hope that this Parliament worries about this subject and I hope that it worries about it in the future with more depth than I believe it has given to it in recent years.",64
108,Mr MACPHEE,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Much has been said in this debate which shows the broad and complex nature of the foreign investment policy. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) and others have touched many issues which have shown us that it is impossible to cover the subject in the 10 minutes have been allotted to us, but in the 10 minIt utes I have I wish to touch on some of the matters which will have to be dealt with by the Foreign Investment Review Board when it commences its First, the 50 per cent rule will prove very difficult in practice unless the Board can assist in formulating a public education program that ensmall investors to invest in the exploration and development projects to which the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has referred. It is a fact of Ufe that Australians have been shon term thinking regarding high risk, long term projects. The capital market may, as the Treasurer we has said, be continuously improving its capacity to invest in such ventures, but it has a long way to go. The Board may well make recommendations of its own regarding its own place in the educational program which will be necessary. In doing this it will be aided by the obligation imposed upon it by the Treasurer to have foreign exploration companies advising it annually of this the details of their forward exploration Secondly, whUe the Treasurer's statement and attachment set out the criteria for the examination of foreign investment proposals, foreign still have the problem of ascertaining weight, the interpretations and the value low judgments which the Board may give and make when applying those criteria. The honourable been member for Macarthur has touched on many of the difficulties involved in that respect. Those teria are set out in the attachment at page 1290 of Hansard of 1 April. They are a detailed and comprehensive response by the Treasurer to sentiments which seem to be widely held in the community. The price which the community may well have to pay for those sentiments, for the evaluation of the foreign investment proposals, may be a slower rate of national economic growth and therefore a slower rate of improvement in individual living standards, especially material standards. In the case by case study which the Board will have to do it will need to develop a coherent and reasonably predictable set of rules for the application of these criteria. Uncertainty or undue delay could well drive potential investors away from Austraha. This system of precedence leads to another question, that is, the extent to which the deliberations of the Board should be made public. The case of takeovers is a controversial one. One would say that in that case it should not be. There has been a great deal of criticism of the Foreign Takeovers Committee for virtually offering an offeree company to competitors of the offeror. Even the public announcement of the fact that the takeover is being investigated by the Committee has had this effect. But in the case of new ventures some public record of the findings of the administration of the criteria would no doubt have a great deal of positive impact on potential investors. They then might view investment in Australia more favourably, whereas an uncertain situation stemming from secrecy could only deter such investors. The final duty which is imposed upon the Board at page 1287 of Hansard is certainly very pertinent. Thirdly, the statement shows clearly that there is much more to the question of control than equity. The application of Australian laws in matters such as those set out in the criteria is important in relation to control. In addition, it is also important that foreign companies be obliged to provide information similar to that required regularly from public compames by stock exchanges. There is no doubt that listing requirements do lead companies to make greater disclosures than those made by non-listed companies. I believe that there are many reasons why the Government should encourage the idea of listing foreign companies on our stock exchanges. The mere fact that such compames would make disclosures would be reported in the local media. That would remove much of the possibiUty of their acting contrary to Australia's national interests, that is, contrary to the criteria set out in the Treasurer's statement. It is the fears cri- by Australians that somehow foreign companies not making that disclosure will act contrary to Australia's national interests that underlie the setting of the criteria. Foreign companies would, if they were Usted on our stock exchanges, be obtiged to report to the exchanges on the acquisition and disposal of their major assets. They would be obliged to indicate their dividend policies and to explain their performances for the year. A foreign company listed locally would then find it harder to stand a loss in Australia in order to make profits elsewhere. That is another fear underlying some of the emotion in the foreign investment debate in recent years. This comment has been made by the Jackson Committee in volume 1 of its report at page 198 and by Mr Valder, the Chairman of the Sydney Stock Exchange, as reported in the Australian Financial Review of 5 AprU. Before closing I would like to make a few other brief references. First, there is and there will remain the problem of the definition of a foreign company. This is one of the matters which I am sure the honourable member for Macarthur had in mind when he expressed uncertainty about the ministerial statement. There is a problem in Australia with Australian companies which regard themselves as really being Australian companies but which because they or a subsidiary have some foreign equity holding are classified here as foreign companies. They are Australian managed and in many respects they meet the criteria set out in the Treasurer's statements; yet they are classified as foreign companies. When they go abroad, whether it be to New Zealand or any of our other neighbours, and become multi-national companies they are still classified as foreign companies. This makes it very difficult. It is not just irksome; it can be and has been an inhibition to investment in Australia by overseas companies coming into a all- minor partnership situation with wholly or what have been previously wholly Australian companies. Secondly, there may well need to be provision for appeal from or at least some review of the proceedings and decisions of the Review Board. This is something which will have to be given consideration by the Treasurer and by the Board itself. Thirdly, the procedures of the Board, the procedures themselves and the legislation when it comes to this House should stress the need for expeditious decision making by the Board. As I have said before, any slow decisions would have an adverse impact on investment. Fourthly, there ought to be a greater use of foreign loan funds to supplement equity brought from overseas. This would supplement not only equity but also portfolio investment. This greater use of foreign or overseas loan funds would support the aim of the Government in increasing Australian control because it would boost our scarcest commodity which, of course, is capital. This question of seas loan funds is of great importance when it comes to the expansion of existmg companies in Austraha. There is of course a limit to such borrowings. There is a limit for reasons which are related to our balance of payments situation as well as to the financial structure of the companies themselves but borrowings should be encouraged in the future. My 10 minutes have expired. Time limits always make debates on complex matters unsatisfactory, but with these, I hope, constructive comments I do genuinely support the thoughtful statement of the Treasurer. Question resolved in the affirmative. BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE sion of The following Bills were returned from the section'. Senate without amendment: Financial Agreement Bill 1976. National Debt Sinking Fund Amendment Bill 1976. ACTS CITATION BILL 1976 Debate resumed from 25 March on motion Mr Ellicott: That the Bill be now read a second time.",65
109,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"This is a Bill small in content; nevertheless it is very important in the sense that it will most pieces of legislation that have already gone through this Parliament and it will certainly affect the Bills that will be introduced in the future and become Acts of this Parliament. To the extent that this Bill is small in content, probably reduces some of the weight that should be given to its importance. The Opposition welable comes the Bill. It does not oppose it. I want to in the course of discussing the content of the Bill that first of all we appreciate the work of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. One who has had the experience of being in government recognises the tremendous effort that has to into bringing into legal terms by way of a Bill the thoughts and the policies of a government. It is worthwhile placing on record our appreciation of the dedication of Mr Comans and his staff in thisfield.I think it is somewhat to regretted that in the past we have never given equate remuneration to this position. In fact, equate remuneration has often been a promise but not brought into fruition because of political intervention and the disallowance of salaries provisions. I trust that in future in amendments to remuneration legislation we remove the disallowance provision. Not only would that be of oversome benefit to the Parliament but it would also assist people such as the Parliamentary Counsel who for a period of years have been working in a situation in which they were getting less than the people working for them, and that is not justice by any stretch of imagination. There has been much improvement in recent years in the modernisation of the form of Commonwealth Acts and this piece of legislation goes a long way towards achieving that aim. I am reminded that in recent years we have done a number of things that might appear to be somewhat insignificant but are very important. The changes include the use offiguresinstead of words in expressing numbers, dates and references to other sections of Acts and the omisthe expressions 'of this Act' and 'of this It might seem somewhat pointless to talk about those matters, but the changes had to be made. Another change was the use of abbreviated cross-references by referring to a numeral in a paragraph and also the inclusion of a table of provisions at the beginning of lengthy Bills which I think most members would welSecond Reading come as being of some advantage. It is thought by that there should be some more explanatory memoranda available to members of Parliament. I know that this is a difficulty. I think it could be done not in the strictest form but by way affect In the New South Wales State Legislature every Bill has in it thefirstsheet which is an explanatory memorandum and it sets out in ordinary layman's language what the particular section intends to mean. I think that is of great help it in the course of debates. I know that the legislation committees of a government have availexplanatory memoranda. I think that withsay out giving away the secrets of government some of that information could be made available. For example, the next matter for discussion on the notice paper is the Trade Practices Amendment Bill which has an explanatory memorandum. I go think that is advantageous but there are other pieces of legislation in respect of which this information does not seem to be available. This Bill deals with technical matters in that it is simplifying the method of the present system be as has been properly explained by the AttorneyadGeneral (Mr Ellicott) in introducing the Bill. We adare virtually doing away with a double year citation. In other words, if an Act such as the Customs Act to which he referred was introduced in 1901 and amended over a period of years no longer will it be necessary to refer to it in the amending years posiuon. It will be deemed to be adequate to refer to it as the Customs Act 1901. I am reminded that there are some very clear examples of the inconvenience that can be found. For example, the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions (Transitional Provisions) Act 1975, made consequential amendments of a minor kind to no less than 14 other Acts. In accordance with the existing system it gave new citations to all those 14 other Acts. The Customs Act 1901-1974 was amended by omitting the words 'through the Post Office' and inserting the words 'by post'. Because of this amendment the Postal and Telecommunications Commission (Transitional Provisions) Act gave the Customs Act a new citation. It became the Customs Act 1901-1975. The existence of that amendment could be very easily overlooked. Another matter which I must confess I did not address my mind to until it was explained to me is what is deemed to be the method of textual amendment. This is provided for in clause 5 of the Bill. I nouce this has been the subject of some considerauon in England by the Renton Committee. I have taken the opportunity of looking at what this Committee has been endeavouring to do in England. It has been talking about how it can improve the introduction of legislation, particularly in the drafting stage. There has been much discussion in the United Kingdom on the question of whether it should continue with the non-textual amendment or the textual amendment. Those who are involved still appear to be wavering between the 2 alternatives. I think it is a much more streamlined fashion and a much more intelligent operation to have textual amendment whereby the amendment being introduced becomes part and parcel of the Bill. Thereby one would not have the problem of having to look at every Act with all its amend the ments to work out what is the present position and then hope that at some stage the Government might get around to a consolidation to vision bring the Act up to date. I notice that in relation to the problems in the United Kingdom there are real difficulties. The Renton Committee had to say: The value of textual amendment to the user of the in helping him to a clearer understanding of the law depends, as we have already said, on the availability editions which will accurately reflect the changes brought about. This in turn depends on the state of ute law being amended. There is less scope for textual amendment if the draftsman is operating on a code which is in need of consolidation; and thus in the case of amendments it would not at present be possible to use the textual method because the amendments would need to be written into texts which are unconsolidated. The report continued: Over the past 25 years the average number of pages of consolidation Acts passed in one year has been 400, and this has probably not kept pace with the rate at which legislation is being amended. First Parliamentary Counselthis is in the United Kingdomestimates that in the whole Statute Book there may be not less than 8000 pages of legislation needing to be consolidated. The Committee states that this is a task which could well take another 20 years just to bring the position up to date. I think that the conclusion of the Renton Committee so far as it relates to this particular section is in favour of what is being done here and has been done here for some time. Over the past few years there has been a change of emphasis in the method of drafting Bills to amend existing legislation. Before that change of emphasis, the commonest method of amending an Act was to state in the amending Bill the substance of the amendment proposed to be made without altering the text of the Act to be amended. Since that change, it has been the practice to amend legislation textually whenever convenience permits. The Opposition welcomes the new practice and recommends that it be appUed as generously as possible. To that extent Australia is ahead of the situation that it is hoped can be applied generously in the United Kingdom. In the course of discussions relating to the possibUity of confusion and misunderstandings, my attention has been drawn to the High Court case of Johnston v. Egg Marketing Board of New a South Wales, reported in 112 Commonwealth Law Reports at page 343. Mr Justice Taylor referred at page 347 to the fact that what was thought was going to be applied, particularly in Australian Capita! Territory, did not happen. Reference was made to the Seat of Government (Administration) Act which contained a prothat the Australian Industries Preservation Act would apply to the Territories, with certain words omitted. The Act that it was intended to this apply was the 1906-09 Act and the day proclaimed for the Act to commence to operate was 1 January 1911. However, there was an statutes alteration to the Australian Industries Preserof good vation Act in 1910, when certain other words being were deleted. The net result was that, although the statthe intention was that the 1909 Act should apply, in fact the 1910 Act applied with as Mr Justice certain Taylor said, a curious legislative muddle. Because of the type of legislation now being introduced, that situation will be avoided. No longer will it be necessary to refer to the year of the amendment. Reference will be made to the Act with the one year and amendments will be noted in a schedule or footnote indicating that the Act itself has been amended. Apparently a number of problems have arisen in recent years when it has been shown clearly that Acts have been amended more than once in the same year. In some of the notes to which I have been referred it has been stated that the main advantage of the new practice is that it is simple and not misleading. Any reference to the Customs Act 1901 will be taken as referring to that Act as amended from time to time, unless the contrary intention appears. There will be a switch in practice. Whereas the double year citation was the norm, it will become the exception. If it is intended in future to refer to legislation not as amended from ume totimebut as in force at a particular date or as amended up to a particular amending Act, it will be necessary to state that explicitly. I wish to refer to some of the problems that have occurred. The broadcasting and television legislation provides for the granting of licences which run for many years. A particular licence will state that it is issued under the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942-1973. If that legislation is amended in 1976 the drafstman will conscientiously update references to the earlier legislation, particularly if the 1976 amendment changes pohcy in relation to licences. Some new advantage may be intended to be conferred on all licensees by the 1976 amendment, but if the advantage is conferred in respect of licences granted under the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942-1976 the advantage will not be conferred on the particular licensee in question because the licence was granted under the Act of 1942-1973. In 1975, 6 Bills were introduced amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act. It was difficult in the later Bills to describe the lation that was being amended. Further, all 6 Bills contained a provision that the basic legislation as amended may be cited as the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918-1975. If other legislation referred to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918-1975, which of the 1975 amendments was being referred to? Of course, those Bills were not passed. Again, in 1973, 5 Acts amending the income tax assessment legislation were passed. A summons stating that it was issued under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1973 would not bring to the notice of the defendant or his lawyer the fact that there were 5 amending Acts in 1973. Having found fewer than the five, they might think that they had found all that there were, yet the fifth Act might be relevant to their case. The income tax assessment legislation contains in one section references to the Meat Industry Act by 2 different double year citations, and lawyers and accountants could be misled by that difference. In summary, Mr Deputy Speaker, what we are doing here is modernising the drafting of legislation. This is a piece of legislation that any government would welcome and any opposition would not oppose. The particular sections I have mentioned relate to the Acts Interpretation Act in the sense that it will refer to amendments which shall be deemed to have been made. In fact they will have been made and there will not be the problem that has arisen in the past where it can apply only in respect of subsequent amendments. Clause 5 provides for a textual amendment relating to section 2 of the Amendments Incorporation Act 1905, and clause 6 covers the position relating to the deletion of the double citation. The Opposition approves of the legislation and wishes it a speedy passage.",67
110,Mr BROWN,UNEMPLOYMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government has a number of pressing and urgent matters to attend to and it is for that reason that I have been asked to speak for only about 5 minutes on this subject. That I agreed to do with some regret, because this is a matter of very great interest and importance and the subject of almost daily conversation where I come from. This is a piece of legislation which, as the Opposition has indicated, should be given a speedy passage through the House because it introduces a reform in the citation of statutes with which one could not disagree. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) already has described amply the nature of the reform. Very briefly, to take the example referred to by the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) in his second reading speech, the reform legisis to avoid the necessity to cite a statute by reference, as in the case of the Customs Act, to the years 1901-1974. It is desirable to amend that citation because the citation tells the reader nothing whatsoever about any amendments that may have been made since 1974. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that the citation in fact might be misleading. So it is felt by the Government, for very good reason, that it is desirable to refer to statutes in other statutes by reference solely to the year in which the Bill became an Act. One could not disagree with the proposition that that is a reform. However, with respect, I think that one question does arise which the Attorney-General might answer for me. That question is: What advantage does that have over a system by which one refers, for example, to the Customs Act 1901? One would have thought that if one referred to the Customs Act simpliciter, without any year appearing after the name of the Act, that would achieve the same purpose and would remove any doubt whatsoever as to whether one should look in the statutes of a particular year to find what had happened to that statute. It would avoid the necessity of tracing through the subsequent history of the statute. In other words, when one sees a reference to the Act as the Customs Act 1901 one is really in no better position than if one saw a reference to the Act as the Customs Act simpliciter. Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly a reform in the manner in which it has been proposed, and one cannot argue against the proposition that it is a reform and that consequently it should be supported by the House. The question of the citation of the Act is not of course the end of the matter. One would hope that this would be the first step in a series of reforms which I hope the Attorney-General will initiate in the whole area of the drafting of statutes, in references to statutes, to the raw materials and source material available, to inform the reader as to what amendments have been made and where those amendments can be found. It is a soul-destroying task, as I have found in the past, and which may mean to the public hours of very expensive labour, to ascertain what amendments have been made to Acts, where those amendments are to be found and what those amendments contain. It was, for that reason, very pleasing to me to find that the Commonwealth has published a consolidation of the statutes up to and including 1973.1 should like to read briefly some words contained in the foreword to the first volume of that consolidation by the then Attorney-General, Senator Murphy. He said a lot of course which is best forgotten, but I think that the remarks he made in this foreword are worthy of remembering. The then Attorney General said: It is essential that the publication date so that those interested what the law is. He went on to say: The Australian Government believes that this consoliyear dation will achieve that purpose. These volumes uncluttered by those Acts of the Parliament which have expired or become inoperative. At a later stage in the same foreword he said: Our Government believes that consolidations should occur at intervals of about 5 years. I agree with the that proposition and I hope that that is one reform of the previous Government which will be continued by the present Government and future governments. The law should be available to the citizen and to the lawyer and they should both be able to find the law without the present Herculean task of ploughing through volumes of dusty statutes to find out what the current law is and what it provides. I hope that some consideration will be given to the Victorian practice of publishing at frequent intervals reprints of individual statutes, which are kept in a loose-leaf volume. Practitioners of the law subscribe to the publication, and every now and again they get reprints of statutes which bring them up to date with all of the amendments. So a person need refer merely to one statute in his volume and there is the whole of the law on that one subject. That would seem to me to be a very desirable reform which should be introduced for Commonwealth legislation. Nevertheless I come back to the basic Bill which is presently before the House and remind the House that, as I said at the outset, this is undoubtedly a reform which is introduced by the Bill, and a reform with which one could not disagree. Apart from commending the Bill, I repeat what I said at the outset, that I only regret that the Government's busy program prevents me from speaking longer on this gripping and enthralling subject.",69
111,Mr FRY,UNEMPLOYMENT," I want to support very briefly the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) in supporting the Acts Citation Bill. I think it is a Bill that all members of the Parliament will welcome, as they should welcome any measure which would tend to simplify the method of citation of Commonwealth Acts and which would also tend to make the Acts more readily available to the quite large body of people who are interested in them. This is precisely what this Bill sets out to do. I think honourable members will also agree that the present system is undeniably clumsy; it is confusing, it is time-consuming and clearly it does not fit the needs of the community as they of our laws be kept up to exist today. can find out quickly and easily I shall just mention a few of the specific matters which will undoubtedly improve the situation. Certainly the elimination of the double citation is an excellent innovation and will will be reduce confusion and no doubt reduce the possibilities of errors arising in legal judgments. The provision of footnoting, for instance, for every amending Act together with all previous amending Acts will, I am sure, prove to be a clearer and less misleading system of citation than the one which presently exists. It is particularly pleasing to note the statement of the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) that this new system of citation should reduce the pressure of work in the Attorney-General's Department, more particularly in the legislation and drafting and publications sections. It is hoped that the easing of pressure of work in these sections will particularly reduce the delays that are at present being experienced in the publication of a wide range of Commonwealth Acts. It is unfortunate that the present staff ceilings will obviously make this more difficult to accomplish. I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to comment briefly on this aspect of the Bill because in my electorate I frequently hear complaints from constituents and students who, for various reasons, are unable to secure copies of particular Acts. I have no doubt that this experience is common to many members of this House. At present there are undoubtedly considerable problems concerning access to published legislation. It could be recalled that in July last year the then Attorney-General, Mr Enderby, announced that a consolidated printing of Australian Capital Territory laws would be carried out last year. According to Mr Enderby it was considered necessary at the time because several bound volumes of yearly ordinances and regulations were just not procurable. I understand that this consolidation has not been completed. Here again this is due to lack of staff in the Attorney-General's Department. Such a consolidation is undoubtedly urgently needed in Australian Capital Territory legislation because at present access to Australian Capital Territory laws and indeed to all laws of the Commonwealth Parliament is generally quite cumbersome. It is often expensive and in some cases it is just impossible to obtain copies of the various laws. To obtain all the laws relevant to the Australian Capital Territory, for example, it is necessary for anyone interested to purchase at considerable expense the Acts of Parliament 1901-1973, plus the Acts of subsequent years, together with the laws of the Territory up to 1975, plus any laws of subsequent years. The promised consolidation of Australian Capital Territory Acts, together with the 12 volumes of the Acts of Parliament which are already consolidated will no doubt go some way towards catering for the demand for up to date legislation, but at the same time it will be by no means the final solution. The bound consolidation of Acts is admittedly useful to those who want to refer frequently to a wide range of Acts, but it is not much use to an individual who merely wishes to obtain a copy of one Act or of an amended Act. In fact in some cases it can be quite a tortuous process to obtain all the legislation available on one particular topic. As an example, if I want to obtain a copy of the Banking Act, I find that although it has been reprinted in pamphlet form the legislation has been amended several times since the days of the reprint and some of the amending Acts are out of print. In such circumstances the only way I can obtain the law on banking is by purchasing the entire 12-volume consolidation. In some cases even this is not available. The complete legislation on workers compensation in the Australian Capital Territory does not seem to be available. One cannot get all the legislation which makes up the workers compensation ordinance from the Australian Government Publishing Service but this legislation is frequently sought by individuals involved in compensation claims. It is often required by union representatives who act on their behalf. Even after the proposed consolidation is completed it still will not be possible to obtain the legislation separately. The only way the interested individual could sight such legislation would be through the reference service of the National Library or through an appropriate government department. Other Acts brought to my notice as being difficult to obtain or which are not available are those relating to compensation for Australian Government employees. Another piece of legislation which is frequently sought after and which people seem to have great difficulty in getting is the Associations Incorporation Ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory. There are many community organisations in Canberra which require guidance on this Ordinance and it is not available. The Weights and Measures Ordinance is one which students frequently find difficulty in getting, particularly the recent amendments. It is in great demand and copies are simply not available. It is not only the older legislation which is unprocurable. For example, when a new ordinance is made it is often quite a long time before copies are available from the Australian Government Publishing Service. I would like to endorse the view expressed by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith that it is extremely important that published copies of all legislation be readily and cheaply available in an up-to-date form not only to the legal profession, to the judiciary, to public servants and to students, but also to individual people who may have particular problems which require reference to legislauon. In conclusion, I suggest to the Attorpense ney-General that having introduced this Acts Citation Bill he also give urgent consideration to the general problem of making Acts and Ordinances more readily available to all people seeking them.",70
112,Mr LUSHER,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Speaking briefly, I want to associate the National Country Party with this Acts Citation Bill. The Attorney General (Mr Ellicott) indicated in his second reading speech on this Bill that it contains the necessary legislative provision to enable a simplification to be effected in the method of citation of Commonwealth Acts which have been amended. I think this Bill is welcomed in all sectors of our community which are concerned with these matters. It is my understanding that the legal profession welcomes it and that the Parliamentary Counsel welcomes it. By and large the Parliament is happy with it. It is not being opposed by the Opposition and it should have the effect of reducing the opportunity for misleading titles to the legislation this Parliament passes. For a longtimethere has been a degree of conaltering fusion over the use of the double citation. It always has been difficult for legal practitioners, the general pubhc and other interested people to know whether an Act has been amended since the date of the last citation which appears on copy of the Act which may be available. It is sigto nificant that the single citation is used in many other countries similar to ours, namely Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and, basically, the United Kingdom. It is also used in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. Perhaps the exlegislation perience of New South Wales is indicative of the problems caused by double-year citations. For a period New South Wales did use the system Acts which we presently use in the Commonwealth but then it reverted to using the one-year system which is used in Victoria and Tasmania. The Parnot liamentary Counsel in New South Wales did clauses revert to the system of single-year citation which we are about to adopt and I think the experience in the Commonwealth will be similarly advantageous. I agree with previous speakers that there is a requirement to keep before the Attorney- (9.39)-Briefl General and the Government the need for conincorporation tinued consolidation of legislation and for all forms of legislation to be readily available. think some credit is due to the former Adminisme tration for its decision and action in consolidatimmediately ing the Acts of the Parliament. This was the first time it had been done for a considerable number of years. Although a reasonable amount of exis involved I think this is a practice which ought to be continued on a regular basis. It ought to be encouraged by the Parliament. It is very difficult to deal with legislative matters if we cannot readily obtain the basic or source material. I believe the Attorney-General has this matter under review and that he will continue to see that legislation is available and that consolidations are not unnecessarily delayed. I do not want to extend the debate- I realise there are a lot of other things to be done-bu t I want to associate myself and my Party with this Bill. I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity of speaking in this debate.",72
113,Mr CREAN,UNEMPLOYMENT," I had not intended to speak in this debate but I was provoked a little by what my friend the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) said about the banking legislation. While he may have some difficulty in getting consolidation of all the banking legislation, the one thing the law has not been able to do is to define a bank. Despite all the zeal tonight for simplification there are some matters that are complicated. Whatever is done about citations, complicated subjects are not made simple by the use of this sort of device. I had some experience in this matter when writing an Act, which I think is going to be very significant in the future, about what are called the non-bankingfinancialinstitutions. I am pleased see my colleagues the technocrats sitting in the gallery but no one has yet defined a bank. They can tell you what a bank is not. With all respect to my friend the honourable member for Fraser I hope we can get simplification in the banking and that we can get little pamphlets that will contain it, but I hope too much is not expected of this change in title dealt with in the Citation Bill. The objective is simple enough but certain of the matters upon which we have to legislate contain complexities of their own. It is easy to get clarity. One of the great simple in the Constitution is section 92. It is known as the layman's clause. However, until recently it caused much more complication than many other clauses. I hope too much is not expected of the simple change of title.",72
114,Mr WENTWORTH,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Mackellar ) y I again make a plea for a quicker of Acts when an amendment has been made. We are altogether too lax and lazy in I issuing copies of an Act as amended. It seems to that the right and proper time to do this is after this Parliament has passed an amendment. It is at that time that the whole of the circumstances are in the mind of the Parliamentary Counsel and surely at that time it would be simple for the ParUamentary Counsel to delegate the task of framing an incorporated amended Act to some junior and proper officer in his Office and to see that as a matter of course the amended Act was issued in its proper form as an automatic procedure after it had received the royal assent. It is altogether wrong that we should not know, without quite complicated reference, what the law is. When this Parliament has passed an amending Act I believe that the amended Act should be issued almost instantaneously and as a matter of course. I can remember that when we talked about the daUy Hansard people said: 'It cannot be done. It will be too expensive. It isridiculous.'But, as a matter of fact, the daUy Hansard now comes out automatically and amended Acts should issue automatically after they have received the royal assent.",72
115,Mr ELLICOTT,UNEMPLOYMENT," I wtil not be long. I just want to express my thanks to honourable members for the very constructive debate that we have had on this rather important measure. I join in the expression of appreciation of the work of parliamentary counsel. Their work is not easy. Indeed it is not easy to get the sort of people who are needed. They have a very special quality of mind and of capacity to apply themselves to the task. It is not the more glamorous side to the law but in a sense it is the most important. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) has suggested that Acts be printed straight away but that overlooks some of the associated problems. The law that comes out must be precise and accurate. The demand for accuracy is much greater, of course, in relation to Acts of Parliament than it is in relation to Hansard. Many inaccuracies appear in Hansard if we perhaps choose to look for them. But an Act of Parliament should not be inaccurate. On at least one occasion even recently there was an instance where an Act of Parliament when printed was found not to contain some vital words. That is an indication that inaccuracies can occur. I hope it does not happen very often and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel seeks to ensure that it does not happen. One matter that was mentioned and on which my comment was sought by the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr cerned why we do not refer to the Customs Act rather than the Customs Act 1901. Sometimes one will find a number of Acts of the same name and it is helpful to know to which particular Act one is referring, whether it is the Trade Practices Act of 1965, the Trade Practices Act of 1973 or whatever it may be. For instance, there was the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1922 and before that the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1915 or 1916. One might recall that they were reviewed in 1936 and the present Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 was commenced but, of course, the previous Acts remained in force in relation to assessments to be made in respect of years prior to 1936. So it does become important, on analysis, to know the year of the Act. Reference has been made to consolidation and also to the avaUabUity of legislation. This is a matter that is constantly of concern to me. Last week when I was in the Northern Territory I found that some prints of ordinances for 1975 were not yet avaUable. This is due to the tedious work that has to be done in relation to the printing of ordinances and I have taken steps to ensure that these ordinances are brought up to date. I am referring to prints of current law which are not available even to practitioners. Sometimes we tend to neglect the basic problems and institutions of government. I think that we will find increasingly in the Parliament that we have to spend more money on the basic institution Uke the law, its production, presentation and consolidation. Indeed, as the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), said, there is a need for simplicity in the law. Often this cannot be achieved and sometimes what seems simple to laymen is very complex in terms of what lawyers have to draft. But constantly we have to be on our guard to ensure so far as we can that the law is certain, simple and avaUable. To the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry), I can only suggest that although it may involve some breach of copyright if he wants a copy of the Banking Act he should not perhaps buy the whole 13 volumes but should be encouraged to take from the consolidation a photostat of the Banking Act so that he would have it up to date. Questions of that nature are constantly before us. Reprints of the important Acts Uke the Income Tax Assessment Act are brought out every year. The purpose is to ensure that the Acts in common use are readily available. I can assure honourable members that legislation in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Temtory will receive my Brown) concontinuing attention. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Ellicott) read a third dme. NA DEATH BENEFITS (PENSION INCREASES) BILL 1976 Bill presented by Mr Killen, and read a first time.",73
116,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE FORCE RETIREMENT AND," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends 2 Acts of this Parliament. amends the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Act and the Defence Force Retirement and will Death Benefits Act. The difference between the 2 pension. Acts ofParliament can be recalled by the House by going back to the Jess Committee's report of 1972 when a new Defence Force Retirement Benefits Act was proposed by that Committee. The incoming Government introduced legistween lation to give effect to the recommendations of the Jess Committee's report. This Bill falls into parts. The first part is preliminary, the second part deals with the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act and the third part deals with what may describe as the post-Jess Committee's Act, namely the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefit Act. In this Bill the Government acknowledges the fact that there is an interim method of adjustculating ment being made. I am bound to tell the House in simple candour that the Government would that be anxious to stand back with the method of adjustment. In other words, we would have a tinct preference for a permanent and regular method of adjustment. This was one of the recommendations made by the Jess Committee's report in 1972. It was the previous Government's intentions to introduce a permanent method updating benefits or pensions received under the respective legislation. I would like to make it clear that it is the present Government's tion to have a permanent method of updating sioners and making adjustments to benefits received recipients under the 2 Acts. But I would hope that the beneficiaries would be generous and indulgent enough to acknowledge the fact that the Government has just recently considered conditions relating to the Commonwealth Superthe annuation Act and the basis there for updating pensions. As a consequence of that the Governfor ment is now proceeding to a consideration Third Reading introducing permanent methods of updating pensions payable under these 2 Acts. Having said that, may I say that these pensions will be paid retrospective to July 1975. With respect to the 2 Acts that this Bill seeks to amend, the pensions which are paid are marginally different. In the case of the defence force retirement benefit pension recipients the method of alteration is related to the Government's share of the pension. Both Acts which this legislation seeks to amend have of course a clear relaSecond Reading tionship to the 17.6 per cent increase in the consumer price index to, I believe, March 1975. In case of DFRB pensions the Government's share will be multiplied by 1.4 times 17.6. This calculation is applied to the Government's share It of the DFRB pension. But in the case of defence force retirement and death benefits recipients it be onetimes17.6 applied to the whole of the There would be very few members of this Parliament who would know better than you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there are distinctions be the 2 schemes. While it would not be appropriate for me now in introducing a Bill of this 3 nature to dilate on those differences, I observe that these differences exist and as a consequence of them there is a different method of updating I the 2 pensions. In general terms there will be approximately a 20 per cent increase in the pension entitlement of DFRB beneficiaries. Some adjustments in respect of arrears will be made in the case of DFRB pensioners as the position has now been cleared in respect of the method of calthe government share of that pension. You wtil appreciate further, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is an area by no means free of technicalities and complexities. Indeed, when one looks at disthe various categories under which the Government's share of pension may be payable, that point is clear to ready demonstration. Adjustments will, of course, be made to pensions paid to widows and to children who have an of entitlement under the legislation. The only other matter I would draw to the intenattention of the House concerns DFRDB penwho retired prior to July 1975. An adjustby ment will be made to the percentage which will affect their entitlement in respect of the 12-month period. Sir, it would not be inappropriate to conclude on this note: You, as the honour the able member for Herbert, my honourable friend honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), the honourable and gallant member Isaacs (Mr Hamer), Senator Devitt and of Senator Maunsell- 3 honourable members from this place and 2 senators from the other placehave continued to show a very lively and a very compassionate interest in the welfare of ex-servicemen and in particular in securing the appropriate adjustments to the pension entitlements of ex-servicemen. I would take leave on behalf of the Government to thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Isaacs and the 2 senators to whom I have referred for the continued interest in this very difficult area of law. I commend the Bill to the House. Mr Crean-Before the Minister sits down he might explain the magical formula that 1.4 multiplied by five-sevenths comes to one?",74
117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE FORCE RETIREMENT AND,"I think this can be decided during the second reading debate. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1976 Bill presented by Mr Hunt, and read a first time.",75
118,Mr HUNT,AGED PERSONS HOSTELS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to extend the tive operation of the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-74 to enable grants to be made for aged persons hostel projects for which applicadons have been lodged but which, for one reason or another, could not be commenced within the time limits imposed by the Act. The amendment will not re-open the legislauon for lodgement of appUcations for new or additional grants. The Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-74 was introduced with effect from 27 September 1972 and was designed to operate for a period of 3 years. The reason for this, as stated by the Hon. W. C. Wentworth, the then Minister for Social Services, in introducing the Bill on 14 September 1972, was to encourage the building of additional hostel accommodation for the frail aged within a short period oftime.The measure was not introduced as a substitute for the continuing program operating under the provisions of the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954-74 which as honourable members are aware provides for the Commonwealth to subsidise the cost of building self-contained, hostel and nursing accommodation for aged or disabled persons. The objective is that all beds funded under the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-1974 are hosteltype, catering specifically for the frail aged and those in greatest need of accommodation because of advanced age and limited financial resources. In introducing the Act it was intended that by encouraging additional hostel accommodation there would be a lessening of the pressure for admission to nursing homes by people who had no real need for nursing care. Since the inception of the Act 154 grants have been approved which have attracted grants in the region of $64m. When all these projects have been completed accommodation will have been provided for 5700 aged persons. Under the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-1974 the Commonwealth Government meets the capital cost of providing hostel-type accommodation for 2 additional aged persons for every one accommodated in an unsubsidised home, or one additional person for every two in an existing home subsidised on a $1 for $1 basis prior to 1957. To achieve the objective of encouraging early construction of new accommodation the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-1974 presently has a condition that a grant shall not be Second Reading made in respect of a hostel unless the hostel was approved under section 5 of the Act on or before 27 September 1975 and construction commenced within 12 months from the date of approval of the hostel. Under the Aged Persons effecHostels Act 1972-1974 many organisations were approved as eligible and acquired the right to purchase or construct new hostel-type beds subject to the availability of Commonwealth funds. The original legislation was amended on 9 December 1974 to enable organisations which wished to do so to transfer theirrightsto other eligible organisations. These rights were sought by some organisations and this gave a considerable stimulus to the program and created a demand for grants in respect of hostels that exceeded the number that could be funded in 1975-76 within the Budget allocation of $40m. In order to preserve organisations' hostel bed entitlements under the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-1974, the previous Government decided in August 1975 to approve all outstanding proposals under section 5 of the Act on or before 27 September 1975-the last day on which, under the existing legislation, a hostel could be approved-bu t to defer the making of a grant in a large number of cases because of insufficient funds. This resulted in the previous Government deferring in excess of 300 applications for grants under this legislauon. These are valued at in excess of $ 134m. At the same ume these organisations were given an assurance by the previous Government that their rights under the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-1974 would be preserved even though the making of grants in respect of their projects had been deferred. Under the existing Act, projects must be commenced not later than 27 September 1976. If projects are not commenced by that date, as the legislauon now stands eligible organisations would lose their previously approved entitlements. The Government has decided that, to enable an annual program of construction to be undertaken and to ensure that the rights of organisations which have acquired entitlements under the legislation are preserved, there should be an extension of the time within which the erection of a hostel can be commenced. An amendment to the existing legislation will give organisations with existing rights 12 months from the date on which a grant is actually approved to plan and commence construction of their hostels. Provided this condition is met, the legislation as amended will authorise the Director-General to actually pay the grant. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) adjourned. NA Debate resumed from 25 March on motion by Mr Howard: That the Bill be now read a second time.",75
119,Mr YOUNG,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL,"The was Opposition will not take its opposition to these amendments to the point of voting against them or of causing a division in the House. However, we are taking the opportunity, as people inside and outside the House will observe, to Barwick'smake stress the importance which we place on this legislation and the way in which we intend to monitor any attempt by this Government to water down what we regard as one of the most important pieces of legislation introduced by Australian Labor Party Government during its term of office from 1972 to 1975. The present Government's eagerness to amend the Trade Practices Act is in marked contrast to the reluctance of Liberal-Country Party governments previous years to legislate at all in this vital area. Australians had to wait until the election of Labor government before effective trade practices legislation was passed. The passage of Labor's Bill in 1973 brought Australia into line with other Western democracies. Every other major industrial nation had stringent laws against unfair trade practices and monopolisation. Most countries had laws to protect consumers. Australia had neither. Successive Liberal governments refused to control restrictive practices or to protect consumers from unfair commercial dealings. It was left to a Labor government to take action. Whilst making this point about the protection offered to consumers, I must say that I was highly amused by a Liberal Party advertisement last evening. I saw the Premier of New South Wales telling the people of New South Wales that they ought to vote for his Government because of the way in which it protects the consumers in New South Wales. He stipulated some of the ways in which his Government was moving. It seemed to be a re-reading of the history book of South Australia about 10 years ago. The Dunstan Labor Government, as would be expected of a Labor government, moved in this area of reform a long time ago. Obviously the people of New South Wales would be far better served by a reform government with Neville Wran as Premier than they would be by the people who have been in charge of New South Wales for 10 years and who have done so little. We took action in fulfilment of undertakings at 2 successive Federal elections. The Trade Prac1976 tices Bill brought down in 1973 was one of the Second Reading great legislative reforms passed through this Parliament. It is a monument to a former Attorney General, Senator Murphy. For all its importance, it had no easy passage in this Parliament. The first Bill was frustrated by the double dissolution forced by the Opposition in 1974; the second Bill passed with amendments later that year. The Liberal Party has never shown the slightest enthusiasm for trade practices legislation or any both concern for the problems and abuses which such legislation necessary. Sir Garfield original attempt to legislate on these matters was effectively frustrated by previous Liberal governments at the behest of commercial and business interests. The Restrictive Trade the Practices Act, which the Liberals eventually passed, was largely ineffectual. It allowed abuses and malpractices to flourish until a Labor government took action against them. Restrictive practices have long been rife in in Australia. Most of them are undesirable. They cause prices to be maintained at artificially high a levels. They enable particular enterprises or groups of enterprises to attain positions of economic dominance which are then susceptible to abuse. They interfere with the interplay of competitive forces which are the foundation of any market economy. They allow discriminatory action against small businesses, exploitation of consumers, and feather-bedding of industries. All these evils were outlawed or effectively curtailed by our legislation. Let no one imagine that the Opposition supported our proposals. True, it lacked the courage to vote against them in the Parliament, but it showed no enthusiasm for the principles of our Bill. When the Bill was before the Parliament, the Opposition moved an amendment to delete the whole of Part V, relating to consumer protection. It argued that consumer protection was a State matter. It was the old Liberal dodge for avoiding responsibility, the old Liberal pretext for doing nothing. Of course, there are areas where State government authorities and protection bureaus can operate quickly and effectively. But the bulk of the products and services bought by Australian consumers are marketed nation-wide. Clearly they should be covered by national legislation. Can anyone be confident that this vital part of our legislation will be safe under the Fraser Government? The Australian people must be wary of any attempt to water down the Trade Practices Act. There have been clear signs that this is the Government's intention. The Liberals said nothing about their intentions during the election campaign. The Fraser Government has never been frank or open in its promises-eithe r those it makes or those it breaks. In the Governor General's Speech on 17 February we had for the first time a promise that the Trade Practices Act would be reviewed. We were not told the purpose of this review. We were not told who would carry it out. We were not told how long it would take. The obvious conclusion to be drawn is that the present Act will be weakened. The Bill now before the house is of minor importance in itself, but may well be a forerunner of further attacks on the substance and functions of the Act. Now the last cause for community foreboding is the decision to place the administration of the Act within the responsibility of the Minister for Busi- ness ness and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard). The Minister has already shown himself to be an uncritical admirer of the business community. He has gone on record with the statement that consumer protection should not be allowed to 'interfere' with the free exercise of commercial freedom- a statement with sinister implications for the future of trade practices legislation. There has been a whole series of hostile statements and intimidatory references to the Trade Practices Commission by Liberal Ministers. They establish a clear pattern of hostility, indeed bitterness, towards the Act. On 15 February, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) accused the Commission of harassing business and causing unemployment. The Melbourne Age reported on 27 March: The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Howard, gave notice yesterday that the interests of consumers were being significandy downgraded on a Federal level. Mr Howard, speaking at an Australian Marketing Institute lunch, indicated strongly that business interests would be held foremost when the Government's review of the Trade Practices Act was launched next week. Details of the review would be announced in Parliament next week, he told the audience. But after lunch, he told the Press: 'Don't hold me to that'. During and after the lunch he also said: There were no plans yet to put the national companies Act legislation before Parliament: There were no plans yet to reconstitute the Senate Committee inquiring into legislation for a corporations and exchange commission: He had noted, but not made any decision on, the call from Victoria's Attorney-General, Mr Wilcox, for the Federal Government to join the Interstate Corporate Affairs Commission. It is hardly an impressive record of ministerial activity and resolution. The Government is restricting the Commission's activities as part of its futile and misguided economy measures. A report in the Brisbane Sunday Mail on 21 March stated: The number of prosecutions under trade practices legislation is expected to fall dramatically following Government decisions to reduce spending. The Trade Practices Commission will have to curb its activities. Some TPC inquiries have been delayed or postponed in an effort to meet the Government's stringent demands that only essential spending proceed. Officers of the Commission expect their work load to drop markedly in the next few months as planned investigations are wound down. An Assistant Commissioner, Mr J. V. MCKeown, has made it clear that the cuts will not stop legal action already under way. The cuts came just at thetimewhen the Commission was starting to escalate its investigations into fundamental busipractices which it considers could restrict trade and competition or could mislead and deceive consumers. Because officers of the Commission have been severely restricted in their right to travel interstate they can no longer follow up investigations in person. Instead, State officers have to take over where the Federal office finds that more detailed inquiry is needed in the State in which a company may be operating. One of the functions of the present Act is to delete all references to the 'Attorney-General' and replace them with the words 'the Minister'. In other words, the adrninistration of this Act will no longer be clothed with the power and authority of the first law officer of Austraha but will be handed over to an inexperienced Minister whose very portfolio is a contradiction in terms. It should be obvious to every honourable member that the interests of the business community and the interests of consumers are fundamentally opposed-at least insofar as consumer protection matters are concerned. All these matters will now come under a highly contentious and heavily politicised portfoUo of questionable value. To hand over the trade practices legislation to this Minister and to this Department is to compromise its strength and effectiveness. The Trade Practices Act was a landmark in our legislative history. It must not be weakened or destroyed by a Government sympathetic to what a former British Prime Minister, Edward Heath, has catied 'the unacceptable face of capitalism'. Tbis Government has already shown its readiness to side with the wealthier and more powerful sections of the community against the weak, the disadvantaged and the needy. It has already shown its wUlingness to break promises and deceive the people whenever it suits the Prime Minister. The Trade Practices Act must not fall victim to this process of deception and distorted priorities. In thefightagainst inflation the co-operation of all sections of the community is essential. Co-operation is crucial to the process of economic recovery. Any legislation, any amendments to the Trade Practices Act which unduly favour the business community and discriminate against consumers or small businesses, wtil create new divisions in society, damage consumer confidence and make economic recovery more difficult. The Australian people must ensure that the Trade Practices Act remains a true guardian of the interests of consumers and of genuine and healthy competition in the business community.",76
120,Mr FALCONER,TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT BILL,"The which speech of the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) indicated that the Oppoamendment sition still has a great deal to learn about the facts of economic life in this country. ness bashing of which honourable members opposite were guUty while they were in power still continues, it seems, and they still have not to any realisation of the effect that that had on the employment situation in Australia, on our national income, on workers and on the confrom sumers for whom the Opposition expresses such sympathy. It is a fact that regulatory mechanisms in our commercial life are necessary. Any government in a modern community would appreciate that fact and seek to implement effective trade practices legislation and other complementary legislation. But regulatory mechanisms in commercial hfe also have their costs. If they are applied with inconsistencies and conflicts they add to the costs of the business world. They require additional staff in order to sort out the accounting and legal problems involved in making submissions and satisfying the various regulatory tribunals. So we have to look very carefully from time totimeat the way in which the regulatory mechanisms in our commercial life are operating. I suggest that the very basic, very simple amendments which the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) has introduced rn the form of this Bill which we are discussing at present constitute a very reasonable approach to some very necessary amendments which have been pointed up by the experience of the legislation's operation. Let us look at the major amendments which the Minister has proposed in this Bill. Firstly, it is proposed that the public interest, as represented by the Government view, should be able to be put to the Trade Practices Commission in any matter which it has before it. The honourable member for Port Adelaide did not have anything to say about that. In fact, he did not really seem to be opposing the provisions of the Bill at all. He used a blustery speech to make a few poltiical points and at the same time he was saying that he was not really pressing his Party's opposition to this Bill very strongly. He did not give us any detaUs of what the Opposition saw as being wrong with the Bill. I must admit that it was very hard to listen closely to what he had to say. Surely in applications under consideration by the Commission we should ensure that the public interest is represented. In these sorts of activities where matters can be the subject of cosy discussions between accountants and company lawyers there is a danger that the public interest-the consumers' interest-for the Opposition professes to have some sympathy-wil l not be heard. So that simple has very profound impUcations in hard terms of consumer protection. This measure is in The busifact a consumer protection measure. Secondly the Bill would discontinue the come special treatment which is now available to foreign companies in takeover activities. It is not right that foreign companies should be excluded the provisions of the trade practices legislation as they apply to takeovers. Under the present provisions foreign companies have an advantage over Australian companies when it comes to the bidding and jostling involved in takeover activity. I would have thought that that again was a simple but rather profound change in the legislation which would have the agreement of all sides of this House. Thirdly, the Bill gives power to the Industrial Court to make declaratory judgments and to issue prerogative writs. This is something that has been pointed out by the experience of the eration of the trade practices legislation. In second reading speech the Minister pointed that these sorts of writs have been taken out courts other than the Industrial Court. In view the fact that so much of the operation of this legislation has an impact on the Industrial it is appropriate that the Industrial Court to have this authority so that we keep it in the jurisdiction in the area where the judges have develop some expertise. The fourth change which was mentioned of specifically by the Minister in his second reading speech was the change from the references in old legislation to 'Attorney-General' to the sets references in the amended legislation Minister'. I think that this has some important philosophical significance although perhaps it is not a major change in terms of the operation of the legislation itself. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has taken over a new portfolio which brings together a group of regulatory mechanthe isms available to the Government and to the interested parties in the commercial world to use in their negotiations and in making business dereview cisions. I think it is appropriate that all these regulatory mechanisms should be brought into the one portfoUo so that the one Minister can look at them with some consistency to ensure that each regulatory body is not operating community. against another. From time totimethere have been complaints adjourned. from people in the business world that they have to satisfy different criteria in respect of different regulatory bodies. For example, some businessmen will tell one that in respect of submissions that they have to make to the Trade Practices Commission they are told that they have to compete, that they cannot get together with their competitors and come to certain arrangements, whereas when they go the Industries Assistance Commission they are often told that there must be greater rationalisation in the industry if assistpart ance is to be granted in the way of tariff protecciplined tion. That is the sort of difficulty that businessbody men are faced with in making decisions in this area. Therefore, bringing those regulatory dissolved bodies under the one Minister and ensuring that there can be some consistency in policy formulation is a highly desirable move. The change in the wording of the Bill in this respect gives effect to that philosophy. I believe that there are many good reasons why we ought to look at the operation of the trade practices legislation from time to time. I am opaware of the way in which some aspects of the his legislation have operated in recenttimeactually out to increase company costs. Fromtimetotimethe in Trade Practices Commission has required a great of deal of detaUed accounting information, as has for example the Prices Justification Tribunal, Court another body for which the Minister has reought sponsibUity. That has required an enormous one amount of expense in terms of new, highly paid to staff-cos t accountants, corporate lawyers and so on-wh o have to satisfy the often very detailed instructions and requirements for the provision information to these regulatory bodies, and, as I have already mentioned, sometimes supply the conflicting sets of information or overlapping of information that have to be calculated in a to 'the sUghtly different way. The companies have to go through the process once for the Prices Justification Tribunal, again for the Trade Practices Commission and sometimes to go through it in another form again for the Industries Assistance Commission. I hope that the Minister will be looking at a number of practical effects of the legislation concerning regulatory bodies that he has responsibility for in his portfolio and ensure that in the coming of the trade practices legislation and any other reviews he might be conducting of other regulatory bodies, he wiU seek to ensure that they are acting consistently and in the best interests of efficiency and the welfare of the Debate (on motion by Mr Nicholls) NA New South Wales Election CampaignUnemployment Motion (by Mr Howard) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",78
121,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT," I think it is time that the House was reminded of the fact that the New South Wales Labor Party is of the Australian Labor Party and is disby it. Of course, as we know, the federal is able to go into a State, if it wants to, and declare that the Labor Party of that State shall be or be reconstituted or something of this character. It has done this in more than one State in recent dmes. It is therefore rather strange that in this election campaign which is occurring in New South Wales at present, great efforts are being made to keep the present honourable member for Werriwa, (Mr E. G. Whitlam), the Leader of the Australian Labor Party in this House, out of the State of New South Wales. This is being done in a dishonest way because the New South Wales Labor Party knows perfectly well that it is under the control of the federal body and the federal body seems to be swayed by its demon, the honourable member for Werriwa.",79
122,Mr SHIPTON,ADJOURNMENT,Who controls the federal body?,80
123,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"I am afraid that the honourable member for Werriwa, the Leader of the Opposidon, seems to have a great deal of he influence in it. I can understand that the Labor Party in New South Wales does not want him part there because whatever admiration we may have in this House for the honourable member for Werriwa- I must confess that my admiration not entirely unmixed-it is obvious that his tation stinks throughout Australia obvious",80
124,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable gentleman will not reflect on another honourable member in that way.,80
125,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"Sir, I must be very carefor ful. I am trying to describe as objectively as can",80
126,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable all member will withdraw the imputation.,80
127,Mr WENTWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"I withdraw it, sir. I am trying to describe as objectively as I can what people of Australia think of the honourable member for Werriwa and I am trying to reason why the Leader of the Labor Party in New South Wales has been so reluctant to allow the honourable member for Werriwa to interthe vene in the present State election campaign. I understand this, as I said. It may be quite unfair to the honourable member for Werriwa, but he not a popular person in Australia, and the Leader of the Labor Party in New South Mackellar Wales- a man whose name I believe is Wran, rather obscure person-seem s to have this kind of estimation himself as to the effect that the intervention of the honourable member for Werand riwa might have in the New South Wales tion campaign. This is particularly so by reason of the fact the honourable member for Werriwa was conweek cerned in a certain breakfast may say so without transgressing, believed to be discreditable by most of the people in Australia. What was reprehensible about that deal as shown by the description of it by the honourable member for Werriwa was not just that he was negotiating to take money from Arab terrorist sources; what was much more reprehensible was the implication that the price of that money was to be the selling out of Australia to Arab terrorists if by any chance the Leader of the Opposition had obtained power at the last federal elections. This was the price of what was offered. Otherwise, why should the money have been offered? What was being bought? What was the honourable member for Werriwa trying to sell? I put it to you, Mr Speaker, without any equivocation whatsoever that what the honourable member for Werriwa was trying to sell was Australia. If had been elected at the last federal election he would have been in a position to carry out his of the bargain. This really is the reason why the New South Wales Leader of the Labor Party, Mr Wran, is so very reluctant to allow the is honourable member for Werriwa to appear in reputhe election campaign in New South Wales. One and it is can hardly blame him.",80
128,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,80
129,Mr YOUNG,ADJOURNMENT,"It was very interesting to hear the honourable member Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) try to hide all of I his own sins by attacking the Leader of the Australian Labor Party (Mr Whitlam). We have heard from him an explanation in this House of the accusations that the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) has made about some of the goings on in Wollongong the many years ago when the communist-led Waterside Workers Federation was given a very large find a trophy by the honourable member for Mackellar. We have never really understood the connection between the honourable member and WWF. But, be that as it may, I would like to can discuss the subject of the New South Wales election. I am quite happy to do so. I would be quite is happy to talk with the Whip of my Party about arranging a pair for the honourable member for if he would promise to spend the rest a of the week door knocking in marginal electorates for Sir Eric Willis and explaining to the people of New South Wales, especially the wage salary earners, what is the policy of the elecGovernment today on wage indexation. It is interesting to note that a number of demthat onstrations and protests are to take place this and next week against the actions of the deal which was, if l Government. We have to try to sort out where this Government stands and to what extent the Sir Eric Willis Government, which is so closely tied with the new Fraser Administration, can be trusted. Before the elections on 13 December the present Australian Government, supported by the New South Wales Government, said: 'We support full indexation'. Not long after the elections and at the first test of the policy the Government of the day said: 'No, we only support the granting of 50 per cent of the consumer price index increase'. That was the Fraser Government's second policy which the people of New South Wales had to stomach and which the Conciliation and Arbitrauon Commission rejected. A third policy was then adopted on indexation by the Government, again with great effect upon the people of New South Wales. It said: 'Let us take the taxadon basis out of the CPIfiguresso that we can get a much smallerfigurethan the real increase in the cost of Uving'. A fourth policy has now been adopted by this Government. Between 13 December and today four policies have been adopted by it on wage indexation. We now have as its policy the relaxation of the guideUnes surrounding indexation but the granting of a flat rate increase above the minimum wage. How can anybody in New South Wales trust the present Australian Government or the combination of the present AusuaUan Government and the New South Wales Government? Let us look at a couple of other issues. Today people from all over Australia visited Canberra to protest about the very immoral action taken by this Government in relation to the breaking of the contracts that had been made by the former Labor Administration with thousands of Australians in relation to payments to them under the National Employment and Training scheme. All of those people were promised by the Labor Government that they would be retrained at a certain rate of pay. It was not a handout. It was not a dole payment. It was one of the first attempts to implement some sophisticated manner of retraining people in Australia. Who broke those contracts? Four months after honourable members opposite were elected to office we have a protest in Canberra about the immoral action that they have taken in relation to the NEAT scheme. Who will be coming to Canberra on Thursday and why? Thousands of people from all over Australia-teachers , parents and children alikewtil be coming because they know what the Government is going to do to the Schools Commission in this year's horror Budget. What effect wtil it have on the people of New South Wales, which is the largest and most populous State, when the Government tells them that it is going to cut the powers and the financial flexibUity of the Australian Schools Commission and will take away from the Schools Commission all of the great advantages which were provided under the Labor Administration to the people and to the children? That was thefirstreal opportunity that was provided to the chUdren who live in working class areas. The protesters will be here on Thursday, which is again 4 months after the Fraser Government was elected to office. Who wtil be coming to Canberra next Tuesday in protest against the acts of the Government? The pensioners will be here. Honourable members opposite, particularly the honourable member for Mackellar, who stands up in this chamber and makes grandiose claims about how he defends the pensioners, should go outside of this chamber and teU them about how he and his colleagues voted to take away their funeral benefits 3 days after they voted to give the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) $5,000 a year under the superphosphate bounty. I challenge honourable members opposite to go outside next Tuesday and teU",80
130,Mr YATES,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to a point of order. I do not recall anything being said about a $500,000 superphosphate benefit for the Prime Minister.",81
131,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,There is no substance in the point of order.,81
132,Mr YOUNG,ADJOURNMENT,"I challenge honourable members opposite to go outside next week and talk to the pensioners-the people whom they have pretended to defend over the years-abou t their actions. There are to be no fewer than 4 protests in a week four months after the election and honourable members opposite ask the working people-the wage and salary earners-of New South Wales to trust the combination of the New South Wales and federal governments. They would have to be looney to trust such a combination, with 4 policies on wage indexation. Nothing could be more important to the wage and salary earner of New South Wales than his purchasing power. Honourable members opposite have shown their complete discrimination against such people by breaking every promise on indexation that they have given since 13 December. If the honourable member for Mackellar wants to go door knocking in the marginal electorates of New South Wales he should ask the Whip for a pair. I am sure that a pair can be arranged. I wtil give the honourable member the names of the electorates to visit. I chaUenge him to go into them and defend the acdons of his would Government and the Government of New South would Wales on the rotten stand that they have taken time against the decent people of this country-the be pensioners, the people involved in education and 'interim the people whose contracts the Australian contributing Government broke in relation to the NEAT a scheme.

134,Mr JAMES,ADJOURNMENT,My speaking time of 5 minutes wtil not permit me to developciety fully the point that I would like to make in nection with a very important and impressive ter that I received from a constituent in this morning's maU. Mr Sullivan-Tell us about,82

The constituent who wrote and would be welcomed the letter to me is a responsible and senior tive officer of the Morisset psychiatric centre.

I wouldtiketo quote to the House in the very Umited time avaUable me some of the suggestions that he has put ward and that I hope the Minister for Employhonourable ment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) wtil give some sympathetic consideration implementing. This very worthy Australian, who is an eminent psychiatrist, made certain suggestions in his letter. He wrote: Because of the discouragement, young person for quite a long time, of failing to be thought valuable enough to employ I feel that the following suggesdon would be well worth the investment. I feel that the Federal government should finance the provision of positions called 'interim assistants'. These created in those situations where if finance were available they would be filled in any case. An example would be at a place Uke a hospital, extra outside park attendant, hall poner, or office assistants, or at schools as assistants to teachers. The be half way between the present unemployment benefit and the minimum adult wage. The positions each locality as close to the that travelling time and cost would be minimised. The number of positions created would be the difference between the present number of unemployed in that locality and the number of unemployed there when the unemployed level was 1.5 per cent of the work force. The Federal government would pay the whole of this sum and the nominal employer none of it. The money for this should come from a special government loan offered to the public at a competitive interest rate. The person accepting a position of 'interim assistant' not regard it as a permanent position, but would not be able to leave the job to go to seek other employment. He instead have visits from an Employment Officer from to time to discuss what employment he would want and told if such was available or whether there was an assistant' position in that type of work nearby into which he could be transferred. In the meantime he would be productively to total output and may move into normal job with that employer should one arise. Some of the advantages of this scheme would be a feeling usefulness in the employee. An increase in his self-esteem. money than the unemployment benefit and the advantage that he could say he was not receiving unemployment benefits. I beheve that that suggestion is worthy of some sympathetic consideration by the House. It would remove the stigma that has crept into soby the use of the term 'dole bludger', which conis a reprehensible way of describing the people letwho are genuinely out of work. I hope that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations will give some sympathetic consideration to this proposal, which has been put to me by a very of the Australian who is an executive officer Morisset mental hospital.

The honourable gentleman raises a point, but I must reject his point of order because there were separate motions-quite separate motions. I would not hesitate to use that portion of the Standing Orders in the appropriate circumstances. Mr Donald Cameron-On a point of order. Mr Speaker. Standing order 58 states: Every Member of the House, when he comes into the Chamber shall take his seat, and shall not at any ume stand in any of the passages or gangways. The motion was moved by the Opposition Whip whose seat at the time was being taken up by the rather large honourable member for Hunter. The motion was moved from the corridor.

166,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"This is the fust night on Killer., D.J. King.R.S. which the new sessional order has been experimented with. In 50 minutes of avaUable speaking time we have had 2 speakers speak for Lynch, P. R. MACKeUar.M.J.R. 5 minutes. The House stands adjourned until 2.15 p.m. tomorrow. House adjourned at 11.14 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Aircraft Seats: Non-Smoking Allotment Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Transport, provided upon nodce: (1) As approximately 60 per cent of Australians are nonsmokers, would a fair allocation of non-smoking seats in aeroplanes be 60 per cent and not 30 per cent as at present? (2) What steps is he taking to increase the percentage of non-smoking seats in aeroplanes and other forms of public transpon? (3) Has he discussed this matter with his colleague the Minister for Health? Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am not aware of the proportion of non-smokers in the community, and I am unable to confirm this to be the same as for the air travelling public. The allocation of seats for smoking/non-smoking in aircraft has been on the basis of monitoring of passenger preferences by the airlines and the 30 per cent allocation has been determined on this basis. (2 ) Apart from periodic adjustments as a result of regular monitonng of airline passenger preferences, there are no specific moves within the industry to increase the proportion of seats allocated to non-smokers. However, I am in favour of ensuring a maximum provision of seats to non-smokers. In the case of the Australian National Railways and the Australian National Line passenger transport is predominantly in cabins and the problem of smoking does not arise, except in the pubUc areas. Smoking is not permitted in the dining rooms or cafeterias but is allowable in the lounges. Smoking is also permitted in the communal sleeping lounges of the ANL known no complaints have been made officially about this arrangement. In other forms of public transpon, the initiative rests primarily with the State Ministers for Transport but the subject has been raised at a recent meeting of the Australian Transport Advisory Council and has been referred to * Includes officials for advice. (3) Arrangements are being made for consultation with nate the Minister for Health on this matter. Health: Training Facilities Mr Lloyd asked the Minister representing the nium. Minister for Education, upon notice: (1) What is the present student capacity in each of the traimng institutions in Australia for the training of (a) pists, (b) health assistants and (c) aides. (2) What increase in numbers in each of these categories and institutions was requested for 1976 and the succeeding years of the triennium. (3) What new courses and institutions were planned, appUed for, for this period. (4) What number of students will the succeeding years. (5) What contact and co-ordination is there between the Depanment of Health and the Officials responsible for the NA financial allocation to the various coUeges training therapists. (Question No. 8)",85
167,Mr VINER,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for Education has the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The latest available figures are for 197S when teaching in the therapies in universities was confined to the University of Sydney (Physiotherapy and Speech Therapy) and the University of Queensland (Physiotherapy, Speech Therapy and Occupational Therapy). At the University of Sydney there were 161 such students, all of whom were enrolled for diplomas in the Cumberland College of Health Sciences and were undenaking miscellaneous subjects at the University. From 1976 these students will undertake all their training at the Cumberland College. At the University of Queensland, which currendy is the only University with therapists courses, there were 599 students in 1975 all of whom were enrolled in degree courses. Enrolments for 1975 in courses in occupational therapy (OT) physiotherapy (PT) and speech therapy (ST) in colleges of advanced education are shown in the table below. No designation of health assistant or aide is used in relation to courses in colleges of advanced education and it is not possible to provide information in relation to these categories. Some options in relation to courses in applied science provide qualifications in the biomedical sciences. Separate statistics in relation to this matter are not collected. NA Lincoln Institute (Victoria) 164 226 168 Cumberland College of Health 180 325 96 Sciences (New South Wales) South Australian Institute of Tech- 47 125 nology passenger ships but as far as is Sturt College of Advanced Edu- - - 20 cation (South Australia) Western Australian Institute of 125 172 20 Technology TOTAL 516 848 304 students undenaking part of their studies at University of Sydney. (2) The submissions from State authorities which coordithe development of advanced education in each State do not contain information which would enable this question to be answered. (Question No. 12) (3) No new institution providing education in the therapies was planned in the now abandoned 1976-78 trienThe development of new or existing courses within existing institutions is not a matter which is finalised at the time when triennial submissions are presented to Government. However, in 1976 the Lincoln Institute has enrolled its therafirst students in a course in Prosthetics and Orthotics. (4) Ail of the colleges listed in the table provide courses in addition to courses in the therapies. The entry into particular courses in these colleges is determined by college and State authorities. At the Lincoln Institute and the Cumberland or CoUege of Health Sciences, where therapy and related courses predominate, enrolments for 1975 and estimates for be allowed for 1976 and 1976 are: 1975 1976 Lincoln Institute 619 720 Cumberland CoUege of Health Sciences 860 897 No information is available for 1977 or beyond as the report for the 1976-78 triennium was not accepted by the previous government. (5) As advanced education is co-ordinated at the State level by statutory authorities in each State, the Commission on Advanced Education seeks the advice of State authorities in relation to the manpower needs of particular courses and the rate at which courses should be developed. At the Federal level the Commission on Advanced Education is represented on the Committee on Health Careers (Personnel and Training) established by the Hospitals and Health Services Commission. The Report of this Committee was tabled in the Parliament on 4 March 197S. Anti-Smoking Advertising Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Why was only half the amount spent in 1973-74 as compared with 1972-73 on anti-smoking advenising as indicated in reply to quesuon No. 1207 (Hansard, 18 February 1975,page415). (2) Why was so little spent in either of these years on antismoking advertising on radio and television, particularly when it was only on these media that advertising was restricted and for which the then Government promised to provide compensatory anti-smoking advertising. (3) When will the detailed information, promised in the answer to the first part of question No. 1207, be provided. (4) What sum was spent in 1974-73 in each secuon of the media in (a) country and (b) metropolitan areas.",86
168,Mr HUNT,OT PT ST,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In the first year of the campaign, 1972-73, advertising was a major component in our approach. The intention, at this early stage, was to develop public awareness of the Nauonal Warning Against Smoking and to influence smoking behaviour. During the next year 1973-74, for the Nauonal Warning allocated to State and nonstatutory health education authorities was increased in order to foster the educational component with advantages of more personal impact, long term effect and inbuilt capacity for feedback. The parucular publicity component during 1973-74 was directed at the smoker who was the breadwinner; who by age was at a higher risk and who, if prematurely deceased would leave a significant gap within a family. The theme during this ume, was 'The Life that you ruin may not be your own'. With this increase in health education activities throughout Australia, and an increased awareness of the National Warning, the amount allocated to the media publicity component was reduced. No attempt was made to match the advertising strategy, and costs, of the cigarette and tobacco producers. (2) The strategy of the campaign and the choice of advertising medium were considered, on expert advice, to be the most effective means of achieving the aims outlined in (1) above. The quesuon of compensatory advertising has already been answered in the reply to the third part of question No. 1207. (3) In part 1 of the answer to Question 1207, an undertaking was given to provide a breakdown by media of the sums spent in the anti-smoking campaign during 1972-73. In the table set out below details are given of all expenditure on promotional activity associated with the campaign. The figure differs from that supplied in the earlier answer as it covers total expenditure on the printing of booklets, posters and leaflets, freight and miscellaneous costs associated with the other promotional activities as well as expenditure associated with media advertising and producdon of advertisements. 1972-73 $ Metropolitan press 108,443 Provincial press 35,448 Ethnic press 7,546 Metropolitan radio 7,627 Provincial radio 11,992 MetropoUtan TV 62,226 Provincial TV 30,198 (Question No. 42) RaUways advertising 1,562 Production costs 21,842 Other promotional activity 97,645 391,529 (4) Media expenditure in 1974-75 was as foUows: (a) Country areas $ Radio 849 Press 1,443 (b) Metropolitan areas Radio 9,544 Press 36,644 48,480 The honourable member will appreciate that the allocation of funds expended between media sources whose headquarters are in the metropolitan areas or in the country does not reflect in any way the impact of that expenditure. For example the impact of the major city newspapers goes far beyond the metropoUtan area and in degree the same applies for radio. The National Warning had equal concern for both city and country people. the proportion of the funds Northern Territory: Medical and Dental Services (Question No. 59) Mr Calder asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) In view of the alarming shortage of doctors and dentists in the main centres of the Northern Territory, will he give serious consideration to the institution of a scholarship system to assist in the recruiting of professional staff to meet the very dangerous situation which is arising. (2) Will he seek other incentive schemes to encourage doctors and dentists to go to the Northern Territory to carry out their practices.",87
169,Mr HUNT,OT PT ST,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Medical Officers A cadet medical officer scheme was inaugurated in 1959 for the purpose of recruiting medical officers for service in the Northern Territory. The scheme was suspended in 1964 because it proved at that dme, of limited value to the Department. During the period 1959-1964, of the 14 cadets recruited only 4 remained in the Service after graduation. However, it may be possible to develop a more effecuve scholarship scheme in today's environment, and this will be studied. Dentists Consideration is being given to including the Northern Territory in the existing scholarship providing dentists for the Australian School Dental Scheme. In addidon, I will enquire into the possibUity of introducing scholarships to provide dentists for the the general dental service operated by the Department of Health in the Nonhern Temtory. However, in view of the previous experience with medical scholarships in the Northern Territory, such an arrangement wttl need to be approached with caution. (2) Medical Officers Yes-the introduction of therightof Umited private practice for specialists in the Northern considered by the PubUc Service Board. Dentists I will investigate the possibiUty of providing facilities for private practitioners in the Nonhern Territory as an incentive to dentists to practise in the Territory. Mineral Resources: Ownership Mr FitzPatrick asked the Treasurer, upon notice: WUl he supply the latest estimates of foreign ownership and control of Australia's mineral resources showing by nationaUty, sector and value of production the percentage ownership and/or control. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The latestfigurespubUshed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics relating to foreign ownership and control of the mining industry are in respect of the year 1972-73. Details of the source of the foreign investment are only avaUable in respect of the United Kingdom, the United States of America and other foreign countries. The level of foreign ownership and control of Australia's mining industry, for 1972-73, as measured in terms of value added, was as shown below. Source United Kingdom . . . . Sector Copper Gold . . Nickel Tin . . Total metallic . . . Coal and petroleum . . Total mining . . . . . . Information requested in relation to the foreign ownership and control in terms of value of production is not available. *N/A-Not available. Telephones: Broken Hill District (Question No. 98) scheme with a view to Mr FitzPatrick asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunicauons, upon notice: (1) When is it expected that Broken Hill and its telephone district will get subscriber trunk dialling facUities. (2) Has the delay been caused through expenditure cuts made on the coaxial cable project linking South Australia with Moree eanh station. (3) WUl recent expenditure cuts mean a further delay in bringing this facUity to Broken HU1. Territory is currently being Mr Eric Robinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Telecom Australia expects to provide STD facilities for Broken HU1 subscribers about April or May next year. Provision of the facilities is dependent on the installation of necessaiy additional equipment at the Broken Hill exchange, programmed for completion in January 1977, and completion of the Pon Augusta-Broken Hill section of the (Question No. 94) Ceduna-Cobar co-axial trunk cable and associated system. Broken HU1 is the only existing automatic exchange in the area and at this stage there are no firm plans to extend automatic working and STD to other subscribers in the district. (2) No. (3) No. Australian Assistance Plan (Question No. 120) Mr Lusher asked the Minister, representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: (1) How many officers of the Depanment of Social Security are engaged in the administration of the Australian Assistance Plan (a) on a full-time basis and (b) on a part-time basis. (2) How many (a) filled and (b) vacant positions are there in the administrative structure of the Australian Assistance Plan apan from positions in the Department of Social Security. Ownership Control (3) What is the latest estimate of expenditure from Commonwealth funds in 1975-76. per cent per cent (4) What amount of this estimate has or will be allocated to projects approved under the auspices of the Australian As15.7 13.6 sistance Plan. 26.4 40.0 (5) Is it correct to assume that the bulk of funds not . . 7.5 3.6 aUocated to projects is spent on salaries and administrative . . 49.6 57.2 costs. (6) How many social workers are funded from Australian Assistance Plan resources. 68.0 *N/A 51.2 N/A Mr HUNT - The Minister for Social Security has 18.5 N/A provided the following answer to the honourable 59.3 N/A member's question: 35.6 N/A (1) In both Central and State offices of the Depanment of 34.6 N/A Social Security, the number of officers engaged in the administration of the Australian Assistance Plan is as 52.3 54.2 follows: 54.0 71.4 (a) full-time-20. 49.6 57.2 (b) pan-time-1 4 persons are spending a significant amount of their time. The number of officers who are spending a relatively small amount of their time assisting the 37 funded Regional Councils for Social Development and the 37 initiating groups which are in the process of establishing Regional Councils, is not available. This group includes Registrars, District Officers and Social Workers attached to State and Regional offices. In addition, 12 officers are engaged full-time in the development and evaluation of the Plan (e.g. in arranging and conducting training courses, conferences and seminars with the staff and voluntary members of the Regional Councils). (2) The number of positions in the administrative structure of the Austrahan Assistance Plan, apart from positions in the Department of Social Security, is as follows: Regional Councils for Social Development: (a) Staff positions(i) Filled positions-21 9 (comprising 91 positions providing social planning secretariats to Regional Councils and undertaking related administrative duties and 128 Community Development Officers. It is to be noted that the former group includes directors of social planning and project officers whose chief functions are not to administer but to advise the Regional Council in its social planning activities and to undertake project work. Community Development Officers are not administrative staff but serve the community in social development activities and stimulate self-help groups to be organised). (ii) Vacant positions- 7 (2 of which are Community Development Officers). (b) Non-staff positions-Ove r one thousand members of regional communities Regional Councils for Social Development on a voluntary basis (e.g. President, Secretary, Treasurer, Committee members). Most positions in the administrative structure of the Australian Assistance Plan, therefore, who receive support in their duties from the Regional Council Secretanat. (3) The $7.4m appropriated to the Australian Assistance Plan for the year 1975-76 has been allocated as follows: Grant Administrative grants to regional council Community welfare projects Community development officers Initiating Development and evaluation (4) $4.5m is available to 14 Regional Councils for Social Development for aUocation to approved community welfare projects. (5) The amounts approved in the table at (3) above were allocated as follows: Administration-3 7 Regional CouncUs at an annual rate of $40,000 maximum each. Community Welfare Projects-1 4 Regional CouncUs at a maximum rate of $2 per head of regional population per annum. Community Development Officer-up to 130 grants at a maximum rate of $12,000 each to 36 Regional CouncUs. Initiating-1 0 groups or associations proceeding to estabUsh Regional CouncUs in non-funded areas may receive 'once only' grants of $2,000 each. Development and Evaluation-funds avaUable to the Department of Social Security to provide evaluation of the Australian Assistance Plan and support services to Regional CouncUs. The Australian Assistance Plan is an experimental program. It was designed to be assessed and evaluated as it was put into operation by Regional CouncUs for Social Development in different ways in different areas, according to area differences. Twenty-three of these Regional Councils were allocated only Administration and, subsequently, Community Development Officer grants to establish secretariats which would assist Regional CouncUs to determine community welfare resources and needs, in preparation for the community welfare grant. Through their social planning activities, these Regional Councils have succeeded in coordinating the funcuons of regional voluntary organisations, determining priorities of community welfare needs and assisting non-profit organisations and local governing authorities to utilise grants under existing Commonwealth and State Government funding programs. They have also assisted local organisations to expand their activities in the community and, by arousing the social awareness of individuals and groups, have stimulated their self-reliance to determine and meet their social welfare requirements. Regional Councils, therefore, provide an important resource for social planning and community advice and their functions are not exclusively adnunistrative. Fourteen Regional CouncUs were also given access to community welfare grants to assist non-profit organisations to meet some of the needs discovered through the social planning process. Because the Australian Assistance Plan is an experimental program, administration costs are higher during that penod than would be the case once the program was fully developed. fill administrative positions on (6) Eight hundred and fifty-seven (857) approved community welfare projects, sponsored by Regional Councils for Social Development, have been funded to date from Australian Assistance Plan resources and 12 of these projects have included the employment of social workers. are filled by volunteers River Murray Working Party (Question No. 132) Mr FitzPatrick asked the Minister for National Resources, upon notice: Allocation (1) Has the River Murray Working Party presented its final report to the Department. $ (2) If so, when will it be tabled in the Parliament. . . 1,480,000 4,500,000 Mr ANTHONY - The answer to the honourable 1,000,000 member's question is as follows: 20,000 (1) Yes. 400,000 (2) I refer the honourable member's attention to paragraph (3) of the answer provided to Question No. 7, (Hansard, page 766 of 17 March 1976).

175,Mr HUNT,OT PT ST,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Approximately 21% of the after-tax net profits representing the period up to 17 September 1975 as a proportion of the year. This represents profits for the period before the shares were acquired by the Government. (2) The present managing director was the major shareholder in the previous ownership.

(3) WUl he make public the contract detaUs and the Australian Industry Development Corporation calculations upon which the sale was negotiated, as it now appears that the final figure will be 300 per cent above the open market price.",91
176,Mr HUNT,OT PT ST,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. It was the understanding at thetimeof purchase Cost by the previous Government that after-tax net profits in the year of sale, up to the point of sale, would go to the vendor, $ as the then owner of the shares, and that profits from that 242 point on would be avaUable for distribution to the purchaser. 405 It was necessary to spell this out in the agreement as a for1,240 mula and the amount still to be paid represents the application of this formula.

The formula for distribution of 1975-76 1,448 profits is fixed and there is no provision for the vendor's proportion to be increased.

Bell Insurance Company (Question No. 214) to the provisions of the VicMr Jacobi asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the recent collapse of the Bell Insurance Co. Pty Ltd, particularly following the Government's decision in December 1975 to refuse the company an authorisation, after it had faUed to meet the solvency provision of the Insurance Act. (Question No. 211) (2) In view of the statement by the provisional liquidators they emphasised that people insured with Bell should get other cover, will he make a public statement to advise these people of the protection avaUable to them. (3) WUl he call for and table in the House the request from be the Insurance Commissioner on this company's liquidation. (4) As I have persistently pressed for appropriate amend to the Insurance Act and the Life Insurance Act for provisions relating to the competency of directors, and the of need for adequate surveUlance or control over such companies' investments, will he now give urgent consideration to altering the Acts accordingly. Mr Lynch: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) It will not be possible to determine the company's current financial position until the provisional liquidator makes his report. The deposit of $24,000 lodged by Bell Insurance Co. Pty Ltd, in accordance with the requirements of the Insurance (Deposits) Act 1932-1973, would be available to assist, if necessary, in the settlement of claims under policies issued by the company. (3) I have appointed an inspector under Part V of the Insurance Acts 1973 to report on the affairs of Bell Insurance Co. Pty Ltd. The question of pubUcation of the inspector's report cannot be determined implications have been studied. (4) The possible inclusion in the Commonwealth's insurance legislation of specific provisions relating to the competency of directors of insurance companies raises major issues that would require detaUed considerauon by the Government. In this context, I am advised that the provisions of the Insurance Companies Act 1974 of the United Kingdom deaUng with the competency of the directors have recently been the subject of significant controversy in that country. The existing provisions of the Insurance Act 1973 and the Life Insurance Act 1945-73 enable a close supervision over the disposition of insurance companies' assets and, against this background, consideration to specific legislative provisions for the control of investments by insurance companies.

185,Mr LES JOHNSON,OT PT ST,"the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, upon notice: What was the number of bankruptcies in (a) total and (b) for each major occupational category in each of the last 25 years.",95
186,Mr HOWARD,OT PT ST,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) This information is contained in Attachment A. (b) Although the occupational status of bankrupts is recorded statistically, the information is not maintained separately. Included in the statistics are the occupations of deceased persons whose estates are administered in bankruptcy, and of persons whose affairs are dealt with under the Bankruptcy Act without sequestration, upon their entering into compositions, or executing Deeds of Arrangement or Deeds of Assignment with their creditors. In other words, the occupational statistics which are maintained cover that group of persons who are in fact bankrupt, or who, for practical purposes, might be regarded as bankrupt. It is not practicable to rupts from the occupations of the other persons mentioned. Attachment B, which consists of two schedules, contains broad details of the occupational persons for the 25 years to and including 1974-75. Major occupational category Accountants; agents; architects and surveyors; auctioneers; company promoters; contractors (not otherwise provided for); brokers; solicitors Building trades (including contractors); electricians and electrical engineers The first schedule covers the years 1950-51 to 1971-72. A detailed dissection of the information contained in this document will be found in the Eighth Schedule to the Annual Reports of the Attorney-General on the operation of the Bankruptcy Act for the years concerned. Commencing with the year 1972-73 there was a change in the method of recording occupational information. The second schedule to Attachment B reflects the change. The Ninth Schedule, Pan A, to the Annual Repons of the Attorney General for the years concerned, gives a precise break-up of the broad groupings shown in this document. Pan B of the Ninth Schedule to the Attorney-General's Annual Repons, which deals with industry classifications (Question No. 373) would, I think, also be of interest to the honourable member.
