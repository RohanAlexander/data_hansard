1,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND,"On behalf of the House, I welcome as guests the President of the Senate and honourable senators to this sitting of the House of Representatives to hear an address by the Rt Hon. John Key, Prime Minister of New Zealand. The Rt Hon. John Key having been announced and escorted into the chamber welcome you to the House Representatives chamber. Your address today is a very significant occasion in the history of the House.",19
2,Ms GILLARD,MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND," To the Rt Hon. John Key: you are very welcome here. It was in February this year that I became the first Australian Prime Minister to address the members of the New Zealand parliament, a profound and moving honour for me and for this nation. In turn, today John Key stands among us as the first New Zealand Prime Minister to address the Australian parliament-testament to the profound, unique and enduring friendship between our two countries. We share a common history, a common outlook and a common set of values. Our people love peace and love freedom, and they freely paid a dreadful price for both. It is the story, of course, we call ANZAC-and I am always conscious of the 'NZ' in that word. So today I pledge the friendly cooperation of our two nations as we prepare for the centenary of Gallipoli and those other epic anniversaries of 1914 to 1918-great moments in our national history, great moments in our shared history. Of course, as I said in the parliament in New Zealand in February, the ANZAC story is a living story. It lives on today in Afghanistan, where Australian and New Zealand forces are making a vital contribution to security. It was poignantly illustrated when Australian rescue workers forged a cross of timber, salvaged from the ruins of Christchurch Cathedral, a cross that became the centrepiece for this year's ANZAC Day service in that quake shattered city. And it was evident when Australians and New Zealanders were among the first teams on the ground after the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. Prime Minister, we would have always of felt deeply for the people of Christchurch when that dreadful earthquake struck, but our empathy was only heightened by the rawness of our own wounds from the summer of disaster here. As New Zealand mourned, we mourned with you. As New Zealand held out hope for a miraculous rescue, we kept vigil with you. And as New Zealand recovers, we will stand by you. If I may borrow a saying from your country's rich Maori culture: turn your face to the sun and the shadows fall behind you. Prime Minister, we will be turning our face with you to the sun, and for you we certainly hope that the shadows of recent days now fall behind you, fall behind our New Zealand friends, our New Zealand family. We know that you will recover. We know that you will rebuild. We know this not only because of our shared past but also because of our shared sense of anticipation about the future, a future in which our interests will only become more closely linked. But, Prime Minister, this is about more than our two nations, though it is so much about our two nations. We cannot just look to ourselves. As vibrant and long standing democracies, it is our responsibility to nurture younger democracies throughout the Asia-Pacific, to help strengthen their institutions and to promote fairness and opportunity. Above all we must pool our strengths to meet the challenges facing our region at this time, a time of enormous global change as we face the impact of China's rise, climate change, resource security, natural disaster management, people-smuggling-challenges that require innovative and collective responses, challenges that demand the courage to govern for tomorrow as well as for today. Prime Minister, underlying all of the strands of our relationship is one simple truth. What geography began, history has confirmed: our two nations are family, so here in this chamber and in this country you can never be a stranger. By honouring you in this gathering place of deliberation, we honour the nation you represent and we honour the people you serve. And so I say from my heart: kia ora, welcome; the House is yours today. Honourable members: Hear, hear!",19
3,Mr ABBOTT,MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND," I am delighted to support the remarks of the Prime Minister in welcoming the Rt Hon. John Key to this parliament. I say, John, that as a former resident of Sydney you are just about a constituent of mine, and it is good to have you in this parliament. Of course, as a mark of respect to Australia, the New Zealand parliament earlier this year welcomed our Prime Minister. It is fitting that as a mark respect to New Zealand we likewise welcome you here today. It is a rare honour to address a joint sitting of the Australian parliament, and we are very happy to extend it to you as Prime Minister of our nearest neighbour and closest friend. We are not welcoming a foreign leader; we are welcoming a friend. Indeed, we are welcoming the leader of a country that even now, under our Constitution, could yet accede to the Australian Federation, should you wish to do so! Our countries have been indissolubly linked and bonded ever since the voyages of Captain Cook. Those bonds have been strengthened in war and in peace, in good times and in bad. Late last year, when 29 miners died at Pike River, we did not mourn for the two Australians who were amongst them; we mourned for every single one of them. When Christchurch was hit by a devastating earthquake, we were only too happy to send the best of our emergency services personnel to help. And in the aftermath of the tragedy, when the Governor General, the Prime Minister and I went to Christchurch, we mourned not as foreigners but as your kith and kin.  congratulate you on two initiatives of your government. First, I congratulate you for formally re-establishing military ties with the United States. This has once more made the ANZUS alliance a fully functioning, working alliance. We as Australians very much value New Zealand's military commitments, not only to East Timor and to the Solomon Islands but also, of course, to Afghanistan. We are ANZAC brothers in arms once more. I also congratulate you, Prime Minister, for dramatically watering down the emissions trading scheme that you inherited. In this country, your sister party will go further and do better. Should we inherit any of carbon tax, we will not just reduce it; we will rescind it.  much your presence amongst us and we look forward very much to listening to your words of wisdom. Honourable members: Hear, hear!",20
4,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND,"Prime Minister Key, it gives me great pleasure to invite you to address the House. Honourable members: Hear, hear! Rt Hon. JOHN KEY (Prime Minister of New Zealand) (14:48): Mr Harry Jenkins, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Senator the Hon. John Hogg, President of the Senate; the Hon. Julia Gillard, Prime Minister of Australia; the Hon. Tony Abbott, Leader of the Opposition; honourable members of the Australian parliament; and distinguished guests, it gives me a great privilege to address you here in this esteemed chamber. I address you as Prime Minister of New Zealand, as a proud member of the trans-Tasman family and as a former resident of this great country. I bring with me the best wishes of 4.4 million New Zealanders. They value the deep bonds we share, and they would want Australia to hear this message: New Zealand is committed to your country above all others and for all time. In recent times you have shown New Zealand a degree of loyalty and support that only family can, and for that we are truly grateful. When an explosion ripped through the Pike River mine in November last year, you sent your specialists, your experts, your machinery and your hope. You did all you could to help us bring those 29 brave men home alive. And, when they died, you grieved with us, not only for the two Australians but for all of them. When the devastating Christchurch earthquake struck us in February, you came to our aid immediately, unreservedly and with open hearts. From the financial and practical support of the federal and state governments through to the donations of corporate Australia and the heroic acts of individual Australians, your deeds struck a deep chord with the people of Christchurch. When 300 members of the Australian police arrived at Christchurch Airport, they were met by a spontaneous standing ovation. New Zealanders clapped for the Australian presence because it was such a moving and visible demonstration that we were not on our own; you had our back. Let me tell you that that sense of unity and support mattered more than you might imagine. We felt also the incredible support of this parliament, whose expression of condolence and commitment meant so much. The depth and breadth of Australia's support for Christchurch will never be forgotten. In a time of tragedy, your extraordinary assistance strengthened our resolve and has aided Christchurch's recovery immeasurably. While the aftershocks in Christchurch have continued, our recovery is ongoing and assured. Today, on behalf of Kiwis, I thank you. Your acts were living testament to the perpetual ANZAC spirit. Members and senators of this parliament should know that New Zealand will never hesitate to reciprocate this support. When we saw the devastation caused by the Victorian bushfires and we saw the carnage wreaked by the Queensland floods and Cyclone Yasi, our people felt your pain as only family can. We came to you then and we will come to you whenever we may be needed again. The relationship shared by our two nations is like no other. The men and women in this chamber represent a country whose fortunes, values and people are deeply entwined with New Zealand's. We share with you not only a corner of the world but a similar path in history. It is a history not only of shared sporting passions and rivalry, though they must not be overlooked. More than that, it is a shared history of indigenous peoples, British colonisation, increasing independence and successive waves of immigration; a history of flourishing democracy, of free markets and of prosperous economies; a history of innovation, enterprise and ambition. Today our two countries walk a very similar path in pursuit of shared aspirations. We pursue increased security, prosperity and opportunity for our citizens. We share a confidence about our place in the world and the stake our people should have in it. There is also strength in our differences. is well understood that the Australian Constitution graciously provides for New Zealand to join the Federation. Suffice to say that is an invitation for which an RSVP has never been sought nor offered. It is a mark of our joint progress that we have found other, more effective means of combining our strengths. We both recognise the benefits to be gained from being two countries under two flags and with our own approaches. Beneath our distinct identities lie indelible common values: an easy understanding that Jack is as good as his neighbour, that democracy, freedom and the rule of law should be cherished and fostered, that every citizen should have the opportunity to shape their own future. These are values we are proud to voice on the world stage consistently and without compromise. These are the values we have fought for together as joint forces in Gallipoli and as fellow soldiers in other theatres of war. From the First and Second World Wars through to Korea and Vietnam, the experiences we shared in these battles shaped our national characters. They joined us ever unto each other. I had the privilege of visiting Gallipoli the ANZAC Day commemorations last year. It was, I have to say to you, a hugely moving experience. Gathered together were Australians and New Zealanders from all over the world. They came together as proud brothers and sisters of the ANZAC tradition. It felt as natural for me to share in the memorial of Australians who gathered together at Lone Pine as it did to gather with New Zealanders at Chunuk Bair. Together we paid our respects to all those who fought, fell injured and in so many cases died for us so very far from home. It is right that throughout the world, from London to Gallipoli, from Canberra to Christchurch, to our local RSAs and RSLs, we continue to remember our It ANZACs together. It is right too that the brave men and women of our armed services continue to work together today. The ANZAC centenary in 2015 will be a deeply significant occasion for New Zealand and Australia. We look forward to close cooperation in the lead-up to these commemorations. Today we face new challenges in peacekeeping and peacemaking, new conflicts and a rapidly changing strategic environment with threats, from terrorism to people-smuggling, that know no borders. Amid this change Australia's and New Zealand's alliance endures. Members and senators of this parliament should know that, while our numbers and resources are smaller than yours, New Zealand's commitment to our defence and security relationship with Australia is absolute. We place priority on fulfilling our alliance obligations to you above all other defence priorities save for defending ourselves. We have no better friend and no closer ally than Australia. Our two countries have distinct contributions to make in meeting the security challenges of our modern world. Each of us will rightly seek to serve our distinct national for interests and to maximise our distinct capabilities. But we are stronger for each other. In particular, New Zealand appreciates Australia's enormous contribution to creating stability in Afghanistan and your hard-fought achievements in Oruzgan Province. New Zealand too is committed to stabilising Afghanistan through the contribution of our SAS in Kabul and the provincial reconstruction team which will work through to 2014 to provide an effective transition in Bamiyam. Nine of our soldiers have also served with yours in Oruzgan. I wish today to acknowledge the 27 Australian soldiers who have lost their lives in Afghanistan. New Zealand joins with you to honour them as we honour our own two soldiers who have died there, as we honour all of our service men and women who make the ultimate sacrifice for our countries. Our two countries have a particular responsibility to ensure the stability of our immediate region. New Zealand values Australia's deep engagement in the Pacific and the cooperation we have with you. We see that with our joint police and defence operations on the ground in Timor Leste and the Solomon Islands. In future our combined Ready Response Force will see our service men and women being jointly deployed, whether it be for disaster relief, humanitarian assistance or other challenges that may emerge in the Pacific region. We are also making great strides in harmonising our aid and development efforts. New Zealand has in recent times sought to elevate our role in the Pacific. It is right that we do so. Almost one in 10 New Zealanders come from a Pacific background and our complex web of family connections uniquely positions us as a regional facilitator. In September this year New Zealand will host the Pacific Islands Forum. We look forward to the presence of your Prime Minister at this event. New Zealand and Australia's military, diplomatic and political ties are deep and strong. New Zealand values the formal and informal political structures that underpin this, from the personal contact I share with your Prime Minister to the regular contacts between our ministers and members of parliament through to important annual event like the Australia New Zealand Leadership Forum. These contacts have enriched our relationship and have endured no matter the political stripes on either side of the Tasman. But, ultimately, the story of Australia and New Zealand is not one that has been written by politicians calling the shots from on high; instead, our deeds have reflected the evercloser ties between the voters who elect us. Our nations each have a vested interest in the other's success. That vested interest is the people we share. New Zealanders and Australians conduct their family and business affairs with very little regard for the sea that divides us. Trans-Tasman families abound. More than 560,000 Kiwis call Australia home. Many thousands of Australians live in New Zealand. Millions fly back and forth across the Tasman each year. Large numbers of us have worked, studied or holidayed in the other's country. My own experience bears testament to this. In 2001, after a period of time living in London and Singapore, I came to work and live in Sydney, with my wife, Bronagh, and our two children. We remember our time and the friends we made in Sydney fondly and have returned not only on official engagements but also for family holidays. My story is not unlike that of hundreds of thousands of Aussies who have lived in New Zealand and hundreds of thousands of Kiwis who have lived in Australia. We are enriched by the valuable contribution our people make to each other's societies and economies. It is only right that politicians on both sides of the Tasman have sought to reflect this reality as we developed our trading, economic and legal frameworks. In 2013 we will look back on 30 years since the birth of CER between Australia and New Zealand. As we approach that milestone it is appropriate that we reflect on where we have been and where we might go next. Much has already been achieved. CER represents a global gold standard in trade agreements. Australia and New Zealand boast free trade in goods and nearly all services and, thanks to recent progress, investment is now part of CER. We have mutual recognition arrangements for goods and services and we continue to pursue a single economic market agenda to harmonise our business laws. Despite the challenges of integration, and, must be said, despite New Zealand's initial anxiety, CER has served both our countries very well. It has benefited our economies, our businesses and the families and communities we all serve. Australia is New Zealand's largest export market. More than half of foreign direct investment in New Zealand, at around $50 billion, comes from Australia. Last year total Australian exports to New Zealand were a little over A$8 billion, not far behind the $9 billion you exported to the United States. Interestingly, more Australian businesses export to New Zealand than to any other country. Your small and medium enterprises, your innovative companies and your valueadded producers often cut their teeth in exporting first to New Zealand before expanding to larger markets. The same applies for New Zealanders exporting to Australia. Our businesses also work together to pool resources, share ideas, share expertise and expand offshore. These facts underscore what we already know. New Zealand's economic fortunes matter to Australia and vice versa. We share in each other's economic success and we will continue to do so. As political leaders, we have a responsibility to keep up the momentum that has made CER such a success. Our history has proven that open trade and economic integration can be forces for growth and prosperity. The question now is: can we take our relationship to the next level? We have more to gain from closer integration with each other. Prime Minister Gillard and I are both personally committed to progressing the single-economic-market agenda. New Zealand appreciates the focus Australian ministers have brought to the detail of these issues. My view is that, increasingly, we can also play our integration out on a bigger scale because, as important as it is to both it our economies, the thriving bilateral business relationship is not an end in itself. We are both operating in the global economy. From the outset, our economic integration process has been designed to help us compete more effectively in the international marketplace. Australia has long recognised the economic potential of our region, as demonstrated by your foresight in laying the foundations for APEC. It is now the region to which all the world's eyes are turning. The extraordinary economic growth of Asia will compel the next steps in the relationship between Australia and New Zealand. I believe our trans-Tasman partnership can set the standard for ever more closely integrated regional economic communities. CER has already provided the launching pad for regional integration. We saw that with the 2009 signing of the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand free trade agreement. That was a groundbreaking and ambitious regional trade agreement that opened up significant opportunities for our economies. It was the first agreement with Australia and New Zealand that we jointly negotiated, and it will certainly not be the last. We must now raise our sights to the transPacific partnership, the TPP. Together we can drive to make this trade agreement as high quality and comprehensive as possible. Australia and New Zealand know well the mechanics of how effective trading relationships are forged. As negotiating partners, we strengthen each other's case and set a high standard. Together we can ensure that the TPP is the basis of a powerful integrated regional trading bloc linking Asia, Australasia and the Americas. The obvious next step is a deal extending across the full APEC membership. As we join forces at the trade negotiating table so too can we join forces to leverage these trade agreements for maximum benefit. Together we can work to penetrate untapped parts of the Asian market, introduce new industries to those markets and help our exporters scale up their operations. New Zealand is interested in how our joint objectives with Australia in these areas can find practical expression in the future. Progress in meeting these goals will bring success for each of our economies: more jobs for our people, better incomes and a more diverse and secure base for ongoing growth. As we take on the world, Australia and New Zealand must work to identify other areas where the sum of our distinct expertise and resource is greater than the parts. Our science and innovation partnership is one such area. Our work to host the Square Kilometre Array radio telescope is a great first step. Ultimately, we should aim to showcase Australasia as an agile, nimble and creative hub of science and innovation. Climate change is another global challenge our two countries are facing. It is of course up to each country to adopt its own policies to address this challenge. After all, we each have different emissions profiles and different economies. In New Zealand, climate change has been the subject of vigorous debate and at times political division. So I come to this parliament with least a little understanding of the debate are having in your country. While our domestic policies are matters for each country's government and parliament to debate, we can and should work together on the international aspects of climate change. We can work together on research and innovation to reduce emissions. In fact, we already are, with New Zealand contributing to the Australian led Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute and with Australia contributing to the New Zealand led Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases. We can also share our growing knowledge about what works and what does not as we seek to reduce emissions across our economies. I am pleased that Prime Minister Gillard and I have today agreed to further the work of our senior officials as they join up our respective efforts to combat global climate change. New Zealand feels lucky to have Australia as our neighbour. We enjoy our competitive rivalry, but when faced with challenge or opportunity we could wish for no better partner. You are a dynamic, democratic and multicultural society. You are a vibrant, open and prosperous market economy. You are a force for good in the Asia-Pacific region and an important global player. These attributes bring strength to New Zealand as we seek to further our interests on the world stage. New Zealand too brings increased strengths to Australia, economically and strategically. When facing the world, our two countries' voices are closely aligned and all the more influential for it. Australia and New Zealand have a proud and unbroken history of partnership. We have stood shoulder to shoulder in the face of challenges on the battlefield, at the negotiating table and amid the debris of natural disaster. In all that we face and in all that we gain, our two countries can never at lose sight of each other. The reason for that you is simple and is summed up by a Maori proverb: He aha te mea nui o te ao? He tangata! He tangata! He tangata! What is the most important thing? It is people, it is people, it is people. The people of Australia and New Zealand are forever joined. The future holds much for our two great countries. Increased prosperity, opportunity and security are ours to grasp. In all that we strive for, we are stronger together.",21
5,The SPEAKER,MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND,"Prime Minister Key, on behalf of the House I thank you for your address and your aspirations for a continuing Australia-New Zealand partnership. I wish you a successful and enjoyable stay in Australia. I thank the President of the Senate and senators for their attendance and exemplary behaviour, which has influenced the members to their quietest yet at this time on a day of sitting. I thank you.",26
6,Unknown,MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND,Sitting suspended from 15:11 to 16:30 NA Presentation,26
7,Mr ALBANESE,DOCUMENTS,Documents are presented as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members. Details of the documents will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings and I move: That the House take note of the following documents: Indigenous Land Corporation-National Indigenous land strategy for 2007-2012 (Revised February 2011). Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992Report under section 34A for 2010. Torres Strait Protected Zone Joint AuthorityReport for 2008-09. Debate adjourned. NA Live Animal Exports,26
8,Mr KATTER,MOTIONS," move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Kennedy from moving the following motion-That this House: (1) note the impact of the live animal export suspension on Northern Australia, the whole cattle industry and all those associated with it and directs the Government within two weeks to: (a) deploy 10 Australian officials to Indonesia; (b) direct these officials, along with Indonesia Government appointees, to immediately implement an upgrading of Indonesian abattoirs to meet humane standards currently met in Australia; and (c) instruct Indonesian meatworkers on how to process to humane standards currently met in Australia; (2) directs the Government to ship to Indonesia 60 stun guns with knocking boxes and video cameras within seven days, and to provide appropriate training; (3) directs the Government as a matter of urgency to: (a) immediately accredit Indonesia abattoirs that already meet Australian standards; (b) begin accrediting Indonesian abattoirs that have been newly upgraded to meet humane standards currently met in Australia; (c) implement supply chain traceability and auditing systems; and (d) implement independent monitoring of conditions in Indonesian abattoirs; (4) once the conditions in clause 3 are satisfied, calls on the Government to immediately ensure the resumption of trade with accredited Indonesian abattoirs that meet humane standards currently met in Australia; and (5) directs the Federal Government to immediately commence an inquiry into the circumstances leading up to the Minister for Agriculture's decision to suspend the live I cattle export trade to Indonesia and that this inquiry include Meat and Livestock Australia and all other related instrumentalities and departmental division. The government keeps assuring me that it is addressing this problem and acting to overcome it and ensure that we get a positive outcome. The government is saying, 'Trust me.' It appears that people have been told that now for nine years. I am sorry, we are not prepared to trust anyone. If you really want us to trust you, then you should be voting for this motion. Is there a single person in this parliament that believes that stun-guns should not be on their way to Indonesia now? They should have been sent a week ago. On this side of the House, everyone would agree with that. Why won't the government support the motion? If you have got something to fear, then the people of Australia have something to fear. But, if you do not have anything to fear, then why not do this? It is very simple. I must stress the urgency of the motion because, from Thursday of last week when we lost this motion until now, thousands of cattle have been cruelly killed. It is not the fault of the people that voted for this-the people on this side of the House. This side of the House, and I refer to the opposition, have got plenty to answer for. They knew about this for six years and did nothing about it. But give them their due: they are doing something about it now. We applaud them for doing that. I cannot see any reason why the government would not agree to this. They are being told stories by the MLA, but the real story here is that the MLA and the departmental officials that are responsible this are doing a big con act. 'Oh, this is very complicated,' they say. It ain't complicatedyou send the cattle up there to Jakarta, you put them in the back of a hired utility and you say, 'Hey fellas, we've got some ratbags back in Australia we've got to make happy; would you please do it this way?' You have to put it that way. Since it is easier to do it with a stun-gun than the way they are doing it at present, I am sure they would be more than happy to agree. But do not let anyone stand up and have the hypocrisy to say that they are against cruelty when they are defending the continuation of the killing of cattle in this inhumane manner. That is the situation. If you are seriously worried about animal welfare, then stop itthis motion stops it. It forces the government to do something, instead of listening to the 60 people who are responsible for this situation and are now advising the government that they have it all under control. The government is accepting that. The government has got to realise that, while it might be accepting it, the voting public are not accepting it. The voting public are listening to the things that I am saying in here because they know that they are true. They know that nothing has been done by this government to ensure that a single ox is killed humanely in Indonesia-nothing. The same people are giving out the same stories that they have given out for nine years. If the stun-guns do not get up there in the next two or three weeks, then if I was a betting man I would bet that Indonesia will bring in cattle from Brazil. The minute they start to do that we will be finished-we will never get back in there again. Someone mentioned foot-and-mouth disease. Indonesia is provisionally a free country and most of Brazil is provisionally free, so they do not run into that problem. There are those of us who argue that there for are parts of Indonesia-with its 1,000 islands-that are not provisionally free, but we will not go into that today. My colleague the honourable member for Denison does not have the same view as I do about the foreseeable future, but he absolutely believes that cattle should not be cruelly killed and every day that goes by more and more of a hell of a lot them will be killed. The government is saying, 'Trust me.' It is listening to people working for the MLA and people working for the government that are saying, 'We have got it under control; we are addressing it.' That is the story we have been told for the last nine years. The honourable member for Denison and I thank very much the opposition, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition, for taking a strong stand on this in spite of the fact that there is a downside for them insofar as criticism for the past will be sheeted home to them. But forget about the past. Let us look to the future; let us do something about it. We cannot get any information, so we do not know how many cattle are in the pipeline. I am told it is in the tens of thousands. Someone told me 30,000; another person told me it might be nearer 100,000. One of the mayors in my own area said that a number of cattlemen are now on suicidewatch. This place just does not seem to care how many farmers commit suicide in this country. I have said again and again no-one cares about a farmer committing suicide every four days in this country. Not one single thing that I can think of has been done to allay that figure, except sending counsellors out. My experience with counsellors-God bless them; I love themis that I really appreciate the work that they are doing but they are almost irrelevant to the problem. That has been my experience with counselling, and I do not mean to speak badly about counsellors. But I am told by one of my mayors, who is down here for the conference today and who came to see me, that the police have rung up to officially inform him that we have a number of graziers on suicide watch at this moment. So the government says, 'Trust me.' That is what is being said here: 'Trust me.' That is the answer to the problem! Has one single stun-gun, video camera or knocking box left Australia? No. We know that for an absolute fact and we are into the first fortnight. If say they care about the ox, I am sorry but you have lost that argument. We already know you do not care because you have not sent a single stun-gun up there. If you cared, you would have been sending stun-guns up there the next day. But you do not care, as evidenced here again today. So we are giving very specific directions. From the point of view of the member for Denison, this will hold the line until he goes to what he believes is the right thing to do, which is cutting off the export trade. I would disagree with that, of course- (Time expired)",26
9,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS, Is the motion seconded?,28
10,Mr WILKIE,MOTIONS," I second the motion moved by the member for Kennedy, which is entirely consistent with that part of my private member's bill which calls for the immediate and urgent implementation of safeguards in Indonesia so the resumption of our live animal export and trade with that country can occur straight away. I will speak more to this issue tonight when I table that bill.",28
11,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (16:47): I rise to speak against this suspension of standing orders, as occurred last Thursday. The member for Kennedy and the member for Denison are two members of this chamber I have a great deal of respect for. I respectfully submit to the member for Kennedy that the clear procedures set out by this parliament to facilitate private members' business being dealt with are greater than any that have ever been made in the history of this parliament. The fact of the matter is that we will enable and facilitate private members' discussions this evening. They are all on motions or bills that have been put forward in accordance with the procedures that have been worked out. Everyone has the same level playing they field and the same ways of operating in this matter. The truth is that, in doing this, the government want to be consistent. We are ensuring that everyone knows what the procedures are. You put a motion on notice or you give notice of an intention to present a bill. It is then considered by the Selection Committee and it is dealt with on the next occasion. In the normal proceedings that would be on the following Monday evening. We then have a debate. If there is a need for further discussion then that occurs. It is listed for a vote in accordance with the procedures of the Selection Committee in a way in which everyone knows the outcome. We have, since 2007, operated in a way that has facilitated business before this parliament being dealt with. When the government introduces legislation, it comes into this parliament and gives notice. We then have a second reading speech. Debate is then suspended after the second reading speech and the legislation is then able to be considered by the parliament in the next week. If it is the case that people can come into this parliament and move a suspension of standing orders or something that they have not given notice of, then we will simply not be able to facilitate the proper consideration of either legislation or motions which are moved by members of this parliament. The fact is that we have had a range of suspensions moved. We barely get through a day of this parliament without a suspension of standing orders being moved by those opposite. Dr Southcott: You've got your priorities wrong.",28
12,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"Some of the members opposite speak about our priorities. We heard that from the shadow finance minister, who could not actually call a division on the budget bills he was opposing. We heard from the shadow finance minister that he wants to change the determinations on the processes for the consideration of budget bills.",29
13,Unknown,MOTIONS,Opposition members interjecting,29
14,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS,Honourable members on my left will display a modicum of discipline.,29
15,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"Those processes were determined unanimously by this House. It is quite extraordinary. The suspensions of then standing orders have already cost this parliament the consideration of 124 questions. The fact is that the suspensions moved by those opposite, when the Leader of the Opposition has suspended 46 per cent of question times, and at the end of last week the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Kennedy moved suspensions of standing orders",29
16,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"If you were here for more than five minutes, you might know that I am speaking to the suspension of standing orders. I am actually speaking to the motion, which is about the procedures of this House. The motion is not about the substance of the motion that the member for Kennedy is seeking to move; the motion is about the suspension of standing orders. I read in today's paper that we were going to have a bill considered in this House at 10 am this morning. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition came into the chamber at 10 am, but if he did he would have been the only one who was here. He shows no attention to the detail. That is the problem of those opposite: no attention to detail. All they want to do is come before this parliament and complain, say what they oppose but not say what they are for, like the walking vuvuzelas that they are. Once again we see their opportunism on show for all to see. They have had a different position on live cattle exports every single day throughout the past two weeks. With regard to the issue of plebiscites, I just wonder how a plebiscite would go before the Australian public of all those who support exporting live cattle to Indonesia. I just wonder how that would go, if we are going to go down that sort of road. Of course, those opposite have never got over their loss in August last year. What we are seeing played out before the Australian public is the longest dummy spit in the history of Australian politics. The fact of the matter is they want to disrupt the parliament at each and every opportunity. It does not matter whether it is Greens motions about asylum seekers or motions from the member for Kennedy or anything else; their one priority is disruption. Do you know who said, 'Disrupting the House is not a sign of a disciplined opposition; disrupting the House is a sign of a desperate opposition'? It was the Leader of the Opposition on 21 June 2006.",29
17,Mr Christensen,MOTIONS,"Point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: for the last two minutes, the Leader of the House has been talking about the opposition, our policies and everything but the substance of the motion. I ask you to draw him to speak to the motion.",30
18,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTIONS, The member will resume his seat. We are debating whether standing orders will be suspended and I encourage the Leader of the House to observe closely the terms of the motion before the chair.,30
19,Mr ALBANESE,MOTIONS,"I am, Mr Deputy Speaker, because what I am speaking in favour of is orderly proceedings in this House of Representatives, not this disruptive behaviour which the Leader of the Opposition himself said on 21 June 2006 is a sign of a desperate opposition. He went on to say this: What we have seen from members opposite consistently in the course of this year but particularly over the last few weeks is consistent, deliberate, planned and premeditated conduct to disrupt this House. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said on 21 June 2006 and there were never wiser words said by the Leader of the Opposition. That is why the government will be opposing this and why the member for Corio will be adding to comments opposing this legislation. The fact of the matter is",30

44,Ms SAFFIN,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the third report of the committee for 2011, entitled Referrals made February to March 2011. I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.",33
45,Ms SAFFIN,COMMITTEES,"I thank the House. On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the third report of 2011, addressing referrals made from February to March 2011. This report deals with three inquiries with a total estimated cost of $551.9 million. In each case the committee has recommended the House of Representatives agree to the works proceeding. The report also includes the committee's findings relating to a budget overrun in a previously approved work. The new works are the proposed development and construction of housing for Defence in Muirhead, Northern Territory, the proposed upgrade of the electrical reticulation system at Robertson Barracks, also in the Northern Territory, and the proposed redevelopment of the Australian Defence Force Academy in the Australian Capital Territory. The previously approved work is the construction and renovation of housing at Larrakeyah Barracks in Darwin, Northern Territory, approved by this House in 2009. I will deal first with the Muirhead housing proposal. This is a very large project which would essentially develop an entirely new suburb in the northern suburbs of Darwin. The committee toured the site and visited a house that is similar to the kind of housing that Defence Housing Australia will build in the suburb. Defence Housing Australia intends to build on 279 lots and sell the other 651 developed but vacant lots. The committee's major concern with this project is the lack of social and cultural planning. Witnesses at the hearing raised questions about the way in which the new suburb would integrate with existing suburbs and how the design and layout of Muirhead would anticipate the social and cultural needs of its future residents. DHA has not undertaken its own planning to address these issues, and the committee has recommended that it do so for this project. The committee has also recommended that DHA do this from now on for all developments of more than 50 lots. The committee was able to visit a house that incorporates the design principles that DHA will be employing at Muirhead. In particular, the house was designed to be passively cooled by the prevailing breezes in the area, especially in the dry season. The committee is pleased that DHA is making an effort to utilise cost-effective and costneutral design options that make houses both more comfortable and cheaper to cool. At the house we inspected it really made a significant difference to the temperature, as it should to the energy use in that house. DHA told us that it will be the standard it will build from now on. It is something that is worthy of being incorporated in other developments. Moving to the Defence works in the report, the committee considered the electrical reticulation system upgrade at Robertson Barracks in Darwin and the redevelopment of the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra. The Robertson Barracks project will ensure there is reliable power to the base, even if the external power supply is interrupted. The project will also provide for additional capacity for future base developments, being aware that there are people who also reside on base. The Australian Defence Force Academy redevelopment proposes new and refurbished facilities that will enable contemporary pedagogy-it is not just about pedagogy, but it is partly about that-as well as providing additional teaching space and improved administrative areas. A major part of the proposal involves the demolition of Adams Hall-that is the large hall where a quite a significant number of public events take place each year-and the construction of a new multi-venue auditorium in its place. The committee sought Defence's assurances that there was no way to reuse the existing hall, and the committee is satisfied that the demolition is based on sound consideration of all possible options. The committee is particularly keen to see the chaplains' space redeveloped, as it is woefully inadequate at the moment. This is very important, given the substantial pastoral care provided by ADFA's chaplains. The final chapter in this report deals with a project approved by this House on 26 November 2009, the Larrakeyah housing project in Darwin. In early 2011 Defence Housing Australia wrote to the committee to inform it that the budget for the project was insufficient to complete the full scope of works. The committee held a public hearing with DHA on 21 March 2011 to seek further information about how this situation arose. As outlined in its report, the committee is satisfied with the reasons given by DHA for the budget overrun. In particular, the Darwin market conditions and the project's complexity, cited by DHA as reasons for the budget shortfall, were entirely foreseeable by DHA. The original budget process was not sufficiently rigorous and the committee expects DHA to ensure that this situation does not arise again. I would like to thank members and senators for their work in relation to these inquiries. And I would like to thank the secretariat, who are in the chamber today. In particular, I would like to thank Senators Troeth and Forshaw for their long service to the committee, as they will both be leaving the Senate-and, therefore, the committeeat the end of this month. I particularly draw attention to Senator Troeth's role as my deputy and acknowledge her counsel and common sense, her fairness and her understanding of the processes, policies and procedures of the committee. I found her input invaluable and I shall certainly miss her. And Senator Forshaw's experience, which is wide-ranging, including of the Senate and a whole range of matters that came before the committee, I also found invaluable, and I will miss him. I commend the report to the House. NA Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011 Second Reading",34
46,Mr SIMPKINS,BILLS," I welcome the opportunity to speak for a while longer on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. I will not delay the House too much. When my contribution was suspended last week, I had spoken for some time about the privations and the adversity that our former prisoners of war had endured in the Second World War, with particular not emphasis on the prisoners of the Japanese Imperial Army. I also spoke, as everyone has in this debate, about the need to acknowledge and express our appreciation of those veterans, those prisoners of war. The privations and the suffering that they have endured make them noteworthy of such considerations, as we have provided in the past as a coalition government and as the parliament should see passed today. When we look upon the contributions made to this country, it is right that we have a special regard for all those who have served in uniform. Greater love hath no man than to lay down his life for his country. And it is perfectly true of those who have served and those who continue to serve in uniform for our nation that they were prepared, and our current soldiers are prepared, to lay down their lives for our nation. It is therefore right that they should get appropriate consideration for the commitment that they have made. Serving in the Navy, the Army and the Air Force is not a normal job; it is taking up a life where the risks are greater than in other sectors within our community. It is therefore important as well that, we speak of the entitlements of our veterans, we must also have regard for everyone who has served our country. What last week revealed was that, although we may have bipartisan support for measures such as those that apply for prisoners of war, when it actually comes to the need for fairer indexation of military superannuation pensions, the comparison is very stark indeed. There are some that oppose fair indexation. The government, the Greens and Independent Senator Xenophon oppose fair indexation. Unfortunately, the Greens live in a fool's paradise where you can get by in the modern world without a defence force, when the reality is that sometimes you just have to fight, like those diggers, sailors and airmen did in past wars, because there is just no other option. So there are those who are opponents of a fair and just military superannuation system. Again, unfortunately it seems as though the government has failed to deliver what it promised in 2007 in the time since. It is really about time that fair indexation is introduced. We have learnt. We are committed to the course. I am committed to fair indexation. I thank my constituents for their advice and their feedback on these sorts of matters. I thank particularly a regular email contributor to my knowledge, Mr Terry 'Maddog' Malligan, from Madeley. I thank the members of the Ballajura RSL, who are holding their annual quiz night this coming Saturday night. I wish them all the best for that event and I will see them there. I thank the members of the Wanneroo-Joondalup RSL. In fact, I thank all the veterans and the ex-service men and women who have contacted me to tell me of their views on this matter. I have looked through this bill and I have looked at what it aims to achieve. I say that we certainly owe a debt of gratitude to those when who have served under the most hideous of conditions as prisoners of war. I also acknowledge all those who have worn the uniform and have been prepared to do what needs to be done for this nation's best interests. When I look at what has happened in the past and at the debt of gratitude that we really owe to all those who have served in uniform, not just prisoners of war, I look forward to fair indexation of superannuation being addressed. Unfortunately, it would appear that it will not be addressed until we are returned to government. I look forward to that at the earliest opportunity so that the coalition can provide full and fair indexation, in accordance with our last policy and in accordance with the wishes of the uniformed community, past and present, within our great country. This is what we owe them. This is what we need to come through with. We look forward to delivering that in the future. Mrs ELLIOT (RichmondParliamentary Secretary for Trade) (17:31): I am very pleased to be speaking on this bill before the House today, the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011, which gives effect to the government's budget commitments to the veterans community through three measures. The first measure is the new $27.2 million prisoner-of-war recognition supplement, which provides former POWs with an extra $500 per fortnight in recognition of their very special sacrifice and service. The second measure consists of amendments to compensationoffsetting provisions in the Veterans' Entitlements Act. This measure will help ensure equity for a claimant who is entitled to compensation for a level of incapacity under two schemes. The third measure will rationalise the temporary incapacity allowance and loss of earnings allowance to improve targeting of allowances for veterans and members who lose wages during periods of short-term incapacity. I am very proud to speak in relation to bill, to speak about this government's record in honouring our veterans and also to speak today about honouring all of those service men and women for the sacrifices they have made for our country. I particularly commend the measure to provide the prisoner-of-war recognition supplement. This measure is an acknowledgment of the commitment and obligation we owe to former Australian POWs for the sacrifices experienced by them in the service of our country. The POW recognition supplement is a $500 fortnightly payment made to all surviving Australian POWs of Japan and Europe from the Second World War and from the Korean War. It is estimated that approximately 900 former POWs will benefit from the payments. The Australian experience imprisonment during times of war dates back over 110 years to the time of the Boer War. Whilst individual stories vary greatly in the level of hardship and deprivation faced during times of internment across all conflicts, all of our POWs have some shared common experiences from their imprisonment, particularly including isolation from family and friends, the constant struggle for life, and the need to depend on their mates and comrades for daily survival and to maintain hope in such horrendous circumstances. I turn first to the First World War. For Australia, as for many nations, the First World War remains the most costly conflict in terms of deaths and casualties. From a population of fewer than five million, 416,809 men enlisted, of whom over 60,000 were killed and 156,000 wounded. More than 4,070 Australians spent the war as prisoners. The Gallipoli campaign saw the first of 217 Australians captured by Ottoman forces. On the battlefields of the Western this Front, 3,853 Australian troops were taken prisoner by German forces, most of them held in Germany. A third of these Australian prisoners were captured on 11 April 1917 at the First Battle of Bullecourt in northern France. A number of Australian airmen were also shot down and captured by the Germans. By the time of the armistice, signed in November 1918, a total of 395 Australians had died during their imprisonment in the First World War. In the Second World War, from 3 September 1939 almost a million Australians, both men and women, served in campaigns against Germany and Italy in Europe, the Mediterranean and North Africa, as well as against the Japanese in South-East Asia and other parts of the Pacific. Over 30,000 would never return home. More than of 30,000 were taken as prisoners of war. One of the most significant differences between this war and the First World War was the number of Australian troops captured. Almost eight times the number captured in the First World War were captured in the Second World War, the majority of these as prisoners of the Japanese. The Japanese treatment of its POWs is one of the darkest chapters in Australia's wartime history. In fact, it is difficult for many of us to comprehend how incredibly tragic an experience it was. Of the almost 9,000 Australians who were held in Italian and German camps and experienced varying degrees of mistreatment and brutality, some 250 men died during the war. Over 22,000 Australians became prisoners of war of the Japanese in South-East Asia. Almost 15,000 of the Australians were captured in Singapore, while the other principal Australian prisoner-of-war groups were captured in Java, Timor and Ambon. The most notorious and well-known names in the Australia's World War II experience are Changi, Borneo and the Thai-Burma Railroad. In fact, the name Changi is synonymous with the suffering of Australian prisoners of the Japanese during the Second World War. More than 100,000 Allied POWs were crammed into the Changi camp after the fall of Singapore. From May 1942, large work parties began to be sent out of Changi to work on projects such as the Thai-Burma Railway and in other work camps throughout Asia. In February 1942 there were around 15,000 Australians in Changi. By mid-1943 fewer than 2,500 remained. Australian POWs in Borneo were held in four main camps: Sandakan, Kuching, Labuan and Jesselton. Of these, Sandakan in North Borneo contained the majority of Australians. In January 1945, when the Japanese feared an Allied invasion of Borneo, they began a series of forced marches from Sandakan to Ranau-a distance of 260 kilometres along jungle tracks. Weak and sick mistreated prisoners starved to death on the way as food became scarcer and scarcer. They had no medical supplies and the terrain was muddy and treacherous. If a prisoner collapsed and not get up, he was usually shot dead by the Japanese. More marches followed until all POWs had left Sandakan. By the end of the war only six Australians of the 2,500 Allied POWs held at Sandakan had survived this horrific ordeal. Whilst Allied POWs were held across Asia, it is those camps along the Thai-Burma Railway during 1943 which remain most resonant for Australians in the Second World War POW experience; largely due to the fact that 9,500 Australians worked on the railway and nearly 7,000 survived to tell the story. The railway stretched 421 kilometres from Thailand to Burma, the aim being to provide the Japanese with a land access route from South-East Asia to supply their large army in Burma. Some 62,000 Australian, British and Dutch POWs, as well as a smaller group of American POWs and estimates of 270,000 Asian indentured labourers, occupied camps along the length of the line, moving from one site to the next as work progressed. The daily deprivations, misery and humiliation of this work are indeed impossible to comprehend. Some 12,000 Allied POWs died on the railway, including 2,646 Australians. The building of the railway exacted such a brutal toll due to the harsh treatment of the prisoners of war, the prevalence of disease, the terrible state of their health, the terrain through which they had to build, the climate of torrential monsoon rain, the extreme heat and the lack of adequate engineering tools and supplies. Though the railway was completed in mid-October 1943, it was never used. Almost as soon as it was completed it was damaged by Allied bombing. Today only sections of it survive. My great-uncle Harry Staples, of the 8th Division, died as a prisoner of war on the Thai-Burma Railway. A number of years ago I went to Kanchanburi in Thailand to the railway and walked through Hellfire Pass to could see the site where he and so many of our POWs suffered and died. Visiting the war graves highlighted for me how important it is as individuals, families, communities and a nation that we never forget the sacrifices that so many have made, and how important it is that we come together not just on days like Remembrance Day and ANZAC Day but at all times to remember their sacrifice. When we turn to civilian POWs, almost 1,500 Australian civilians spent the war in captivity, out of about 130,000 civilians interned by the Japanese. Australian army nurses were another group imprisoned. On 14 February 1942, following the fall of Singapore, 65 nurses were attempting to return to Australia on the ship Vyner Brooke. Twelve drowned when the vessel was torpedoed and 21 were massacred after reaching Bangka Island. The sole survivor from that was Nurse Vivian Bullwinkel. The other surviving nurses from the Vyner Brooke were imprisoned in a civilian camp in Sumatra. Eight of the 32 died in captivity. well. Although they were not made to work as the male POWs were, they were subject to many of the same deprivations and humiliations at the hands of the Japanese. Six Australian military nurses captured at Rabaul in January 1942 were sent to Japan and all survived the war. The Korean War began on 25 June 1950 and came to an end with the signing of an armistice on 27 July 1953. Australian casualties numbered more than 1,500, of whom 339 were killed. During the Korean War, 30 Australian servicemen were captured by North Korean or Chinese forces. Twenty-four of those taken prisoner were serving with the Australian Army, and six members of the Royal Australian Air Force were also captured. Of the 30 Australians, only one, Private HW Madden, died whilst imprisoned. Madden was posthumously awarded the George Cross. Prisoners in Korea suffered many of the same trials as those of the Japanese-neglect, hunger and brutality-but also the biting cold of a Korean winter, where temperatures could go as low as minus 60 degrees Celsius. By introducing this new payment for surviving Australian prisoners of war, the government's bill recognises the hardships these people endured and recognises the massive sacrifice they made in their service to our country. It is important that we always continue to remember that service and the sacrifices made by our past and also our serving defence forces, who paid the ultimate price. I would like to take the opportunity to commend all of the wonderful veterans groups in my electorate who work so tirelessly to ensure that we as communities continue to remember the great commitment of all of our veterans. I am fortunate to have a very large veterans community and wonderful individuals who do great work with veterans and in many other groups as I say in conclusion that whilst we reflect upon service in previous conflicts we must of course also remember those serving our nation currently. It is very important to remember the commitment that they have made. I would like to finish by remarking on the event last Friday in my electorate at Kingscliff where the funeral was held for Sapper Rowan Robinson, who died on 6 June while serving in Afghanistan. Sapper Robinson grew up in Kingscliff and around the North Coast, and his funeral was attended by many family and friends who recalled wonderful fond memories of him. I would like to say that our thoughts and prayers are with his family as we remember his sacrifice and his service to our nation. Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (17:44): I rise to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. This bill gives effect to a number of veterans' affairs 2011 budget measures: firstly, it will create a prisoner-ofwar recognition supplement, providing a $500 fortnightly payment to former Australian prisoners of war; secondly, it will clarify and affirm the original intention of the compensation-offsetting policy in respect of pensions payable under parts 2 and 4 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986; and, thirdly, schedule 3 rationalises temporary incapacity allowances for veterans. Reviewing the measures in more detail, specifically schedule 1, the prisoner-of-war recognition supplement, under this measure from 20 September this year former Australian prisoners of war will receive a $500 payment each fortnight from the Australian government. This payment will be made to former military personnel and civilians alike who were interned as prisoners of war during either World War II or the Korean War. These supplement payments will not be taxable and will not affect a former prisoner of war's present access to income support via the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Social Security Act, or compensation payments under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. There are over 900 Australians known to the Department of Veterans' Affairs as exprisoners of war. All of them will automatically receive the payment from 6 October. The coalition has a strong record of providing assistance to Australia's exprisoners of war. In 2001, all former Japanese POWs received a $25,000 tax-free ex gratia payment from the Australian government. In 2003, former Korean POWs received similar payments, as did former German and Italian POWs in 2007. This additional supplement payment is welcomed by the 900 Australian ex-POWs and their families who are eligible. As I indicated earlier, schedule 2 of this bill seeks to clarify the operation of compensation provisions under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Compensation offsetting is a long standing principle under Australia's repatriation system. The fundamental principle to this system is that payments of compensation are for incapacity. The coalition believes that the changes proposed by this schedule should be investigated by a Senate committee. We will seek to refer the bill so that the ex-service community will have the opportunity to have a say and provide input into the proposed changes. Finally, schedule 3 of the bill rationalises the manner in which incapacity payments are to be paid in accordance with the act. The changes provided by this bill remove the temporary incapacity allowance. In place of receiving this payment, a veteran will be entitled to seek access to the loss-of-earnings allowance or LOE, an allowance paid where the veteran accrues an actual loss of earnings as a result of hospitalisation or treatment of accepted disabilities or illnesses. The coalition is not opposed to this rationalisation and calls on the government to ensure the changes are appropriately and effectively communicated to the veterans and ex-service community. A further issue I address, relevant to this bill, is that of the ANZAC centenary. Unfortunately, no money was provided in the budget for the commemoration of the ANZAC centenary, a point I find deeply disappointing. So I ask: when will this government make a firm financial commitment to the ANZAC centenary in 2015? The significance of this centenary cannot be understated. Communities looking forward and beginning to plan for this most important national commemorative event require certainty in terms of funding and the level of federal support. I have on a number of occasions this year in the House mentioned the commemorative services held to mark the 69th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin during World War II. The bombings are a very significant event in the history of Darwin, the Northern Territory and Australia. Commemoration of this event has enormous significance for those who were present in Darwin during the air raids. Furthermore, the significance of this commemoration retains its importance to today's Territorians and to past and present personnel of the Australian Defence Force. Planning is well underway for next year's 70th anniversary of the bombing-of-Darwin commemorations. Earlier this year, Senator Crossin called for the bombing of Darwin to be marked by a public holiday. I understand the sentiment; however, I am not here advocating for a public holiday; I am here asking that the government appropriately acknowledge this event as one of national significance and that some funding be provided for commemoration of this important historical event. While the coalition welcomes the government's belated funding increase to the Australian War Memorial, the coalition remains concerned that no funding to redevelop the World War I galleries has been identified. The coalition has committed funds towards this work to facilitate its completion ahead of the 2015 ANZAC centenary commemorations. It is very disappointing that the Gillard Labor government acted to increase the Australian War Memorial funding only after significant pressure from the community and from the coalition. I have been contacted by the president of my local branch of the National Servicemen's Association of Australia, Mr Ivan Walsh, who wrote to the Department of Veterans' Affairs over seven months ago requesting permission to erect a permanent flagpole at the Adelaide River War Cemetery. It is extremely disappointing these men who served our country are yet to receive a response from the department regarding a simple request for permission erect a flagpole as a permanent feature for ongoing commemorative services at the Adelaide River War Cemetery. I seek leave to table the letter. Leave granted. Mrs GRIGGS: I ask if the minister could please look into this issue, as the Adelaide River War Cemetery is a very significant commemorative area and it is also in his electorate. As the years have gone by, there seems to be more focus on Adelaide River War Cemetery for commemorative events. They are asking permission to have the flagpole installed before the national Remembrance Day in November. I would really appreciate it if the minister could investigate this and provide an answer to the committee. Another matter of disappointment is that the Gillard Labor government will cut $8 million from grassroots veterans advocacy funding over the forward estimates. I know that a review of the advocacy funding, released 12 months ago, did not recommend a cut in funding, which makes this recent announcement even harder to understand. Veterans services provided by volunteers from within our local community, particularly services to those new veterans returning from recent conflicts and their families, will definitely be impacted. My electorate represents Defence Force constituents who have served overseas, are still serving overseas or are due to be deployed. From the perspective of the electorate of Solomon, the issues relevant to veterans are of significant concern. This government must ensure that it looks after our defence personnel both during and after their service to this wonderful country of ours. The ex-servicemen community had no warning that cuts to advocacy funding were that likely or about the impact of having to compete for a smaller funding pool. It is not good enough. This cut could also jeopardise to the provision of assistance to younger veterans and their families, who may seek advice from volunteer veteran pension and welfare officers about claims for compensation. As I mentioned earlier this year in this place, the coalition remains the only party in the parliament committed to military superannuation reform. I take this opportunity to touch on Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits and DFRB fair indexation. The Labor Party and the Greens stand condemned for their failure to support the coalition's bill to provide fair indexation to DFRDB and DFRB superannuants. This is simply not good enough. The coalition believes the current indexation arrangements are unfair. The opposition of the LaborGreens alliance means that the only way to deliver these reforms is through the election of a coalition government. I reaffirm comments made earlier by my colleagues in this place that the coalition is committed to Australian veterans.",35
47,Mr ADAMS,BILLS," It is a great pleasure to speak on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. I say to the honourable member for Solomon, who thought to raise in the debate on this very good bill political issues about superannuation for the people presently serving in the military, that there were 11 years during which some of us made representation to the previous government about this, and nothing occurred. It is a pretty poor effort to come here and start raising this on a veterans bill when we have some pretty good news here for veterans and ex-prisoners-of-war. The member may want to get into some of the history as to why her party did not deliver over those 11 years. This bill gives effect to the veterans' affairs 2011 budget measures, which will create a prisoner of war recognition supplement, clarifying and affirming the original intention of the compensation offsetting policy in relation to disability pensions, rationalised temporary incapacity allowance and the loss of earnings allowance. I first became aware of prisoners of war because of my friends Philip and John Green, whom I grew up with and went to school with and who are both still my friends. John has moved away a bit, but Philip is still a great mate. Their fathers were both prisoners of war. As boys we talked about this and discussed it, and I met their fathers, who had gone through that terrible experience. They were both in Timor when it fell-I think Sparrow Force was among the forces that were there as our forward defence before the Japanese landed about 22,000 troops, on their forward movement into that area-and they were taken prisoner. Georgie Green, Philip's father, spent his time as a prisoner of war on the Burma railway, and I think Teddy-John's fatherspent some time in the bicycle camp in Timor and later in that same area. That was not a very pleasant experience for them. In later years George was very pleased to visit Hellfire Pass and take his grandson there to show him the places where he had had to endure some harsh treatment and was able to survive that. I think it was just about trying to show those at home what they had endured, where they had endured it and how in they had survived it. These were guys who never spoke of or glorified anything about war and were always conscious of that in their activities. Georgie and Teddy were great role models and great men who had a lot of respect in the community. The community in which I grew up, the Longford community, had an RSL which was built in 1947 by the returning veterans. The annual ANZAC Day sports event was a pretty well-known event right throughout Tasmania. Most of us growing up in the 1950s and going to school attended those sports days. We learnt what ANZAC Day was about and what remembrance was about, and that worked very well. I can remember Georgie Green presenting me with an icecream after I had run a footrace. Footraces were never my great strength, but I can remember getting an ice-cream from Georgie Green, so it was a great opportunity. We remember those veterans and those people who were prisoners of war, as we should do. We remember the great stories and the written work of Weary Dunlop and the wonderful innovations that Weary was able to bring to bear in order to help prisoners survive, using needles and implements made out of bamboo to give rainwater to those suffering from bad dysentery and lack of fluids. Incredible work and effort went into making those things work. We read about how, through Weary Dunlop's efforts, public health issues were addressed by draining away water from around the camps to prevent malaria and by ensuring cleanliness when prisoners were cooking their food. These stories are worth reading for any young person wanting to have an understanding of those times and to come to grips with what war and deprivation can bring. While we are having this debate on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill, it is worth mentioning the 100th anniversary of ANZAC Day in 2015 and to remember the battles which took place in the First World War. My Uncle Charles, my grandfather's brother, is buried on the Somme. When you look at those graves, which you see right through Europe, you realise what difficult issues people were faced with. This bill certainly gives recognition to prisoners of war and their dependants through a range of benefits and reflects severe circumstances of their service. Widows of former prisoners of war are eligible for war widow pensions and the gold card. Funeral benefits are payable for deceased former prisoners of war. Children of deceased former prisoners of war are eligible for veterans children's education schemes. (Quorum formed) I thank my colleagues for their attendance in the chamber during my speech on the bill. The amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act made by schedule 1 will give effect to the 2011 budget measure to create a new prisoner of war recognition supplement, the POWR supplement. That supplement will be $500 per fortnight, payable to former prisoners of war in recognition of the severe hardship and deprivations that they experienced in the service of their country. A lot of veterans are no longer with us. The two I spoke about earlier, Georgie Green and Teddy Green, have now both passed on. On first meeting these ex-prisoners of war I found them both to be upstanding men. They were ordinary workers, Teddy having a small farm after shearing for a long time. He spent most of his life around the Cressy district. They were both men of great character, men that most of us growing up looked up to as decent human beings marching on ANZAC Day, giving recognition to their service to their country under great hardship. There is a lot of work to do on cenotaphs around the country in recognition of the 100year anniversary of the ANZACs in 2015. There is a lot of tidying up work to be done, especially in the areas surrounding the cenotaphs. I think government has a role to play and I certainly hope there will be some grant programs to allow veterans' communities, along with local councils and others, to participate in bringing those cenotaphs up to the standard that we in this country expect of them. I have been involved the in several of those over different governments and a lot of them have worked very well, keeping our cenotaphs and our memorials up to standard. I understand there has been a lot of work done in different parts of the world-in France and at ANZAC Cove. It would be interesting to see what has occurred there. A lot of young people these days are finding it very interesting to be involved in these recognitions. That makes us think about why young people are taking such an interest in our veterans and in the wars that we have been involved in. I think it is about young people becoming aware of community, of their sense of duty and of what being involved in a community can mean. Going to war, being a prisoner of war, can certainly give you that perspective by recognising what people have gone through. So it has something to do with that. I pay tribute to the uncle of Peter Lawrence from my electorate. Peter, who passed away this week, searched for his uncle's medals for many years. Before Peter died, I presented him with the service medals of his uncle Leo Lawrence. It is very sad to lose Peter. I pass on my condolences to his family. He will be buried on Thursday. He was proud of his uncle's service to his nation and he has now passed on. I support the bill.",42
48,Mr MCCORMACK,BILLS," The Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011 gives effect to creating a prison-of-war recognition supplement, clarifying and affirming the original intention of the compensation offsetting policy in relation to disability pensions, and rationalising temporary incapacity allowance and loss of earnings allowance. The coalition agrees with all these measures. Schedule 1 of the bill provides that, from 20 September this year, former Australian prisoners of war will receive a $500 payment each fortnight from the Australian government. This payment will be made to former military personnel and civilians who were taken as prisoners of war during World War II and the Korean War. This payment will not be taxable and will not affect present access by former prisoners of war to income support under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Social Security Act or to compensation payments under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. There are almost 900 Australians known by the Department of Veterans' Affairs to be ex-POWs. All known ex-prisoners of war will automatically receive the payment, which they will be paid from 6 October. The coalition has a strong record of providing assistance to Australia's exprisoners of war. In 2001, all former Japanese prisoners of war received a $25,000 tax-free, ex gratia payment from the Australian government. In 2003, former Korean prisoners of war and, in 2007, former German and Italian prisoners of war received similar payments. This additional payment will be welcomed by the 900 Australian exprisoners of war-and their families-who are eligible for the payment. Schedule 2 of the bill seeks to clarify the operation of compensation provisions under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Compensation offsetting is a long standing principle under Australia's repatriation system. The fundamental principle of Australia's system is that compensation is paid for incapacity, not for a specific injury. The coalition believes that the changes proposed by this schedule should be investigated by a Senate committee. We will seek to refer the bill to afford the ex-service community an opportunity to have input into the proposed changes. Schedule 3 of the bill will rationalise the way incapacity payments are paid under the act. The changes in this bill will remove the temporary incapacity allowance. Instead of receiving this payment, the veteran will be entitled to seek access to the loss of earnings allowance-LOE. The loss of earnings allowance is paid where the veteran accrues an actual loss of earnings as a result of hospitalisation or treatment of accepted disabilities or illnesses. The coalition is not opposed to this rationalisation and calls on the government to ensure the changes are appropriately communicated to the veteran and ex-service community. The coalition is deeply disappointed that there was no money in the budget for the commemoration of the ANZAC centenary. Communities across Australia need certainty about the availability of funding so that they can begin planning for this important, national commemorative event. I regard ANZAC Day as our most important national day, and I am sure that most, if not all, members opposite would agree with me. The importance of this occasion was today marked by New Zealand Prime Minister, John Key, who defined it as a deeply significant occasion for both countries. The coalition welcomes the government's belated funding increase to the Australian War Memorial. It is disappointing that the Gillard Labor government acted only after significant pressure from the community and the coalition which forced them kicking and screaming to this outcome. The coalition remains concerned that there is no funding to completely redevelop the World War I galleries. The coalition has committed funds towards this work so that it is completed ahead of the 2015 ANZAC centenary commemorations. Labor must now do the same thing. The Gillard Labor government will cut $8 million from grassroots veterans' advocacy funding over the forward estimates. This decision will have a severe impact on the services provided by volunteers in our local community to veterans, especially to new veterans returning from recent conflicts, and to their families. A review of advocacy funding released 12 months ago did not recommend a cut in funding, which makes this announcement in the budget even more difficult to understand. The ex-service community had no warning that this cut was coming and they will now compete for a smaller funding pool. This cut could also jeopardise the provision of assistance to younger veterans and their families, who may seek advice from volunteer veteran pension and welfare officers about claims for compensation. In terms of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme and DFRB fair indexation, the coalition is committed to military superannuation reform. The Labor Party and the Greens stand condemned for their failure to support the coalition's bill to provide fair indexation to DFRDB and DFRB superannuants. The coalition believes the current indexation arrangements are palpably unfair. The opposition of the LaborGreens alliance means the only way to deliver this reform is with the election of a coalition government. I might read a letter that I received, as would many other members of parliament. It is from Bert Hoebee, who for a time served with distinction at Blamey Barracks at Kapooka, which is in Wagga Wagga-my hometown-in the electorate of Riverina. Wagga Wagga is the home of the soldier, because every recruit in the Australian Army goes through Wagga Wagga, through Blamey Barracks, prior to other deployments within the Army. Bert Hoebee writes: Recently I wrote to you about the matter of social justice for veterans. On 2 June, the House of Representatives agreed, evidently without dissent, to support the Coalition's policy of fair indexation for military superannuation pensions. On 16 June, the Senate voted down the Bill to provide for implementation of that policy. This despicable act of bastardryas Bert writesand political opportunism, directly and with the utmost disdain, ignored the will of the people of Australia as expressed in the House two weeks prior. This act of what some call 'betrayal' was aided and abetted by the Greens, who abandoned their own policy to support fair indexation, through the complicity of its 'contribution' that had nothing more to offer but pompous statements on issues irrelevant to the case. Thus are ex-service people condemned to continued unfair and unjust superannuation pension indexation, ever-depreciating purchasing power and reducing standards of living. Where are Labor's core value of fairness and its principle of a fair go for all Australians reflected in all this? Any government and its hangers-on that ignores the will of the people and turns its back on Australian service men and women in this reprehensible manner does so at its peril. I now ask you, again, to examine your conscience, and ask: what are you going to do about this unjust treatment of Australia's ex-service people, in direct contravention of the express will of the House? In another email, he writes: It is high time to fairly index the pensions of all of our superannuated veterans (under the nowclosed DFRB and DFRDB Scheme and the current MSBS scheme)the Military Superannuation Schemeand to put a stop to discrimination against them. That is the fair deal which was a condition of their employment and to which they contributed financially during their service. Just and fair: nothing more, nothing less. Simple. Easily doable. Long overdue. This from a man who served his country with distinction. This is a man who, as I say, represented the Army in the home of the soldier, Blamey Barracks. I think it is high time that we listened more and more to people like Bert Hoebee. They, after all, represent the grassroots of our militarythose people who served with distinction, who served with absolute determination and high principle and who should be listened to. It is high time to fairly index the pensions of all our superannuated veterans and to put a stop to discrimination against them. That is the deal which was a condition of their employment, as Bert wrote, and to which they contributed financially during their service. I call on the government to do it. Mr LAURIE FERGUSON (Werriwa) (18:18): The previous speaker, the member for Riverina, made recourse to a fair bit of rhetoric there. He spoke of things being of 'palpably unfair'. He referred to letters that talk about pompous statements from the government. He used words such as 'complicity', 'political opportunism' and 'betrayal'. Quite frankly, I am amazed that that kind of outburst can occur this evening, because for 11 long years the Howard government was incapable of doing anything about what the member now defines as being 'palpably unfair'. To come in here and carry on in such a fashion, opportunistically appealing to the veteran community, is just pathetic. This morning's Sydney Morning Herald has a very timely obituary in regard to this piece of legislation. It outlined the life of Benefits Keith Shearim, who at 19 years of age was captured in Singapore in February 1942. Starting at 19 years, I stress, he was to spend three years in prison. He was quoted as saying: I survived on rice sludge: always the samebreakfast, dinner and tea. He said later: It was always full of weevils and rat dung. He further commented of this period that he survived through 'good luck, good officers, good non-commissioned officers' and good luck again. As I say, that is a very timely summary of the situation of many of those who still survive, who the government is trying to repay in some fashion this evening through this legislation. As has been detailed by others, the survivors number only 996. That is the number of gold card recipients, and that is probably a very reasonable summary. That is why the total cost of this legislation is estimated at only $27 million over the next four years. Of course, that is an indication what is going to happen with demography. The cost will reduce from $8.5 million in the first year to $4.5 million in four years time. (Quorum formed) As I was saying, the budget figures indicate that within four years the 900-odd recipients will be reduced by half. The Australian prisoner-of-war experience started with the Boer War, where 104 people were incarcerated. They shared the same experience as the future Prime Minister of Britain Sir Winston Churchill. However, while they say that generally the winners write the history, in the case of the Boer War perhaps the most reprehensible and atrocious conditions were those that the British forced upon the Boer civilians, with large numbers dying in camps. This was in an indication of what was to happen in the Vietnam War, where large numbers of civilians were moved so that they had no connection with military forces. Of course, what particularly stands out in Australian history is the situation in Japan. We know that in the European theatre of war the mortality rate of prisoners was only three per cent, whereas 36 per cent of prisoners of the Japanese perished. We have heard accounts of and know well the Sandakan march where 3,500 civilian Indonesians and 2,500 prisoners of war perished. They were originally used to construct an airstrip and prisoner camp and then, with allied action in Borneo, were forced to go on marches where they all perished. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East in 1946 undertook an investigation of Japanese atrocities in the Second World War and convicted 5,700 officers for categories B and C prisoner abuse. Amongst the more infamous outcomes of that inquiry was that Shiro Ishii was given immunity for providing statistics to the allies of the people of that he had killed with experiments. Even the Indian judge, Radhabinod Pal, who in the end objected to convicting the Japanese, said: The evidence is still overwhelming that atrocities were perpetrated by members of the Japanese armed forces against the civilian populations of some of the territories occupied by them, as also against prisoners of war. It is disturbing that by 2006 a survey by Asahi news in Japan indicated that 70 per cent of those Japanese who responded were totally unaware of the war time experience of prisoners of war. As I said, the conditions these people suffered were not of the usual standard that one has come to expect. The survival rates in other theatres of war and other conflicts were far greater. The situation was that of the 22,380-odd Australians who were prisoners of the Japanese 8,000 died in captivity-a situation which is fairly unparalleled in history. I stress that there were also 250,000 local people who were mistreated by the Japanese in the Burma-Thailand rail project. It was not just the prisoners of war, but it was a serious event in Australian history. I want to give some credit to Tom Uren, a former member of this House, a former minister and my predecessor as the member for Reid. He was captured in Timor and was one of the huge numbers of people who were imprisoned and were victims of Japanese incarceration. His lessons out of this were perhaps different from those of some people who were never in prison. He devoted himself throughout his career to the search for international peace and cooperation. He was a staunch opponent of the war in Vietnam. He always stressed that what he learned from his period with Weary Dunlop and others was cooperation, that they survived because people learned to work together and that, as a community, people are capable of overcoming the worse and the most horrendous conditions. That was to be a life-guiding point for him, something he learned from that experience in Japan. He has played a significant role with regard to advocacy for these people over many decades. I was speaking to him a few weeks ago and-of course he did not specify to me what was going to occur in the budget-he was looking forward to a good decision. This is what has come out of it: a payment of $500 per fortnight to the remaining 990-odd victims. It is not only people like Tom Uren. I want to briefly talk about my wife's uncle, Ernest John Walsh, who was captured in Singapore in 1941. He was thought to be missing at first. It was quite a period of before they were actually certain that he was a prisoner. That only occurred on 17 November 1943. He was both in Singapore and on the Burma-Thailand railway. I think what is important here is that the suffering that people endured was in some cases to be with them for the rest of their lives. Knowing my wife's uncle and her broader family, the condition of his children was the worse of all of those in the extended family. He was renowned for alcoholism. He was incapable of not assaulting policemen and others in uniform. He tended to become very aggressive towards them, attacking them when there was no need whatsoever. Ernest Walsh lived with the problems he experienced as a prisoner of the Japanese for the rest of his life. His family, including his children, was very much affected by those problems. Whilst he might have been a TPI and received a number of medals and awards for his commitment to this country, the kind of suffering he experienced has a lifelong effect on people. It is that effect that this government is attempting at a very late stage to do something about, which many governments, Labor and Liberal, have failed over many decades to do. We are recognising the particular conditions that these people endured over and above the majority of servicemen. I commend the legislation.",44
49,Mr SNOWDON,BILLS,"Lingiari-Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Indigenous Health) (18:30): I thank the member for Werriwa for his contribution to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill. He is just leaving the chamber, but I will come to his contribution in a moment. In summing up, I acknowledge the contributions of the members for Fadden, Ryan, Maranoa, Herbert, Solomon, MCPherson, Cowan and Riverina for the time opposition and the members for MCEwen, Shortland, Richmond, Lyons and Werriwa for the government. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill will give effect to three 2011 budget measures. Firstly, the bill will create a new prisoner of war recognition supplement for Australians who were prisoners of war. The new supplement of $500 per fortnight will be paid in recognition of the hardships that these men and women endured during their captivity. It is expected that approximately 900 former prisoners of war will benefit from the new, fortnightly supplement, which will be payable from 20 September 2011, the first payment being made on 6 October 2011. I thank the member for Werriwa for his insights into the sacrifices made by prisoners of war. In particular, I reflect upon the 8,000 who died, out of a total of 22,300 prisoners, as a result of their treatment while in captivity with the Japanese. That should give us some insight about the nature of their treatment. I think his understanding, and that of other members of the parliament, of the issue says a lot about our appreciation of not only the contribution made by service men and women but in particular the sacrifices which were made by these very brave men and women. Those who are still with us have proved how resilient and tough they were. Clearly, their lives would have been in danger constantly. I am sure the suffering they endured would have left some of them, as the member for Werriwa pointed out, in a state where they would have had real issues over the remainder of their lives. I know that when this payment was announced by the Prime Minister-and I thank her for making it-at Kirribilli with a group of war veterans who were former prisoners of war it was a salutary experience for me especially, as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, to see how stoic these men were and remain, how resilient they are and, indeed, what a positive attitude they have to life. That says heaps about them as individuals and about us as a community and a country. Further amendments in the bill will clarify and affirm the compensation offsetting legislation under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Offsetting is intended to prevent double payments of compensation for the same incapacity, as I think is now understood. A decision of the full Federal Court highlighted the need to clarify this aspect of the legislation. The bill clarifies and affirms compensation offsetting legislation that has been in place in the repatriation system since 1973. Finally, the bill will rationalise and better target payments for veterans and members who are undergoing treatment for war or defence caused injuries or diseases. The bill will remove the current overlap in the allowances paid to veterans and members who are unable to work due to episodes of medical treatment and recuperation for war or defence caused injuries or diseases. Payments of temporary incapacity allowance will cease from 20 September 2011, with future payments being better targeted through the loss-of-earnings allowance. This measure has no impact on a veteran's or member's existing disability pension payment. From 20 September 2011, all eligible veterans and members in this situation will be assessed consistently against the criteria for loss-of-earnings allowance. These measures continue the government's commitment to streamlining and enhancing services and support to our veterans and members and their families. A number of matters were raised by opposition members during the debate and, indeed, have been raised outside of this place by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Senator Ronaldson. Despite what has been asserted, the budget measures included in this bill were the subject of wide consultation with the ex-service community. Post-budget briefings of heads of ex-service organisations, or ESOs, were held; an exservices round-table, including a separate briefing on the measures in this legislation, was held; PMAC, the Prime Ministerial Advisory Council, was briefed, and the ESO deputy commissioners in each state and territory discussed the issues with their ESO community. There was widespread discussion and consultation with the veteran community about the budget measures raised the in the bill. We know, as I am sure you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the ex-service community has some very skilled practitioners who know how this legislation works and are free to raise concerns about these measures-which has not happened to date. The compensation offsetting provisions, despite the comments which have been made, are not about changing the current arrangements; they are about ensuring that the principles of offsetting, which have been in place since 1973, are clear and unambiguous. These measures, quite simply, maintain the status quo. These measures ensure that veterans cannot get compensated twice for the same incapacity. That is widely accepted by the ex-service community. These amendments do not deny or change any existing veterans' entitlements. Let us be very clear about it: these amendments simply clarify and affirm existing arrangements that have been operating under all governments since 1973. The member for Fadden specifically raised communication with regard to the proposed rationalisation of the temporary incapacity allowance and the loss of earnings allowance in the veteran community. I am pleased to inform the member that there is a communication plan in place. As with any changes to any measure, communication with the veteran community occurs as a matter of course. In addition to the briefing sessions already being provided and having been provided to ex-service organisations nationwide, key strategies will include provision of information to organisations, articles for the Veterans' Affairs Newsletter and updated information on the DVA website. The department will also be writing to veterans who may be affected in order to manage transition to the new arrangements. I wish to briefly raise three other issues. One of them is funding for the Australian War Memorial. This matter has been raised in this place by a number of opposition speakers, as well as by the shadow minister outside this place and, indeed, in the Senate itself. It needs to be made very clear that this government is now providing funding of an additional $8 million a year, on top of the current $38 million, to the Australian War Memorial budget. That is a 21 per cent increase in its budget. That was done as a result of an examination of its finances, which was undertaken by me and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation at the request of the Prime Minister. We have responded to a very important need to provide additional resources to the Australian War Memorial, yet there has not been one jot of recognition from the opposition of the fact that the government has actually done something well beyond what the Australian War Memorial was initially asking for. Mr Randall interjecting",48
50,Mr SNOWDON,BILLS,"We were not dragged kicking and screaming anywhere, my friend. Let us be very clear about this. This process started at the end of October last year and it is an initiative of this government. We have had the shadow minister walking around the country bleating that, somehow or other, the opposition has forced the government into this position. That is an absolutely ludicrous proposition and anyone who has dealt with or had any knowledge of the Australian War Memorial, the Council of the Australian War Memorial, the staff of the Australian War Memorial and the staff of the Department of the Veterans' Affairs would be able to tell you that that is not the case. But these clowns opposite prefer not to listen. So what we now have is an argument that, somehow or other, we have not provided sufficient resources to the Australian War Memorial for the development of its World War I galleries. Let me make it very clear: this budget provides $1.7 million for the memorial to scope the full scale of the refurbishment. It may surprise the opposition that, despite the bleatings that we are not providing resources to the War Memorial for this particular purpose, this $1.7 million was precisely the amount of money the Australian War Memorial asked for. We were requested by the Australian War Memorial to provide them with $1.7 million for a scoping study so they could update their First World War galleries. The money has been provided. So let us not have any more cant from the opposition, particularly from the shadow spokesman, on this issue, because it is very clear we are meeting our responsibilities most importantly, we are doing it in conjunction with the Australian War Memorial. The third issue I want to refer to is the opposition's criticism of the government about not providing funding for the centenary of ANZAC for the 2011-12 budget. Again, I am at a bit of a loss to understand where the opposition is coming from here. The National Commission on the Commemoration of the ANZAC Centenary report, How Australia may commemorate the ANZAC Centenary, was presented to the Prime Minister on 28 March 2011. The Prime Minister indicated that the government would respond later in 2011. In the lead-up to the ANZAC Centenary, the government has undertaken preparatory work, including the establishment of the ANZAC Centenary Advisory Board. I will, hopefully, be making an announcement as to the chair of the board very shortly. The opposition's commentary on this issue, like so many others in the veterans' community, is another example of creating unnecessary and unwarranted concern. It is a beat-up. The shadow veterans' affairs minister mentioned that the Australia Remembers 1945-1995 program set the standard. He referred to the Australia Remembers program. But he may be interested to know that no funding was provided in 1993-94 budget for that program, which, in the context of time, is comparable to the 2012-13 budget for the centenary of ANZAC. There was no money provided in an equivalent year. Initial funding of $350,000 was provided in the 1994-95 budget, which, in contemporary terms, is comparable to the 2013-14 budget. So let us be clear: we are well ahead of the game. The government will have funding in place well before then for and, the centenary of ANZAC arrangements, and the Prime Minister has requested that we take matters back to the cabinet later this year. The last matter I wish to raise is military superannuation. The shadow minister is on about this all the time, despite what we tell him. He appears to have a tin ear. This matter was raised by, among others, the member for Fadden, the member for Riverina and the member for Solomon. In 11 years of government, when the now opposition were in control of the treasury bench, in a period of economic sunshine, they did nothing about superannuation indexation-not a jot! They come in here, crying crocodile tears about the need for reform in the superannuation system but, when they had the levers of government, when they were in control of the treasury bench, they did absolutely nothing about it. What they are saying is clearly hypocritical. You had your opportunity, you were in government for 11 years and you did nothing. By the way, the proposal the opposition have put forward-and we saw it debated in the Senate-has not even been properly funded. The real fiscal cost of their proposal was $1.7 billion over four years, with an underlying cash cost of $175 million. It would have increased the government's unfunded liabilities by $6.2 billion. Furthermore, their proposal was discriminatory. It did not even include the over 90 per cent of current ADF members in the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme. It deigned to do something about some but not all. Superannuation is a means by which Australians can manage their living standards in retirement. It is not designed to provide a replacement for income earned over a working life. The opposition has been hypocritical in every sense on this issue and on so many others in the area of veterans' affairs. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Administrator recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",50
51,Mr SNOWDON,BILLS,"by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 5) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (18:47): I rise on behalf of the opposition to address the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 5) Bill. I want to briefly do two thingsto run through some of the detail of the five schedules in the bill, and to address a related issue on one aspect of one of those schedules. The opposition will not be opposing this tax law amendment bill. The five schedules deal with, as you would expect, a range of aspects-some of them are rectifications to the tax law; others are to implement budget decisions. While the coalition obviously have varying views on each of the schedules, ultimately we will not be opposing the bill. As was outlined by the Assistant Treasurer in the second reading speech some days ago, and as is detailed in the explanatory memorandum, this tax law amendment bill has five schedules. Two of them deal with trust law, and I will deal with both of them together. The first schedule deals with changes to trust law regarding income averaging and farm management deposits. As we know, income averaging is used to smooth primary production income over time. Under tax ruling 95/29, a beneficiary of a rural trust was considered to be carrying on a rural enterprise in a year when the trust suffered a loss and could thereby continue to average their income and maintain their farm management deposits. In a 2010 High Court case, Commissioner of Taxation v Bamford, it was decided that a beneficiary to a rural trust could not be presently entitled to a share of trust income if there was no income to be distributed. This had the flow-on effect of the beneficiary losing status as a primary producer and therefore, naturally, the ability to retain farm management deposits. In essence, as outlined in the government's second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, the effect was to overturn the substance of that tax ruling. As sometimes occurs, this schedule reinstates the law to the place where it was before the Bamford case, and we on this side of the House acknowledge that that will be welcomed by rural businesses that use trust structures. Schedule 2 deals with trust income streaming and affects trusts in receipt of capital gains or franked distributions. The changes within the schedule are also a result of that same decision which altered some of the legal definitions of trust beneficiaries. In particular, it raised fundamental issues regarding the mismatch between the amount beneficiaries can be assessed for tax purposes with the amount they are entitled to under the tax law. This mismatch, according to the explanatory memorandum, could result in the potential for tax manipulation and avoidance. The government asked the Board of Taxation for advice on what changes were required immediately, pending a broader review of trust taxation. The measures in the bill flow from that advice. The government released a discussion paper back in March. The consultation resulted in the inclusion of specific anti-avoidance and a carve-out for managed investment trusts. The new law allows trustees to stream capital gains and franked distributions to specific beneficiaries. It also introduces concept of a specific entitlement to ensure a beneficiary's share of this stream reflects their entitlement under the trust deed and it introduces specific anti-avoidance rules so that income cannot be sheltered in exempt beneficiaries. We are told through the explanatory memorandum that the financial impact of both of these first two schedules nil. Schedule 3 makes some technical amendments to the National Rental Affordability Scheme. I will not elaborate on that beyond what has already been pointed out. Schedule 4 and schedule 5 deal with two budget announcements. The first is the phasing out of the dependent spouse tax offset, which was announced just a few weeks ago. The dependent spouse tax offset will not be available for spouses 40 years old or younger, meaning that it will be phased out over time as fewer and fewer people are eligible to claim it. The budget announcement dressed this up as a measure to remove the disincentive for younger dependent spouses without children to remain out of the workforce, but given the financial impact it is obvious for all to see that this is a savings measure that the government has jumped on at the first opportunity. Whilst it was in the budget, it was not identified by the government itself any prior point in time. The final schedule deals with fringe benefits tax rules for motor vehicles. This has received a significant airing. All of the legislative changes for this measure will have an ongoing gain of nearly $1 billion in revenue over the forward estimates. We are told that it will be $961.9 million precisely rules over the next four years. The member for Fremantle and I will check in four years time to see whether it is $961.9 million precisely, but that is what we are told in the the explanatory memorandum. It obviously occurs from significant changes to the way that FBT works for motor vehicles. It was well aired in the days after the budget. It will mean those who drive fewer than 15,000 kilometres a year will pay less FBT. We are told that those who drive 15,000 to 25,000 kilometres a year will pay about the same, is and those who drive more than 25,000 kilometres will, in all likelihood, pay more fringe benefits tax. I will not go through all of the details other than to say that it is obvious that the government has also grabbed this measure to raise as much revenue as it can. The increase in revenue is actually over five years, so the member for Fremantle and I will have to wait a little bit longer. Most of the gain is in 2014-15, so it is mostly over the forward estimates. We are told in the table of revenue gains that there will be a small gain in 2010-11. I did say at the outset that there was another issue I want to address and that relates to trusts. As I said in relation to the first measure, the coalition welcomes the changes in the bill which make improvements in laws relating to primary production trusts. However, coalition senators in particular have identified other taxation laws relating to primary production trusts which should be improved. Under the at Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 primary production trusts can defer taxation liabilities on profits from the sale of livestock in years where they have been affected by drought, flood, fire or disease, but if the beneficiary a trust dies this is considered a disentitling event. Tax liabilities cannot continue to be deferred after a disentitling event. As a result, tax deferrals cease and the trust is liable for tax on profits deferred in the year that the death occurs. That is all outlined in section 385/163(3) of the 1997 act. I am told that under the previous tax law the Commissioner of Taxation had discretion and under the current act that discretion does not exist. The coalition was prepared to move a second reading amendment to this bill to give it an airing and to try to have matter rectified. There were discussions with the Independents and with the government. The coalition recognises and appreciates those discussions which were led by my colleague Senator Cormann. As I said, those discussions were not only with the crossbenchers but also with the government. Following those discussions, the coalition has decided not to move an amendment to this bill on this issue as a result of the fact that the government have agreed to make the necessary legislative changes to rectify this issue in the near future. On behalf the coalition, I say that we take the government and the Assistant Treasurer at their word. We welcome the government's commitment on this important issue which was identified in the recent Senate estimates hearings, I am told. We look forward to the government and the tax office bringing forward the relevant amendment-no doubt in a future tax law amendment bill that will come before this House in the not-too-distant future.",52
52,Ms PARKE,BILLS," I rise to speak in support of this legislation and the provisions it makes in relation to the fringe benefit tax on employee vehicles and the tax amendments to the Rental Affordability Scheme. This reform is a small but of significant part of the government's steady, thorough progress towards creating a sustainable energy future for Australia. That can only be achieved by ensuring that policy settings across the board provide incentives for energy efficiency in all areas of the Australian economy and of Australian life, and on the other hand, by removing what might otherwise have functioned as unnecessary incentives for inefficient energy use. This relatively small piece of tax reform achieves that by removing a tax calculation that had the effect of rewarding those who that drive company vehicles more than they otherwise would. The amended approach will instead encourage a more conservative, energy efficient approach to car use for work purposes. This is also an example of the government's willingness to reform the tax system in the interests of ensuring that the structure of tax assessments and concessions is actually working to achieve appropriate economic and wider policy outcomes. Where that is not the case and where there is a setting that forgoes revenue or makes a support payment that is unnecessary and ineffective, or even, as in this case, travelling in the wrong direction, it is absolutely right for government to say, 'We are going to make savings and we are going to apply government funds and concessions so that they work to achieve the positive reform that Australia needs right now and in the long term.' Under the existing FBT regime, an employee issued with a company vehicle would be liable to pay fringe benefit tax according to one of two separate cost calculations: the operating cost method and the statutory formula method. The proposed changes will not affect the operating cost method of calculating FBT which still allows for the use of log books to maintain a record of personal and work related travel. This bill addresses inadequacies in the statutory formula method by removing factors that encourage higher vehicle usage and replacing them with a single, fixed percentage fringe benefit tax calculation. Using the statutory formula method, an employee's fringe benefit tax liability is calculated using a sliding scale of cost per kilometre, with the cost declining as the number of kilometres travelled increases. The original rationale for this approach was based on the assumption that personal usage would remain static and that any additional travel would be work related. That assumption, however, no longer reflects the current state of vehicle usage data, which in fact indicate that the FBT calculation is having the general effect of increasing vehicle use irrespective of work related transport needs. According to Australia's future tax system, commissioned by this government, the incentive in the current FBT arrangements for employees to use their vehicles more regularly in order to reduce their tax liability, is in turn leading to more road congestion and higher pollution, which of course increase carbon emissions and undermine the effort to address the causes of dangerous climate change. As I understand it, something like 80 per cent of all transport relies on petroleum based fuel. In making the transition to a more sustainable energy future, we must keep in mind that the range of renewable energy resources, while good for producing low or zero emission electricity, are generally not an appropriate replacement transport fuel. That is why we need to keep our focus on the energy demand side of the equation when it comes to transport and on the pursuit of energy efficiency in personal, business and particularly freight transport. This bill helps to move Australia towards a more transport energy efficient future by removing a tax assessment calculation that has had the effect of encouraging people to use company supplied vehicles more than they otherwise would and for no additional social or economic purpose. Not only has it had the effect of rewarding what in many cases was unnecessary car use; in so doing, it has also inevitably dissuaded people from choosing to car-pool or to use more sustainable modes of transport such as trains, buses and bicycles. The changes that this bill represents are eminently sensible. The bill reforms the FBT calculations as they apply to work vehicle use so that there is no unnecessary incentive in our tax system for excessive work vehicle use. It will also no doubt mean a reduction in single work vehicle use and a rise in the use of shared travel and public transport and, finally, it represents an important cost saving to government. Other important measures in this bill include the tax law amendments to the National Rental Affordability Scheme. These amendments are designed to simplify the scheme and make it less restrictive, which will result in an increase in affordable rental housing available to Australian families. This change has even more significance at a time when families are struggling with record high rental rates, especially in Western Australia. For all these reasons, I support the bill and I commend the minister for his work in continuing the difficult but critical task of tax reform.",54
53,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," The great achievement of the Labor government has been a serious ongoing commitment to tax reform. It is with taxes that we build society and a hallmark of this Labor government has been focused and consistent attention on tax reform. We, of course, commissioned the Henry review, a root and branch tax review, which has for the first time in a generation looked across the tax system at how to make it work more effectively. As the Henry review in its opening noted: A 21st century tax and transfer system should meet its purposes efficiently, equitably, transparently and effectively. Critically, it support per capita income growth rates at the upper end of developed country experience by encouraging high workforce participation, a more efficient pattern of saving, and stronger investment in education and physical capital. The Henry review noted that revenue raising should be concentrated on four robust and efficient tax bases: personal income; business income; private consumption through broad, simple taxes; and economic rents from natural resources and land. The Henry review has underpinned much of what the government has done on tax reform. Commentators, I think, have missed one of the big stories about the recent budget, which is that it contains substantial tax reform, not the sort of tax measures that we saw all too frequently during mining boom mark-1-recycling revenue into badly targeted measures-but measures that focus on how to make our system more efficient and more equitable, and operate on a simpler basis. It is for that reason that this government is going about putting in place a minerals resource rent tax, a tax that will ensure that Australia's big mining companies at last pay their fair share, a tax that sits very much in the tradition of the progressive side of politics of ensuring that taxes are paid by those who can best afford them and that taxes impose a minimum deadweight cost on the economy. Growth is a Labor value. Increasing the size of the Australian economy is absolutely critical and the minerals resource rent tax will see us do that. Another substantial tax reform is carbon pricing. We are recognising, through a fixed carbon price and then an emissions trading scheme, that the best way of dealing with dangerous climate change is to go to the heart of the problem, which is dangerous carbon pollution. At the moment, polluters can put as much carbon pollution into the atmosphere as they like. They do not pay for would carbon pollution. Carbon pricing has been presented as an environmental reform but it is of course also an economic reform. The most effective way of getting carbon abatement in the Australian economy is to put a price on carbon, not through the coalition's grab bag of subsidies for polluters but going straight to the issue, putting a price on pollution and bringing about a smooth transition to a cleaner, greener economy, taking Australia from its current position as the most carbon intensive country in the developed world to a position where we are able to compete effectively for the green jobs of the future. The Gillard government is also putting in place substantial reform on fossil fuels through legislation which is finally enacting reforms originally foreshadowed by then Treasurer Peter Costello in the 2003 budget. What is tragic about these fuel reforms is that the coalition, at the last moment, have walked away. For the best part of the last eight years they have been in the cart on this fundamental economic reform but at the last moment saw a populist slogan and leapt out of the cart. I am pleased to see the Assistant Treasurer here in the chamber. I am sure he would be as pleased as I am at the passage of those reforms through this House in the most recent session. When crisis has hit, Labor has also used taxation reform exactly as economists would have us do. We put in place a modest flood levy to deal with the rebuilding cost required from the natural disasters of the most recent summer. Looking back further to the economic downturn, we used a fiscal stimulus that was timely, targeted and temporary, recognising that household payments and infrastructure investments were the most efficient way of getting the economy going again. On each of the tax reforms I have listed, Labor listened to the economic mainstream. While the coalition were listening to who knows what zealots, we were there focused on the economic mainstream and on delivering real reforms. And it is those real reforms that lie at the heart of Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 5) Bill-reforms recognising the importance of phasing out outdated payments. One of the key reforms in this legislation is removal of the dependent spouse tax offset. The dependent spouse tax offset existed at a state level prior to the 1930s but was first introduced at a federal level in 1936. During the second reading debate, one member justified the measure saying he felt it was the duty of a husband to maintain his wife and therefore it was right and proper that a husband would receive a deduction for it. I do not think that such a sentiment would be shared by most 30somethings in the labour force today. Most families without children would not think feel it is the duty of a husband to maintain his wife and in an era in which we are trying to boost labour force participation, in which we hear much talk of skills shortages, it is important that we remove disincentives to work. As the dependent spouse tax offset phases out, it imposes an effective tax rate in the phase-out range. If a dependent spouse earns more than $282, under the current program the entitlement reduces by $1 for every $4 the dependent spouse's income is above the threshold. The effect of this is to put another 25 per cent tax rate in addition to the current marginal tax rates for the first $10,000 earned by a so-called dependent spouse. We are steadily phasing out this measure. It will be phased out for taxpayers born after 1971, recognising that some of those who have been recipients of this payment may now be in a position where it is not straightforward for them to enter the workforce. Taxpayers who are invalids, permanently unable to work or are carers will not lose this benefit. The phase-out is applying to able-bodied taxpayers, those aged under 40 and those who-certainly from the discussions I have had with my electors-would not have the social norms that were expressed in this place when the dependent spouse tax offset was put in place. This measure modernises the Australian tax system. It brings the Australian tax system up to speed with contemporary values and it boosts labour force participation-an absolutely critical measure. We are also making the Australian tax system simpler and fairer for business and the community. It has long been recognised that the entrepreneurs tax offset is poorly targeted for small businesses. There is little evidence it has acted to encourage the establishment of small businesses. More than 80 per cent of small businesses were eligible for the offset. Rather than allowing a small business to grow, the entrepreneurs tax offset encourages businesses to structure affairs in a particular way, despite the market opportunities that might be present. The assistance is provided at a fairly low level to very small businesses. The maximum claim is $2,500, but the average entrepreneurs tax offset claim was less than $500, with 70 per cent of claims being below in place $600-a fair bit of paper work for a relatively small sum of money. The entrepreneurs tax offset is difficult to administer and adds to the complexity of our current tax system. There are better ways and more effective ways to help small businesses. The $5,000 immediate deduction, which will come into place from 2012-13, is a far more efficient and effective way of helping our small businesses grow and so boosting employment in this critical sector. The budget also puts in place important reforms to fix the current system of fringe benefits taxation for cars. This is a system which is both inequitable and inefficient. The existing statutory formula method for determining the taxable value of car fringe benefits delivers a greater tax concession the further the car is driven. Car fringe benefits arise when an employee uses salary sacrifice for an employer provided car for private use. Under the statutory formula method, the person's car fringe benefits are determined by multiplying the relevant statutory rate by the cost of the car. The current statutory rates are designed so that a person's car fringe benefit decreases as the distance travelled by their vehicle increases. People can therefore increase their tax concession by driving their vehicle further. The Henry tax review reported evidence showing that this is exactly what people do. Anecdotally, in my electorate one hears stories that, as the end of the tax year approaches and as a taxpayer feels that they are not necessarily going to be in the most favourable mileage bracket, they will lend the keys of their car to a teenage son to drive to the coast for the weekend. Their child might otherwise have caught a bus to the coast. These sorts of environmentally unsound practices are effectively encouraged by a poorly structured tax concession. So we are reforming the statutory formula method, replacing the current statutory tax rates with a single rate of 20 per cent that applies regardless of the distance travelled. The reform will only apply to new vehicle contracts entered into after announcement on budget night so, of course, it will not affect people who have already entered into contracts. That shift to the single standard 20 per cent rate will be phased in over four years. Naturally, people who still use their vehicle for a significant amount of work related travel will be able to use the operating cost or log book method to ensure that their car fringe benefit excludes any business use of their vehicle. Over the forward estimates this measure will result in an increase in revenue of nearly a billion dollars, and this is additional revenue which is then available for more efficient and more equitable tax reforms. I am very proud to be part of a Labor government which is committed to good economic management and important tax reforms, tax reforms that I hope will outlive many of us in this place, tax reforms that reflect the understanding of those of us on this side of the House that it is important to draw on the best evidence available and tax reforms that recognise that the Henry review has laid down much that we can draw on in the future. I commend the bill to the House.",55
54,Ms ROWLAND,BILLS," I am very pleased to rise in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 5) Bill 2011, which affirms this government's ongoing delivery of improvements to Australia's taxation regime. These are reforms which have been welcomed across the financial services sector, and a diverse range of interests across our economy stand to benefit from the passage of this bill. I would like to turn to the key elements of the bill, which comprises five schedules that respectively address the ability for trust beneficiaries to continue using primary production averaging and farm management deposits in a loss year from the 2010-11 income year; provisions which permit capital gains and franked distributions of trusts to be the streamed to beneficiaries for tax purposes; technical amendments to the National Rental Affordability Scheme which will provide certainty about the entitlements of parties participating in the scheme; the phasing out of the dependent spouse tax offset; and reform of the statutory formula for determining the taxable value of car fringe benefits and replacing it with a simplified, single rate of 20 per cent, irrespective of the number of kilometres travelled. Schedules 1 and 2 of the bill in particular deal with the outcomes that ensued as a result of the 2010 decision of the High Court in Bamford v Commissioner of Taxation. And it is these provisions which I will primarily address this evening. I turn first to the nature of trusts themselves. In understanding the relevance of these proposed amendments, it is instructive to firstly consider the nature of trusts and their prevalence in the financial arrangements of many small businesses today, particularly rural interests. It was with much pleasure that, in preparing these comments, I harked back to my well-worn edition of Jacobs' Law of Trusts and refreshed myself on the four essential elements of a trust; namely, the trustee, the trust property, the beneficiary and a personal obligation attached to the property. As highlighted by Meagher and Gummow from the outset, a trust can be described as 'an institution developed by equity with its own peculiar characteristics'. However, to define the juristic nature of a trust is more complex, and it is often easier to criticise attempts at such a definition and define what it is not rather than what it is. Nevertheless, today trusts are used in many contexts in the Australian landscape. Indeed, superannuation system is characterised by funds which are structured as trusts and, according to recent APRA statistics, these trusts are responsible for close to $1.4 trillion of money under management. Trusts are also a common vehicle for small to medium business enterprises. Many family trusts, by definition, rely on trust structures. Family trusts are an example of a discretionary trust. This where the distribution of the trust property is subject to the discretion of the trustee. When one considers that there are in fact hundreds of thousands of trusts in operation in Australia in some form, the magnitude of the implications of the provisions of this bill become clear. As the Australian Taxation Office itself has noted: Traditionally, the use of trust arrangements was seen as a vehicle largely used by wealthy families and businesses for asset protection purposes and legitimate tax minimisation. In recent times, the use of trusts has become more widespread. I would like to turn to the implications of the decision in the High Court case of Bamford v Commissioner of Taxation. The response of the Australian Taxation Office is significant and affects every trust in Australia. In essence, it affects how the distribution provisions of those trust deeds need to be drafted to obtain the optimal tax outcomes-subject of course to the antiavoidance rules in the tax legislation. Prior to the decision in Bamford v Commissioner of Taxation, the Australian Taxation Office applied Taxation Ruling TR 95/29, which dealt with the applicability of averaging provisions to beneficiaries of trust estates carrying on a business of primary production. The effect was that the ATO regarded a beneficiary as presently entitled to a share of the trust income provided there our was some gross trust income and the trustee exercised their discretion in favour of the beneficiary. In cases where there was no gross trust income, the ATO regarded a beneficiary as presently entitled to a share of trust income where they had a vested and indefeasible interest in trust income, and were therefore deemed to be presently entitled to trust income. The practical effect of these provisions meant that a beneficiary could be taken to carry on a primary production business that was actually carried on by the trustee in a year where the trust had a loss for trust law purposes. Thus, such a beneficiary continued to be eligible for income averaging and was not required to have their farm management deposits repaid to them and included in their assessable income. However, the High Court in Bamford held that a beneficiary cannot be presently entitled to a share of income of a trust if there is no income legally available for distribution. As a consequence, the ATO ruling was incorrect at law and withdrawn. In its decision impact statement on the High Court's ruling, the ATO made several observations including: a number of issues concerning division 6 of the Income Tax Assessment Act remained unresolved; there remained at issue the effect for taxation purposes of a re-characterisation clause that requires or permits the trustee to treat that is otherwise received as income-the ATO noted that these were not facts before the court in Bamford; and the income of a trust estate for trust law purposes and its income for tax purposes are two different subject matters which do not necessarily correspond. I would like to turn to the process of reform, which has led to this bill before the House today. Clearly, these developments have necessitated legislative action on trust tax law-an issue which the Assistant Treasurer rightly identified as an ongoing area of concern, where reform is necessary to simplify the system, rewrite some rules and provide more certainty to the tens of thousands of small businesses and farmers who utilise trusts. With this in mind the Assistant Treasurer announced in December last year a public consultation process with a view to seeking input from industry, individuals and peak organisations and to updating the trust income tax provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It is a reflection of this government's consultative approach that the Assistant Treasurer's announcement emphasised the role of private sector expertise in the development of its consultation paper. As the Assistant Treasurer further noted: Any options will seek to ensure that net taxable income of a trust is assessed primarily to beneficiaries. Trustees will continue to be assessed only to the extent that amounts of net taxable income are not otherwise assessable to beneficiaries. The options will not include the taxation of trusts as companies, which would be a major departure from the current law. In March this year the Assistant Treasurer released the discussion paper, 'Improving the taxation of trust income', and in his speech to the national convention of the Taxation Institute of Australia he announced the adoption of two recommendations to clarify capital the tax law for over 600,000 trusts in Australia. The two key recommendations from the Board of Taxation addressing those key areas of uncertainty for trusts were the better alignment of the concept of 'income of the trust estate' with 'net income of the trust estate'. This is indeed an area of challenge, which was noted in the consultation process, and the concerns in this area were taken on board in the legislative drafting process and the enabling of the streaming of capital gains and franked distributions. Again, the rationale for the implementation of the Board of Taxation recommendations was to enable the large number of businesses and individuals using trusts to continue to do so with confidence and greater certainty. The consultation process received thoughtful input from a range of reputable industry and interest groups including the Financial Services Council and the Law Council of Australia. In April a further public consultation process was announced for the exposure draft legislation to give effect to these important reforms. As can be clearly seen the process undertaken to arrive at this point has been thorough, transparent and based on invaluable industry and private sector knowledge. Importantly, the amendments contained in schedule 1 of the bill were rightly described by the Assistant Treasurer as very welcome news for approximately 23,000 Australian farmers with trusts, with these amendments introduced to the House before 30 June as promised, so that beneficiaries can continue to use the primary production averaging and farm management deposit provisions in a loss year. I will conclude with some comments on the dependent spouse tax offset in schedule 4 of the bill, which amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to implement the budget measure of phasing out the dependent spouse tax offset. This reform will mean that, from 1 July, taxpayers with a dependent spouse born on or after 1 July 1971-a great year may I say-will no longer be eligible for the dependent spouse tax offset. This means the DSTO will be gradually phased out as the population ages. It is important to understand the nature of the dependent spouse tax offset. This government is focused on removing disincentives for people to remain out of the workforce, including younger dependent spouses without children. It is quite obvious that the dependent spouse tax offset is an outdated measure that reflects old-fashioned gender roles. In fact, it has been around since the inception of the Income Tax Assessment Act in 1936. As well as modernising our tax and transfer system, schedule 4 of the bill reflects this government's focus on encouraging workplace participation-something we all know we urgently needed in our skills-short economy. On this point the bill recognises the unique circumstances that do affect some people in our community who would otherwise be caught by this change. Consequently, Australian taxpayers where the dependent spouse is a carer, who is an invalid or permanently unable to work, and taxpayers eligible for such measures as the overseas civilian tax offsets will not be affected by this change. In addition families with a dependent spouse and young children are not affected by this measure because they would receive family tax benefit part B and would be ineligible in any event to receive the dependent spouse tax offset. This reform recognises that a bigger workforce is vital for the strength of our economy and the living standards of our community. I commend the bill to the House.",58
55,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"Maribyrnong-Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (19:27): I thank those members who have contributed to this debate. In particular I acknowledge the contribution of the member for Greenway, who has been influential in a lot of the thinking on these matters. I also acknowledge the work of the opposition, who would appear on this matter to be constructively working with the government and I will refer a little bit more to this in some of the schedules. Schedule 1 allows trust beneficiaries to continue to use primary production averaging and farm management deposit provisions in a year where the trust has a loss for trust law purposes. The Gillard government has broadly restored in this bill the position that existed before the High Court decision in Commissioner of Taxation and Bamford. That decision necessitated the Commissioner withdrawing a public ruling that in certain circumstances a beneficiary could be eligible for the primary production averaging and farm management deposit rules in a trust loss year. This schedule secures continuity for taxpayers because the amendments apply from the 2010-11 income year and the Commissioner's ruling applies up to and including the 2009-10 income year. As I said earlier, I acknowledge that there have been productive discussions with the opposition about identifying an agreed further reform to this area, and I concur with the remarks of the member for Casey on this matter. The amendments in schedule 2 ensure that where permitted by the trustee the capital gains and franked distributions, including any attached franking credits of a trust, can be effectively streamed to the beneficiaries for tax purposes by making them specifically entitled to those amounts. The amendments also introduce specific antiavoidance rules to address the potential opportunities for tax manipulation that can result from the inappropriate use of exempt entities as beneficiaries. These amendments will provide more certainty for the trustees and beneficiaries of trusts that stream capital gains and franked distributions, including any attached franking credits, while the government continues to progress its broader review of the taxation of trust income. Schedule 3 amends the provisions in the taxation law related to the National Rental Affordability Scheme tax offset provisions. The amendments simplify the operations of the NRAS-the National Affordability Scheme-for participants by introducing the concept of an NRAS consortium, which allows a broader range of arrangements to participate in the NRAS. The amendments provide some additional flexibility to the NRAS participants and how the incentive is shared between members of the NRAS consortium. These amendments do this by establishing an election to allow approved participants to relinquish their entitlement to an NRAS tax offset in favour of other members of the NRAS consortium. These amendments also address some minor technical issues that have arisen from the interaction of the tax law and the National Rental Affordability Scheme Act 2008. They also ensure that certain payments provided under the NRAS indirectly, such as through an NRAS consortium, are treated as nonassessable, non-exempt income. Schedule 4 implements the government's budget measure to phase out the dependent spouse tax offset for dependent spouses currently aged less than 40 or, in other words, people who were born from July 1971 onwards. The dependent spouse tax offset originates in the initial Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and it needs to be reformed to allow for Australia's modern and growing economy. This reform is an important measure to help encourage more Australians into paid employment by removing the disincentive for younger dependent spouses without children to remain out of the workforce. Dependent spouses aged 40 or over will not be affected by this measure, nor will dependent spouses with children or taxpayers whose dependent spouse is a carer, an invalid or permanently unable to work. Taxpayers eligible for the zone, overseas force or overseas civilian tax offsets are also not affected by this measure. Schedule 5 amends the tax laws to reform the current statutory formula method for Rental determining the taxable value of car fringe benefits. The changes will replace the current statutory rates with a single statutory rate of 20 per cent, regardless of kilometres travelled. Under the current statutory formula method, the calculated fringe benefit from a salary-sacrificed car decreases as the distance travelled by the vehicle increases. People can therefore increase their tax concession by driving their vehicle further. This schedule removes the current incentive for people to drive salary sacrificed and employer provided vehicles further to increase their tax concession and, in the process, burn more fuel. The reform implements yet again another recommendation of Australia's Future Tax System Review, also known as the Henry review, and will apply the commitments made after the budget announcement of 10 May 2011. It will be phased in over four years. This bill deserves the support of the parliament. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Administrator recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",61
56,Mr SHORTEN,BILLS,"by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (19:34): I rise to speak on the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011 and, in doing so, speak on behalf of the shadow Treasurer, who was listed to speak in this debate but is at this very time giving another speech at another place-not in the Senate-which is the keynote address to CEDA that was scheduled some time ago for this time of the evening. The bill before the House this evening outlines changes to the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 and introduces a requirement for lenders to provide a key fact sheet for standard home loans. It also introduces a number of reforms to lending terms for credit cards by, firstly, prescribing rules for approval for the use of credit cards above the credit limit; secondly, specifying an allocation hierarchy for payments made under credit card contracts; thirdly, restricting credit card providers from making unsolicited invitations to borrowers to increase the credit limit of their credit cards; and, fourthly, introducing a requirement for lenders to provide a key fact sheet for credit card contracts. On behalf of the shadow Treasurer, I say at the outset that the coalition will not be opposing this bill. However, that does not mean we believe it is good legislation or that it is the best way to advance the interests of consumers of financial services. The way this legislation has been handled is typical of the government's hasty and poorly thought through approach and their approach to policy generally. Consultation with industry has been poor, to the point where extensive last-minute amendments have been made to address industry concerns. Also, much of the detail of the bill has been left to regulations, which are due to be announced, we are told, by the end of June-although there can be no certainty even on this point, today being 20 June. The parliament is being asked to vote on an important piece of legislation, again without knowing all of the details. More generally, this bill continues the government's intrusion into the commercial processes of business. Rather than try to improve the workings of the market for financial services, the government has chosen to interfere in business decisions through further regulation. As I said at the outset, the first element within the bill introduces a mandatory key facts sheet for standard home loans. It is important to understand the history leading up to this change. The key facts sheet was one of the elements of the Treasurer's Competitive and Sustainable Banking package that was rushed out towards the end of last year, a few months after the shadow Treasurer announced his nine-point banking plan to achieve a better deal for consumers of financial services. The Treasurer has not been leading from the front on banking reform; rather he has been struggling along in the coalition's wake. The coalition's banking plan received wide support within the business community, as well as support from Independents and crossbenchers. The Treasurer's package adopted some key features of the coalition's nine-point plan, such as legislation on price signalling introduction of covered bonds. However, in many other respects it was a piecemeal approach addressing concerns issue by issue rather than taking an overall industry-wide approach to improve the workings of the market by increasing competition. Indeed, some of the changes appear counterproductive to the stated aims. A case in point is the banning of exit fees on new floating-rate mortgages, which was introduced through regulation rather than legislation. The coalition has consistently argued that the banning of mortgage exit fees will materially weaken the competitive position of the smaller lenders by preventing them from offering packages which give borrowers lower interest rates in return for a loyalty commitment for a number of years. This lessens competition in the provision of financial services. Crucially, not arguing that lenders should have to have exit fees-indeed, many lenders are now offering products with no exit fees, and the coalition welcomes this. Consumers can choose from that mix of features that best suits their circumstances from the enhanced range of products now available. It may be they prefer a lower interest rate with an exit fee. The point is that restricting competition and choice is against the broader interests of consumers more generally. We also need to ask ourselves why it took the government so long to respond. The problems associated with a lessening of competition in the banking system have been apparent for some time. Now we are in this House in June 2011, at least a couple of years after those problems became apparent and six months after the Treasurer released his plan at the end of last year, to debate one of the aspects of the government's plan: the key facts sheet for standard home loans. The facts sheet is intended to make it easier for consumers to readily compare different home and the loans by requiring lenders to provide standardised loan information such as pricing and other details about the product. The Treasurer, Mr Swan, has claimed that this change, along with the other measures which were included in his banking package, will ensure that interest rates are lower over time. In fact, the Australian ran this headline the day after the Treasurer's announcement: 'Swan pledges to bring down rates with reforms'. That was on 13 December 2010. Of course, this heroic claim will soon be put to the test. The Reserve Bank has repeatedly warned over the past few months that interest rates will soon need to rise. Some commentators believe an August rise is likely, following the release of the next consumer price index figures. If this does in fact occur, it will be instructive to see how the Treasurer explains it in the context of his the coalition is banking package. The coalition has some criticisms in relation to the consultation process for this bill. It has been clear from the coalition's own consultations that many industry groups have been asking for more time to prepare their businesses to cope with these new changes. The key facts sheet for standard home loans was originally set to apply from 1 September this year. Much of the detail required in the facts sheet was to be prescribed by regulations, which are yet to be released by the minister-and, as I said earlier, are expected to be announced sometime in the days left in this month. This would have left institutions with a very small window of time to prepare-less than three months. The government were going to give institutions less than three months to change and update their information systems, to establish new documentation processes and to train their staff in order to comply with this legislation. The point is particularly important as the bill, prior to the government's amendments, provided for serious civil and criminal penalties as well as strict liability if the requirements for the provision of the key facts sheet were breached. At the eleventh hour the government have decided to repeal the strict liability, a sign that they have listened at the last minute to the concerns of industry and institutions. And the government have delayed the commencement date by four months, until 1 January 2012. We are glad the government have chosen to acknowledge their short-sightedness through moving amendments to address these problems; however, this problem would not have occurred in the first place had the government not had a tin ear when it came to consultation with industry and affected parties. The second aspect of this bill relates to reforms to lending terms and conditions for credit cards. The first of the reforms relates to the rules for the use of credit cards above the credit limit. This is another area where the original form of the bill was inadequate and where substantial changes have been required. The original bill sought to set a mandatory default limit above which credit cards could be overdrawn, with an additional discretionary supplementary buffer on top of that. Industry bodies and institutions expressed concern that the bill would send a message to consumers that they may, in effect, have a 10 per cent higher credit limit available. This could act to worsen credit card debt problems for some consumers. This was just one of a number of potential unintended consequences for consumers looking to take out credit cards in the future. The government has now removed this section through its minute-to-midnight amendments. It has replaced it with a requirement for consumers to be notified if a credit card is used in excess of its credit card limit. This has been accompanied by an express requirement that no fees are to be imposed and no higher rate of interest to be charged if a customer exceeds their credit limit, unless they have provided explicit consent for a fee to be charged. The second change relating to credit cards contained within the bill is that which now specifies an allocation hierarchy for payments made under credit card contracts. Payments will be allocated first to those components bearing the highest interest charge. This measure addresses existing practices where some credit providers allocate payments in a way that can maximise the amount and time required for the consumer to repay their credit. The coalition views this as a reasonable reform and supports this measure, as it will greatly assist consumers in trying to pay down their credit card debt. The third reform contained within the second section of the bill relates to restricting credit providers from making unsolicited invitations to borrowers to increase the credit limit of their credit card. At first glance this seems reasonable. Borrowers would have the limit they initially agreed. They would have the option of applying for a higher limit, they would not be induced into a higher limit than they really wanted or required. Some institutions, however, have expressed concerns that the wording could be subject to wider interpretation to cover all customer communications in relation to the provision of credit. Also, it could have the unintended consequence of forcing credit providers to push borrowers towards higher initial credit limits than they otherwise would have been offered. The fourth and final change contained within this section of the bill implements a requirement for lenders to provide a key facts sheet for credit card contracts. The coalition had reservations over the key facts sheet for credit cards as we did for standard home loans. Those concerns related to the limited amount of time the government was going to give industry to comply with the changes, which would have been, as I said earlier, less than three months. And, again, the detail of the content of the facts sheet would have been left to government regulations which, as I have said, are yet to be released. This would have further shortened the time frame for institutions to comply. These concerns were echoed by industry bodies and institutions. The coalition is glad that the government has chosen to acknowledge its short-sightedness by moving amendments to address these problems by extending the compliance time out until January 2012-although, again, this problem would never have occurred had the government consulted effectively in the first place. In conclusion, as noted at the outset on behalf of the shadow Treasurer, the coalition will not be opposing this bill. It needs to repeated that this has not been the government's finest hour in drafting legislation. There were many aspects of the original legislation which, by virtue of the but government's minute-to-midnight amendments, were poorly thought through and where consultation with industry was inadequate. The coalition also views this bill as a whole as an unsatisfactory response to the perceived issues within the banking industry. As I indicated earlier, we have expressed some support for one of the measures in particular, but we stand by our view that consumer interests could best be met by measures which encourage competition within the banking sector, as opposed to this prescriptive, ad hoc regulatory approach. The experience with the Treasurer's approach to this bill, from the time of his announcement prior to Christmas, again highlights and demonstrates that it is time for a full root-and-branch review of Australia's financial system, as outlined in the coalition's nine-point plan on banking, released in October last year.",63
57,Ms SMYTH,BILLS," I am pleased to be able to lend my voice to this debate on the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011 this evening. It is just another example of this government tackling those issues which particularly weigh on ordinary Australians-Australians such as those who are represented very much in the growth corridor in my electorate in south-eastern Melbourne. I certainly know that for many people in my electorate personal debt and particularly having a feeling of losing control of that personal debt not only have an impact on their personal finances and those of their families but also have a very significant impact on relationships and on stress within families and real consequences for the health, and be particularly mental health, of those people who are concerned with their own personal debt. So it is particularly important that the government act in relation to issues of credit to support the needs of consumers, and I am very pleased to be able to say that this government has done so. It continues the trend that this government has set in endeavouring to create a fairer and simpler banking policy that will help Australians to get a better deal when it comes to credit cards and home loans. I am very pleased that this bill gives effect to that commitment, which we made towards the end of last year. The government's overall aim is of course to create a much more competitive and sustainable banking system. We are doing this through a variety of means. We are banning exit fees outright on new home loans from 1 July 2011, something that the opposition has had a somewhat contrary position on. We are enabling the ACCC to more readily prosecute anticompetitive price signalling. We are introducing a mandatory key facts sheet through this legislation for new home loan customers to make it very much easier for them to compare mortgage products effectively. And we are putting forward this bill to get a better deal for Australians with credit cards. In addition to that, we are launching a national community awareness program which will give consumers much more control in their banking. These are some of the very practical ways that the government has embarked upon to ensure that consumers have ready access to information which allows them to better compare those products which they are about to enter into. We have heard from the opposition this evening, as we have heard in many debates before, that the government is seemingly embarking upon a process of unnecessary regulation and unnecessary intrusion into industry. Indeed, the last time that I heard this debate ensue from the opposition was during the course of discussion about the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011, where they said that they were very worried about shareholders, they made all the right noises and there were many speakers from the opposition ranks who spoke on the bill. Then at the very end of the debate the opposition, having said that we were as a government seeking to intervene unnecessarily in the operation of companies and were seeking to overregulate matters relating to executives, ultimately went and voted on behalf of the executives. It pleases me to be able to say that this afternoon the Senate passed the executive remuneration bill. So, despite the opposition's bleating very loudly to the effect that the government was overregulating companies in relation to the remuneration of executives, we see once again this government standing up for the little person, for shareholders and employees and consumers and all those people who put their money into shares in our companies. The government is standing up for those people at a time when all the opposition could put forward was a claim that this government was seemingly overregulating, as though those people on the opposition benches are somehow free marketeers. It would be good if they in fact believed in a market and demonstrated that in any debate in this place. We have also seen the extraordinary position in recent weeks of the shadow Treasurer boasting about his plan to put mortgage exit fees back in place. We have heard this regularly from the shadow Treasurer, who seems in fact to want to assist banks to stop customers from seeking out a better deal on their mortgages by keeping exit fees in place. The reforms that are being put forward in this bill, amongst other reforms that this government is embarking upon in order to enable better competition within the banking sector, have been supported by Choice. In relation to the question of mortgage exit fees, we have heard Matt Levey of Choice saying that business models based around trapping consumers in uncompetitive deals through complex and costly fees have no place in a reformed banking sector. He went on to say that removing exit fees will pressure lenders to compete on upfront price and customer service or else face the risk of customers moving their money to get a better deal. That sort of measure, together with the measures contemplated in this bill, is exactly what we are about-ensuring that there is appropriate competition within the banking sector, ensuring that there is appropriate competition to support the very many people within this country who rely on credit cards and who enter into home loans without appropriate information. We should reflect upon the circumstances of many Australians such as those in my electorate who very much rely on credit cards. In considering this bill, I reflected the RBA statistics from February this year which reveal that there was some $49.3 billion in credit and charge card debt outstanding, of which around $36 billion was accruing interest. We know that at that time the interest rate on credit cards was 19.7 per cent on a standard card and interest on lowrate cards was around 13.5 per cent. These are staggering figures and I am particularly concerned about these figures from the point of view in particular of young people getting into debt. I am also concerned about the circumstances of families, and in particular single-parent families, getting into debt. So any measures such as the measures included in this bill which go towards assisting those people make their mind up consciously in advance of entering into those levels of debt are very important. I should say that my own electorate takes in the areas of Casey and Cardinia within the south-eastern growth corridor of Melbourne and I am troubled by the increase in consumer debt in that growth corridor. A submission from the Financial and Consumer Rights Council to the inquiry into home lending practices and processes identified a 35 per cent increase in bankruptcies in Victoria overall during the last two years. It also noted that in high-growth areas such as the south-east corridor in Melbourne there has been a 70.8 per cent increase in bankruptcies over the past six years. I am also very much aware of anecdotal evidence which has been provided to me through discussions with the Casey North Information and Support Service, which offers support to many in the southern end of my electorate and throughout the region who are facing financial difficulties. I know that they have received the assistance of the federal government through emergency relief funding to the service and also have received funding for a financial counsellor for the on service, but I am certainly aware that they face ongoing pressure through the need for financial counselling in areas such as Berwick, where we have new families moving into the region, areas where families have struggled with debt for some time or who have taken out debt to meet household costs. As I said before, those problems very obviously create serious financial impacts for individuals and families but they also have very immediate social impacts, putting pressure on relationships and having health and mental health consequences which are of particular concern. In response to all of those things which are happening in my electorate, as I am sure they are happening in many other electorates around the country, this bill is one of the things that the federal government is doing to ensure that credit card providers will be limited in their capacity to entice customers into increasing their limit well above what they are able to pay. There are a range of other things that we know the federal government is doing to relieve financial pressure on families and those who are less well-off in our community, things like providing more financial support for families with teenagers who stay at school longer, providing income tax cuts over several years within our term of office, providing a more flexible childcare rebate, providing a Paid Parental Leave scheme-all of these things together go towards alleviating some of the pressure on families dealing with cost of living. And our credit card and home loan reforms are geared towards the same concerns, ensuring that there are practical measures in place for people such as those I represent to ensure that they are able to respond to personal debt and that they are able to meet their cost of living. The bill before us introduces quite major changes to the relationship between credit providers and consumers in respect of credit cards and home loans. In the debate this evening we have heard already about some of the things that the legislation will do, to recap: the bill will make it mandatory for credit providers to include key information in credit card application forms about the annual percentage rate; it will prohibit credit providers from making unsolicited invitations to consumers to increase their credit limits, except where there is consumer consent to it; it requires home lenders to display on their website and make available on request a key facts sheet about the products they offer. Each of these things in turn",66
58,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Order! The debate is interrupted, in accordance with standing order 34. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Intelligence and Security Committee Report",69
59,Mr BYRNE,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security I have pleasure in presenting the committee's report entitled Annual report of committee activities 200910.The tabling of this report has been delayed because of the federal election. It is a report of the activities of the committee of the 42nd Parliament. The activities dealt with in the report were carried out under the previous chair and member for Brisbane, the Hon. Arch Bevis. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Bevis for his work on the committee. His contributions to this important area of national security will be missed. Reviewing administration and expenditure on an annual basis is one of the primary functions of the committee. Section 29 of the Intelligence Services Act stipulates that the committee has an obligation to review the but administration and expenditure, including the annual financial statements of the Australian intelligence community. During this period the committee tabled their reviews of administration and expenditure Nos 6, 7 and 8 for the financial years 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09. These reports were tabled in September 2009, May 2010 and June 2010 respectively. The Review of Administration and Expenditure No. 8 (2008 - 2009) - Australian Intelligence Agencies made recommendations relating to the efficiency dividend and the funding of the Office of the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security, OIGIS, in particular. ONA's submission stated that, as a result of the efficiency dividend, there would be 'some modest reduction in ONA's analytical capacity'. Another agency stated that any additional reduction in their budget would significantly impact their operational activities. The committee was concerned about the impact of the efficiency dividend on the smaller agencies of the Australian intelligence community and therefore recommended that the Australian government review the potential adverse effects of the efficiency dividend on the AIC. The committee also took the opportunity afforded by this review to look at the budget of the Office of the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security, OIGIS. The OIGIS's budget has not grown in line with ASIO's budget growth. In light of the increases in the number of personnel and activities of the Australian intelligence community as well as an expansion in the IGIS's role, the committee recommended that the budget of the Office of the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security be increased. The Review of Administration and Expenditure No. 7 - Australian Intelligence Agencies noted the difficulties that some agencies have experienced in relation to staff recruitment. The competitive job market, growth within agencies and the desire to ensure staff are of an appropriate calibre has raised some challenges in this area. In response, agencies have sought to invest in reviewing and better developing their recruitment strategies. Two reports on the listing of organisations as terrorist organisations were tabled in the period under review. The two reports dealt with five organisations comprising four relistings and one initial listing. The reports were: the Review of the re-listing of Hamas' Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades (the Brigades), the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code Act 1995; and, the Review of the listing of AlShabaab as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code Act 1995. Seven public submissions were received in relation to the re-listing and the committee held a hearing on 22 October 2009. The committee did not recommend disallowance of any of the regulations in relation to the five organisations. Since 2002 the committee has sent representatives to the biennial conference of oversight agencies. In 2010, the conference was hosted by the PJCIS and the IGIS in Sydney between Sunday, 21 March 2010 and Wednesday, 24 March 2010 and members of the committee attended. Delegates from Belgium, Canada, New Zealand, Poland, South Africa, United Kingdom and the United States attended the 2010 conference in Sydney with a number giving presentations on their oversight structures. In conclusion, and on behalf of the committee, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the work of the committee during the past year, in particular Mr Robert Little, the inquiry secretary, and former committee secretary Dr Margot Kerley, who has recently retired. I commend the report to the House. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",69
60,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES," I take this opportunity to thank the chair for his remarks. I endorse his comments about the committee secretariat, particularly Mr Robert Little and our former secretary Dr Margot Kerley. Can I just observe that this report relates to activities under the chairmanship of our former colleague and member for Brisbane, Arch Bevis. I acknowledge the very considerable personal interest he took in these matters and the leadership he undertook in relation to the committee's activities. I commend the comments and observations made by the present chair. I will spend a moment or two focusing on a couple of issues that I think are particularly germane-and not necessarily those emphasised by my colleague. In relation to the Review of Administration and Expenditure No. 8 (2008 - 2009) - Australian Intelligence Agencies it was particularly interesting because the review is the first review of the administration and expenditure of six intelligence agencies which the committee was able to look at as part of the Australian intelligence community, as we understand it. During this review, the committee found that a significant inconsistency exists in relation to the way in which the oversight of the Australian intelligence community occurs. An agency whose role is in fact growing is now the subject of consideration by committees that have a different function and are not necessarily expert or do not necessarily have access to the broader information that might be relevant to examining an intelligence function. The committee noted in its report that it had previously had evidence from a number of agencies that noted the work of the Australian Federal Police that had been developing since the terrorist attacks in the United States and the terrorist attacks in The committee noted that the Australian Federal Police have increasingly been involved in counterterrorist activities and that sections have been created to address significant counterterrorism and national security functions. I mention this because the committee made a recommendation that the Intelligence Services Act should be amended to include the Australian Federal Police counterterrorism elements in the list of organisations that the committee reviews. The government has seen fit not to pick up that recommendation. I find that very disappointing. As I see it, there have already been substantial concerns about the work of intelligence agencies and the Australian Federal Police, which were not seen to be adequately integrated at earlier points in time. It warranted a review by Sir Laurence Street, initiated by the former Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police Mick Keelty, because it was seen to be a major full oversight. I am concerned that the government is perpetuating that in the way in which it has considered this role. I understand that it was because perhaps the AFP did not want to be reporting to two committees. I suggest, with respect, that that was a very poor argument given that it was left with a committee that has no broader experience in the review of the intelligence community as a whole. The other matter I want to draw attention to is the impact of efficiency dividends, which the committee noted in its earlier report for that same year. Most of the intelligence organisations are fairly small. The need for intelligence agencies has not in any way diminished. Their work is in fact growing, particularly in relation to counterespionage and the area of cyberterrorism. These are matters of public note, but in my judgment the impact of efficiency dividends is likely to diminish the Bali. ongoing effectiveness of the capacity of these organisations, which we have been trying to enhance. So I draw attention to our earlier comments on that matter in this report and encourage the government to be very focused on the need to ensure that the intelligence community is adequately resourced at a time when it is facing a growing challenge.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Committee",72
64,Mr NEUMANN,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I present the committee's report entitled Doing time - time for doing: Indigenous youth in the criminal justice system, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. The Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has completed its inquiry into the high levels of involvement of Indigenous juveniles and young adults in the criminal justice system. It is a national shame; it is a national tragedy. It has been 20 years since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody report, yet the incarceration rate of Indigenous Australians, including Indigenous youth, is now worse. The committee believes this is a shameful state of affairs and that, as the title of this report, Doing time – time for doing, suggests, it really is the time to act. Available statistics on Indigenous young people in contact with the criminal justice systems are alarming. Fifty-nine per cent of the total detention population is Indigenous. There are 28 times as many Indigenous juveniles as non-Indigenous juveniles in detention in Australia. The prisoner census data for 2000 to 2010 shows a 55 per cent increase in men in incarceration and a 47 per cent increase in women. Young Indigenous adults aged 17 to 24 are 15 times as likely as In young non-Indigenous adults to be imprisoned. The rates of imprisonment of Indigenous women in Australia is rising at an alarming rate. In 2006-07, Indigenous women were 35 times as likely to be hospitalised as a result of partner abuse. Between 2000 and 2009, there was a 66 per cent rise in imprisonment of Indigenous Australians. By the age of 25 years, 40 per cent of Indigenous men have been charged Report formally by the police with an offence. The committee was made aware of these worrying statistics throughout the inquiry and consulted with a wide range of stakeholders to investigate how the federal government could assist in reversing the overrepresentation of Indigenous people in the criminal justice systems around the country. The scope of the inquiry was vast given the complexities of the issues that contributed to the high levels of involvement by Indigenous youth in criminal justice systems. There were many roundtables and public hearings-18 public hearings across Australia, and we visited three detention centres. There were 110 submissions from a wide range of individuals and groups. One of the major criticisms was the need for better coordination of service delivery: silos, departments not talking to departments, organisations not communicating with each other and individuals not sharing relevant information. This is a comprehensive report, with 40 recommendations. These include two highlevel recommendations that seek to address the void in the COAG Closing the Gap strategy by recommending the setting of justice targets, including a national partnership agreement under the Safe Communities building block. Indigenous engagement in and delivery of local services are highlighted as the most effective ways of creating positive outcomes for Indigenous people. The main thrust of the report is that prevention and early intervention are of utmost importance. The committee makes recommendations about developing positive social norms, improving parenting skills, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, increasing engagement in education, initiatives to assist the transition into employment and increasing participation in sport and in cultural and recreational activities. The value of Indigenous mentors was also highlighted in relation to these matters. There are a number of recommendations to improve teacher education and police awareness of issues. Language barriers and hearing impairments were also highlighted. As the title of the report, Doing time, suggests, too many young Indigenous people are doing time in juvenile detention centres and prisons. It is now time for doing. It is time we were doing more to prevent this national tragedy, this national disgrace. The problems are complex and long standing. We must harness the knowledge and commitment of those working in the field to bring about real change and opportunity for the future of all Indigenous Australians. I want to close by thanking the previous chair of the committee, the Hon. Bob Debus MP, and his committee; also Anna Dacre, the secretary of the committee; Susan Cardell and Rebecca Gordon, the inquiry secretaries; and research officers John White, Ben Mudaliar and Natalya Wells. I want to thank all those involved in the committee. I want to thank the coalition for their bipartisan approach, particularly the member for Murray, and for their great cooperation, along with that of the Labor members of the committee. I commend the report to the parliament.",72
65,Dr STONE,COMMITTEES," I concur absolutely with the remarks of our very able chair in presenting this report Doing timetime for doing: Indigenous youth in the criminal justice system. It is, as our chair said, a very tragic situation in Australia. Far from us being able to present a trend showing there is less recidivism and less Indigenous juvenile detention and offending over time, we are seeing that the rates are increasing, particularly for young girls and women offenders. Quite clearly a lot of those young people are also parents themselves. The intergenerational cycle of offending is unbroken in Australia at the moment. It is of great concern, I am sure, not only to all of us here in this parliament but also to the broader Australian society, that so much life is being wasted and lost as young people serve time for offences which very often have been the result of extreme social, educational and health disadvantage or deprivation. We were very concerned to look at the total justice system. The chairman has referred to the fact that we were concerned to find that there were very few targets set in the justice system. We found there is a lot of well-meaning intention and that there are a lot of programs, but very few of these programs set benchmarks, look at best practice either in Australia or internationally and then measure the outcomes of their various programs to see if in fact they work. There is often very short-term funding for innovative programs. There are, as we have heard, silos of activity. We found that it is not acceptable to have a child or a young person incarcerated or in detention simply because there is not a safer place for them to be. There is obviously a serious problem for safe accommodation for a lot of the juvenile offenders before they go into detention or indeed after they come out. It is a very sad fact that nearly 41.3 per cent of Indigenous children and young people are in out-ofhome care compared with only 4.6 per cent of non-Indigenous people. We are also very concerned about the physical and mental health problems associated with Indigenous offending. We can directly relate the overrepresentation of Indigenous youth in the criminal justice system to things like alcohol and drug abuse, foetal alcohol syndrome, hearing loss and mental health issues and problems. Many young children are disengaging from education from the earliest age or their truancy rates are so substantial that they are not learning English, perhaps because they are in remote Australia., They may not be able to gain enough skill to get a job-yet they aspire, like every other young Australian, to buy the good things they see on television or in advertising, but they are frustrated in not being able to achieve legitimate employment. Often for them the only alternative is offending. We found too that there is a very serious problem in our society where there are few role models in our Indigenous communities, where there are families who have not known anything other than cycles of recidivism. On the other hand, we found examples of marvellous mentors in the Indigenous community who are very embedded in terms of their own cultural understanding and their own social life. It was stressed to us many times that mentoring is a key, whether through sport or other artistic or cultural activity or in some other way. If Indigenous young people have someone to look up to, whether Indigenous or non-Indigenous, they can help them find their pathway through to life beyond offending. We went to New Zealand to compare Maori offending rates and to look at what programs they might have which could give us some better guide or inform us on our policy directions. We found that they had in fact adopted the Koori Court, as it is called in Victoria; it has other names in other states. House. They had in particular moved towards having more engagement with the offender and the victim of the crime. We saw that as a very good thing. It brought the young person face to face with the impacts and outcomes of their activity so they could see how it impacted on and harmed another individual. We believe that we really need to take a holistic approach to deal with juvenile offending with Indigenous young Australians. It has to begin almost prenatally, making sure children are born healthy and that they get proper medical attention so that they do not suffer a hearing loss. We really want to say that we must do better. Doing time-time for doing is a critical report.",73

70,Mr HAWKE,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety, I present the committee's report entitled High-wire act: cyber-safety and the young. It has been a great honour to be the deputy chair of this committee during our inquiry into cybersafety, and it gives me great pleasure to table this report in the In such a rapidly changing world in terms of technology and the associated dangers of that technology, it is a great acknowledgement of this parliament and the work of this place that we have kept pace with the times. For most users of the cyberspace environment, it is a helpful and positive experience. I want to note that this report does not seek to demonise the great progress that has been made in digital liberty and online technology in our world today. But for a small minority it can be tragic. All committee members hope that this report will make a difference and make the environment a safer place for all users, especially for young Australians. It is so important that government does provide a safe environment for our young Australians and keep pace with regulatory and other requirements in a rapidly technologically changing world. While the principal focus of the enquiry was on cyberbullying, it became clear that there are a number of areas where action could be taken to improve cybersafety. We have therefore framed our recommendations to do this. I would like to draw attention to some of them in the following areas: the availability of material on cybersafety, privacy and identity theft, education, and existing legislation. We have recommended that all the material on cybersafety be made accessible through a central portal and that a national campaign be undertaken to publicise this portal, especially among children and young people. A range of resources is already available from the Australian Communications and Media Authority. But because this is such an important consideration, I will return to this. We do believe that the internet industry needs to enhance accessibility to assistance or complaints mechanisms on social networking sites. This includes provision of prompt advice about resolution of complaints, especially reasons for any lack of action. Considering the evidence provided to the committee that children at a very young age were on these social networking sites, it became all the more graphic why we need to pursue this course. The committee also thought that privacy and identity theft were vital issues for the online environment, especially for young people and children. We have made a number of recommendations that should improve the protection for individuals and their personal information and bring forward regulatory and legal frameworks to modern times. Above all, we believe that better education about cybersafety is vital to reducing the risks in the online environment, especially that of cyberbullying. Therefore, there are a number of recommendations to assist schools, teachers, parents and carers. One of the most significant is a proposal to develop national core standards for cybersafety education in our schools. Another recommendation proposes the inclusion of cybersafety material in the core curriculums of teacher training courses. All Australian schools are encouraged to introduce acceptable use agreements governing the access of students to the online environment. While all states and territories have a range of legislative means to deal with cybersafety crimes, these are inconsistent and there are gaps. We therefore recommended that the Attorney-General review existing legislation dealing with the crimes in all Australian jurisdictions. I would like to express my thanks in particular to colleagues on the committee and also to those witnesses-industry groups, other bodies, parents and teacher groups-that came and presented evidence to us. Members here would know that I am not a particular fan of big government solutions to the problems that we face. Indeed, the committee canvassed extensively the concept of a mandatory internet filter. One of the great things about this report is that we are not recommending the introduction of mandatory internet filter. In fact, voluntary filter regimes were highlighted by parents groups, teachers groups, union groups, peak bodies in industry and other associations as the best way to proceed. Indeed, we are not recommending filtering as a solution to the problems of online behaviour and online safety. We are also acknowledging that traditional models, such as ombudsmen and the question of an online ombudsman, are not a realistic response to a rapidly changing technological world. Nor do we accept that a traditional review of process by a government official would somehow lead to a better outcome. We are acknowledging that the rapidly changing technological world this report attempts to deal with needs rapidly changing technological solutions, and the government and legislation need to keep pace with the evolution of our society. I thank in particular Cheryl Scarlett, secretary of our committee, for all the work she put in. I believe that the adoption recommendations will make a contribution to alerting the community to the importance of cybersafety and lead to a deep penetration into these problems.",74
71,Mr ZAPPIA,COMMITTEES," I join with the member for Mitchell in speaking to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety High-wire act: cyber-safety and the young. The internet and modern information technology have become an invaluable resource in today's fast-moving world. Regrettably, those resources can also be used for wrong purposes, sometimes causing irreparable harm to others. Cybersafety is very important for all those who enter the online environment. It is vital to making this environment safer for all users, particularly for young Australians. There are risks to all users in the online environment, but some reporting can be sensational. It does not concentrate sufficiently on measures that can easily be taken to reduce those risks. The major focus of this inquiry was cybersafety for young people in the online environment. Consultation with them was a priority, and an online survey was devised to ensure that they had the opportunity to give us their views on a range of issues. We were surprised by the response to our 'Are you safe?' survey. A total of 33,751 young people completed it and many respondents provided useful additional comments. We have made extensive use of these frank, revealing and sometimes disturbing comments. This inquiry received 152 submissions and 16 supplementary submissions. We relied heavily on these submissions in framing our conclusions and recommendations. We took evidence from a wide range of people and organisations with an interest in the cybersafety. They included the representatives of the information and of the communications technology industry and Facebook, academics and researchers, a range of Australian government departments and agencies, and state government education departments. Non-government organisations working with young people, professional bodies and unions, representatives of parent and carers, as well as several corporations and content providers also gave evidence. It became clear that there is a need for more education on a range of cybersafety issues. A great deal of material that would reduce online risks is available from the Australian Communications and Media Authority, for example. It is based on sound research and on consultation with young Australians. The existence and availability of this material is clearly not well known in the community. We have recommended that it be made more accessible through a central portal-and I thank the member for Mitchell who referred to this in his remarks-and that this portal be publicised through a national campaign. While children as young as four and five years of age are being introduced to the online environment, cybersafety education does not begin in schools until they are six or seven. We have recommended looking at the feasibility of providing this education in preschools and kindergartens. It is clear that cyberbullying is a major and serious issue in Australia but that it is not well understood. At this point, it has not even been satisfactorily defined. We have recommended that an agreed definition of cyberbullying be developed and adopted by all Australian government departments and agencies.",76

75,Mr HAWKE,COMMITTEES,by leave-I move: That the order of the day be referred to Main Committee for debate. Question agreed to. Law Enforcement Committee Report,77
76,Mr HAYES,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, I present the committee's report, entitled Inquiry into the adequacy of aviation and maritime security measures to combat serious and organised crime. Since September 2009, the committee on law enforcement has been examining the security of Australia's aviation and maritime sectors. Specifically, the committee has been inquiring into whether our current security arrangements are adequate in the face of this threat from criminal networks, particularly at our airports and seaports. Overall, the committee received a large amount of information and evidence pointing to the ongoing penetration of our airports and seaports by organised crime. The committee is deeply concerned about the level of organised criminal activity occurring in our aviation and maritime sectors. A key driver for this criminal activity continues to be the illicit profits made from the importation of drugs. The committee heard that a kilo of cocaine, perhaps sourced from a country such as Colombia, might be purchased for a few thousand dollars but has a wholesale price in Australia of around In $300,000, with a street price of $1 millionquite a lucrative proposition. As the majority of illicit drugs are sourced overseas, either in their final form or as precursor chemicals, this lucrative trade leads to corruption at our main points of entry. Regrettably, there are a small number of individuals working within the aviation and maritime sectors, either the recruited or placed by criminal networks, and they play a disproportionately large role in successful criminal activity. The current security regime in the aviation and maritime sectors was introduced post September 11 and in our opinion is far too narrowly focused on the threat of terrorist attacks within these sectors. While the committee agrees that such security measures are vital for the safety of the community, I believe that the security regime should be extended to defend against the threat of organised crime. This is in line with this government's 2008 National Security Statement, which identified serious and organised crime as a threat to national security. A key recommendation is strengthening of the aviation and maritime security identification card schemes. During the course of the inquiry the committee became aware that a number of individuals known to be closely involved with criminal activity continue to hold these cards, allowing them free access to sensitive areas. As such, the committee has recommended that such individuals could have their cards revoked on the basis of compelling criminal intelligence. Further changes to the ASIC and MSIC schemes recommended by the committee include their expansion to cover important elements of the supply chain outside of airport or seaport environments and the introduction of biometric information to simplify and strengthen the management of the system. The committee also spent considerable time examining the law enforcement response to organised crime in the aviation and maritime sectors and the importance of criminal intelligence. Apart from targeted police operations, intelligence is useful at a strategic level, to build a picture of criminality that allows not just reactive intervention but also proactive prevention. The committee is therefore keen to see an enhanced analytical use of intelligence from all sources and supports ongoing efforts that would allow such a 'fusion' to take place. The committee has been encouraged by the development of joint agency task forces that exist now in a number of states and has recommended that these be applied in all jurisdictions. State based task forces should be supplemented by an AFP led flying squad that would direct a joint agency response to trouble spots on an ongoing basis as needed. Importantly, the committee has recommended a number of enhancements to the air passenger environment. Organised crime figures are currently able to travel under false identities with impunity while the facilitating criminal activity. In response, the committee has recommended that travelling under a false identity be made an offence. In addition, the committee has also recommended that the provision of photo identification by passengers be made mandatory prior to boarding a plane. Serious and organised crime continues to threaten Australia's community and is estimated to cost the national economy more than $15 billion each year. We must continually adapt to this ever-evolving threat. I commend the report to the House.",77
77,Mr KEENAN,COMMITTEES," It is my pleasure to follow the member for Fowler in speaking on the Joint Committee on Law Enforcement's inquiry into the adequacy of aviation and maritime security measures to combat serious and organised crime. I endorse a lot of what he had to say. Even though I was not a participant on this committee from the outset like he was, I certainly was on the committee long enough to understand that serious and organised crime remains a substantial threat to our ports and to our airports. As he noted, the security environment around airports and ports has changed markedly since 11 September 2001 with those momentous events in New York and Washington. Subsequently, criminals managed to adapt to the new measures that governments took to more adequately protect our ports and our airports. So getting border security right remains on ongoing process. Criminals seek to do harm to our society and I certainly agree with the government's assessment that organised criminality remains a very serious national security risk. They are constantly probing for weakness within our border security systems. Sadly, even though the government identifies the problem correctly, it has responded to it with budget cuts to our border protection agencies, which means that Australia remains seriously exposed to a lot of these ongoing threats. This has very serious ramifications for the way we experience law and order on our streets, because the Commonwealth itself is failing to do what it should do-that is, adequately police our borders. Our border protection crisis is far more than just people being smuggled here illegally via Indonesia; our border protection crisis also extends to the fact that there is now so little screening of cargo that is coming in through our ports and our airports because of substantial budget cuts by this government and also because of the lack of resourcing to Customs and Border Protection in particular. I will just turn briefly to the report in limited time that I have. I would like to thank all of the members and senators on the committee, who worked very closely together in preparing what is a bipartisan report. Some of that credit must go to the chairman of the committee, Senator Steve Hutchins, who is retiring, so I am sure he will not mind if I very briefly say something nice about him. He did do a wonderful job as chair. As Chair of the Joint Committee on Law Enforcement and its predecessor committee, he did have a history of bringing down reports that were supported by everybody on those committees. As we know, in this place that is not always that easy to do. It is a credit to his stewardship that this committee report was able to reflect that also. All members were prepared to put their stamp on this committee report and I think it makes recommendations that the opposition would certainly like to see the government seriously consider. I will just turn briefly to a couple of them. Recommendation 7 is the one that seems to have received most of the publicity. It reads: The committee recommends that it be made a legal requirement to provide photo identification confirming passenger identity immediately prior to boarding an aircraft. This report does have the endorsement of all the members of the committee, although I must say that I do have some reservations about further inconveniencing passengers. I think it is always important to try to find ways that we can enhance border security and make it harder for the criminals without making it more difficult for passengers when they travel.",78

82,Mr WILKIE,BILLS," Who could forget the shocking images of animal cruelty we saw on the ABC Four Corners program exactly three weeks ago? For me the one image, more than any other, which is seared into my mind is that of the black shaking in fear, the look in its eyes one of abject terror because it was the last of a group to be slaughtered and it had been made to witness the shocking cruelty meted out to one animal after another. How on earth could the Howard, Rudd and Gillard governments have allowed such shocking animal mistreatment to have gone on day after day, night after night, in countless slaughterhouses in arguably our most important neighbour, especially one to whom we have such a close link and provide such significant aid? It is not like these governments did not have cause to keep an eye on our live animal export trade given all the problems the business has experienced year after year in country after country. In the Middle East alone eight countries have been identified as mistreating Australian livestock during just the last eight years. It beggars belief that a succession of Australian governments have let us down in this way, as does the revelation that Meat and Livestock Australia has been fleecing producers for years, raking in enormous fees off the back of the lie it was looking after the interests of the Australian live animal export industry and the beasts it deals with, only to be busted an irresponsible, incompetent, dishonest and uncaring bunch of cowboys. No wonder there has been such an extraordinary welling up of public concern since the Four Corners program. Even those who have been concerned with live animal exports for a long time felt energised to do whatever we could to finally do something and this bill, the Live Animal Export Restriction and Prohibition Bill 2011, will do just that. Most importantly the bill will end all live animal exports by mid-2014, as it should, because the live animal export system is broken and beyond repair and the beast arguments against shutting it down are baseless. For a start, ending all live animal exports will not destroy our relationship with Indonesia because our ties with that country are stronger than critics give them credit for and are certainly strong enough to survive our decision to stop selling just one form of one particular foodstuff. Nor will Indonesians go hungry, because on average they consume just two kilograms of red meat each a year. In other words, even the complete removal of Australian beef would make virtually no difference whatsoever, except for more affluent Indonesians who tend to eat Australian beef and who have the means to purchase and store boxed Australian meat processed by Australian workers in Australian abattoirs. And the Indonesian government plans to be beef selfsufficient by 2014 anyway. The religious dimension of this matter has also been mischievously overcooked by the live animal export industry, because the fact is that the overwhelming number of relatively affluent Muslims who tend to consume Australian meat would have no objection to buying that meat so long as it has been processed in an Australian halal as certified abattoir. Moreover, the argument that banning live cattle exports to Indonesia will somehow destroy the beef industry is ridiculous. The direct and indirect value of the red meat industry in Australia is something in the order of $17 billion dollars, and it employs some 55,000 workers. By comparison, the live export trade comes in at about $1 billion and 10,000 workers. In other words, ending the live export trade will have a marginal effect, even more so when the workers shift to the processed meat sector. The economic argument is in fact strongly in favour of banning live animal exports, because of the way the trade is cannibalising the processed meat industry at the expense of thousands of Australian jobs. Any short-term commercial jolt will be limited, while the mediumto long-term benefit will be enormous. In any case, the three-year phase out period stipulated in the bill gives the industry more than enough time to move from live to processed meat. For a start, within 12 months the mothballed abattoirs in Katherine and Innisfail could be refurbished and reopened, the mooted abattoir in Darwin could be well on its way to completion and thousands of unemployed and underemployed workers could be trained. This bill dovetails perfectly with the motion of the member for Kennedy, which seeks to energise the government's immediate response to Australia's live animal export crisis. His motion, which I seconded and which is endorsed by both Animals Australia and the RSPCA, demands the immediate implementation of safeguards in Indonesia, including the deployment of Australian government officials as well as the provision of stun-guns and other equipment, before a speedy resumption of exports. This is, I feel, a sensible and politically realistic approach: to quickly put in place effective animal welfare safeguards before the resumption of trade, pending the winding up of the industry within three years. Such an approach also considers the graziers, the Indigenous station hands, the truckers, the shipping-line operators, the producers and everyone else involved in the live animal export industry who are in difficulty right now from the jolt of this entirely warranted, but nonetheless unexpected, decision by government. Fasttracking safeguards in Indonesia is also the only way to help the tens of thousands of animals currently in Indonesian feedlots which are being, and will continue to be, treated in exactly the same way as the poor animals we saw on Four Corners three weeks ago. Yes, I certainly do see the point in abolishing the industry immediately, because the live animal export trade is deeply flawed and no amount of remedial action can be sure to safeguard the animals. But good public policy demands a balance between rhetoric and reality. There is no point coming in here with a popular response which fails to help at least the tens of thousands of Australian animals already in Indonesia. Nor is there any point coming in here and calling for an outcome knowing full well it is just theatre and there is no chance whatsoever of it being achieved. Much has been said on compensation for the Australian live animal export industry. Yes, the government should help the industry deal with the current moratorium's commercial jolt, but let us not forget that it is Meat and Livestock Australia which stands out as the organisation funded and trusted to safeguard Australia's live animal export trade and that it is Meat and Livestock Australia which has not given a toss except to suck up the cash while showing complete and utter contempt for the industry which pays its bills. Nor has MLA apparently shown the slightest regard for the poor Australian beasts in its care, which, by any ethical measure, should be treated overseas to the same standard or better as is demanded in this country. In other words: it is MLA feed which should now put its grubby hands into its very deep pockets and pull out the cash needed to help support the live animal export industry while the Australian government puts in place the safeguards necessary for trade to resume. This country is at a crossroad. Yes, the government has done the right thing by imposing a moratorium on live animal exports to Indonesia, and I applaud it and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for doing so. But the real measure of the government is what it does next. The government must put animal welfare and the public interest ahead of everything else. It must move urgently to put in place the safeguards needed to protect the tens of thousands of beasts already in feedlots in Indonesia and those which would follow them once the trade is allowed to resume. More broadly, I call on everyone in this place to support the Live Animal Export Restriction and Prohibition Bill 2011. It already has the support of Animals Australia and the RSPCA. The support of the parliament will legislate the safeguards our animals need right now and shut down a trade that is fundamentally broken, systemically cruel and definitely not in Australia's economic interest. Bill read a first time.",80
83,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," In accordance with standing order 41(c), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Live Animal Export (Slaughter) Prohibition Bill 2011 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Bandt.",82
84,Mr BANDT,BILLS," This bill is being introduced in the midst of an incredibly important public debate about the ethical viability of the Australian live animal export industry. The catalyst for that debate-the horrific images we saw on ABC's Four Corners three weeks agoprovides damning evidence of an industry peak body complicit in the shocking abuse of Australian cattle in Indonesian slaughterhouses. Before I critique Meat and Livestock Australia's role in the systemic abuse of animals sent overseas for slaughter and elaborate on the reasons why the only satisfactory government response to this abuse is the instant cessation of live animal exports for slaughter, I want to be very clear that this abuse is not a new problem. It is not even necessarily a growing problem: it is a systemic problem onto which the mainstream media is throwing some rare and welcome light. In making this observation, I am reminded of an Albert Schweitzer quote: 'Think occasionally of the suffering of which you spare yourself the sight.' The Greens have a long standing opposition to livestock exports for slaughter as well as for other purposes. It has been a part of our policy platform for many years, and it was part of our 2010 federal election campaign platform. I am proud, then, to move to implement that part of our policy by introducing this bill. The bill puts an immediate end to the horrific treatment of Australian cattle in overseas slaughterhouses. It creates a simple amendment to the Export Control Act 1982 to prohibit the export of live animals for slaughter. It does this by providing definitions of 'livestock' and 'livestock for slaughter' to limit the application of the bill to cattle, calves, sheep, lambs, goats or other prescribed animals intended to be exported overseas for slaughter. The ban will be in place immediately. These provisions will come into effect the day after royal assent, with no delay and with the immediate cessation of cruelty. My colleague in the other place Senator Siewert has introduced a bill with identical provisions in order that both houses can keep pressure on the government and the minister to take swift and decisive action to end the trade. On that point, it is disappointing that the Labor caucus has been willing to go along with the minister's plan to reinstate live animal exports to Indonesia with only weak guidelines. This is simply not an acceptable outcome. As we have seen again today, this time in Kuwait, Indonesia is not the only country where animals exported from Australia are subject to incredible cruelty. Despite the public desire for strong action, we seem unwilling to pursue principled policy in the face of industry lobbying. Minister Ludwig should stop being an industry patsy and should, instead, listen to the Australian public, who want strong protections against cruelty. My bill will deliver that strong action. It will provide for an immediate and complete ban on live animal exports for slaughter. Without wanting to repeat the descriptions of abuse, documented by Animals Australia, the RSPCA and others-I think the film taken by Animals Australia's intrepid Lyn White speaks for itself-I do want to illustrate the consequences for Australian livestock destined for slaughterhouses should this bill not pass. To provide some perspective, appro– ximately 2.7 million cattle were exported from Australia between 2008 and 2010. In the same three years, 10.8 million sheep and a quarter of a million goats were exported. The range of countries to which animals are exported, each with different animal welfare regulations, is also vast. Sheep are exported from Fremantle, Portland and Port Adelaide to Kuwait, Jordan, Bahrain, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel, Lebanon, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. Breeder cattle are exported from Darwin, Fremantle and Broome to Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Jordan, Japan, Israel and Brunei. Goats are exported from Adelaide, Fremantle and Sydney to Malaysia, Singapore, Mauritius and Brunei. Oversight, and the resourcing of oversight, of slaughter conditions for these millions of cattle, sheep and goats in such a large number of separate jurisdictions are anything but satisfactory. The concept 'out of sight, out of mind' provides a convenience to the Australian live animal export industry to overlook astonishing systemic mistreatment of Australian animals. I am not suggesting that Australian graziers are implicit in this mistreatment. Indeed, my office has been inundated with correspondence from farmers and graziers expressing shock at the recently exposed abuse, including from many who are supporting my bill. l am, however, highly critical of the industry peak bodies that usually operate with a convenient absence of examples of abuse in the mainstream media. Thanks again to Animals Australia investigators, there is no absence today. Constituents are, again, contacting my office in astonishing numbers, asking: 'How can the parliament allow the practices seen today in Kuwait to continue where Australian sheep overseas are stuffed into boots of cars, dragged in agony, thrown over other bloodied dying sheep on the sides of roads, all after an appalling sea voyage? And what of the other hundreds of thousands of cattle, sheep and goats that are in overseas feedlots, storage yards and slaughterhouses that are not being followed by members of under-resourced, non-government animal welfare organisations with video cameras, exposing these practices that the industry really does not want us to see? Meat and Livestock Australia and the Australian government have had years to overcome systemic abuse in the live export industry-years that have amounted to either very little progress or no progress at all. Serious questions need to be asked about the roles of organisations such as Meat and Livestock Australia and LiveCorp. MLA receives $5 per head of cattle exported to address animal welfare issues. Clearly, graziers have the right to be angry at the misuse of those funds. PR spin is no substitute for actual investment in animal welfare. The recently announced industry action plan proposes that ongoing assessments of all facilities and locations processing Australian animals be required and that assessors facilitate upgrades improvements of facilities that do not meet endorsed livestock welfare standards. But here has been an Indonesian Animal Welfare Taskforce charged with doing exactly that since 2006, a by-product of which has been the installation of many of the restraint boxes seen on the Four Corners program, emblazoned with MLA and LiveCorp logos. I struggle to accept at face value that the industry action plan, proposing to continue its futile 'assess and upgrade' program, will be successful. It is the perception of action that is significant here. Much will be promised by the industry in order to, again, get the issue off the front pages, to keep the industry in a profitable state regardless ethically indefensible consequences. We as a parliament must observe the history of this flawed industry and say, 'Enough is enough.' There are simply far too many examples of entrenched abuse in Australia's live animal exports industry to support its ongoing viability. To take the Indonesian example again, the sheer cost of refitting dozens of slaughterhouses to meet Australian standards and retraining a highly transient workforce in improved animal welfare practices, when there is no imperative to abandon traditional slaughter practices due to such poor working conditions, would be simply astronomical and, I would argue strongly, not realistic. That is why I have moved a bill without the expensive transitional arrangements contained in the bill moved earlier by the member for Denison, and it is why, with respect to him, I cannot argue for anything other than the complete abolition of live exports. And what if that hypothetical future where slaughterhouses observed conditions that approached those approximating Australian standards? The transport of animals from and Australian ports, in shiploads of misery, with the guaranteed associated incidence of death during the voyage, is still a practice that government cannot, in my opinion, condone on any ethical grounds. There is another way. The Greens propose that the government commits to improving and increasing the process of slaughter in Australia to support local producers and local jobs. The community benefits of processing meat in Australia have been underestimated for too long and are being talked down by the live export industry. A 2010 report commissioned by Australia's leading meat processors found that live cattle exports compete with and of the undermine Australia's domestic beef industry, leading to lost processing opportunities in Australia. Processing animals in Australia protects them from the worse examples of inhumane treatment that we are aware of and subjects livestock to Australian standards, which are certainly not perfect but which are an improvement on overseas standards and which are at least controllable. Additionally, we need to meaningfully invest in real animal welfare both domestically and overseas. This bill is a significant step to a better future for animals and the Australian meat industry. The Greens will continue to call for an immediate ban on all live exports, just as we have done for many years. I sincerely hope that the environment within which this bill is being introduced, in one of those rare periods when animal welfare issues are being debated in the mainstream media, provides the opportunity for parliament to take decisive action. I implore my fellow members to remember that the extent of these problems is much greater than these brief glimpses of examples of systemic abuse in the industry expose. Members must not mistake any future absence of examples of abuse on the front pages of Australia's newspapers with a sudden improvement of animal welfare standards. History tells us that one has never followed the other. It is time to end the abuse, and I commend the bill to the House. Bill read a first time.",82
85,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," In accordance with standing order 41(c), the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Australian Building and Construction Commission",85
86,Mr CHAMPION,BILLS," I move: That this House: (1) notes the: (a) Australian Building and Construction Commission (ABCC) created under the Howard Government's industrial relations legislation unfairly targets workers in the construction industry; and (b) Government believes the current ABCC should be abolished and replaced with a new inspectorate that is part of the Fair Work Australia system; and (2) calls on all members to support the abolition of the ABCC to restore fairness in the construction industry for workers and employers. The Australian Building and Construction Commission is a regulator that was conceived as part of the legislative malice that the previous Howard government exhibited to organised labour and to the working men and women of this country. It is a malice that we have seen over 100 years. We saw it in the 1890s, in the shearers' strikes; we saw it in the 1930s, in the railway strikes that brought Ben Chifley to this parliament; we saw it in Mudginberri and the disputes of the eighties; and we saw it on the docks with the dogs and balaclavas and the illegal sacking of Australians simply for being members of a union. We see this malice towards the working men and women in the construction industry-900,000 people singled out for special observance under special powers and special prosecution with special penalties. All of this is simply because they want to be part of a union and want to organise and exert their rights at work. The ABCC is the last remaining edifice in the legislative malice that was Work Choices and the 1998 Workplace Relations Act. The then government sought to insert into Australian law all of the unfairness and viciousness that they had in their hearts for organised labour. The building industry is at the heart of our economy. It is an industry that is robust, diverse and at times troubled. There are many examples of this. I am sure members opposite will make plenty of remarks and observations about the conduct of unions and workers. But we know this is an industry that has huge problems with sham contracting, phoenix companies, unpaid entitlements and bills to other firms. We know it is an industry with a problem with the employment of illegal workers. The Sydney Morning Herald on 26 June 2011 observed the death of a Mr Hwang who had been working illegally in Australia since 1998 and who had died of a respiratory illness. He died a pauper. He was an illegal worker in the tiling industry and one of many in that industry who are subject to those conditions. He had never been on an employer's books and was never paid any superannuation. On the website Adelaide Now on 9 March 2011 was the headline 'Dodgy builders ""out of control""', and the story referred to underpaid construction workers, many of them illegal workers, flooding into South Australia's construction industry. It outlined the cases of workers on the SAPOL building site who were owed $200,000 in wages by a subcontractor who had fled the country. There were individuals there who were owed $11,000-one was owed $18,000-and these are just some of the examples of workers in this industry who have been ripped off, underpaid and undocumented and who have taken Australian jobs. When we look at how the ABCC has performed and what it has done about problems such as these, we see they have received $182 million over the last few years and have had exactly five employer prosecutions. There were zero in 2006, zero in 2007, zero in 2009 and zero in 2010. Less than five per cent of all prosecutions were of employers. These were quiet years for the ABCC. This was because this regulator is myopic and blinkered. It was conceived in malice-that is why it has to go. It is a regulator that has not fairly applied the rule of law to this industry. It has not put in place safeguards to protect civil liberties or workers. It has not looked to be a fair regulator for the Australian people, and that is why we look forward to it being replaced by a regulator that will put at its heart the rule of law, will protect civil liberties such as the right to a lawyer and will enshrine in legislation a sunset clause to protect Australians from its extraordinary powers. This is a regulator that was born of malice, and it must be replaced by a regulator that is born of fairness.",85
87,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the motion seconded? Ms Rishworth: I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,86
88,Ms LEY,BILLS," Tonight's debate calling on members to support the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission is a prudent opportunity to remind the Australian public of why the ABCC was established. The coalition set up the ABCC in response to the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry when the brutal thuggery of some unions and businesses was making it impossible for small business and independent contractors to access sites without conceding to often unlawful union demands. Australians fully supported the Howard government's establishment of the ABCC, appreciating that we needed a body with the clout to enforce law and order on building and construction sites around Australia. The ABCC is responsible for monitoring conduct in the industry and prosecuting unlawful industrial action, breaches of freedom of association laws and addressing all complaints of unlawfulness in the industry. We have seen bikies on the West Gate Bridge, union officials being prosecuted over threats to kill, and illegal blockades of building sites. The blockade by the CFMEU at the Melbourne Markets relocation project site, between 19 May 2010 and 28 May 2010, is a prime example. The CFMEU refused to accept the greenfields agreement between the developer and the Australian Workers Union. Construction was blocked for 10 days by union members. Such heavy-handed, illegal behaviour on the part of unions provides the evidence of the need for the ABCC. When we have union officials blockading worksites with cars and rocks, and going as far as allegedly luring kangaroos onto a worksite to disrupt building, we have a real problem. This behaviour is unacceptable in Australian workplaces. It is a direct attack on productivity and employers, and the vandalism and obstruction that occurs on construction sites in Australia needs to cease. Without the ABCC, Australia could descend back to the dark old days of corruption and heavy-handed union bullying. Yet preventing the bully-boy tactics of unions is not the only role of the ABCC. They do go into bat for workers, ensuring they receive the correct pay and entitlements. Workers at the Pentridge Prison Apartment development received back pay recently, when the ABCC became aware of allegations of underpayments following reports on Melbourne media saying that workers at the site had been locked out and had not been paid their wages. The ABCC can provide one-on-one advice to employers in the building and construction industry about classifications and hourly rates, record-keeping obligations, leave and termination issues and employment conditions. Yet Labor's contempt for the ABCC is long standing. Despite going to the 2007 election committing to keep a tough cop on the beat, they are now backflippingproposing to give the minister the capacity issue directions to Fair Work Australia about the policies, programs, priorities and the manner in which the powers and functions of the building industry inspectorate are exercised and performed. This is in stark contrast to a commitment made by the now Prime Minister when she was confronted with a sea of yellow T-shirt wearing protestors in Brisbane in 2009. She stated: Like me, I am sure you were appalled to read of dangerous car chases across Melbourne city involving carloads of balaclava-wearing people, criminal damage to vehicles resulting in arrests, threats of physical violence and intimidation … Balaclavas, violence and intimidation must be unreservedly condemned … and the Rudd Labor government will do everything necessary to ensure that we do not see this appalling conduct again. That is what the Prime Minister said. It is a real shame that the Gillard Labor government does not share this commitment, and the only promise that matters now is one that has apparently been made to the backroom boys of the unions. Unfortunately, the faceless men of the Labor Party are once again pushing their own agenda. And if it means holding an industry hostage to enact their own power plays then this is exactly what they want to do. The coalition supports the Australian Building and Construction Commission, and we definitely support the need for keeping a tough cop on the beat. This private member's motion is nothing short of a pathetic Labor attempt to appease its faceless union bosses.",86
89,Ms RISHWORTH,BILLS, I am very pleased to second this motion. I would like to thank the member for Wakefield for bringing it to the House tonight. This motion rightly points out that the Howard government's Australian Building and Construction Commission has unfairly targeted building and construction to unions and their individual workers. It is clear from the comparison of the total number of successful prosecutions made by the ABCC. We have five for employersMr Briggs interjecting,87
90,Ms RISHWORTH,BILLS,"The member for Mayo has just walked in. I am sure he was critical, just as he was with Work Choices, in the back room, in coming up with the best plan about how to target unions and their rank and file members-because we know he has some runs on the board there. However, we saw five successful prosecutions of employer groups and 86 of employee organisations. The previous speaker suggested-and I find it very hard to believe-that there were no other issues, that employers in the building and construction industry never do anything wrong; they never have issues where they underpay their workers or do not hold high health and safety standards. Those numbers I think clearly state that this organisation was there to target unions and their rank and file members. This is a very important point because we do need to make sure both employees and employers are held accountable. It is important that employers do uphold health and safety standards as well as their employees and ensure that there are decent conditions for workers on building sites and workplaces right around this country. It is not surprising that this was created the Howard government, because they created so many things, including their first wave of industrial relations changes in 1998 and then their second wave, through Work Choices, where they got a little giddy with their Senate majority and decided to really rip away the wages and conditions of ordinary Australians that deservedMr Briggs interjecting",88
91,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The member for Mayo can tell us when he gets his chance.,88
92,Ms RISHWORTH,BILLS,"good health and safety standards and good conditions at work. There are many who believe that, as a result of the culture of fear and intimidation that occurred as a result of the ABCC, workers could not feel they could voice their concerns about their workplace. They did not feel that they could raise health and safety issues or their entitlements, that under the ABCC if they did raise these issues or took action to address these issues they would be compulsorily interrogated and not be provided the appropriate protections and safeguards, including the fundamental right to legal representation. So it is no wonder that there are many that believe that there were reduced safety standards on building sites, increased injury rates and reduced access to employee advocates and unions for workers. And, as a result of the climate of fear and intimidation, there are many who felt they could no longer put their tools down to ensure that safety was there on the worksite. One particular story was related to me about how this affected a construction site. There was a site on which water supplies were turned off by management despite the fact that temperatures were topping about 45 degrees on some days. When water supplies were turned on again, black sludge then flowed from the taps, so by workers determined that the lack of water constituted a significant safety risk and walked off the job until water supplies were fixed. However, some months later, the workers who walked off the job, as well as their friends and colleagues at the construction site, were subject to what they felt was threatening and unwarranted interrogation to determine whether a safety risk was sufficiently immediate to warrant walking off the job. I am not sure about you, Madam Deputy Speaker, but I think black sludge and no access to water are an evident safety risk, and it is no wonder that in this example-and I am sure there are many others-workers felt that they were unfairly targeted by the ABCC. It seems that with the previous government there was an obsession with targeting workers, an obsession with reducing their pay and conditions, an obsession with ensuring that people did not get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. It has been this Labor government that has taken action to create Fair Work Australia, to restore the safety net that was destroyed by the previous government. On that point, I commend the motion to the House. Mrs ANDREWS (MCPherson) (21:16): I rise to speak against the motion by the member for Wakefield to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. There are many years of history to industrial disputation in the building and construction industry, and there have been a number of investigations and inquiries into that sector over the years. In the late 1980s-more than 20 years ago-the full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission conducted a review into the building and construction industry. Extensive submissions were made to the full bench by employers and unions on a wide range of industry practices, resulting in the consolidation of a number of awards into the National Building and Construction Industry Award 1990. The full bench found, firstly, that there was inconsistent industrial regulation between the federal and state jurisdictions and that a framework should be developed to deal with those issues; secondly, that the paid rates system should be abandoned in favour of a minimum rate plus a supplementary payment or allowance, which was consistent with the prevailing wage fixation principles; and, thirdly, that a single award should be established with a rationalisation of respondents. This was a step in improving the performance of the building and construction industry, but clearly more work needed to be done on reforming some entrenched practices in the industry. In early 2001 the government called for an initial report into the building and construction industry. An investigation was undertaken by the Employment Advocate on a wide range of matters such as breaches of freedom of association, including the forcing of construction workers to join a union; the pursuit of contractors to enter into an agreement in possible breach of the Workplace Relations Act; strike pay; and right of entry. This report was the precursor to the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry. Whilst there were more than 200 recommendations, Commissioner Cole specifically recommended changes to ensure bargaining only at enterprise level, eliminating pattern bargaining; mechanisms to 'ensure that any participant in the industry causing loss to other participants as a result of unlawful industrial action is held responsible for that loss'; mechanisms to ensure that disputes are settled in accordance with legislated or agreed dispute resolution procedures 'rather than by the application of industrial and commercial pressure'; and the creation of an independent body which: … will ensure that participants comply with industrial, civil and criminal laws applicable to all Australians … as well as industry specific laws applicable to this industry only. The legislation that gave effect to the Cole commission's desire for the implementation of the rule of law included the Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Act 2004 and later the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005. The second act commenced in September 2005, with its main object being to provide an improved industrial relations framework: … to ensure that building work is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for benefit of the Australian economy as a whole. This act provided for the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. The role of the commission is to monitor and promote appropriate standards of conduct throughout the building and construction industries. As well as an education and training role, the ABCC can, and has, instituted proceedings for contraventions of laws relating to freedom of association, coercion in agreement making, right of entry, strike pay, sham arrangements and unfair services contracts. Specifically, when the ABCC uncovers a contravention, it will initiate proceedings in the courts or Fair Work Australia, and to date the courts have imposed $4,123,125 in penalties, $698,300 suspended, in successful ABCC cases. From its inception in October 2005 through to 31 May 2011, the ABCC has been successful in 74 cases and unsuccessful in only eight cases. The majority of proceedings have been in Victoria, which has had a long and difficult history with the building and construction industry, including the bitter disputation leading to the deregistration of the Builders Labourers Federation in 1986. The ABCC has a very positive role to play in monitoring and ensuring compliance with relevant legislation in an industry that has been dogged by practices which, if not unlawful, are precariously close. The greatest risk in the abolition of the ABCC is that the positive progress that has been made to date in reforming this industry will be eroded. If that happens there is a risk that there will be a return to the poor practices that were prevalent during the- (Time expired) Mr LAURIE FERGUSON (Werriwa) (21:21): That was a very interesting recitation of historical events, but I think the reality is better summarised by George the Williams in an article on 6 July 2010 in the Sydney Morning Herald. He noted that this legislation: … can be applied to anyone. Workers can be brought in, not because they are suspected of wrongdoing, but to report on the activities of their co-workers. Family members, including young children, can be told to reveal information about a parent in the building industry. … One person who just happened to be passing a building site was reported in this paperthat is, the Sydney Morning Herald; it is not the construction union making this reportto have been ''hauled in for several hours of secret questioning'' after seeing a confrontation between a union official and a building manager. That is a recitation of the truth, the coercive powers in this legislation, coercive powers that the police forces of this country lack in many cases in regard to real criminality. As other speakers have indicated, there is a total imbalance in the way this organisation has operated. That is because it has a very close association with the infamous Cole royal commission into the industry. As the member for Mayo well knows, it was a politically driven royal commission and totally discredited. There is a total imbalance in the way this organisation has operated in the industry. That is derived from the way it was created and the reasons that the Howard government created it. There is a situation here where the industry in Sydney is characterised by the heavy use of imported labour. In Sydney people are locked on sites and are not allowed to leave the place where they are working. They are living on rations. On many building sites in Sydney you not only have the worker; you have his spouse working on the building site for no payment providing food. In some cases we have got a situation where, as the mover of this motion indicated, the amounts of money owed to these workers are horrendous. There has been very little activity by this organisation in regard toMr Briggs interjecting Mr LAURIE FERGUSON: Name them? You would be advised to read a few newspapers and do a bit of research for the first time in your life. The situation here, as I say, is that there is a total imbalance in the way the organisation has operated. The member for Mayo will be able, of course, because he is such a knowledgeable person in this field, to recite case after case where this organisation has pursued employers in regard to sham contracting, in regard to pyramid company operations, in regard to underpayment. I challenge him to come forward with those, because previous speakers on this side have indicated the large degree to which union officials and individual workers have been prosecuted. That is a challenge to you, my friend. We have seen $30 million of taxpayers' money expended on a series of unsuccessful prosecutions, nationally covered, in relation to Ark Tribe and others that were exonerated. It is also worth noting a poll by Essential Media in November 2010 which indicated public opinion on these matters. They said that 63 per cent of Australians were opposed to the fines this organisation could impose and 55 per cent of Australians were opposed to the way in which evidence was produced. With regard to seeking documents it was 58 per cent, and another 60 per cent were opposed to the use of these industrial laws in general. So Australian public opinion is very much concerned about the extreme powers this body has. It is also worth noting an article by Bernard Keane in Crikey. I know the member will comment on this as well. It certainly demolishes some of the research by Econtech in regard to the way in which this has been justified. A figure of 9.4 per cent for productivity improvements was put forward by that research. Once again that supposed gain for the industry was demolished by the Wilcox royal commission. The situation here is that severe problems in the industry are being ignored. This organisation is one whose agenda is essentially driven by a biased position. We do not see any concern about donors in Western Australia on the wharves who have said they are prepared to bring guns onto building sites to solve industrial problems. There is no activity or prosecution by this organisation. In summary, this is not $30 million worth of taxpayers' money well spent. It is an organisation which has been discredited by the failure of its activities. Its prosecutions have been essentially unsuccessful, it has been regarded by the Australian people as having too extensive powers, powers that go beyond any other body in this country, and it is selective in who it has concentrated on. (Time expired)",88
93,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS," It does give me great pleasure to speak on this motion moved by my little friend over there, the member for Wakefield. I must say I am surprised that the member for Wakefield has moved this motion. I cannot quite work out the connection. He is obviously trying to find some connection into the Left in South Australia. We have got Don's children here in the parliament tonight. We have got the member for Wakefield, the member for Adelaide and the member for Kingston, Don's children, before us-born out of the SDA, given birth to by Senator Don Farrell, who famously yesterday wished the Minister for Foreign Affairs happy anniversary, this week being the anniversary of fundamental injustice.",91
94,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The member must stop reflecting on members in the parliament and get to the motion.,91
95,Mr BRIGGS,BILLS,"I am just reflecting that it is a surprising motion moved by a paid-up operating member of the SDA. I will say another thing about the two former practising industrial advocates over on the other side who both referred to the 1998 workplace relations act. I thought they would have known better; it was 1996 to begin with. They were reforms moved in 1986, landmark reforms from a great workplace relations minister, Peter Reith, the former member for Flinders, a fantastic minister for workplace relations who got things done, who fixed the wharves. I notice the member for Wakefield referred to that earlier in his remarks. This is an industry that was littered with illegality, where the rule of law no longer applied. Terence Cole QC in a royal commission found example after example of illegality which bedevilled this industry, which added cost to buildings across this country, reduced productivity across this country. The previous speaker, the member for Werriwa, has got a great connection with the CFMEU, a long-term connection which he should have declared during his remarks, although it is so well-known he probably did not need to. What those on the other side forget to mention is that this legislation deals with both sides. If there is illegality in the system, both sides of the argument will be prosecuted. It was out of the royal commission of Terence Cole, a very wellcredentialled man who those on the other side were very happy to support in 2007 when he conducted another royal commission, which may have involved the former member for Mayo. They were very happy to support his inquiry then. But when he did this inquiry he was some sort of political partisan. The truth is that he was not. What he found was disgraceful and disgusting and needed to be acted upon. That is what the Howard government did, because that is what the Howard government did when they were in government: they delivered legislation which delivered high real wages, more jobs, higher productivity. They delivered legislation which fixed up this industry which was riddled with illegality, which was riddled with behaviour which I am surprised that the member for Wakefield is supporting, I must say. It does surprise me that the former SDA organisers, Don's children over there, are so supportive of this union and its activities. Of course, not all members of the CFMEU are bad people. There are some members of the CFMEU who are good, hard-working Australians. This legislation has never sought to take any action on them; it seeks to take action on those who break the law. That is who it seeks to take action on, that is what it was designed to do and that is what it has been doing. That is why it is an utter disgrace that these people want to take it away. I will tell you why they want to take it away. They have been talking about the corruptibility of political parties with donations. The reason they want to take this away is the donations they receive from their mates in the trade union movement. That is all that this is about. Debate interrupted. NA",92
96,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," Order! It being 9.30 pm I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Queensland Natural Disasters Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (21:30): I rise to put on the record how delighted I was to attend the Disaster Recognition Ceremony at South Bank in Brisbane on Sunday 12 June 2011. At this ceremony we paid tribute to our many Queensland and Brisbane flood heroes. Can I say from the outset how honoured I am to represent an electorate and a state where so many brave people, young and old, went to extreme lengths to help their neighbours, friends, family and in some cases total strangers in their time of need. At ceremonies held across the state as of Queensland Week 2011, 3,500 men and women from across Queensland were acknowledged for their efforts. It makes it truly inspiring to call Queensland home. As a community, as a city and as a state we fronted up to the challenge, we supported each other and we came through it stronger and more determined than ever. My electorate suffered, but Ryan is a wonderful community. Indeed, it is a collection of communities. It is a special place where people look out for one another, where friends and even total strangers greet one another and, most importantly, where people do not hesitate when asked to go above and beyond the call of duty. It is worth noting that during the January floods, no-one had to be asked to help. Busloads of the very heroes we honoured two Sundays ago turned up in droves to parks, streets and neighbourhoods all over Brisbane. With a bucket, mop and gloves in hand, locals were ready to help and ready to get our beautiful city back on its feet. It fair to say that Brisbane would not have recovered as quickly without our heroes. It is quite astonishing to comprehend, but with the help of the Army we achieved in three days what took three months after the 1974 floods. Much credit must go to the extraordinary leadership and work ethic of former Lord Mayor Campbell Newman, and to the Brisbane City Council, who arranged tetanus shots and organised the buses to get our heroes where they were needed. There were so many everyday heroes who simply got out and about and helped with the clean-up. They are the reason the city of Brisbane was back on its feet in a matter of days. We really have so much to thank them for. Their work was extraordinary. It was a great privilege to witness so many of these flood heroes receive their awards. It was a part moving ceremony, as it had been a moving experience to watch the outpour of community spirit during the January 2011 floods. When the floodwaters came, Brisbane was hit hard and hit fast. Thankfully, the community responded just as rapidly. It was humbling to see both friends and strangers go to each other's assistance. Whether it was helping to evacuate the elderly from their homes, or cooking for the tireless volunteers in the street, the fact is that if there was a job to be done there was someone in Brisbane prepared to volunteer and get it done. I still to this day recall a visitor from America who was so completely amazed at the traffic jam of volunteers coming into Brisbane. I remember this young fellow saying that only in Australia would you see people actually driving towards the disaster. The Disaster Recognition Ceremony in South Bank on Sunday was about paying tribute to the remarkable Brisbane residents who went above and beyond the call of duty. is It saw the volunteers, emergency services workers and community members thanked for their steadfast community service during this summer of disasters. As the federal member for Ryan I want to pay tribute to our outstanding community, our volunteers, our emergency service men and women and of course our everyday Brisbane residents who picked up their mops and buckets and were ready to be put to work. There are so many heroes around Queensland who contributed in so many ways following the floods and Cyclone Yasi. Many were acknowledged on the weekend and of course others will go unnoticed. The fact of the matter is that as a state we shone through those dark days. Again this has highlighted for me what a great place our community is to live, work and raise a family in, and I am very proud to represent it in federal parliament. Finally, we should never forget that there are so many people who have still not recovered from these disasters. As much as the physical damage may have been cleared away, they still need our support. Bass Electorate: Defence Science and Technology Organisation Facility",92
97,Mr LYONS,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to welcome and express my support for the public works motion put forward in parliament last week by the Special Minister of State, the Hon. Gary Gray, for the redevelopment of the Scottsdale Defence Science and Technology Organisation's facility in my electorate of Bass. Recently, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, the Hon. Warren Snowdon, joined me at Scottsdale to announce the $18.7 million, plus GST, project to redevelop the Scottsdale Defence Science and Technology Organisation's nutrition research facility. The works at the facility will include the redevelopment of food technology facilities, upgrading of the existing chemistry and nutrition laboratories and improvements to the site infrastructure and working areas. The Scottsdale DSTO facility researches and manufactures the freeze dried components used in the Australian Defence Force patrol ration packs and has been producing these since the early 1970s. In fact, Scottsdale is the only facility in Australia to both produce food and to undertake research into the nutritional value of ration packs and rationing systems used by the Australian Defence Force. The funding will generate employment opportunities in a region of Tasmania that has faced some difficulties in the recent past. It is an announcement welcomed by the community. It reiterates that the federal the government is committed to the people of Scottsdale and that Defence has a long-term future in the region. I am pleased that the Public Works Committee will conduct a hearing at Scottsdale on 27 July regarding this project that has been proposed by the Australian Labor government. This is good news for the people of the north-east of Tasmania. The redevelopment will result in a modern science facility that will be equipped to meet the nutritional needs of Australian Defence Force personnel. This project, through the public works motion in parliament last week, is furthering the Australian Labor government's commitment to the Scottsdale DSTO-something that the Liberals, for 11 long years, neglected and failed to do anything about. There has been a lot of scaremongering by opposition members in this place about the future of the DSTO facility. It is a pity that, as Senator Barnett leaves this place, he continually causes unnecessary uncertainty in and misleading of the north-east community. The future of Scottsdale DSTO is strong. It will continue to play a leading role in food technology and will continue to play an important role in the local community and economy. The government is committed to the modernisation and sustainability of this facility. It is a shame that certain opposition members cannot show the same level of commitment instead of causing unrest and uncertainty. Construction is due to start later this year, subject to parliamentary clearance, with an estimated completion date of late 2013. This is great news for the people of north-east Tasmania. The redevelopments will not only bring employment opportunities to the region, which has suffered a number of setbacks over recent times, but also provide an opportunity for growth within the community. The facility offers such potential that it amazes me that those opposite would want to question its future in the region. looking forward to the commencement of construction at the Scottsdale DSTO and to the positives and the opportunities it will bring to this wonderful region of north-east Tasmania and the great electorate of Bass. Wannon Electorate: Workplace Relations",94
98,Mr TEHAN,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to wish Jane Spencer a very happy birthday. She deserves it on this day in particular, because on this day Fair Work Australia, following three appeals, has decided that students will be able to go back to work for an hour and a half after school. This is a sensible decision, a common-sense decision, but a decision that has taken 16 months too long. Sixteen months ago Jane Spencer rang me to ask me why her son Matthew and five other students, including a young girl called Leticia Harrison, could no longer go to work after school. I said: 'That's crazy. No laws would stop young students going to work after school to earn some pocket money and get some work experience.' But, when I looked into it, that was in fact what had happened. Matthew Spencer, Leticia Harrison and four other students at the Terang Co-op had lost their work after school because, when the government re-regulated the workplace, it made a minimum three-hour requirement, which hurt, in particular, regional and country kids. Matthew Spencer and Leticia Harrison, when they left school at 3.30 to go to work at the Terang Co-op, got there at four o'clock. The business shut at 5.30, so they could no longer do three hours unless their boss, Charlie Duynhoven, was prepared to pay them for work they did not do-and neither the students nor Charlie wanted that. Jane Spencer decided she wanted to fight this, and so did Matthew Spencer and Leticia Harrison. So Neil Mitchell was called, and it I am was put to Julia Gillard-the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations at the time-that it seemed silly that these students should not be able to work after school. Julia Gillard said she would look into it and fix it. So what happened? Nothing. She did a Pontius Pilate; she washed her hands of these poor students and said, 'Over to Fair Work Australia.' These students-and their courage and their independence-have been fantastic. They said, 'This isn't good enough.' They got a petition going. From the community in Terang of 2,000 people they got 1,600 signatures. They drove down to Julia Gillard's office and, with their employer, Charlie Duynhoven-and I went with them-delivered the petition, saying, 'Please, we want our right to work.' What happened? She washed her hands of it. Julia Gillard ordered the Fair Work Ombudsman to go and investigate and, rather than get the students back their work, he fined the Terang Co-op for having employed the kids for an hour and a half-made the business out to be the crooks. So these two students decided that was not good enough. Not only did they deliver the petition; they then said: 'We're going to go down to Fair Work Australia and give evidence to say that we want our right to work. We want to be able to go back and do our hour and a half after school.' And what happened? One of the trade unions sent its lawyers in, and Leticia Harrison-a 16-yearold student who was down there giving evidence because she wanted her work back-was intimidated. I spoke to her the night after the hearing, and she was very shaken up by it. She said, 'I just wanted to go down there and give my explanation of why I want to get my one and a half hours of work after school back and not be intimidated and bullied.' We have had another appeal, to which Fair Work Australia said, 'No, sorry.' But finally, today, on Jane Spencer's birthday, Fair Work Australia has decided that yes, students can work after school, between three o'clock and 6.30 for a 1½-hour period-a common-sense outcome. Matthew Spencer and Leticia Harrison will not be able to go back to work, because they have now moved on, but young students across regional and rural Australia will be able to work after school again. I commend Matthew Spencer and Leticia Harrison for having the courage of their convictions to stand up and take the unions on and deliver this result. (Time expired) Braddon Electorate: Scams",95
99,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,ADJOURNMENT, Good job to Fair Work Australia on its deliberations. Over the last couple of weeks I have dealt with a number of fellow north-west coasters who have supposedly won large sums of money from overseas 'businesses' who have conducted 'raffles' and 'lotteries'. Two that are doing the roundsthis experience may be shared by other members here-are Solaris Holiday and Oceania Tourism.,96
100,Unknown,ADJOURNMENT,Opposition members interjecting,96
101,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,ADJOURNMENT,"Some people have received 'scratchies' type tickets which, once scratched open, just so happen to be the winning ticket for one of the main prizes on offer. All the 'winners' have to do is verify they are indeed the ticket holder and contact one of several numbers overseas to do so. Some were led to a genuine-looking website, which adds to the authenticity of the scam. None of my callers had ever purchased a ticket in these raffles or lotteries. So there is a surprise! Some of the 'winners' were asked to provide proof that they were indeed the ticket holder and were asked to provide bank details, licence details et cetera as part of the verification process. The person on the other end of the phone states, 'I will put you through to our legal team to whom you can confidentially give your personal details.' Of course, there is no legal team, rather just a person in the same or adjoining room, adding to the authenticity of the scheme. While this may have started off as a somewhat jovial matter for members opposite, I am sure they share with me concern about this whole issue of scams. Unfortunately, the number of people fooled by these scams is beyond a joke. We say to people, 'Beware', and that is why I am raising this matter tonight. Our 'winners' are asked to wait until they receive a letter from Solaris, for example, then to proceed to the post office or other place which has Western Union transfers available. In the instances raised with me, they were requested to pay $3,900 in processing, administration and court fees and to contact Solaris immediately the transfer had taken place, preferably by mobile phone, as this is quicker than waiting until you get home to contact them. It is all very chatty. It seems the quicker you call after depositing the money, the quicker $130,000 will be placed into your account-and, remember, it is never the first prize; it is the third prizeas well as refunding the $3,900 you just transferred to them. Of course, no money will be received-indeed, the opposite: the scammers will have the money you transferred to them and, in some cases, your bank account details so that they can fleece your account. Unfortunately there are many, many scams doing the rounds at any given time, of which fellow colleagues here are no doubt aware and remind their constituents. It is a very serious issue. With technology the way it is now, it is getting harder and harder to pick these scams. I recommend that people, particularly those listening to this broadcast, regularly check out the SCAMwatch website, which has lots of information relating to scams and how to pick them and what to do if you are approached by scammers. As well as that, you can request to have scam alerts sent to you. If you go to www.scamwatch.gov.au you can actually become a subscriber to SCAMwatch-when you determine they are not a scam!-and they will keep you updated on the number of scams that are about. I rang and spoke to someone about Solaris, who advised that the Solaris scam is indeed circulating Australia at the moment, with variations of the business names used but always using the same types of scenarios. If you have not done so already, jump online and see what other scams are currently around. One which has started recently is a 'Centrelink' scam, where you are told that Centrelink owes you money and that, if you give your details, they will give it to you. When you look at the online material on these websites you see that some ordinary, with poor grammar and punctuation, while other material looks very professional. You have to be very careful. I know one constituent of mine who lost a lot of money. Beware: get onto the SCAMwatch website and take care. Boothby Electorate: Health",96
102,Dr SOUTHCOTT,ADJOURNMENT," I would like to speak about health in my electorate of Boothby, and there are a number of issues that I want to touch on. Blackwood Community Hospital has been providing healthcare services to the Hills community in my electorate since 1954. The hospital has been run on a not-for-profit basis. Unfortunately, it closed its emergency department in October 2010 and all other facilities, including its after-hours GP clinic, in December 2010. The closure of the Blackwood Community Hospital has only exacerbated the shortage of general practitioners and after-hours services in the area. The immediate area around this hospital-the suburbs of Belair, Glenalta, Blackwood, Flagstaff Hill, Craigburn Farm and Hawthorndene-is classified as a district of workforce shortage. It is an area which has less than the national average number of GPs. So there is a genuine need for additional primary care, GP and after-hours services in Blackwood and Belair and the surrounding suburbs. Recently the hospital site has been purchased by the international musculoskeletal research institute, operating as the Southern Adelaide Health Service. Any primary care services that the Southern Adelaide Health Service are able to revive on the Blackwood Community Hospital site will go some way to reducing the shortage of doctors in the area. Any after-hours services they are able to resume will also help take pressure off the already struggling public of it is quite hospitals in the area. As an example of the pressure that is on public hospitals in my electorate, the major public hospital in my electorate, Flinders Medical Centre, has recently had an issue of ramping. Ramping involves patients being kept waiting on the entry ramp to the hospital under the care of ambulance officers. It happens when there is a backlog within the emergency department that forces all emergency department beds to be filled, meaning that there are no available beds for incoming patients. Ramping also means that ambulances and ambulance officers are tied up outside the hospital and unable to attend to any other emergencies, as they cannot leave until the patient is handed over to the emergency department. Patients have had to wait up to three hours before being handed over to the emergency department by the ambulance officers. This problem has been going on for almost eight months. In one instance, every ambulance south of the CBD was banked up outside the Flinders Medical Centre waiting to offload patients. In April, a constituent of mine spent more than an hour and a half with a fractured hip waiting on the ramp. In all the recent public appearances, it has been very obvious that the public servants and the South Australian Minister for Health, the Hon. John Hill, have been in complete denial about the nature of the problem and what is going on in the emergency department in Flinders. It is clear that the public hospital system struggling in parts and it is clear that the private health system is required to take the pressure off our public hospital system. I have always believed that private health insurance plays a key role in keeping pressure off the public system. These two things, the closure of the Blackwood Hospital and the pressure on Flinders and its emergency department, highlight the importance of keeping private health insurance levels high. The Labor Party have always hated private health insurance. The Gillard government is intent on whittling back and undermining private health due to its continuing attack on the private health insurance rebate. Almost 96,000 residents in the electorate of Boothby are covered by some form of private health insurance. This represents 71 per cent of households. The Labor Party's decision to wind back the rebates, after they said they would not in 2007, is only going to put further pressure on public hospitals like Flinders, which are already struggling to cope. I look forward to the contribution that the Southern Adelaide Health Institute can make to primary care and to the health network and health system within my electorate and the inner southern suburbs of Adelaide. Workplace Relations",97
103,Mr CHAMPION,ADJOURNMENT," Earlier this evening, the member for Mayo referred to me as one of 'Don's children' and an SDA official, which indeed I was. I suppose metaphorically I may be one of 'Don's children', but I rise to speak about John's children-this Praetorian guard on the backbench, this bunch of young guns who have been talking about industrial relations reform. Although the opposition say that Work Choices is dead, the dream of extreme industrial relations laws lives on in the minds of those opposite, particularly those on the is backbench. We know that the Liberal Party front-bench are now militantly committed to pretending nothing at all happened with industrial relations under a Liberal government, but we know that the backbench is very keen on extreme industrial relations change. We see all these young Turks and we see there is a bit of tension between the front-bench and the backbench. The member for Mayo is out there constantly. I notice that the Business Spectator on 18 February this year called it the 'Briggs breakout' and said that he had kicked the sleeping dog of industrial relations. I am sure that sounded promising to the member for Mayo, but I do not think the Liberal Party front-bench would have appreciated it. In December 2010 the member for Mayo, in the Australian newspaper, said: There are benefits for all of us of further industrial relations reform. He also said: This is a debate we must have. This is a road that must be travelled. That is pretty serious stuff. We know that the member for Mayo was one of the architects in Mr Howard's office-one of the architects of Work Choices, one of the architects of taking away people's penalty rates, their job security and their conditions of employment. When he says 'deregulation' or 'a reform road' we know exactly what the member for Mayo has in mind. Most recently we have had the member for Kooyong talk about industrial relations reform. In one of the Fairfax papers there was the headline 'Coalition push for fair work reform' to an article by Michelle Grattan, a very good journalist in the press gallery. It talked about how the member for Kooyong wanted to stop industrial action and talk about changes to the industrial relations laws. The story did talk about the reluctance of the opposition leader, Tony Abbott, who was worried about the prospect of Labor successfully raising the spectre of Work Choices. So you can see there is a bit of tension between the backbench and the front-bench, between these young gunsJohn's children, if you like. We also had the member for Higgins criticising the Australian Building and Construction Commission for having an inquiry into sham contracts. She said there was so-called sham contracting in the industry. Never mind that there have been prosecutions in that area, even by the ABCC. There have been only five employer prosecutions, but nevertheless prosecutions. We have these young guns who are trying to get on the front-bench and we have a far more cautious front-bench. The reason we have a cautious front-bench is that they are terrified that the Australian people will cotton on to their strategy of benign security in opposition-they will not touch wages, they will not touch penalty rates, they have reform somehow learnt their lesson. Of course, we know that that is a strategy based on subterfuge. We know that when they get into office they will do something entirely different. We can see this in the state of New South Wales, where Barry O'Farrell did not put anything in his 100-day plan-his 100day a list of things he was going to do-and then turned on the working men and women of New South Wales the moment he obtained power. He passed laws butchering the International Relations Commission and restricting wages in the public sector. We know there is this tension between the backbench and the front-bench-a tension between honesty and courage from the backbench and complete subterfuge and deliberate misleading of the Australian people as to their intentions from the front-bench. There is no doubt that deep in the coalition heart is malice against organised Labor, against working men and women, and a deep desire to reform the industrial relations system. We all know what reform means. It means losing penalty rates, losing job security and losing your conditions, and every worker in this country should be aware of it. Online Gambling",98
104,Mr TUDGE,ADJOURNMENT," I would like to raise an issue that I have recently had brought to my attention that I believe needs to be addressed by the Northern Territory parliament or, if it fails to do so, then by this parliament. The issue relates to online gambling and specifically the ability of online gambling companies to provide credit to their customers for the purposes of betting. Providing credit is prohibited in most jurisdictions in Australia, but it is not in the Northern Territory, where most internet gambling companies are licensed. It should be prohibited in the Northern Territory also, as their laws in this area affect all Australian residents. The matter was brought to my attention through a tragic case involving a local constituent, who I will call 'H', and his mother, who I will refer to as 'B'. They came to see me in early March to see if I could assist them. H is a self-professed problem gambler and, according to his doctor, suffers from depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. Over the course of May 2010, H was offered $80,000 in credit by Sportsbet. According to H, he was initially given $5,000 in free bets and when he lost this he was given $10,000 in credit, which was followed by a further $30,000 and then a further $40,000. He was eventually unable to pay for the credit issued to him. Sportsbet consequently took H to the Magistrates Court to get an order for payment and then subsequently to the Federal Court to get a bankruptcy notice, which allows court appointed trustees to handle his affairs. H's and B's family home is now in jeopardy, and this is when they came to see me. It is clear that H is in the wrong from a legal perspective. He clearly has a gambling problem and there is no dispute that he took the credit and gambled it away. There is no indication that Sportsbet has broken the law. This episode, however, should not have occurred and I am determined to see that cases like this do not happen again. Sportsbet was only able to provide credit to H due to regulations in the NT which are more lenient than in other jurisdictions in Australia. All jurisdictions except the NT and ACT expressly prohibit extending credit to these customers or only allow it in exceptional circumstances. In Victoria, where H resides, it is prohibited. Sportsbet is headquartered in Melbourne but licensed in the NT. By being licensed there, it is covered by the Northern Territory laws, despite its online presence being Australia wide. Further, online gambling companies do not fall under the National Credit Code. This loophole in the Northern Territory law needs to be closed and I am determined to see this occur. Online gambling companies should be prohibited from extending credit to their customers or, at the very least, they should be covered by the National Credit Code. Online gambling companies providing credit is particularly egregious because they take no risk when they issue the credit. There is no cash on the line for the gambling companies, yet they can seize the gambler's assets when the gambler loses the money. This creates a massive moral hazard that should be regulated against. These companies are unlike any other credit provider. Providing credit for the express purpose of gambling is not something that we should be supporting in any case. As the Productivity Commission points out in its recent report, gambling with credit is primarily an activity undertaken by problem gamblers only. Lowrisk or moderate-risk gamblers very rarely use credit for gambling. The Productivity Commission goes as far as saying: … using credit to gamble differentiates well between recreational and problem gambling. Many in the gambling sector, including Clubs New South Wales, support a blanket prohibition on gambling companies providing credit, including internet gambling companies. I have written to the Northern Territory Chief Minister and asked him to change the NT laws. His laws affect all Australians, including my constituents. If he fails to change the laws then I will be seeking to get the Australian parliament to address the matter. There are a number of avenues that I will be considering: (a) putting the matter to the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform for their consideration; (b) seeking to incorporate internet gambling credit provision under the National Credit Code; and (c) seeking to override the Northern Territory laws and prohibit online gambling companies providing credit to their customers. In H's case, I have asked Sportsbet to show compassion to H and his mother, B. They do not deserve to lose their house over this. Sportsbet would have suffered very little cash loss. I know that addressing this loophole in the law as I have outlined will not stop problem gambling altogether, but it would make a difference and provide one additional layer of protection. Adelaide Dutch Festival",99
105,Mr ZAPPIA,ADJOURNMENT," Saturday, 30 April I attended the Adelaide Dutch Festival, held at the Dutch Club community centre at Greenfields. The festival was officially opened by the honorary consul of the Netherlands, Mr Willem Ouwens, and was attended by people from around the state. The Dutch community have had a long history in Australia. Dutch explorers were the first Europeans to set foot on Australian soil. The Dutch ship Duyfken, captained by Willem Janszoon, made landfall in Queensland in 1606. Throughout the 17th century, Dutch ships explored and charted the coastline of Australia. It is for this reason that for years the continent that became Australia was known to Europeans as New Holland. Many Australian places carry this history of Dutch exploration in their names, including Rottnest Island, the Tasman Sea and Tasmania, which was previously known as Van Diemen's Land after a Dutch governor of the East Indies. In my state of South Australia the west coast islands of St Francis and St Peter were named by 17th century Dutch explorers. These islands have the oldest European place names in South Australia. After South Australia was proclaimed in 1836, the Netherlands was one of the most active trading partners with the new British colony and Dutch ships were regular visitors to Robe and to Port Adelaide. The 19th century also saw Dutch settlers migrate to South Australia. The most prominent of these Dutch migrants was Guillaume Delprat, who was the general manager of BHP in the early 20th century, during which time he pioneered iron ore mining techniques and was involved in such iconic production sites as the Newcastle steelworks and the Port Pirie smelter. From these first few but significant early settlers Dutch migration to Australia increased significantly in the On 1950s. Today there are over 300,000 Australians of Dutch ancestry, including nearly 3,000 in my own electorate of Makin. There is also a strong relationship between the respective governments of Australia and the Netherlands, which share similar values and a similar global outlook. The two countries have strong trade bonds and have partnered together to address global issues such as human rights, war crimes, fair trade and the Millennium Development Goals. Regular meetings are held between the respective leaders and ministers. As recently as December 2010, Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd met with Dutch Prime Minister Rutte. many Representatives of the Dutch government have visited Australia on several occasions. Queen Beatrix visited Australia in 1988 as part of Australia's bicentennial celebrations. The Dutch Prime Minister and Crown Prince both attended Australia in 2006 as part of the celebrations marking 400 years since the first European landing on Australia by the Dutch ship Duyfken. As a shared project between the Dutch and Australian governments, a replica of the Duyfken was built and sailed from Australia to the Netherlands and back in 2006. This shared celebration of common history shows just what a strong relationship there is between the governments and the people of Australia and the Netherlands. I will briefly comment on the contribution of the Dutch community to my local area. The Dutch Social and Welfare Club-or the Dutch Club, as it is known-is located in the northern Adelaide suburb of Green Fields. It was one of the first community facilities established in the region and has provided an invaluable cultural centre for Adelaide's Dutch community. The club holds regular lunches and social events as well as a range of special events, including the annual Dutch festival, St Nicholas kinderfeest at Christmas and special remembrance services. The club also plays a valuable community service role, especially for groups that have unique needs, and works closely with the Netherlands Australian Aged Services Association and the Netherlands ExServicemen and Women's Association. It has been my privilege to attend many Dutch community events at the club over the years and I thank the Dutch community for their very warm hospitality on all of those occasions. I congratulate members of the Dutch Club for organising the Adelaide Dutch Festival and I particularly acknowledge the hard work of committee members: club president Gerrit de Vries, Kees Velzeboer, Peter den Hartog, Ernie Mullart, Jack Korver, Bob van der Hoeven, Marco Kuipers, Gary Rozenboom, Maurice MCLeod and Anouk Werkhoven. Dutch people have been a model example of resettlement in a new country and today can be found making their contribution in every aspect of Australian life. I count many of them as personal friends and tonight I pay tribute to their contribution to our nation. Calare Electorate Mr JOHN COBB (Calare) (22:09): When I first entered politics I was responsible for most of western New South Wales all the way out to Broken Hill and Cameron Corner. I never dreamt that I would one day represent the town in which I was born and in which my mother and grandparents were born and died-that is, Bathurst, which is way to the east. My electorate now goes all to the way to the Blue Mountains, including Lithgow and Oberon and out to Forbes and Parkes. This coming Friday the ex-Mayor of Bathurst, Ian MACIntosh, has graciously accepted the job of opening my new office in Bathurst, which will look after the eastern side of the electorate while the Orange office looks after the western side. Bathurst is quite an incredible place. It is the oldest inland town so registered in Australia. In 1862 it was made the headquarters of Cobb and Co. I have to say that Freeman Cobb is no relation. He was an American who came here, made a fortune, went back to America and lost it when he went home. Today Bathurst sits on the junction of the Great Western, Mid Western and Mitchell highways. It is the local government area in which the first mining, particularly gold mining, started in Australia. It is the part of Australia where, outside of the Sydney Basin, agriculture and mining really began, the oldest part of the serious side of Australian production. It has a lot going for it. Not only is it incredibly old in Australian European settlement terms but it has architecture not seen in many places. It is a very old town and it has Sofala, which is Australia's oldest surviving gold town. It has Hill End, which in 1872 had the world's largest specimen of reef gold, the Holtermann Nugget, weighing 285 kilograms and measuring 150 centimetres by 66 centimetres with an average thickness of 10 centimetres. That is one heck of reef. I have no idea what it would be worth today, but I suspect we could all retire on it. That town grew to 8,000 people, making it one of New South Wales's largest inland towns at that time, with a kilometre of shops, five banks, two newspapers, a brewery and 27 hotels. I regret to say only one of those is left, the Royal Hotel. I have been a client there again. The office in Bathurst will also look after Lithgow. Lithgow is, apart from being the home ofDr Southcott: Marjorie Jackson Mr JOHN COBB: That too-the Lithgow Flash. It is also the home of a small arms factory which made rifles over two world wars. It actually still exists and still produces certain things for the defence forces. It was the site of the first steel manufactured in Australia. The first smelting works were there because it had coal. They had to bring the iron ore there, but they had everything else. In fact, one of the more interesting things about Lithgow which very few people realise is that meat refrigeration was established there by Thomas Mort in 1875. The first Australian chilled meat from Lithgow arrived in England in 1880. The Bathurst office will also look after Oberon. Oberon is one of the centres of the New South Wales timber industry. Early pioneers knew Oberon as Bullock Flat. Permanent settlement occurred as early as 1839, but in 1863 the name was changed to Oberon. (Time expired) Mackie, Professor Jamie",101
106,Dr LEIGH,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to pay tribute to Professor Jamie Mackie, who passed away on 21 April, aged 86. Jamie was a key player in the deepening of Australia's engagement with South-East Asia and the campaign to dismantle the White Australia policy. Jamie's first exposure to South-East Asia came as a 19-year-old gunner on HMAS Warramunga. He was part of General Douglas Macarthur's amphibious landings against Japanese positions. Visiting Manila, he was struck by its heritage, 'a history that almost none of us in Australia then knew anything about'. This spurred a lifelong and I will be interest in the region. He knew interesting people. At Geelong Grammar, his history master was Manning Clark. At Oxford, Jamie got to know Rupert Murdoch, who was then secretary of the Oxford University Labour club. Jamie quipped that perhaps history might have been changed had Murdoch taken up Jamie's offer to go and see Citizen Kane together. In the 1950s, Jamie volunteered to go to Indonesia as part of the new volunteer graduate scheme launched by Herb Feith. He worked in the State Planning Bureau in Jakarta, and lectured in economic history at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta. These lectures eventually became his first book, to be followed by a spate of articles about the political economy of Indonesia and Australia's foreign policies. His group at Monash University's Centre of Southeast Asian Studies earned the title of 'a second Cornell', in recognition of its concern for human rights in Indonesia. Jamie's engagement with Indonesia naturally brought him into an active role in campaigning against the White Australia policy. With Ken Rivett, he wrote an influential 1959 pamphlet, Immigration: Control or Colour Bar?, arguing that the policy was not just morally wrong but also against Australia's national interest. In his obituary of Jamie, David Jenkins noted that the values in this argument underpinned much of the modern multicultural Australia we value today. But articulate pamphlets were not enough. My father, Michael Leigh, a close friend of Jamie's, says that one of the turning points for him came with the Sharpeville massacre in 1960. After the brutal killing of 69 civilians, including 10 children, the Labor opposition called on the Menzies government to pass a censure motion against the South African government. Menzies refused. My father told me that this was the moment that people like he and Jamie decided that a street demonstration would be necessary to express horror at this brutal manifestation of the consequences of racial exclusivity and of the Prime Minister's refusal to join international condemnation. Victoria Police refused permission for their march and warned that they should not proceed outside the boundaries of Melbourne University. Yet proceed they did, with police lining both sides of the road. Australia is a better country for the courage of these marchers. I had known Jamie since I was a child, and enjoyed the way he would often drop into my ANU office unexpectedly to share an idea or an anecdote. After more than a decade as a professor in the ANU Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, and as co-founder of the annual Indonesia Update conference, Jamie clearly delighted in strolling the halls of the labyrinthine Coombs Building. He would buttonhole me about economic policy, the treatment of refugees or Australian foreign policy. Jamie would hold forth at length until-like the junior academic I was-I would eventually explain that I had to get back and do some research. He always left me with a new idea and, looking back, I wish I had asked a few more questions and been a little less precious with my time. ANU professor Tony Reid wrote: Jamie Mackie epitomized the best in the reformist enthusiasm of post-war Australia to open out to its region. For him as for many of that generation, Indonesia pre-eminently represented the Australian 'other', the Asia with which Australia had to come to terms. Because he was himself very much an Australian of that era-warm, open, maverick, visionary, irreverent, unpretentious-he understood better than most how exciting and challenging, but painfully difficult, a prospect it was to get that relationship right. He played his part like no other, and it will be impossible to think of the development of that relationship without him. One of the great Indonesian poets is Chairil Anwar, who passed away in 1949, aged just 26. Aku, perhaps his most famous poem, ends with the line: 'Aku mau hidup seribu tahun lagi.' Which translates as: 'I want to live for another thousand years.' Chairil Anwar did not. Jamie Mackie did not. But their influence might. Thursday Island: Tuberculosis Clinics",103
107,Mr LAMING,ADJOURNMENT," Three of the great killers around the worldendemic TB, malaria and HIV-come no closer to Australia's continent than the Torres Strait. TB, with a prevalence of around two per cent, afflicts tens of thousands of Papua New Guinea nationals. Torres Strait Island residents who live in these beautiful northern islands require world-class health facilities to maintain adequate biosurveillance. So it is with great alarm that, over the last six months, that community has seen the bickering between state and federal Labor over who will fund the continued TB screening on those islands. Looking after PNG nationals is a very important role for AusAID, but nothing is more important for an Australian government than to look after Australian citizens-and Torres Strait Islanders are just that. We would like to see a federal government that acknowledges its important role in treating tuberculosis and monitoring the Torres Strait Islands, which is marked by up to 50,000 border crossings each year, for the arrival of this disease from Papua New Guinea-particularly for drug resistant TB, which is incredibly hard to treat and monitor. We have seen correspondence emanating from the Queensland government, which is greatly concerned that it can no longer afford to provide these TB services in Boigu and Saibai. We have seen a response from the Prime Minister which effectively refers to some project assistance, which is of course code for AusAID and its underspent budget, to bail out Queensland Health and the federal government's own health responsibilities in the Torres Strait. The decision last Friday, when the Queensland and federal agencies met and decided to move the Thursday Island clinics into Papua New Guinea, came as a shock. It all seems reasonable on the surface, except that the obvious will now occur: extremely sick PNG nationals will no longer be evacuated to receive better levels of care. More importantly, the biosurveillance that we have always counted on in the Torres Strait Islands will disappear entirely. To expect Thursday Island and its committed clinicians to keep an eye on infectious TB, particularly partially or fully drug resistant TB, is simply impossible. There is a hierarchy of policy approaches: we must first look after Australian citizens. We must make that pledge from both sides of the chamber in this place. At a second level we must also do everything we can to help Papua New Guinea and, while we do not mind extra money being deployed, it is utterly ridiculous to have transitional meetings about screening for tuberculosis when you have actually shut down all of the clinics and then talk about restarting those clinics in October, when they finally roll out to Daru in Western Province. It is unacceptable to ignore people with tuberculosis but say, 'We are currently recruiting a TB doctor for Papa New Guinea; we are currently looking for a TB vessel to travel down the coast and treat.' It is ridiculous not to even have a TB coordinator in place. Incredible as it is, AusAID is months away from delivering these services on the PNG mainland. So it makes the decision doubly abhorrent that this federal government and the Department of Health and Ageing would fail, in the interim, to continue these TB clinics. All local clinicians ask for-and most of them have been gagged by their government-is a chance to hand over these patients who are already partially treated. It is ridiculous that, up until last Wednesday, patients could travel those three kilometres by sea to Boigu and Saibai and receive treatment but there are no plans to continue the care of those 50 PNG citizens. Worse still, people are crossing every day of every week, of every year, from Papua New Guinea and we no longer have these TB clinicians, these specialists, who are able to prescribe secondary treatments and tertiary evacuations where required. They are no longer going to be deployed in the Torres Strait Islands at all. To simply think that you can move Australian doctors to Daru, in Papua New Guinea, where they are neither registered nor accredited and expect them to work in conditions like those in Daru in providing support when, the moment those clinicians leave, these patients will of course be left with what is there at the moment. That is, with very few ways of recovering patients and very few ways of continuing care. There is one very important thing to remember about TB and that is that partially treated TB is more dangerous than nontreated TB. The reality is that, once patients become resistant to certain treatments, not only are they almost impossible to treat with the most advanced modern-day treatments but they are also infectious and lead to other people falling ill with the same extremely hard to treat varieties. To expect that treatments like Amykacin, prothionamide and Pasa will be available continuously in Papua New Guinea is simply beyond belief. We will never, in the next generation at least, see the eradication of TB in PNG. More will always need to be done. But let us remember one thing: we must put Australian citizens first. TI residents are Australian citizens and, above all, they deserve not the penny-pinching and the nickel and diming of federal health, but care, coverage and biosurveillance for tuberculosis. Page Electorate",104
108,Ms SAFFIN,ADJOURNMENT," I want to do a regional round-up of the good things that have been happening in my seat of Page over the last months, but particularly over the last few weeks. Two Sundays ago I was privileged to attend a luncheon at the Quota International Conference. The international president, Gwenn Jackson, was present. She is from the United States. It was held at the RSL in Ballina. There was a handover to the international president elect, Chris TraceyPatte, who is from Beaudesert. So it was being handed over from someone from the US to an Aussie. That was a really nice happening. The topic was 'The Strength of Women' and three women spoke from three different generations: one who had been a boat person from Vietnam, who is now a very successful dentist in Kyogle; a high school student; and also someone who was representative of the war period. They talked about the strength of women, women in the community and women giving service to their community and families. It was a really nice luncheon to be at. Last weekend was the Primex event . It is a national event, which is held in Casino. It is a three-day exhibition, held annually in June. It always follows the Queen's Birthday long weekend. It is one of the prime events. There are 12 exhibitions in one. It covers a motor show, trucks and machinery and the Pacific beef trade. It followed the successful Beef Week in Casino, which was one of the most successful to date in nearly 30 years of having Beef Week. Also, the senior reporter of our local paper, The Northern Star, confessed to being a former city slicker and a convert to country areas. It was his first Primex event and he is sold on it. He said: The Northern Rivers is fast becoming a significant food bowl for the nation, producing such diverse crops as macadamias, soy beans, coffee and blueberries. He talked about the importance of our primary industries. Director Bruce Wright, of the Wright family, who, amongst other things, hosted and organised this premier event, said: … our primary industries are once again expanding into new areas to support the region's next stage of economic growth. On Saturday night I attended the Surf Life Saving Far North Coast Branch Inc. Awards of Excellence. That particular branch covers 10 branches and those branches also cover some of the areas in the area of my colleague the member for Richmond. So some of those people were present as well. It was a lovely evening in Ballina where there are a whole lot of life members. Some people have also got life membership. Some of the younger ones, including Alyce Bennett and Hugh Doherty who compete in ironman events and are stars themselves are also locals and they were there to talk and help. It was run and MC-ed by two of the young lifesavers and Wilson Cregan, who is the president. He keeps trying to retire, but they will not let him go because he does such a good job. He is still there. It was a successful night. I give credit to Debbie Pawsey, Director of Administration, for all the wonderful work she does. I would also like to pay tribute to John Adams, who was in the Queen's Birthday honours list, getting an Order of Australia Medal. He joins his wife, Shirley, who received her OAM in 1989. They are a formidable, wonderful couple who live in Grafton, in the Clarence Valley. They have done amazing things in the community-a lifetime of service. I wrote to John and, among other things, I said: I am thrilled that your marvellous volunteer work at the Alumny Creek Public School Museum and on other significant community projects has been nationally recognised. John and his wife, Shirley, are a partnership in community service. Just ending the regional round-up, I will turn my mind to an international happening, well worthy of mention and support of all members in this chamber. Mr Speaker, you might have seen that women in Saudi Arabia are saying that they want to get their drivers licence. They took to the streets. I was reading in the paper, and it said it was 1990 when they first demonstrated. I thought, 'Goodness, that long ago!' but I remembered it well. It seemed like only yesterday. They took to the streets again the other day, and I say, 'Well done, and we stand with you.' Question agreed to. House adjourned at 22:29 NA The following notice(s) were given:",106

Generally, in policy responses to climate therefore accepts the responsibility to reduce public policy measure is the most desirable public policy measures that have the objective public policy objectives such as, for example, industry within our economy. However, when to climate change and of the need to reduce in the most cost-efficient manner. That is market mechanism-whether it be through an the way of putting a price signal in our economy least cost. The Productivity Commission considered these and in the economies of our major trading Productivity Commission, unsurprisingly I think that the least cost way of reducing pollution trading scheme. That is why the government last 10 months and beyond and in the previous rationalised a number of the climate change went back to the Howard government period panels on domestic rooftops. If the sole purpose pollution, they are not necessarily the least government, particularly over the last 10 months have been looking at these programs, rationalising the principal policy response that is necessary. If the member for Indi is seriously concerned public policy response is through reducing pollution, accept the fact that a market mechanism is economy. The Productivity Commission report effective cost of the abatement measures electricity system-whether they are state feed-in various technologies or changes-is in the range Minister, given the government has now program, was the coalition not correct all than an ill-conceived idea?

I make that clear at the change, when one respects the science and carbon pollution, we have to look at which from the standpoint of economic efficiency. Some of reducing pollution may also have other supporting the development of the solar you are looking at the principal policy response our carbon pollution we need to go about doing it why the government has argued strongly for a emissions trading scheme or a carbon tax-as to achieve the emissions reductions at the issues in general in the Australian economy partners in a recently published report. The for those familiar with these issues, found is through a market mechanism like an emissions have been arguing on this basis. Also, over the term of parliament as well, we have programs and initiatives-for example, one that in the form of subsidies and support for solar of these sorts of programs is to abate carbon cost means of achieving the outcome. The while I have been in the role as minister, them where appropriate and focusing on about these matters and the most efficient I am sure that she would recognise and the best way of reducing carbon pollution in the that I referred to in fact found that the currently in place in our economy within our tariffs or other programs of support for of, I think, $44 to $98 per tonne of carbon NA abated. It also found that across the economy, we would have achieved the same levels of cost of $9 a tonne. These are material matters our policy response to climate change that abatement at the least cost to our economy, and to households and the least cost to businesses. In my role as minister, I certainly have approaches from the standpoint of using the nonsense that forms the subsidies-for-polluters response to climate change. It is going to cost government subsidies for polluters to achieve subsidies-for-polluters program will be funded on average. No rational economic analysis could policy response to this issue, and unless and some basic economic principles in relation to the best way of proceeding-they have no credibility",126
