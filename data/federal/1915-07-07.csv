1,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I ask the General whether contracts with prevent any of the Broken Hill companies from selling any of their lead, zinc, or concentrates to British or American buyers if they desire to do so 1",4
2,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I cannot answer the question by merely saying "" Yes "" or "" No . "" The contracts-if I may apply that term to them-whic h existed before the war, would, were they still in force, prevent the sale of the products of the Broken Hill mines to the British Government, or to British manufacturers, and, if the Enemy Contracts Annulment Act , which was passed by this Legislature, had nob annulled them, would still do so. But in my opinion, the Act is a valid exercise of our legislative authority, and is effective for the purpose for which it was intended. Some of the companies, however, assume that the measure is invalid, and, in consequence, concentrates and metallic products are not being sold to the British Government or to British buyers as freely as, I think , they ought to be sold to them.

SUGAR INDUSTR Y.",4
3,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,Is the Attorney T General yet in a position to make a statement in regard to the sugar industry generally 1 Will the honourable gentleman tell us what is the position of the canegrowers of New South Wales under any arrangement which the Commonwealth Government have made either with the Queensland Government or with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company 1,4
4,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have not had an opportunity of preparing a statement, but, by leave of the House, I shall shortly reply to the honourable member's question. This Government have come to an arrangement with - the Government of Queensland under which the latter have acquired the whole sugar crop of 1915 upon varying terms which average £ 1 8 . per ton for raw sugar, 94 per cent; net PAPERS - tifcrs - This Government will, take over that sugar, and have made arrangements with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company for refining and distributing it . We have como to an agreement with the Governments of Now South Wales and Victoria-and I have no doubt that the Governments of the other States will cooperate with us, although we have not yet received replies to our communications to them-whereb y we shall be able to retail sugar throughout Australia at a maximum price of 3d. per l b . The discount now generally allowed to wholesalers will be extended to manufacturers, but no other discount. We have also taken over from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company the sugar which it is i m porting from Java-bot h that whioh has arrived and that which is to arrive--upo n terms that are satisfactory to us, and, shortly, are these: We pay t i e net cost to' the Company of bringing the sugar to Australia, and from the 19th July, or thereabouts, we shall put that sugar on the market. It is estimated that by the time that sugar has been consumed the new season's crop will be available. I am not able to speak in detail of the arrangements between the Queensland Government, the millers, and the cane-growers, but I have been given to understand that they are quite satisfactory. In regard to the remission of duty on imported sugar, the Government were faced with many difficulties. The quantity now to be imported is 14,200 tons; but, with the further shortage which is certain to arise about the end of February or the beginning of' March, probably 80,000 to 120,000 tons more will be needed. It is impossible to speak with greater accuracy of this shortage, because neither the exact quantity of the present crop nor the date on which the new crop will begin to be available are known. It is clear that if the 1916 season is early the period of shortage will be abridged, and the importations will be less than they must be should the season be late. The Government were, therefore, confronted with the difficulty of remitting duty on, not 14,200 tons, but probably 130,000 tons. Considering all the circumstances, we decided that the welfare of the community, and of those engaged in the sugar industry in Queensland, whose interests as much as those of any other section must be considered, would be best served by spreading the duty on the 14,200 tons over the whole quantity of sugar that we have acquired, namely, 14,200 tons of imported sugar and 120,000 tons of Queensland sugar. That will make the duty about 12s. per ton spread over the whole crop. » The terms upon which we haye acquired the sugar, and the cost of refining, distributing, and placing it on the market w i ll enable the Government to sell it to the community at 3d. per l b . As the Government have no power to fix prices it was necessary to secure the cooperation of the various State Governments, and consequently I saw the At torney-General of New South Wales, and Mr Hagelthorn, and the Premier of Victoria, and they have agreed to cooperate with us, and fix the wholesale price of sugar at such an amount as will enable this to be done. No sugar will be sold except upon the condition that it is retailed at the maximum price of 3d. per l b . , and it will be sold in [169]- 2 Brisbane at the same price at which it is sold in Perth, namely, 3d. per l b . The position in regard to the New South Wales crop is different. The Commonwealth Government have not taken it over, and no arrangements have been made to do so, but I am authorized to say that it is the wish of the New South Wales Government to take it over if the growers of New South Wales so desire. In that .case the Commonwealth Government will extend to raw sugar so produced in New South Wales the same treatment as that given to raw sugar produced in Queensland, and it will be retailed at the same price, and treated in exactly the same way. NA MANAGEMENT.",4
5,Mr ORCHARD,LIVERPOOLCA MP,"In view of the non-fulfilment of the promise of the Assistant Minister of Defence to accompany me to the Liverpool Camp at the last week end, and seeing that some statements have appeared in the press casting doubts upon my representations in regard to the condition of affairs prevailing there, I ask the Assistant Minister whether he is prepared to make *a statement to the House, setting forth the results of any inquiries he may have made?",5
6,Mr JENSEN,LIVERPOOLCA MP,"I shall be delighted Co do so. I ask leave to mak,e a statement. Leave granted.",5
7,Mr JENSEN,LIVERPOOLCA MP,"In regard to the statement made just now by the honourable member, I may say that I said distinctly that I could not accompany him at the last week end, but that I would endeavour to do so at this week end.",5
8,Mr ORCHARD,LIVERPOOLCA MP,That was said after the House adjourned.,5
9,Mr JENSEN,LIVERPOOLCA MP,"But I also said when I was speaking in the House that I did not think that I could accompany the honourable member that week, but would do so at the first opportunity. I have a report from the Quartermaster-General, Colonel Stanley, who has visited Liverpool Camp, a report from the Vice President of the Executive Council, Senator Gardiner,, and a letter sent to Senator Pearce by a mother of a recruit who was in Liverpool Camp for three months, and has since gone to the war. Colonel Stanley's report upon the allegations made here last Thursday by the honourable members is as follows: 1. A series of careful inspections during Thursday, Friday, and Saturday of last week has made it clearly manifest that the statements concerning unsatisfactory conditions alleged to obtain at Liverpool Camp are wholly and entirely unsustained, with the exception that a number of newly-joined men have not been served out with greatcoats as ordered by H ead-quarters. 2. It should, however, be explained that the troops are not exercised during wet weather, and that all men detailed for any military duty, such as guards, piquets, police, &c, are supplied with serviceable greatcoats whilst tlius employed. 3. Eeeruits are not supplied with actual military uniforms until they are attached to units, but have two issues of dungaree suits and warm underclothing, also a cardigan jacket. The only occasion when a greatcoat becomes really necessaiy to recruits is when visiting their friends in the evenings, and on these occasions men wear their own private clothes. B y far the greater majority come into camp with overcoats; those who do not are only in the same position as they were before joining the forces. However, the Department, with almost an undue solicitude for the welfare and comfort of the soldier, has sanctioned the issue of a greatcoat to all men immediately on joining, and these garments should certainly have been provided as directed by Head-quarters. This matter is now the subject of separate* correspondence. 4. The huts are well and f a it h full y structed; and though full provision for ventilation is provided, it depends on the occupants as to whether pure air is admitted into the habitation in volumes, or they choose to exist in a practically hermetically-sealed atmosphere. 5. Medical arrangements I found, after careful inspection, to be very complete and entirely satisfactory. Accommodation is provided for the more serious cases in two cottage hospitals, wherein patients receive treatment such as could not bo bettered in any institution in the city. The general medical conditions were as good, if not better, than any I have seen in the Commonwealth, India, or Great Britain . 0. The statements that greatcoats used by convalescent patients have been issued to troops for service purposes is emphatically denied by the camp authorities. 7. Bations - The ration scale is full and ample, the meat, bread, and provisions generally being of first-class quality. The cooking is good and satisfactory, and the system of issue of meals to troops is expeditious and orderly. 8. Bifles in sufficient number for training purposes are on issue to the Camp Commandant. That Lithgow rifles are defective is incorrect. Minor disabilities, such as can be readily remedied, will be found in small arms of every pattern. (Signed) J. STANLEY, Air. Jensen. This is the report of the Vice - President of the Executive Council , Senator Gardiner: On reading the report of Mr Orchard's speech in the Sydney morning papers, I immediately set out for the Liverpool encampment. On arrival at Liverpool, I wired to Senator Pearce, Minister of Defence, that I was going to have a look round, to see for myself the conditions. Going into camp, I reported to the Camp Commandant (Lt - Colonel Kirkland) that I liad read Mr Orchard's charges, and wanted to see for myself what the conditions were like.",5
10,Mr ORCHARD,LIVERPOOLCA MP,Why did he not go to the men?,6
11,Mr JENSEN,LIVERPOOLCA MP,"The report continuesI then strolled through the lines, talking to groups of men here and there",6
12,Mr ORCHARD,LIVERPOOLCA MP,W it h the State Commandant.,6
13,Mr JENSEN,LIVERPOOLCA MP,"The honourable member has asked for a statement. Is it distasteful to him ? Senator G a r d in e r 's report continuesI then strolled through the lines, talking to groups of men here and there, and, as the midday meal was being served, I had the opportunity of observing both the quantity and quality of the food supplied. It was well cooked, of first-class quality, and comprised conroast beef, baked onions, boiled potatoes, bread, and tea. Later I visited the kitchen, where the cooks were preparing a warm evening meal for the men, who were having a field day. That meal consisted of beef, vegetables in ample quantity, potatoes, onions, and carrots. AB there was an abundant supply of good, wholesome, clean food, I was satisfied there was no room for complaint on that score. Clothing - * Immediately upon arrival at camp, the recruits are ""given two suits of warm woollen underclothing, and dungarees for the rough camp life wliile going through squad d r ill. When they are - passed into a company, uniforms are supplied, and, although all are not yet supplied with greatcoats, it is a mistake to think that there are only a few in camp. Upon inquiry, I learned that every man engaged on night duty is supplied with a greatcoat. Buts and Bedding. The huts are Large and roomy, and being new, are quite clean. The floors aro tongued and grooved boards. The framing is oregon, the walls and roofs are corrugated galvanized iron. The ventilation is an air space between the top plate of the wall and the roof, which, extending over the walls in bungalow fashion, keeps out the rain. Three blankets and waterproof sheets are served out to each man on arrival, and in many cases straw has been supplied. On inquiry, I was informed that the reason why Q.M.G. all had not been supplied with straw was due to the fact that straw was almost unobtainable; owing to the high price of fodder there was little straw on the market - O The Medical Officer and the Hospital. I had not the pleasure of meeting Dr Schlink, but I heard expressions of regret on every hand that unfounded and unwarranted charges should have been made against him in Parliament. He holds a very distinguished position in his profession, and among his many friends he is spoken of most highly. It is impossible to understand why an attack should have been made on the hospital management and the treatment of the sick at camp. While there are the regular early morning and afternoon parades of the sick, any serious or urgent case is attended to at any hour. I saw a man carried on a stretcher to the hospital at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and he received prompt attention. In cases where a patient is seriously ill , he is sent in the ambulance to one of the Sydney hospitals; that is, if he can be removed with safety; if not, he is put in one of the two cottage hospitals at the camp, where there is a matron and nursing staff. The less serious cases are sent to the hospital tent; the beds, bedding, &c., are iust what one expects to find in a modern, well-equipped hospital. I was informed that the instructions of Colonel Wallack, Commandant of New South Wales, were that no expense was to be spared where the sick were concerned. I spoke to quite a number of the hospital inmates, inquired closely about their treatment, and did not hear one single complaint. In conclusion, I would point out that I have been through seven militar y camps; the knowledge gained there made it easy to make my inquiry without assistance, and, although I questioned group after group of men, I heard no serious complaint. To my oft-rcpeated question, "" An y complaints?"" the most general complaint seemed to be that it was a hardship to ask the men who had given up good positions,-where they were earning good money, to serve the country, and give, if necessary, their lives in that service, to ask them to pay their railway fares when visiting their homes. "" Cheap fare or free pass "" .is the most oftrepcated complaint uttered, and therefore I concluded there was little room for complaint, and wired the Minister accordingly. 7th July, 1915. I may mention that Senator Gardiner refused to have any officer accompany him about the camp.  identity ?",6
14,Mr JENSEN,LIVERPOOLCA MP,"They did not. The officer in charge of the camp offered to accompany Senator Gardiner, but the offer was refused. I desire now to read a letter sent to Senator Pearce by the mother of one of the soldiers whohas gone to the frontFennell's Bay, Toronto. 1 2nd July, 1915. SIR, I read, with much surprise, of Mr Orchard's allegations with regard to the treatment of soldiers at Liverpool Camp. My son, Private Ernest Watkins, A Company, 17th Battalion, was at Liverpool Camp for four months prior to his departure on 12th May for the front. On his visits home and to my relatives, who visited him, ho spoke highly of the way men were treated at the camp. They were well fed, well treated, and had little to complain of. He made no complaints. The tents were rather crowded, but he knew this was unavoidable, and even it was improving. They had no beds, but plenty of blankets, which were, he considered, sufficient. My son was dangerously ill in hospital for about a fortnight while at Liverpool, and was most grateful for the care and attention he received from the doctors and nurses. He had a comfortable bed, and everything was satisfactory in every way. My father was a soldier, Quartermaster-Sergeant Groves, of the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Buffs. He served in the Zulu War, and gained medals. I was with him as a child, and I know a little of war's horrors, also of soldier's life in barracks, so I can write from knowledge of both, and my son and his mates, I believe, told mo the trut h about life at camp. You can use this letter as evidence if necessary. Trusting I have not taken too much of your valuable time, I have the honour to he, sir, Your most obedient servant, LUCY M . WATKIN S. Assistant, Cardiff Public School. . I think I have given a sufficient reply to the allegations of the honourable member for Nepean.",7
15,Mr FISHEE,LIVERPOOLCA MP,"I desire to announce that in response to the challenge issued when the statement was made by the h o n orable member for Nepean, the At to r n e y General has asked the Chief Justice to a p p o in t a Justice of the High Court to in q u i r e in to this matter .

75,Mr JOHN THOMSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"The Government cannot regard the criticism as contemptible, seeing that Ministers have thought f it to have a Royal Commission appointed to make inquiries concerning the various matters which have been referred to ",12
76,Mr FLEMING,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,We object to our remarks being termed contemptible.,12
77,Mr FINLAYSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"I ara glad that the cap fits. In yesterday's Argus there is a report of a speech made by the honourable member for Balaclava, to which I regret to have to refer in his absence, though it is not my f a u lt that he is not here. Speaking about the action of the Government in bringing forward its referenda proposals, the honourable member is reported to have saidNo one could possibly fight two great fights at once, and any one who sought to take an ounce of attention from the great struggle for the safety of the Empire was a traitor to his country. The honourable member was not entitled to say that publicly, and, indeed, had no justification for saying it at all , his statement being, to my mind, extravagant LIVERPOOL and contemptible, and of a kind of which we are hearing too many these days. A PUR- member of the Opposition who, at a political meeting, charges Labour members with being traitors to their country because they choose to bring forward certain business which they refuse to regard as party business is unfit to mix in decent society. The honourable member for Balaclava stands condemned by his own words, because, in the same speech,, he said thatHe had not been talking politics in Parliament lately. He did not intend to, for two reasons. Firstly, because he did not see how a man could immerse himself in ordinary party strife at the present time. The honourable member made that statement when addressing a party political meeting, a meeting of the Australian Women's National League. A member of this House addresses a party meeting and tells those present that he declines to talk in Parliament because he refuses to immerse himself in party strife! The impertinence of the statement! He goes to a meeting of a political league which supports his own side in politics to say that the men who are opposed to him are traitors to their country! His speech proves him to be a man who is absolutely unreliable, and who is not responsible for what he may say in public. I - am sorry that the honourable member is not here, so that I might throw back his statement in his teeth. We, on this side, are not traitors to our country; quite the contrary. We are in favour of the referenda proposals, which we decline to discuss as party questions, because this country needs saving from other than European enemies, and because the enemy within the gates is of more danger than the enemy without.  able member's opinion? It is a good job for him that he has not to face the Germans in the trenches.",12
78,Mr FINLAYSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"We have to face their compatriots here. If honourable members continue to make statements like that of the honourable member for Balaclava, I shall not sit silent under them. Had the honourable member been present today, I should have had still stronger things to say of him. At the meeting at which his statements were made, it was said by an ex-member of this House that if the Mmister of Defence had had a son at the front a second shift would have been installed at the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow long ago. A more despicable statement was never uttered in public. Honourable members opposite ought to be ashamed that at their party meetings statements like that are allowed to go unchallenged. Such statements are not likely to bring about the cessation of party warfare, and I am going to fight attacks of that kind whatever the quarter from which they may come. I may have something more to say about this matter later, when the honourable member for Balaclava is present. Last Thursday I put a question to the Assistant Minister of Defence regarding the rejection of volunteers. On the 29th June, Dr. J. R. Lee, speaking at a meeting held in the Malvern Town Hall, said that there is too much red-tape about the system of examining volunteers, the rejections, according to the newspaper reports, being 50 per cent, of the men volunteering. Dr. J. Leon Jones said that to his own personal knowledge fine, able-bodied men, who would be a credit to any country, had been rejected, and weeds had been accepted. According to the press reports, in Victoria, on Thursday last, 297 men volunteered for service, and of these 124 were rejected as medically unfit. On the 2nd July, the volunteers numbered 263, and the rejections 97. On the 3rd July the volunteers were 411, and the rejections 173. On Monday last, 1,129 men voluntered, and 316 were rejected; and yesterday 1,949 applied for enlistment, and 977, or nearly half, were rejected. In June 5,564 men volunteered in Victoria, and only 3,381 were accepted. The magnificent response of the men of Victoria to the call now being made is most creditable to the State; but the position is seen to be serious when it is remembered that about 40 per cent, of those who offer are rejected as unfit. Is the manhrvod of Australia-becaus e the results obtained in Victoria are an indication of the position in the other States-becomin g unfit for military service ? It is the best men who are offering now. The best men always offer first. From volunteering you get better results than are obtained by conscription, and it is a sad state of affairs if the manhood of Australia is degenerating so greatly, from a military stand-point, as it would appear to be if these figures can be taken as a correct guide. What makes the position worse is that since the 2nd July the Defence Department has reduced the standard of heifrht, the standard of measurement, the requirements in regard to teeth, and the requirements in regard to other physical Qualifications, and that, nevertheless, the percentage of rejections increases. In Great Britain the experience has been the same. During the Boer War a p'osition of affairs such as that to which I am now alluding was made plain in Great Britain. Thousands offered for service, of whom an immense number were rejected. The Inspector General of Recruiting, Sir Frederick Maurice, reporting on the subject, made some rather startling statements. He said that there was an alarming proportion of the young men of the country unfit for military service on account of defective physique, and added that at the end of two years more than 40 per eent. of the .men - wishing to become soldiers would not be found serving; or, in other words, that 60 per cent, of the men offering were physically unfit to serve as soldiers. have here a table showing the reasons for which men are rejected. It compares the rejections obtained in 1891 with those obtained in 1902, as follows:Under cliest ineiisurement per 1,000 ... ... ... 03.03 Defective vision 40.35 Under weight 32.47 Under height 26.76 . 11.59 Imperfect constitution and debility 18.40 Disease of veins 16.39 Disease of heart 16.00 Defects of lower extremities 15.57 Varicocele 12.93 Flat feet 11.04 Loss or decay of teeth ... 10.88 The Director-General of the British Army Medical Service, who was asked to report on that matter, somewhat questioned the figures of Sir Frederick Maurice, but the. latter pointed out that, although the military medical statistics showed that the rejections were only thirty-seven per 1,000, a large number of men failed to pass the recruiting sergeant and did not come under medical inspection; and that there was also a large percentage of men who, knowing their inability to pass the test, did not offer themselves. On these grounds, it was considered that the estimate of Sir Frederick Maurice, that 60 per cent, of the manhood of the British Isles were incapable of rendering military service, was well within the mark; and the position was regarded as so serious that K in g Edward appointed a Royal Commission, which undertook a very full and complete examination of the position. It dealt with such things as infantile mortality, hereditary taint, employment of mothers late in pregnancy and too soon after childbirth, decrease in breast feeding, defective milk supply, parental ignorance and neglect, school system, risks of contamination during adolescence, syphilis, insanity, eyes and ears, teeth, and so on. I do not wish to go into all these matters. I merely n6w refer to the question of teeth, to which the honourable member for Richmond has rightly drawn attention. On page 8 of the report of the Commission, in paragraph 44, in reply to the questionWhether, in his experience as an anatomist, he had noted any changes in structure unfavorable to development? Mr Finlayson. Professor Cunningham saidNo, with the one exception of the teeth. It is an obvious fact that the teeth of the I people of the present time cannot stand comparison, in point of durability, with those of the earlier inhabitants of Britain. Those who have the opportunity of examining ancient skulls cannot fail to be struck with this. . . . In the white races of Europe the jaws are undergoing a slow process of shortening. The 1801. 1902. stunted character of the wisdom or backmost teeth, the small amount of space allotted to 56.72 them, their variability, their late appearance* 39.23 and, indeed, their frequent failure to appear 21.72 at all, bespeak this change in the jaws. Through it the teeth are reduced in size, more crowded together, and, therefore, more liable 3.91 to disease. Indirectly this may tend to 12.30 favour the early degeneration of the teeth 17.33 which is so marked a feature of the present 12.27 age; but I take it that the real cause of this 12.59 degeneration is the striking change which has 12.44 taken place in the character of the food. 49.26 On page 83, the Commission refer again to this very important matter. One gentleman, Mr W . H . Dolamore, saidHe had no doubt that bad teeth were a condition of the feeding that accompanies high civilization. The ruder and coarser sorts of food at one time iij use not only kept the jaw in action during the plastic period of its development, but had the effect of a tooth-brush in keeping the teeth free from the settlement of toxic agents. That an unreasonable number of men is being rejected in Australia on account of defective teeth is very evident. I think that these men are being rejected on very unnecessary grounds. We find it impossible to believe that, because a man happens to be shor.t of a few teeth, or has artificial teeth, he is thereby prevented! from fulfillin g the duties of a soldier satisfactorily and effectively. The fact that the majority of the people of Australia have to resort to artificial aid to mastication is most regrettable, but should not in the slightest degree detract from their ability to serve their country, though probably it may place them at a disadvantage occasionally. The military authorities are unreasonably strict in rejecting men because of bad teeth. However, the whole question of the number of rejected men, and the reasons for their rejection, is a very important one, which the Government should take into consideration. The social conditions of the people, the kind of life we have to live,, the conditions under which we are living, the houses we occupy, the food we eat, the cooking of our food, and the hygienic surroundings of life generally-al l thesematters ought to be the subject of a very searching inquiry. Undoubtedly, they are affecting the physique and efficiency of our race. Australia is able to supply, in proportion to its population and resources, a much larger number of men and quantity of equipment in support of the Mother Country than any other Do.minion; but the fact stares us in the face that if we had to depend entirely on our own resources for the repelling of an invasion, we sliould be in a very sad position indeed. Some of us deplore most regretfully our inability to serve the Empire at this juncture; but if we are to have a continuation of the physical degeneracy that seems to be affecting the British people, as indicated by the figures I have given, and the reports I have read in regard to the British people, and by the statements appearing in our press as to the number of men rejected in Australia, it would really seem that, before long, we must regard ourselves as a degenerate nation. If the war, which hasopened our eyes to certain weaknesses in our military organization, and also in our civil affairs, also opens our eyes to those social and moral questions so intimately associated with the welfare, physical development, and mental improvement of the people, it will have done some real good.",13
79,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Nepean) [4.12] - I am. pleased to have the opportunity of thanking the Prime Minister for his intimation of the intention to appoint a judicial tribunal to inquire into, the charges I made in this House on Thursday last relative to the management of the military camp ab Liverpool, because I feel sure that nothing bub good will result from such an inquiry. As I made my charges after personally investigating the truth of them, I am prepared to stand by them. I do not detract one charge I made in regard to the management of the camp, as I feel sure that I can verify every statement. I made; and it was my intention today to give the House the benefit of my experience at the camp on Sunday last.",15
80,Mr JH CATTS,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,Do you propose to verify your statements before the in quiry ?,15
81,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,I shall retain the further information that I have received until that investigation of my charges.,15
82,Mr JH CATTS,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,But do you propose - to verify your facts before the inquiry ?,15
83,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"I shall be only too pleased to give the Commission the sources of my information. I hope that the Prim© Minister, in justice to myself, will recognise the urgent necessity for appointing the Commission speedily, and taking evidence, not in regard .to the Camp as it is noiv, but in regard to what it ' was before I made my charges. A wonderful difference has taken place at Liverpool since Thursday last. The Assistant Minister of Defence is reported in the Argus of 3rd July to have saidThere was A temporary shortage of military overcoats at Liverpool depot. However. 1,000 overcoats had been supplied to them that day, nnd if a further deficiency was found on inspection, additional supplies would be provided. Evidently the gun that I levelled at the shortage of overcoats was loaded. On Friday last the military authorities went through Sydney buying up all the available overcoats to supply the men who had been without them for weeks. Mattresses were also unearthed suddenly from some mysterious recess, and the men are getting the benefit of them today. On Monday the troops were lined up, and the officers went round aud asked each man to step forward and state what particular clothes he was short of-whethe r underclothes, dungarees, overcoats, or anything else in the shape of personal equipment. Consequently on investigation into the conditions of the camp at the present time, or next week, or the week after, would not be fair to me. My charges were levelled against the Department in regard to the conditions prevailing at Liverpool a week ago. The Assistant Minister of Defence read a letter this afternoon that the Minister of Defence had received from the mother of a recruit. I may be permitted to read a letter that I received from one of the men in the camp. It is as follows: Just n line to tell you there is a vast difference in the Cnmp routine since your speech in the House last week. I may say that overcoats ancl warm underclothing are being served out to the men with post haste, also straw mattresses are being provided in the huts. That the military authorities are endeavouring to rectify their shortcomings as speedily as possible is quite evident. There was a general cleaning up at the Camp last week-end. Men who have been stationed at Liverpool since. February say that they have never seen sucb activity. It was because the Minister and I were expected tliere on the Saturday. I believe that the position at the hospital, on which remarks of a eulogistic nature have been passed today, was ludicrous. Though men in the past have had to an hour or so for attention, on Saturday one man who was carried up on a stretcher was absolutely rushed by four doctors anxious to attend to him. Seemingly my charges are bearing f r u it . If they have resulted in giving the men - better conis ditions-in fact, in giving them that which they are perfectly entitled- I shall be satisfied. Senator Gardiner went .to camp and has made a report. I have statement on good authority that he simment of the internment camp. ply went to the officer commanding, Colonel Kirkland , and, accompanied Colonel Stanley, they went down the lines and asked "" An y complaints? "" anything be more ludicrous ?",15
84,Mr FISHER,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,That is not so.,16
85,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,I am informed by have the men that such was the case.,16
86,Mr FISHER,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,On Senator Gardiner's word of honour it was not so.,16
87,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"I am pleased to hear the Prime Minister's refutation of that statement, but the men say that was the case. I did not go to the officers. I leave that sort of thing to Senator Gardiner, and to the other representamattresses tives of the Government. They may place themselves on the side of the officers. House. I am more concerned about the welfare of the men. The officers are well profortable. vided for, the men are not; hence my bringing forward these charges. I again impress on the Prime Minister the necesthat sity for having these cliarges investigated in speedily, because it is a matter of vital importance to the troops who are in camp in New South Wales. I have a letter for from one of the men in camp. It is given an as confidential, but it practically endorses all that I said last week. It is dated the 4th July, and saysDEAR SIR, In view of your very able and bold advocacy of .the cause of the recruits at Liverpool Camp and the Government's denial that grievances exist, I hereby furnish you with the actual facts. I am a recruit having just recently arrived at the Camp, and I am taking this opportunity of a week-end leave to write to you. Naturthese ally, I do not desire my name to be made .public. I will hand the letter to the Prime Minred ister if he wishes.",16
88,Mr FISHER,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"As the matter is going before a Judge, I do not wish to see the cooks, tetter.",16
89,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Then why did not the Assistant Minister of Defence allow the matter to rest, without introducing fresh matter beyond that which I menwait tioned in my speech? The Minister referred to the quality of the food. I did not speak about the quality of the food; I complained of the way in which it was served. The food is good enough, but it the manner in which it is issued that to I object to. I contrasted its issue with the issue of the food at the German In the ternment Camp, and I asked the authorithe ties to take a lesson from the manageBy so doing they would greatly benefit the men by at Liverpool. This letter continuesOn the question of accommodation. On arCould rival we were given three blankets, one rubber sheet, and told to sleep in a long shed, which at that time was devoid of windows, except in places. Since then windows of tin been constructed. But that first night will be one long to be remembered for the bitterness of the cold nnd the hardness of the boards. No one slept, and all, pretty well, were coughing violently. I do not wonder at pneumonia under those circumstances. Two days later we received sacks, which we filled with straw; these were our mattresses, given such the day after you advocated them. I wish to emphasize the point that tliose were issued only on the day after I advocated that course in this Needless to say, they made things more comThey talk about overcrowding in the city; well, you should see how we sleep in one of those sheds-col d and bleak and draughty as they are. We are packed so close our breaths mingle and our shoulders touch-fort y of us each side of the shed, eighty the shed. There is no room to dress, and everything is disgustingly cramped and unhealthy, and we are told we are responsible all things issued to us. How can we be in overcrowded shed, without convenience or comforts, or a place to put onr things except the floor (not even a nail) ? We get our food like animals, and have to eat it on the ground in the dust, which is 6 inches thick. As you know, the stew is brought over in boilers, or dixies they call them, and there is a rush. One man is supposed to serve from this to the others, but the men are naturally impatient, and help themselves, and there is confusion confounded. The same applies to the tea and coffee, which is likewise brought in .dixies. Por tea we get dry bread and jam. After our meals certain of our number have to wash out boilers; there is no hot water provided to wash the grease off them and the plates; lit lead, we bave to rub them with a dirty sand and wash them in the river or under a tap- a slow and dirty process. We have to then fill them and take them back to the cooks - this , mind, is for the convenience of the who will not give hot water to do it . Then eating our food in the dirt is abominable - and dirty. Why cannot a table be provided that we can eat our food from ? Witli regard to washing, there are far too few taps I may say that there are only five taps for 400 men. The conveniences in this respect are altogether inadequate. There are no basins of any kind, and some men have to wait for over half-an-hour before they can reach the taps, and consequently many of them have wet boots and trousers before they can wash themselvesand the spectacle is common of crowds of men waiting to wash themselves, their tin plates, and to fill their boilers and rinse them out. Far more taps should be provided, and more conveniences erected. The sanitary arrangements are crude and devoid of all privacy and decency to a disgusting degree. Little wooden or iron cubicles should be erected; instead there is simply a rail with tins underneath. In the matter"" of accommodation, as I said, there is neither convenience nor comfort, and there is overcrowding, rendering the loss or theft of articles quite easy.",16
90,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,They are not allowed to take valuables into. camp.,17
91,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"The letter proceedsGenerally speaking, the arrangements for the recruits at Liverpool are rotten and primitive, and aboriginal savages are better off. I see Senator Gardiner has wired that everything is all right. This is a lie, and let Seuator Gardiner become a recruit and he will agree it is. We have given our all, our lives, and left comfort, convenience, and congenial company, and the least the Government might do is to give us some place where we can eat our food in cleanliness, where we can sleep in comfort, where we can wash decently, where the sanitary arrangements are better than a black's camp, and where the food is served with system and with sufficiency. I have numerous letters on the subject, but I shall read only one more regarding the conditions at the medical campDEAK SIR, I was delighted to' read in this morning's Telegraph of the stand you have taken on behalf of our recruits at Liverpool Camp. The following may interest you :Hy only son enlisted, and was duly drafted to Liverpool Camp. He complained of the cold nights in Camp, and longed for something warmer to lay on, but "" stuck"" it like he should. On Thursday, the 24th, he had awful pains in the stomach, and desired to see the doctor. He had to walk nearly 2 miles to get to the doctor's place, and he was so bad that his mates offered to carry him there. ""No,"" he'd get there somehow, and did. An orderly asked what was the matter; he told him, and there was a conversation between the orderly and a third person. My son then heard the following remark : "" It won't hurt him, anyway,"" and a dose of oil was given him to take. He walked back again and had a terrible night. The next I heard was a telephone message that the civil ambulance was taking my boy to the garrison hospital, at Victoria Barracks, and as he was pretty bad I should get there quickly. An examination there showed that he was suffering from acute appendicitis, and an immediate operation was the only chance he had. Thank God for the Christians he was then amongst! The doctors went without their dinners to get to him right away, the matron and nurses treated him as if he was their only son, and today he is making a rapid recovery. I trust that tliere will be an examination into the whole of the management of that camr>. and that evidence will be obtained from the men who were at Liverpool at the time my charges were made. The Government must recognise that men are leaving for the front daily, and if the investigation is delayed, in all probability many of those who gave the evidence which I have placed before the House will have left ' for the seat of war, and their testimony will - not be available.",17
92,Mr BURNS,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,What steps will you take if you do not prove your case?,17
93,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"It will be timeenough to consider that question when my case is disproved. I shall have no difficulty in proving my charges. . Mr JENSEN - As the Prime Minister has said there is to be an inquiry by a Judge, do you not think it would be better to let the matter drop for the present?",17
94,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,The Assistant Minister ought to have taken that fact into consideration when Ee made his statement to the House.,17
95,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,The honourable member asked me to make a statement.,17
96,Mr KELLY,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,But the honourable member did not then know that tliere was to be an inquiry by a Judge.,17
97,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,I shall be quite content if justice is done to the men at Liverpool. I am satisfied that the M i nister does not know what is taking place there. The honourable gentleman would persist last week in saying that the Germans in the internment camp had received second-hand coats. I challenge the Minister to repeat that statement.,17
98,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,That is my information.,17
99,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"No doubt the inHe said formation came from the Minister of Defence. But I am in possession of other information to the effect that on the 26th May 430 coats were purchased from a certain warehouse in York-street, and others were obtained from Lowe's stores and Grace's stores, and were sent to the German Camp six weeks before I deemed it necessary for me to apply the spur to the Government in order to induce them to give our own boys the same comforts. Could anything be more absurd than the Minister's statement that these coats were second hand? If it were necessary to purchase 1,000 second hand coats in Melbourne tomorrow, where could they be obtained? The honourable member must realise that it was impossible to purchase 1,000 second hand coats in Sydney.",17
100,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,Does not the military store keep these coats in stock?,18
101,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"The coats issued to the Germans were not regulation military coats; they are brand-new civilian coats. Another fact I omitted to mention is that the German Camp, although of more recent date than that at Liverpool, has a splendid electric-lighting system.",18
102,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,In order that the men on guard may see everything that takes place.,18
103,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,A very excellent idea. At the Liverpool Camp the men are obliged to go to bed with naked candles. The indifferent system of lighting in that camp is not conducive to the moral welfare of the men stationed there.,18
104,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,That is a nice imputation to cast ou the men. You have said it!,18
105,Mr KELLY,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,What has he said?,18
106,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,The honourable member knows what he said.,18
107,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"I say that when surrounding circumstances are considered, the present lighting system at the Liverpool Camp is not conducive to the moral welfare of the men stationed tliere. The Assistant Minister pounces down on that statement like a bird on a worm, and, with the instinct of a Sherlock Holmes, says, "" Y o u have said it . "" What have I said ?",18
108,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,What is the inference? What do you mean by your statement?,18
109,The CHAIRMAN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"I must ask honourable members to cease interjecting, and allow the honourable member for Nepean to proceed.",18
110,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"We are men of the world, and we know what human nature is. I say that we cannot have these camps too well lighted; and if it is necessary to light the German Camp with electricity, why not give the Liverpool Camp the same advantage? One of the writers whom I have quoted complained of the lack of hot water with which to cleanse the dixies. Perhaps it would surprise the Assistant Minister to learn that at the German Camp it is quite the usual thing for some of the men to receive hot baths. Our boys at Liverpool have difficulty in getting hot water even to wash their utensils in . I am not desirous of hampering the Government in any way in this matter, but the points that have been raised are common knowledge up there, and it is the men who are complaining. On the previous occasion when I visited the camp I was alone. This time several honourable members of this House accompanied me. They are prepared to substantiate the statements I made, and hundreds of men are also prepared to endorse them. I am delighted that the Prime Minister has expressed his willingness that the matter should be investigated by a judicial tribunal ; but what I clo ask is that the inquiry shall be held as speedily as possible, because men are leaving the camp daily, and delay would not be fair to me.",18
111,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"You will get the inquiry, and get it speedily.  listened with keen interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Nepean, and I think the House and the country ought to congratulate the honourable member upon having brought the treatment which soldiers have been receiving at the Liverpool Camp before the notice of the House. A great many of my electors have gone to the front . More of them are now in course of training at the camp; otherwise, I would not have spoken on this subject.",18
112,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Leave the matter to the inquiry; why refer to it now?  Minister did not leave the House the moment he heard these complaints and at once investigate them. These things can be covered up. The telegraph wires have been going, motor cars have been running to and f r o in order to cover up the tracks.",18
113,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"A member of the Government has been there.  hundreds of the soldiers is that the conditions have been much improved since the honourable member for Nepean brought the matter before the notice of the House. I would point oiit that what the Minister read was only a statement that had been prepared for him. The Vice-President of the Executive Council also visited the camp. Everybody knew he was a member of the Executive Council. information would he obtain when in the company of officials. I did not go to the Liverpool Camp myself, though I intend going there as soon as possible.",18
114,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,Are going under Dr Schlink?  more closely related to you than to me.,19
115,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,Le t me tell the honourable member that I am the son of Danish parents.,19
116,Mr FENTON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"It is a contemptible remark, anyhow.  is not going to side-track me; I am going to say what I have to say, and if honourable members keep quiet, it will be the better for themselves. that a particular friend of mine happened to be in my town on Monday. He enlisted at Christmas, and some seven weeks ago contracted pneumonia, and was taken to the field hospital. I discussed affairs with him. I asked him whether he was well looked after when in hospital. He said the nurse9 were all male nurses, very willing, and though rough, and not accustomed to nursing, they did their best. I said, "" What nourishment did you receive-wha t food ? "" He said, "" That is the point; all they gave me was three courses of gruel a day."" I said, "" How long did you receive this?"" "" F o r a week."" "" A f t e r that , "" I said, "" y o u were convalescent?"" ' ' Fairly so; and all they gave me was three rounds of bread and marmalade a day."" I said, "" Were they big rounds?"" He said, "" No ; they were not very much better than a lady wo aid receive at afternoon tea."" Three slices of bread and marmalade a day!",19
117,Mr RILEY,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Doctor' s orders, I suppose.  he entered the camp he weighed 11 stone 8 lbs.; when he left the hospital he weighed 9 stone, and that he could have eaten a loaf of bread instead of the slice that was given to him .",19

W it h regard to clothing, this soldier to l d me that he entered the camp just before Christmas, and he only received his uniform the other day.

You are spoiling your story.  ing the story as I received it , and I will believe this soldier, just as I would beI want to say lieve the Postmaster-General, and I say that without casting any reflection on the Postmaster-General. I asked him what the food generally was. He said it was very .good, though badly cooked. W it h regard to the camp, he told me they had long sheds with boarded floors 3 feet from the ground, but between each board there was about an inch of space, through which there was such a draught that he preferred to lie on the floor than upon the boards. I was very much struck with the statement made by the honourable member for Nepean regarding dirty mediHe said, cine bottles. I asked this young fellow if the facts were as stated. He said they He said, were. I said, "" Don't you think the story that persons went to the doctors with dirty medicine bottles looks very much like at a l e ? "" He said that the men took these bottles to the doctors thinking they would be taken away and their medicine supplied in clean bottles, as they had no facilities for washing the bottles in the camp.",19
122,Mr BURNS,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Has the doctor facilities for washing the bottles?  be, facilities in the dispensary. Honourable members know that in every country town in New South Wales have probably men go round the town buying medicine bottles, which are cleaned and used again. The same thing might apply to this camp. These young fellows came along with dirty bottles, and I was in formed that in many cases medicine was put into the bottles and mixed up with the ingredients already there. I am surprised more of tliem were not sick. I asked my friend if the statement made by Mr Orchard regarding the coats and clothing generally supplied to the interned Germans was correct ? He said it was absolutely correct. I asked him how he knew, as he was not there. He told me that the motors passed close to the camp, and that the soldiers used to watch the lorries carrying all kinds of luxuries for the Germans, and to wish that they could be treated in a similar manner.",19
123,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Will you give evidence to that effect beforo the Judge?  this man, if need be. I am surprised that the Assistant Minister, after having heard the statements made in this House by the honourable member for Nepean, should have allowed a week to elapse without making personal inquiries. Every other consideration should have been placed on one side by the Assistant Minister. It suggested that enlistment is being discouraged by these statements. My retort to that is that enlistment is being encouraged by our criticism. The young fellows who give up all for their country are entitled to the best treatment possible. We should exert ourselves to the very utmost to make them comfortable, and to see that they get everything tliey need. Nothing is too good for them.",20

This man enlisted as a private on 2nd May; he has been acting sergeant, and is still getting private's pay. I do not wish to create any ill-feeling in this matter. All I want is to see that things are run on proper and right lines. I believe that a good deal of what is complained of has been done in ignorance. I am afraid that the Minister is too much inclined to accept the reports of officials. 1 believe the Prime Minister is actuated by motives of patriotism.",20
127,Mr BURNS,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Will the honourable member say that on the platforms of the country ?  ther, that the errors which have been made are not wilful, but are due more to ignorance than to anything else.

134,Mr YATES,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"The honourable member would not make that statement if the honourable member for Grey were present. That honourable member has an interesting story to tell of the conditions which vailed in the shearing sheds of Australia when he was a young man. I am pleased to find honourable members opposite disties playing some consideration for shearers and others now in camp, and I hope that those who have enlisted will return f the front fit in wind and limb to their places once more in the industrial army of the Commonwealth.",21
135,Mr ATKINSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Does not the honorin able member think that we had better something to promote the successful secution of the war, and talk about doing of something for the shearers at the time?",21
136,Mr YATES,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"I do not accept as every statement made by honourable memAustralia, bers opposite, and we have learned this afternoon that most of the allegations made in regard to the Liverpool Camp have been disproved. Whilst I was servment ing with the M i l it i a in South Australia attended three camps, and am able to that lif e in camp means a rather rough time. Whilst there I ate food at which I should have turned up my nose had been offered to me at home, and my limbs often ached as the result of sleeping on the ground instead of on a well-made such as that to which I was accustomed. But I recognised that I went into camp to be trained as a soldier, and that - to rough it . If honourable members posite were not so ready to listen to a who will never be satisfied, we should have so many complaints as we have I trust that when our troops come and take their places in the industrial fighting line of Australia, honourable members of the Opposition will give equal tention and interest to their demands f fair conditions of employment, and for reasonable wages, so that they may be able to. buy spring mattresses, overcoats to keep out the cold, and comfortable houses. The Opposition will have an as follows: opportunity to do something to better the conditions of these men when they return, but I am afraid their wail w i then be that the men are always askat present. ing for something for nothing, and that they do not give a fair return for_ they are receiving. I did not rise to Holmes."" criticise the Opposition, but I fel t that I could not allow the opportunity without making a reply to some of the statements we have had from them concerning the treatment of our troops. I wish now to bring under the notice of prethe Assistant Minister of Defence a complaint regarding the treatment meted out to a medical officer of the Friendly SocieMedical Association of South Australia, who, because he holds that position, is ostracised by the local branch of r o m the British Medical Association. That take association has fought the Friendly Societies Medical Association most bitterly from its very inception, and apparently the same bitterness is now Being evinced connection with the making of arrangedo ments for the care of our wounded. proDoctor Holmes, who holds the rank Captain in the A r my Medical proper Corps in Tasmania, and is at present a medical officer of the Friendly gospel Societies Medical Association of South recently presented his commission to the commandant in Adelaide, and offered his services either in connection with camp work or the treatof wounded soldiers returning to I South Australia. He is a Fellow of the say Royal College of Surgeons, and also a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, so that he is a properly-qualified medical itman. In order to prove that he did not make this offer merely with a desire to get into the limelight, I think it well bed, to mention that he is nearly seventy years of age. His son, Lieutenant L . G. Holmes, went with the First Contingent I had to Egypt, and while there was made opAide-de-Camp to the Brigadier of the few Third Brigade, and promoted to the rank not of Captain. He has since been wounded at had. the Dardanelles. Dr Holmes, as I back, have mentioned, made application to serve his K in g and country by attending soldiers in camp, or wounded soldiers returned to Australia. The reply that he atreceived from Dr Shepherd, the Prino r cipal Medical Officer, could not have been more terse or cutting than it was. It was addressed to him, not as "" Captain "" or "" Do c to r "" Holmes, but as "" Mr . Holmes, 24 Parade, Norwood,"" and was Your letter of the 18th instant received. I l l beg to inform you that there is no vacancy I think that Dr Shepherd should at least what have addressed his letter to "" Doctor",21
137,Mr THOMAS,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,He looks upon him as to pass a non-unionist.,21
138,Mr YATES,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Professiona l etiquette should have heen sunk in this connection; but, in any event, Dr Holmes was entitled to be addressed as "" Captain Holmes,"" since he still retains his commission. I hope that the Minister will de- permanent military area. mand that Dr Shepherd shall extend to every military officer the respect and courtesy that he would expect to be shown to himself. I hope, further, that the Minister will inquire whether, on the 18th May last, the date on which this application was made, there was really no vacancy for medical men in the directions indicated. If there was a vacancy it will prove conclusively that the feud existing between the local branch of the British Medical Association and the Friendly Societies Medical Association was responsible for this refusal. In any event, I trust that the Minister will direct Dr Shepherd's attention to the fact that, as a military officer, must, when addressing a military officer, have due regard to the ordinary courtesies aud requirements of the service.",22
139,Mr JOHN THOMSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Cowper) [5.0]. - I wish to take this opoortunity to make a few suggestions, which I am sure the Assistant Minister of Defence will accept in the spirit in which they are offered. I am pleased to learn that the Government have decided that a Judge shall be appointed to inquire into the condition of things alleged to have existed at the Liverpool Camp prior to the speech made in this House by the honourable member for Nepean, in which attention was directed to the matter. Since that date, I have visited the camp in order to interview some of my own constituents there; but, in view of what is taking place. I shall make no statement now regarding what I saw. I wish, however, to remind the Assistant Miuister, and the Committee, that the Liverpool Camp is a permanent one, established on property purchased by the Commonwealth at a cost of something like £150,000, and that it will be well Minister, in view of the large expenditure so incurred, to avail himself of the best services that the Departments can offer him in his desire to make the camp what it ought to be. I suggest to the Minister that he should avail himself of the skilled advice of Colonel Owen, Director-General of Public Works, who, being a military officer, would understand camp requirements. He should ask Colonel Owen to furnish him with a lay-out of the ground showing how it may be used to the best advantage, and setting for t h what permanent structures and conveniences are necessary to make it all that it should be, not only for its present purpose, but as a In the first place, it would be well to ask Colonel Owen if it is possible to provide the camp with a proper system of sanitation by means of septic tanks.",22
140,Mr RILEY,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,That can easily be done.,22
141,Mr JOHNTHOMSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"I think it can be done. I hope it will not be thought that, in making these suggestions, I do not realise what camp lif e means, or that there is any desire on the part of the Opposition to make feather-bed soldiers of our men. We realise what camp life means, but recognise, at the same time, that a certain measure of comfort and conhe venience should be provided for men who are doing the highest work that can be performed for their country. We do not wish to spoon-feed these men, but, at the same time, we think they should have some conveniences. There should be, for instance, a better system in connection with the serving of their meals. The men have their food supplied to them in a small boiler with a cover, which they call a "" D i x i e , "" and they eat from tin plates, which, with the "" D i x i e s , "" they are expected to return clean to the cook, or else to pay him 6d. per week for cleaning them. Afc present cold-water taps are the only means provided for cleaning these vessels, and, as honourable members know, it is impossible to properly clean greasy vessels by the applica>tion of cold water. I suggest that Colonel Owen should be asked to report whether it would not be possible to introduce some system of steam jets, or hot water, for the cleaning of such vessels. Tliere should also be a better system of lighting. At present, the camp is lifc here and there by a kerosene lamp on the top of a for the post, and men on sentry duty find it scarcely possible to identify persons in the poor light provided at night. Reading in their tents at night, the men have to use candles, which waste quickly and give but a poor light, because of the way in which the flame is blown about by the draughts. Would it not be better to provide electric lighting for the whole camp? I think that the Minister should visit the camp, and obtain his information at first hand. At present he relies. too much ou his officers, and, wliile I admire hini 'for sticking to them, I know that officers are not faultless, and that a surprise visit would teach the Minister a great deal as to how money can be best spent in fitting up the camp, not merely for temporary occupation during the present training, but for all time. ""What I have asked for I look upon, not as .luxuries, but as necessaries. ""When a man wishes to wash his face, he has to catch with his hands the water from a tap, no trough or basin, being provided. Thus water is wasted, and the process is uncomfortable to the washer. Every navvy or timber-cutter has a dish, supported on three posts, for service as a wash basin, and our soldiers would not be spoon-fed if they were provided with similar conveniences. As to clothing, several hundred boys assured us that they were three weeks in camp before they received their dungarees. Many a boy leaves home with only the suit in which he stands up. He thinks that other clothes would be a nuisance, and he knows that it would be difficult to send them back. I had considerable trouble in getting the belongings of a soldier who had left for the front returned to his friends. Under these circumstances, men should be supplied with dungarees within a few days of their joining the camp. There may be reasons for not providing uniforms at once, but dungarees could be given. I left the Liverpool Camp at 5.45 on Friday night, and the outside sentry, who, I understood, was there for the night, was without an overcoat.",22
142,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"All these men are supplied with overcoats, but we cannot force them to wear them.",23
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,If I were the Minister I would not talk so confidently.,23
144,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,That is the information that I have received from the officer sponsible.,23
145,Mr JOHN THOMSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"I have been told that overcoats have not been supplied to all the men, and that the overcoats which they are made liable at a valuasergeant-major, tion of £2, cost from 12s. 6d. to 14s. Having been reared in the country mymember self, I speak in no carping spirit of conditions at Liverpool. I know that some of the complaints of the men are considered unreasonable. But we should do the fair thing to those in camp.",23
146,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"The week before last Captain Murdoch visited the Liverpool Camp to inquire regarding the putting down of septic tanks and the provision of electric light, and we have received reports on both subjects. In all probability the septic tanks will be made and electric light installed very shortly.",23
147,Mr JOHN THOMSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"I am glad to hear it. Both things are urgently needed. I am sure that the Minister of Home Affairs would gladly lend Colonel Owen to the Defence Department, and he, as an architect and a military man, would know exactly what is needed, and could suggest the best way of spending public money on the camp. There are many things which I gathered from conversation with men on the spot which I cannot mention here, but with which I shall be glad to acquaint the Minister in private conversation. I hope that he will see that proper latrines are erected, so that men may not have to sit out at night in the rain.",23
148,Mr THOMAS,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Barrier) T5.12] - I cannot say that I rwrret that the honourable member for Nepean has drawn attention to the condition of the Liverpool Camp. I am confident that Ministers are anxious to have the defects remedied:, and it is unfortunate that the Assistant Minister of Defence could not visit the camp last Saturday.",23
149,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"I could not do so, because of the trouble at the Naval Base.",23
150,Mr THOMAS,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Of course, I accept the explanation; but had the Minister visited the camp with the honourable member for Nepean, a large number of matters could have been dealt with straight off. I have not been able to take interest in the Liverpool Camp, because of distance from Melbourne; but when my boy was at Broadmeadows I visited the camp rethere several times, and various complaints were brought under my notice. I learned, however, that there are two sides to most questions. The honourable member for for Calare instanced the case of an actingwho, he said, was not geteach. ting the pay of liis rank. The honourable first omitted to say that the man the was only acting as sergeant-major, which makes all the difference. Very often, before a man can qualify for promotion, he is permitted to act in the rank to which he aspires. A private's first step is to the position, of corporal. The corporal may become a sergeant, and so on. It is of advantage to a corporal who wishes to become a sergeant to be permitted to act as a sergeant. Such a man has a better chance of passing for sergeant than a man who has not acted in the position  whose case I referred was being charged 3s. 6d. a day for mess expenses, although he was not receiving the pay of the rank in which he was serving.",23
151,Mr THOMAS,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"There may have been some hardship in that case, but most young fellows who aspire to a higher rank are glad to act in the higher capacity fore submitting themselves to examination to prove their qualification for promotion. As to the supply of overcoats, I know that members of one contingent were not given overcoats until shortly before they left. But overcoats are often stolen. One young fellow of whom I heard had his overcoat stolen by a tent mate, and became liable for its replacement.",24
152,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,A man should not become liable to pay £2 for an overcoat costing 12s. 6d.,24
153,Mr THOMAS,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,If these overcoats cost only 12s. 6d. there are fortunes to made in the tailoring business.,24
154,Mr ATKINSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,The overcoats served out at Liverpool the other day were bought in the Sydney warehouses at that price.,24
155,Mr THOMAS,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"As the Government intends to appoint a Judge to inquire into all these matters, I have no doubt that good will come of the discussion. I am sure that the honourable member for Nepean was actuated by the best of motives. Things are happening in these campe which I cannot mention here, and which it would be almost impossible to imagine. Another matter to which I wish to refer is one to which attention been drawn by the honourable members for Bendigo and Melbourne. Some time - ago the honourable member for Bendigo referred to the voluntary contributions that were being made for many laudable objects connected with the war, and asked for some Government supervision of the collections, and today the honourable member for Melbourne asked that there should be a central authority appointed hy the Government to control the numerous patriotic collections. I understand that the Government have replied that they are taking the matter into consideration. I hope that they will take it into their serious consideration. Though they cannot prevent any voluntary association collecting money without full approval of the State Governments, I hope that the time will not be far distant when the Gommonwealth Government, working in conjunction with th© State Governments, will see that no collections are taken up without the full consent of the Commonwealth Government, and that there is proper control over these organizations. Otherwise, we shall have a tremendous scandal in Australia. Our be- people are open-hearted and generous, and at this particular juncture are ready to subscribe right and left to anything arid everything in connection with the war, but it is due to them that the Government should see that the money is collected by people who are properly authorized to do so, and that there is Government control in connection with every effort in this direction. We have had grave scandals in the past in connection with voluntary subscriptions. I believe that in connection with the Creswick disaster the trustees took some of the money be that they should not have touched. There is in Great Britain a very large fund called the Prince of Wales' fund, amounting to £2,000,000 or £3,000,000, which money has been collected on behalf of wounded soldiers; but in Glasgow the cost of distributing l is . from this fund is 9s. Of every £ 1 raised, 9s. is spent in the cost of distribution. Some may not imagine that such a thing could happen in Scotland, where the people are so careful with the bawbees, but, seeing that it has, we can well imagine what may happen in other places. Naturally there was some outcry when these Glasgow figures were made public, and the. defence put up was that, as the work of distribution was has put in the hands of clerks who wer© out of employment, the money paid to these clerks could be set down as relief pay. I do not say that nothing should be done for the unemployed, but it is hardly fair to raise money for wounded soldiers and use it for the relief of the unemployed. The Lord Provost of Glasgow took £17 10s out of the Prince of Wales' fund in order to go to London and make some inquiries, and when this matter was ventilated in the press the Town Clerk ofGlasgow pointed out that, as the Lord Provost went to London on general matters, his expenses should not have been drawn out of this f u n d , and it was only done by mistake. However, the fact remains that the money was taken by the Lord Provost for a trip to London, and if such things can happen in the Old Country they are just as likely to occur in connection with the funds that are now being raised in Australia. have no desire to stay the flow of benevolence and philanthropy in connection with the war, but a few days ago a collection was being taken up for the wounded soldiers returning to Australia. It is my view that the Commonwealth Government should make full and complete provision for every wounded soldier returning to Australia by means of general taxation. If we called upon the people of the country to bear this cost, they would gladly respond.",24
156,Mr ATKINSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Hear , hear; as long as the tax was equitable.",25
157,Mr THOMAS,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,To me the fact that people should be selling buttons and collecting money in order to make provision for our returning wounded seems to be a reflection on - the Commonwealth Government.  a month ago.,25
158,Mr THOMAS,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"When we have so much weight of intellect-that of the honourable member and my own-brough t to bear on the Government upon this matter, something should be done. I hope that the Postmaster-General, who is i u the chamber, will bring the matter under the notice of the Government, following upon the questions put by the honourable members for Melbourne and Bendigo. These organizations for raising, by voluntary means, money for laudable objects, seem to be multiplying, and should be under complete Government control in order that the public may know thati when they subscribe money it will go to the object for which they give it .",25
159,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"East Sydney) [5.28] - J regret that in the National Parliament of Australia the honourable member for Nepean did not first take that course which any honourable member not anxious to get into the limelight, but anxious to serve his country, would have taken. But there is some excuse for the honourable member. He is a juvenile; also, he is among a body of men who will stoop to anything for the purpose of belittling those who happen to be on the Ministerial side of the House.",25
160,Mr ATKINSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,I rise to a point of order. Is the lionorable member permitted to charge any honourable member with stooping to anything to gain a political advantage?,25

164,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"I withdraw it . I shall say the same thing-no t in the same words, but in parliamentary phraseology that will give the same result, is any one reading it will understand. The honourable member travels here from another State in company with a large number of honourable members on both sides of the chamber, and, prior to making Ms speech on Thursday last, he travelled in the train in company with the Minister of Defence. Every lionorable member, and every person in Australia, will admit that, at this particular juncture, the Minister of Defence has very heavy responsibilities on his shoulders, and I believe that the public, and even the honourable member, w i ll admit that no one is more prepared to listen to grievances, or to remove anomalies, or tilings that sliould not exist, than the present Minister. I feel sure that the honourable member for Nepean will admit this; yet he travelled in that train, and, under the guise of friendship, sat alongside the Minister of Defence, yet did not have the courage to bring these matters under his attention in any way, or to intimate to him anything of the nature of the conditions that he is trying to make the public believe exist at Liverpool. The honourable member is, I know, a juvenile, and does hot understand the trickery and machinations that are directed towards damaging honourable members on this side of the House. But the fact remains that' he did not say anything of these matters when in the company of the Minister in the t r a in ; and when he got into his party room, he made up his statement in order that he might come on to the floor of the House in an endeavour to damage political reputations. If the result were only to damage the reputations of honourable menibers on the Ministerial side, I could suffer it , but the result was. to damage the interests of the people of Australia; and it makes my heart bleed to think that a man could get down so low in the human scale in order to gain political kudos.",25
165,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,The honourable member is on the wrong track.,26
166,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"The honourable member is starting out in a political career; let me advise him. I was at Liverpool before h» was able to walk; I was there when it wis a washing-ground for wool, when doible the men who are now there were camped at the spot. The trouble is that in tnat district the party which the honourable member represents is losing support, and the honourable member's friends tried io get him to do something so that he miglit not lose the vote he secured at the last election. Let the honourable member take the advice of a man who knows something about the political motives to which those on his own side will stoop, and he will never again allow himself to get into the mess into which he has now fallen.  member know that the honourable member for Nepean consulted the leading members of his party on this matter before he came into the House?",26
167,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"You can k ill a cat by other means than by choking it with butter. Is there any honourable member in this House; is there any writer on the press, or reporter in this House, who believes that the action of the honourable member for Nepean will secure one recruit, or tend to the en-couragement of recruiting? Does the honourable member believe that Colonel Kirkland , or Colonel I r v in g , or any of the high military officials, would for one moment allow men in the Liverpool Camp to be treated in the way that the honourable member indicated? Do honourable members believe that the doctor to whom the honourable member for Nepean referred was influenced in his actions by the fact that his father had been born in Germany, a circumstance over which the doctor himself had no control ? No member of the House will believe such a thing, yet that was the inference to be drawn from the honourable member's statements, which are not in accordance with fact. I would advise the honourable member not to rush into these allegations, but to treat those who hold Ministerial positions, no matter to which party they belong, with the respect that one man should be able to command from another. Does the honourable member ask us to believe that those in control of the Camp would tolerate the conditions which he has referred to, if they knew that such things existed?",26
168,Mr OBCHABD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,My statement is true.,26
169,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"It is not true. The honourable member should deal with things he knows something about. He may understand how to wind up a watch, but he knows nothing about buildings. In his opening remarks the honourable member referred to the huts being built off the ground. If I were asked to prepare a plan of a hospital building, I should place the floors well above the ground, so that there would be a good circulation of air under and through the building. The buildings erected, at Liverpool are typical of hospital buildings throughout New South Wales. The only trouble is that, in the Liverpool area, frosts are experienced. Anybody connected with building knows that, at the present time, it is impossible to get seasoned timber, and though the flooring boards may be tongued and grooved, it is impossible to keep them draught-proof, no matter how they may be jammed together with the jack. They will shrink apart in places, especially when there is a good current of air underneath the structure. The flooring boards are cut to within an inch of the walls, so as to give an upward current of air; that is a sensible plan, because otherwise it would be necessary to provide air bricks. So far as the roof is concerned, there is a space of 3 inches i-the thickness iof the ceiling joistsbetween the top plate of the wall and the roof. That is not too great a space to leave along the whole length of a building. In my opinion, the buildings are very suitable for hospital purposes, because doctors agree that a sick person cannot have too much pure air.",26
170,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,Are you speaking of the huts or the hospitals ?,26
171,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"My remarks apply t d both classes of building. Perhaps the men would be even better off if they slept in the open air. I would undertake to sleep very comfortably in those buildings. So fa r as the medical attention is concerned, I went into the hospitals and asked the men to tell me candidly if they had any complaints. They said they had none.",26
172,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Did you think they about two years. would complain while you were there, and they were sick ? It is when they leave the hospital that they complain.",27
173,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"They may complain when they can pull the leg of a simpleton like the honourable member, but they would not make foolish statements to an intelligent person like myself. The cedure in regard to the issuing of uniput forms was explained to us. A man Time enters camp in his own clothing, and particulars of his identification are taken. When his clothes are taken from I him, he is given a docket, and his valuthe ables are placed in the safe. The man is then given a suit of dungarees he continues to wear while he is a recruit. He is not given a uniform until he bewashstands. comes definitely a member of some unit. In only one place did we hear of any grumbling, and then I was shocked find that men could sink so low as some of these men had sunk. Two deputations gradually. waited on us, and both made such requests that I felt bound to tell them, unmistakable language, what I thought of them. I said that they ought to thank God that they were in such a camp, and receiving the best medical vice, and that they were not fit to be outside the barbed wires. The action of military powers in keeping them under restraint was to their best interests. complained that their pay had been stopped, although payment was being made to their wives, and that they were not allowed to purchase certain articles which were likely to be injurious to their health in the condition in whioh they were. Honourable members must underThe stand that a man in camp is either fit service or he is unfit. If a man has boil about his body, he is of no military use, and is sent to hospital. The large number of men in the hospital is partly accounted for by minor ailments of that description. The doctor informed me that for days, and sometimes months, there was an almost complete absence of measles other form of sickness, but that when the dry weather set in after the rains cases of those diseases seemed to increase. The honourable member for Nepean ought to to the Speaker have seen the plan of the new hospitals and huts which are already in course construction. They are a very good type move. of building. We cannot expect the camp to be perfect, because the Government have owned the Liverpool area for only",27
174,Mr FLEMING,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,They could have done a lot in that time. They are trying to make a temporary camp do the work of a permanent camp.,27
175,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"It was never intended that 12,000 men should be accommodated in that camp at one time. I consider it promarvellous that so many men have been through the camp with such success. is required to make preparations to provide the necessary accommodation for training between 30,000 and 40,000 men. honestly believe the officers in charge of camp are just as earnest and sympathetic as the honourable member for which Nepean. When the men reach Egypt they will not be supplied with beds and",27
176,Mr ATKINSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,They know that.,27
177,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Then why not break to them in to hard fare? When one purchases a colt, he breaks it into work",27
178,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,Were you told that a in great improvement had taken place during the last two or three days?,27
179,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"No ; there has been no alteration. Perhaps, had I seen' Mr . adHoy, he might have told me something of that sort. I do not feel disposed to go so the f u l ly into this.matter as I otherwise should because of the announcement of They the Prime Minister that a Commission of investigation would be appointed. Honourable members should give all the information they have to the Department, so as to assist the Minister all they can, and not seek to stab him in the back in an attempt to make political kudos. period through which we are now for passing is the most trying that has ever a come upon - Australia, and if we can do anything at all to assist one another, we should do it , and not make unfounded statements, or statements based upon one side of a question. If the honourable member for Nepean had taken the trouble to investigate both sides of this or question before he came to the House, we should have heard very little of it . In stead of doing that he rushed with his letter, desiring to move the adjournment,",27
180,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,I moved more quickly of than the military authorities generally,27
181,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"The honourable member can move too quickly in throwing mud and in slandering. Friends of the honourable member for Nepean have expressed the view to me that they did not think that a Britisher and an Australian could have so belittled men in Australia who were trying to do their best under very trying circumstances, for I am sure the people outside will admit that the Defence Department has done wonders during the war. It has shown g r it and ability that historians of the future will deal with , and the sort of stuff served up by the honourable member for Nepean will not "" go down "" at all . Even if all he stated were true, he should have approached the Minister and placed the circumstances before him. No Minister in a democratic Government would - have dared to refuse to go into - the matter, and would have given the honourable member what credit was due to him. What is dangling in front of honourable members is the proximity of the submission of the referenda questions. When I know what has been done, and when I know of the sacrifices that Australia has made, and is prepared to make, I wonder, when I hear statements like that made by the lionorable member for Nepean, whether I am in the National Parliament at all.",27
182,Mr WEBSTER,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,Were the statements made by the honourable member true?,28
183,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"No , they are not true. If you go to a public school of 500 boys, you will find one or two prepared to growl. Go anywhere, you will find men ready to growl. There are growlers everywhere. There are some in the National Parliament. The honourable member for Nepean is a growler. He has not dealt with this question as he should have dealt with it .",28
184,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Does the honourable member sympathize with the way Germans are being treated in the concentration camp, as compared with the treatment of our own boys ?",28
185,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,The honourable member is now coming to the root of all this controversy. He is tryin g to make the people believe that honourable members on this side of the House are doing something for the Germans in the concentration camp that they are not doing for Australian soldiers.,28
186,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,They are.,28
187,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"There it is-there - is the kernel of the honourable member's complaint. Here is a member of this National Parliament accusing this Government of neglecting the interests of Australian soldiers in preference to the in terests of a few Germans. I have some sympathy for the honourable member. He has only occupied his position in this House for a short period, and prior to coming here his environment was not such as would teach him to look upon allegations of this kind as he should do. He has not yet had a sufficient education in political matters.",28
188,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,You have not had occasion to regret my presence here.,28
189,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"The honourable member has to be excused for a good deal, but I hor>e this will be the last occasion upon which we shall hear allegations of this kind without their subject-matter being previously brought to the notice of those in authority. W it h regard to the camp doctor, all I have got to say of him is that I have found him to be a man who knows his business from A to Z. I do not know any other medical man so conversant with military matters, or one who is so anxious to look after the welfare of his patients.",28
190,Mr ORCHARD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,I did not criticise his ability. I criticised his origin.,28
191,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,H is origin ! God help some of the people of Australia if they are to be judged because of their origin. I know of some who came out here for the good of the country they left. I do not know what m y honourable friend's origin was.,28
192,Mr WEBSTER,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,What is the doctor?,28
193,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"He is an Australian, trained at the Sydney University, where he took the highest degrees that it is possible for a man to take. For seven years he was a member of the staff of Prince Alfred Hospital, and for three years was secretary of a body which had for its object the closest scientific research possible in medical science. That is what the doctor's career is. If there is one thing to be said about him , it is that he does not get sufficient pay. At present he is getting captain's pay, but he should be getting more. He has given up his consulting rooms, the rent for which was more than he is now receiving.",28
194,Mr ATKINSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,I a he at camp all the time?,28
195,Mr WEST,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"He is there all the time, night and day, attending to his patients. The first parade is at 7 o'clock in the morning, and there are four parades a day. He has to be at them all. He has assistants, of course, but be has to supervise. As far as the field hospitals are conMinister cerned, the men in them receive more tention than could be given in the public hospitals, because the public hospitals could not afford the time devoted to these men in camp. But, as I said before, i must not be forgotten that this is a camp, and camp life must be lived there.",28
196,The CHAIRMAN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,Order ! The honcuring orable gentleman's time has expired.,29
197,Mr ATKINSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Wilmot) [6.0] I am sorry that any heat should have been generated by the discussion of this subject. The Prime Minister has already declared that a judicial tribunal will appointed to investigate the charges made by the honourable member for is Nepean, and I am sorry that a man who claims to be a Democrat, and who prethat tends to be bubbling over with the milk of human kindness, should make any tempt to prejudge the case. It will time enough for any honourable member to say there is no truth i charges when the Judge has made his inquiry. Until then, in justice to all confrost? cerned-the Department as well as the men- I think the best thing we can do is to be silent as to what the result is likely to be. I have been to the camp, and I was surprised at the spontaneity sleep in overcoats? with which hundreds of men there said that every word that had appeared i the papers was true. I have a good deal of sympathy with these men. I am satisfied that most of them have enlisted from the very best motives .possible. They know what is in front of them, and further. they are ready to face it, and I do think more evidence could be required than these men seem ready to give.",29
198,Mr BURNS,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,I thought the honourable member suggested that this matter should rest pending inquiry.,29
199,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,let the Judge settle,29
200,Mr ATKINSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"The honourable member for Nepean had no sooner demised livered his speech in this House than a thousand overcoats were immediately procured by the Department, and the camp was immediately busy in putting things right. Mattresses were brought in for the men.",29

202,Mr ATKINSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"The Assistant says the Department has proatcured all these overcoats. I am glad to know it ; but I do not lay any charge against the Department at all. I believe the Department is anxious to do what is t right, but the unfortunate thing is that the overcoats have not been distributed.",29
203,Mr JENSEN,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,I tell you we are prothem every week. Do not think that because we procured some last Friday that we did anything new.,29
204,Mr ATKINSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"I am sorry that the Assistant Minister cannot stand a little criticism, and I am sorry that he bo should make any attempt to cover this matter up. He has nothing to fear. It not his fault if these overcoats have not been supplied, and it is just as well inquiry should be made to see if the Department's orders have been carried atout. It is no good providing overcoats be if the men do not get them, and they are left to lay in the frost in the blankets n any of these that I saw there.",29

208,Mr ATKINSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"I did not say that n they had to sleep in their overcoats, though they might just as well sleep in them, as they are left lying about the floor amongst towels and everything else; but I will not deal with the matter not Mr SHARPS - Why attempt to make political capital out of it?",29
209,Mr ATKINSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,I am not attempting to do so.,29
210,Mr SPENCE,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,The honourable member has been doing so throughout his speech.,29
211,Mr ATKINSON,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"I can only say that it . I have had no desire to do anything of the kind. The Prime Minister has prothat an inquiry shall be conducted, and I hope that it will be pushed along with the utmost despatch, as in all probability, hundreds of the men in camp today will have left Australia in a little also while. If the inquiry is to be of any value, then the evidence of these men should be taken. There should be an war opportunity for all to be heard or repreI hope, therefore, that the' inquiry will be commenced very speedily, so that all the facts may be brought out.",29
212,Mr MAHONY,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Dalley) [6.7] - I desire to make a few observations regarding the Liverpool Camp, but trust that in doing so I shall not be accused of endeavouring to prejudice the inquiry which the Prime Minister has told us today is to be made by a Justice of the High Court. I , in company with two honourable members of my party, visited the camp on Monday last; and, wliile it covers so wide an area that it would take several days to examine it in a thoroughly systematic manner, we examined it as far as we could do in one day. My experience of men leads me to the view that, if one desires to elicit the truth, it is useless to question a man concerning matters of mismanagement in the presence of his superior officers. I was. careful to be guided by that experience, so that, while we were received very courteously by the Commandant of the camp, and other officers, I availed myself of the earliest opportunity to go amongst the men unaccompanied by any officer. As the result of my inspection I am able to say that whilst tliere is room for improvement in the Liverpool Camp, there is nothing in connection with it to which serious objection can be taken. I , at all events, failed to discover anything of a serious character, or any defect such as would not be found in any large business establishment.",30
213,Mr OBCHABD,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,Did the honourable member see the latrines ?,30
214,Mr MAHONY,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"I have had experience of big business establishments, and can say that even in connection with their management there are details which will sometimes go wrong. We found that the principle laid down is that when men are taken into camp certain clothing shall be issued to them. The Commandant told us that the arrangement was that each man on coming into camp should receive two singlets, two pairs of underpants, two cardigan jackets, two pairs of overalls, and a pair of boots. I examined the clothing very carefully, and am able to say that for quality it will compare with the best in the country. It is, in short, of the very best. Each man is supposed to receive this quantity of clothing as soon as he goes into camp, but, unfortunately, the system laid down in practice does not work out altogether in detail. Whilst I got this statement from the Commandant himself, I made it my business to ascertain from the men how the system actually worked. One man, who was wearing blue overalls, told me that he had been supplied with a suit of overalls, one singlet, and a pair of boots. Another said he had received only two singlets, and no other clothing whatever. Others, again, had received nothing but a pair of boots. The blame for this does not rest with the administration of the Defence Department, but relates to the failure to carry out the instructions issued by the Department. I made particular inquiry from the men themselves, in the absence of the officers, regarding the food supplies, and did not meet with one complaint. Every man to whom I spoke said that he was perfectly satisfied with the quantity and quality of the food supplied to him. We gave particular attention to the question of hospital accommodation in view of what had been said regarding the hospital arrangements at the camp being under the direction of Dr Schlink. As the result of our investigations, I have come to the conclusion that the Department should consider itself fortunate in having the services of a man of Dr Schlink's capabilities.' He is not only a capable surgeon, but possesses that sympathetic temperament which makes so much for the proper care of men in hospital. There was an officer in charge of each hospital tent, and I asked them to retire while I questioned the patients so that they might speak with the utmost freedom. Every one of the patients spoke in the very highest terms of the manner in which Dr Schlink was attending to them, and as to the treatment they received in hospital. Each patient is provided with a spring stretcher with a mattress and blankets. In the matter of bedding accommodation, I think the men in hospital are very well treated, and they all told me that they were comfortable and .felt as happy as their illness would permit. These spring stretchers are fa r more - comfortable than are many beds in which I have had to sleep. Shearers and others working out back often sleep on stretchers consisting of a sack through which two saplings are run .",30
215,Mr FLEMING,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"They make very good bunks, and it is good luck to obtain them.",30
216,Mr MAHONY,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Perhaps so; they are certainly better than sleeping on the floor. I repeat (hat the bedding accommodation at the camp hospital is all that could be expected-) and that the patients appear to be thoroughly satisfied in respect of it : We saw a number of men who were not in uniform , and it appeared to me at first sight that there must be something wrong in this respect. On making inquiries, I discovered that the rule is that when men come into camp, they shall be provided, with the articles of clothing I have already enumerated, but that no man shall be supplied with a uniform until he has been allocated to a particular unit. That is a fair and reasonable proceeding. As the Commandant very properly pointed out, until the authorities are sure of their man, it is not reasonable to fit him out. When they are, they provide him with the articles I have named, and also a uniform. This explanation of what, on the face of it, would appear to be a serious omission on the part of the Department is a very satisfactory one, and shows that an apparent omission is really a step in the interests of the Department. I should like to give a word of praise to Dr Schlink for one arrangement he has made, and that is the provision of a detention camp for those suffering from venereal diseases. There are some most shocking cases in this detention camp, and from the men there several complaints were made tb us. They asked, through their sergeant, that we should receive a deputation from them. We agreed to do so, and the men placed their grievances before us. Their most serious complaint was that they were kept in a compound surrounded with barbed wire, and were not allowed to mix with the men outside or with the people in the neighbouring town. The doctor and the military authorities, in enforcing such. a. regulation, are not only doing their duty to the camp, but are rendering a service to the community. Every credit should be given to the medical officer commanding for his action in this respect. If like methods were adopted in the case of all persons suffering from this terriblescourge, it would not he many years before it would be stamped out of the country. We were informed that Dr Schlink is an Australian native, and that he is truly Australian in sentiment. In speaking to us, he advocated certain claims made on behalf of the unfortunate men in the compound, despite the opposition of other military officers in the camp. We ought to be proud to have the services of such a man to take charge of the medical arrangements of the camp. Another complaint made by the men in the detention compound related to the stoppage of pay. It appears that men placed in the detention camp on the ground that they are suffering from venereal disease have the whole of their pay stopped, although this rule is not followed in regard to men suffering from other diseases. I think it rather hard that these men should be absolutely deprived of the whole of their pay for the reason that they have contracted this terrible complaint. I hope that the Minister will give some attention to what, I-think, is a reasonable claim on the part of these unfortunate fellows. I do not say that these men should receive their full pay, but something should be given to them. To be perfectly fair to the Minister, I must explain that if a man has allotted part of his pay to his wife or other dependant, the Department gives to that dependant the amount allotted; hut, in the case of the man who has no dependant, nothing is paid. As to uniforms, these are not served out until men have been attached to a unit. I desire to direct the attention of the Minister to the need for giving more encouragement to drill instructors. I do not think that the Department is taking advantage of all the service that it could command in various States from the drill instructors that are available. I was amazed, on visiting the camp, not to see there many of the drill instructors that I knew a year or two ago, the big, strong men of commanding personality, whose word of command compels discipline. These men are missing.",30
217,Mr GROOM,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,Probably they have gone to the front.,31
218,Mr MAHOUT,CAMP MANAGEMENT COMMISSION OF,"Some of them; hut there are others still available. I understand that some are considered ""too old; but I know of several men whose services could he obtained, and who would give to the camp the discipline that I believe it needs. I could, if necessary, supply the names of fine, active men, whose mere tone and hearing would force any squad to obey at once, and I feel sure that, now that attention has been drawn to the matter, the Minister will endeavour to get the services of these men. I understand that the pay offered is not a great inducement to drill instructors to give their services. One of the greatest needs in military training is the enforcement of discipline, and to obtain that we must have men of the proper type to give instruction. With an instructor who knows his business, and who has the proper tone and bearing, you can quickly get men to absorb the knowledge that is being imparted, and they have the confidence in the authorities that is necessary to enable them to do their part in the grand - army of Australian soldiers. If attention is given to this matter, it will improve the camp. I am glad that the Prune Minister has decided to appoint a Judge to inquire into the complaints that have been made. The intention of both sides should be to see that the conditions at the camp are ideal. In many things Australia has led the world. We have done this by our social legislation-w e have shown that social conditions better than any previously known are obtainable. If we get to work in this tion adopted. matter in the right spirit, we shall make a democratic army of which we shall be proud, and which will be an example to other countries.",31

Is there competition, or are rights granted only to certain persons? The complaint has been made to me that at the Enoggera Camp certain persons seem to have acquired the right to carry on businesses, while others are refused. I can understand that there must be some regulation governing .the matter, because you must have discipline within a camp; but where profitable trad-' ing concessions arc concerned, some definite principle should be laid down, so that there may be proper competition for the privileges concerned.",32
