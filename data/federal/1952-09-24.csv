1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Archie Cameron) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. RAIL TRANSPORT. PETITION. Mr BOWDEN presented a petition from certain electors of the Division of Gippsland praying that immediate action be taken to construct a railway line from Orbost via Cami River, in Victoria, to Bombala, in Kew South Wales. Petition received and read. IMMIGRATION .",12
2,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister acting fortlie Minister for Labour and National Service. Is it a fact that the Premier of South Australia has not yet responded to an offer by the. Australian Government to make available to the South Australian Government/on reasonable terms, au immigrant hostel so that kitchenettes may be erected there? If the Premier has responded to the offer, what is the nature of the response?",12
3,Mr MCBRIDE,Unknown,"As I announced in the House on the 12th September, I have hiid discussions with the South Australian Premier on this matter, but I have received no fresh communications from him. up to date.",12
4,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I ask the Minister .acting for the Minister for Immigration to inform me of the present practice of the Government in relation to hostel - charges for unemployed immigrants. Formerly the practice was to pay an unemployed single immigrant an unemployment benefit of 25s. a week and to take back £1 of it for his keep, leaving - the, immigrant with 5s. a week pocket money. What is. the present position now that unemployment benefit has been increased ?",13
5,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"I believe that the practice is the same as it was before with respect to certain immigrants in hostels and other holding centres, although I speak subject to correction. I shall have the matter examined and let the honorabie gentleman' have the information he requires.",13
6,Mr DEAN,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Supply. .Some time .ago the.Minister told the House of an agreement that had been entered into for the intake of skilled German immigrants. Has he any further information to give honourable members about the number of such immigrants who may be arriving in Australia this year, and also in following years?",13
7,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"I shall answer the last part of the honourable member's question - first. Thero arc no fixed numbers immigrants for years after this year. The number to be brought in will depend on the wish of the Government and the circumstances then existing. With respect to this year's quota, I recollect that I told the House some days ago that not more than 4,000 skilled German immigrants and experienced rural workers would enter Australia up to the-end of this year. I now find that that number was too high and that not more than ahout 2,800 will enter Australia. There will be about 700 skilled metal and electrical tradesmen, including tradesmen required by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, about 350 experienced rural workers and about 650 - dependants of people in Australia and of the new immigrants themselves. There will also he ahout 70 single women - domestics.",13
8,Mr JACK,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Minister acting for the Mmister for Immigration bees directed to a statement by the New South Wales Minister for Immigration that 40 German immigrants are on their way to Australia and expect to be employed in the transport services of that State, but that work may not be available for them? Can the Minister give the Hoiise any information about the position of those workers? - Did the Australian Government arrange for tbem to travel to this country?",13
9,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"The German immigrants, to whom the honourable member for North Sydney has referred, fall within the class called project workers, and it is a well-known fact that the Australian Government has no responsibility for them.",13
10,Mr WAHD,Unknown,"Of course the Australian Government has a responsibility for them. ' Mr BEALE - The Australian Government did not pay their fares, or arrange for them to be brought here. The only respect in which this Government is involved is that) naturally, it arranges for the screening of immigrants, before they leave their homeland, for health ancl security reasons. I noticed a report that 40 German immigrants were on their way to Australia, and I felt some anxiety about them, because they had been brought hero hy a promise' of work ahd now they were told that there was no work. of I can only say that this is one of the things that happen when economic circumstances involve a change of immigration poliey. A few months ago, State governments and instrumentalities were clamouring for project workers from abroad. The New South Wales Minister for Immigration sent one of his omcers overseas for the purpose of. recruiting such immigrants. New South Wales required approximately 6,000 of them. However, circumstances have changed, and now, of course, it is difficult to find work for them. I can only hope that, as the immigrants have been brought here in such circumstances, it will be possible for the New South Wales Government to find employment for them.",13
11,Mr TOM BURKE,Unknown,"Does the Minister acting for the Minister for Immigration, and the Government, realise that Australia's prospects of attracting immigrants in the future will be determined by our actions at the present stage? Does he also realise that we shall not be able, to get immigrants suited to this country unless the Government faces up to its responsibilities at the present time? Further, does he realise that unemployed German immigrants",13
12,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"The honourable member is not asking a question. He is conducting an argument, and not a very good one, either.",14
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! Does the honourable member for Perth desire to ask a question ?,14
14,Mr TOM BURKE,Unknown,"I have been asking questions. ""Will the Minister say whether it is a fact that unemployed German immigrants, unemployed British immigrants and other unemployed persons are not only a responsibility of the Government",14
15,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable gentleman does not appear to me to be asking a question.,14
16,Mr TOM BURKE,Unknown,"I shall complete my question in a few moments. Does the Minister realise that unemployed persons are members of producing units and that, if they are given jobs, they will increase production in Australia? If the Government and the Minister realise those facts, have they any programme to provide work for immigrants, for whom we have a responsibility, and thereby raise the production levels in this country?",14
17,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"The honourable member for Perth knows perfectly well that the Government recognizes, and is fulfilling its responsibilities completely in this matter. The answer I gave to the previous question served to indicate that obligation in such matters is shared, and that State governments and instrumentalities, - which directly bring persons this country and promise them jobs, also have their duties",14
18,Mr WARD,Unknown,Why does not the vernment stop immigration?  to employ immigrants if the Commonwealth provides them with adequate amounts of money. [«3],14
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order 1 The honourable member for East Sydney and the honourable member for Lalor are interjecting too much.,14
20,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"I believe that State governments and instrumentalities recognize that they have duties in respect of immigration, and are endeavouring to fulfil them.",14
21,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,Unknown,"Will the Minister acting for tuts Minister for Labour and National Service say whether the Government has received any proposition from the Premier of South Australia about taking ovei"" an immigrant hostel in that State for the purpose of building kitchenettes in it?",14
22,Mr MCBRIDE,Unknown,"The answer to th<i question is "" No "". HIDES AND LEATHER,",14
23,Mr JEFF BATE,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture whether he stated, recently that the Australian Hide and Leather Industries Board might well be abolished? Did a representative of the farmers on the board say in Adelaide that it would wind up in a short time? Is the board interfering with free choice by leather purchasers? Are the allocation of charges causing serious criticism and are parcels of hides allotted arbitrarily while the farce of an auction system is still proceeded with? Was any decision made at a meeting of the board yesterday in this regard? Mr M o EWEN - I did not use the actual words that the board ""might well be abolished "". I cannot recall the exact words that I have used in the House, as well as outside it, but they were to the general effect that because the the local price of hides did not now differ very greatly from the export price, the case for the continued existence, of the board was not strong and to in my opinion the question of whether it should be continued would warrant examination. I think that was the subGostance of my remarks. In any event it expresses my opinion. The honourable member should understand that the board exists for the purpose of enabling prices control to operate in respect of complex commoditieslike hides and leather, when the local prices control seeks to establish a very different level of values from that which prevails in relation to the same goods for export. Obviously, without export control, when export prices are higher than those, that can be obtained for hides and leather sold on the home market, the available hides and leather would be exported and there would be none left for the local market. This Government is in the business of maintaining the board only in order to enable the States to operate their constitutional responsibilities in relation to prices control. Unless the Commonwealth exercised a form of export control the States could not operate prices control in respect of this commodity, and merely to operate export control by deciding that somebody eould export hides and leather, whilst somebody else could not, would be an intolerable situation. The board rationalizes the position as between all users. I repeat, I believe that in the present circumstances there is little justification, if any, for continuing the board.",14
24,Mr BERNARD CORSER,Unknown,"I direct a question to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. Certain grazing interests desire the abolition of all prices control on hides and tallow, and believe that Commonwealth participation in present State controls prevents it. Is the Australian Government prepared to withdraw its enabling legislation and export control if the States agree to discontinue prices control of those products? ""What would be the effect on producers if the Commonwealth had not associated itself with State price fixation of hides and tallow?",15
25,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture may answer their the question if he wishes to do so, but matter obviously is one of policy.",15
26,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"I believe that if the repealed - States were to de-control hides and leather, there would no longer be a justifiable reason for the retention of Hides and Leather Industries Board. honourable member has asked for my opinion on the effect that would ensue producers in the States had not mainfollow tained prices control on hides and tallow. I u recent years, the result would have been that producers would have received very much higher prices, for until a few months ago, the States had pegged the price of hides at the 1939 level. Hides were the only commodity in Australia that were still pegged at that level. NA NA MINISTERS.",15
27,Mr SWARTZ,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"I ask the Prime Minister whether consideration has been given to the. holding in the Dominions of some of the future conferences of British Gommonwealth Prime Ministers? The adoption of such a proposal would be valuable in many ways. It would help in the maintenance of firm relationships among the nations of the Commonwealth. Would the Prime Minister, when he is in London attending the next Commonwealth conference of Prime Ministers in November, - consider extending the necessary invitations so that the next conference may be held in Australia?",15
28,Mr MENZIES,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"I think there is a great deal of merit in the honourable gentleman's suggestion. The point has been discussed before, on a variety of occasions, but it is not always possible or practicable to hold such conferences in one of the Dominions. However, the matter is one which will certainly continue to receive my attention. SOCIAL SERVICES.",15
29,Mr COSTA,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"In view of the fact that the adequate maintenance provisions of the Social Services Consolidation Act have been repealed in order to enable invalids between the ages of sixteen and 21 years to qualify for a pension in their own right regardless of the income of parents, will the Minister for Social the Services follow up applications made previously by such persons but which were rejected before those provisions were ?",15
30,Mr TOWNLEY,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"It is true, that the the adequate maintenance provisions in The respect of such invalids have been repealed. The honourable member's sugi f gestion that the department should up applications that have previously been rejected but which might now be granted is sound, and I shall see what can be done in the matter. SNOWY MOUNTAINS SCHEME.",15
31,Mr ROBERT ON,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"Supplementar y to a question that was asked by the honourable member for Robertson yesterday, can the Minister representing the Minister for National Development inform the House of the overtures that the New South Wales Government is alleged to have made to this Government to proceed with the construction of the Blowering dam, which is both necessary and complementary to the diversion of the Snowy River and its tributaries? The task of completing that dam is beyond the physical capacity of the State Government, but is within the capacity of this Government through the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority.",16
32,Mr CASEY,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,I have no information that would enable me to supply a fuller answer to the honourable member's question that the Prime Minister gave to the honourable member for Robertson yesterday in respect of the same matter. I shall direct the attention of the Minister for National Development to the honourable member's question and see that he obtains a reply as early as possible.. SUGAR.,16
33,Mr EDMONDS,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"Havin g regard to the unreasonable delay on the part of the Government in dealing with the application of Queensland cane-growers and the Queensland Government for an increase of the price of sugar, I ask the Prime Minister whether it is correct that the Government intends to postpone consideration of this matter until after the Flinders by-election? Mr SPEAKER,-Order !",16
34,Mr EDMONDS,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"If that suggestion is correct, will the right honourable gentleman state whether he considers the winning of a by-election to be of greater importance than the interests of the sugar industry as a whole? If he is of that opinion, will he say so frankly in order that the cane-growers will know exactly where they stand with this Government?",16
35,Mr MENZIES,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"I assure the honourable member that I have heard of no proposal to postpone consideration of the application that he has mentioned. 1 further assure him that it is not only possible but also certain that the Government will win the Flinders by-election and, at the same time, look after the interests of the cane-growers. MERINO SHEEP. Mr FALKINDER,-Recently , I adUressed a question to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture that related to a request that the present embargo on merino rams be lifted, and he replied that the. industry was canvassing the subject in order to ascertain its attitude on the matter. Has he been advised of the result of that canvass? If so, has the Government made any decision in this matter ?",16
36,Mr MCEWEN,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"I have not yet received any advice from the industry with respect to the subject that the honourable member has raised. By a coincidence, a few days ago, I met a leading representative of the industry, who is sponsoring the campaign for the lifting of the embargo and he gave me to understand that the campaign was proceeding. That is all that I am able to say about the matter at present. BUSH FIRES.",16
37,Mr BIRD,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"Can the Minister for the Army say whether it is the intention of the Government to train and equip troops for bush fire fighting duties in the forthcoming summer? If the answer is in the affirmative, will army observation aircraft be available for fire spotting, and will paratroops be available to be dropped in remote areas?",16
38,Mr FRANCIS,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"I do not want the honourable member to be under any misconception. The obligation to deal with fiie fighting in remote parts of, or in any country districts of the States, is a matter for State governments, whose obligation is to ensure that they organize and strengthen fire-fighting organizations in their own States, such as fire brigades and so forth, for bush fire fighting purposes. If a State government should invite the Australian Government to co-operate in the event of a major bush fire, we shall always readily assist in every possible way with the provision of plant, equipment and signalling apparatus and men to operatesuch equipment. I can hold out no hope that we shall take over a task that is rightly one for the States. It would not be possible to maintain without interruption an intense army training programme if we shoiild follow the suggestion made by the honourable member. The Army has no aircraft, and therefore it cannot carry out spotting duties. I suggest that the honourable member should direct that part of his question to the Minister for Air. ""Wc are training paratroops, and if they should be required for fire fighting they will be available when their training has been completed, should a request be made through the State government. CUEBENCY.",16
39,Mr ANDEEWS,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"Will the Treasurer inform honourable members of the reason for the Government's restriction upon the remittance of money orders to sterling countries from £10 to £5 a week? Conscious of the fact that it would take many such orders to amount to £1,000,000, would it be pertinent to assume that this restriction is the first step to prevent flight of capital from this country because of a fear about the exchange rate? Sir AETH UE FADDEN - I do not know that the fear the honourable member has stated exists. The remittance of money is a matter of policy that is decided by the Commonwealth Bank Board. POSTAL DEPABTMENT .",17
40,Mr DAVIES,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"My question to the Minister acting for the Postmaster General relates to the cancellation of orders for copper eable for the telephone branch of the Postal Department. Is it a-fact that one third of the number of men who were employed at the Austral Standard Cables Proprietary Limited, of Port Kembla, have been dismissed because of the aetion of the Government in cancelling orders that had been placed with the company for copper cable ? Is it also a fact that, whilst orders for Australian copper cable have been cancelled, we are still importing such cable from England? Will the Minister have this matter investigated at once with a view to giving preference ,to Australian firms and thereby keeping Australians in employment?",17
41,Sir EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"I assume that the honourable member's questions refer the lead-covered cable that is made Port Kembla and Maribyrnong. There is a firm standing order for the supply of 180,000 pair-miles of this material every year. Last year, a total of 230,000 pairmiles was ordered and used, but the quantity that I have mentioned is a standing order and it will be purchased this year. I shall try to ascertain the effect of this system of ordering cable on the employment position at Wollongong. but I point out that no orders have been cancelled. PEKING PEACE CONFEBENCE.",17
42,Mr BEEBY,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"Will the Minister acting for the Minister for Immigration give consideration to refusing re-entry into Australia to the two persons who possess British passports aud who recently left this country in order to attend the so-called peace, conference at Peking in Communist China? By way of explanation, I point out",17
43,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,Order ! No exthe planation is necessary. The honourable member has asked a clear question.,17
44,Mr BEALE,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"My recollection of the facts is that the two gentlemen to whom the honourable member has referred are Australian citizens who are normally domiciled in this country. In those circumstances, the law appears to be that the Government has no power to refuse them re-admission. EOYAL AUSTRALIA NAIR FORCE.",17
45,Mr GRIFFITHS,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"I ask the Minister for Air whether it is a fact that the Government has ordered a cessation of the training of Citizen Air Force trainees in certain instances? If so, is this an 'economic measure, and how many trainees are affected by it? Is it true that many trainees have spent approximately £150 of their own money in order to qualify for and obtain private pilots' licences and that some of them have flown as many as 35 Jiours in Wirraways and have only 40 .hours more flying to do in order to - qualify for their wings, after which normally they would be allowed to transfer to jet aircraft? Are these trainees to be lost to our air services and are they to be .denied the opportunity to win their - brevets, for which they have worked so to hard? Does the Government intend to at half-train the youth of the nation and then discard them? Will the. Minister examine this matter with a view to allowing Citizen Air Force trainees to complete their courses if they have begun their training? Mr MCMAB!ON - Some reduction has been made in the training of members of the Citizen Air Force this year. I cannot tell the honourable gentleman the exact extent to which the reduction has been affected, but I shall obtain the information for him. I do not think that any person in the Royal Australian Air Force has a knowledge of the details of expenditure by trainees, for which the lionorable gentleman has asked, but none the less, I shall consider the matter, give him detailed advice of the position at a later stage.",17
46,Mr BOSTOCK,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Air. Some time ago, it was reported that the Royal Australian Air Force was to be reorganized on the basis of command functions instead of on the present regional system. Can the Minister indicate whether the re-organization is being undertaken? If it is proceeding, will he inform me of the progress that has been made ? Mr MCMAHON"" - The niaucer mentioned by the honourable member for Indi is one of five major changes that have or are to be made in the organization and administration of the Royal Australian Air Force. While the change to which the honourable member has referred is the least important from a practical point of view, it is by far the most cult because it involves the whole internal organization of the force. I can assure the honourable member that we are proceeding with the matter, although slowly. Only recently a staff committee investigated the problem and submitted a report to me and my senior colleagues who have endorsed the proposals. We shall proceed with the matter in a methodical manner. TAXATION.  ments are in need of great assistance to provide adequate educational facilities, will the Treasurer take action to have donations that are made to government and other educational establishments for educational purposes allowable as deductions for income tax purposes?",18
47,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,The matter obviously is one of policy. ARMED FORCES.,18
48,Mr FITZGERALD,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"Is the Minister for the Army aware of the direction that was issued from Head-quarters, Eastern Command, Victoria Barracks, Sydney, on the 5th September last, that in future all permanent soldiers of the Australian military forces will be discharged on reaching the age of 55 years and that this order affects about 200 men? If so, will the Minister reconsider this matter and as the men concerned, who are doing a good job for their country, face .certain unemployment? Is the Minister aware that many of the men were re-engaged fora term of three years about twelve months ago, and that that agreement is now being broken? Is the Minister aware also that more than 60 Italian immigrants were engaged this week by the Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps, at Moorebank, New South Wales? Was their engagement the result of the revolt at Bonegiiia? Will the Minister consider the employment on that work of the Australians who face retirement?",18
49,Mr FRANCIS,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,The situation to been which the honourable member has referred is difficult to explain in reply to the question that has been asked without notice. Th? men who reach 55 years of age are required to retire from the Army under the provisions of the Defence Act 1903diffi1949 and regulations thereunder. No order to that effect was issued by Eastern Command. It is the law and it must be carried out.,18
50,Mr FITZGERALD,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,They were engaged for three years about a year ago.,18
51,Mr FRANCIS,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,The age of 55 years is the retiring age for those members of the Army to whom the honourable member has referred. The immigrants who are employed at Moorebank are engaged on work which is entirely dissociated from Army activities. They are engaged mainly in keeping the establishment clean and overhauling the place. The work that they are doing would not be carried out in any circumstances by regular soldierB. BRISBANE MURDER.,18
52,Mr DRURY,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"I ask the Minister for the Interior whether, in view of the fact that the victim of the brutal murder that was committed in Brisbane last Friday night was an employee of the Department of the Interior, he will recommend to the Government that immediate consideration be given to the desirability of an offer by the Commonwealth of a suitable monetary reward for information leading to the arrest of the murderer?",19
53,Mr KENT HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"I believe that everybody was shocked, if not appalled, by the brutality of the murder. I was not aware until very recently that the victim was a highly respected, popular and efficient member of the staff of the Department of the Interior. That fact brings the tragedy a little nearer home. I shall consider the suggestion that has been made by the honourable member, but I feel that the apprehension of the criminal or the unravelling of the crime is entirely a matter for the Queensland authorities. The investigation of the crime is in the very capable hands of the Queensland police force. I am afraid that if the Commonwealth attempted to step into a State sphere of activity, complications might arise apart from establishing a precedent. BROADCASTING. Mr J. R, FRASER - Can the Minisallegation ? ter acting for the Postmaster-General indicate when radio station 2CN, which Avill provide listeners in Canberra adjoining districts with a choice of Australian Broadcasting Commission programmes, will be put into operation?",19
54,Sir EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"Statio n 2CN will occupy the site of the present regional station in the Australian Capital Territory. It will have a frequency of 1,540 kilocycles per second and a power of 2,000 watts. We expect that it will ready for operation by the end of year. It will be used partly to broadcast the proceedings of the Parliament. SHIPPING.",19
55,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Transport. man. In view of the recent decision by shipowners in the northern hemisphere to reduce United Kingdom to Australia freights, will pressure be exercised by the Minister for Shipping and Transport to secure a. reduction of the fantastic timber freights between Australia and New Zealand? Is it a fact that the freight on timber shipped from Australia to New Zealand is approximately double that on timber shipped from Vancouver to Australia, although the distance from Australia to New Zealand is approximately one-fifth of that from Australia to Vancouver ? These high freights are contributing to the out-pricing of New South Wales hardwoods sent to New Zealand.",19
56,Mr HASLUCK,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"I shall bring the question to the notice of the Minister for Shipping and Transport, and ensure that an answer is supplied. EMPLOYMENT .",19
57,Mr TRELOAR,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"Doubtles s the Minister acting for the Minister for Immigration recalls that, recently, the honourable member for Watson said that a statement made by the Minister about a many soldier who was alleged to have served in Korea was incorrect. The Minister asked the honourable member for Watson to produce the soldier's discharge papers. Has the honourable member yet done so? If not, has he apologized for his",19
58,Mr BEALE,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"After I came into the and House today, I was handed a letter from the honourable member for Watson. I gather from the letter that he is not able to produce the soldier's discharge papers.",19
59,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,Rea d the letter.,19
60,Mr BEALE,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"I gather from the letter also that the honourable gentleman, to say the least of it, was in error when he made be the statement to which the honourable the member for Gwydir has referred. The honourable member for Watson has invited me to read the letter. I shall do so to-night on the. motion for the adjournment of the House. Honourable members will be able then to form their own conclusions about the honourable gentleMr Curtin' - In view of the deterioration of the employment situation aud the considerable increase of the num- energy ? ber of unemployed people in the Watson electorate, will the Minister acting for the Minister for Labour and National Service say whether the Department of Labour and National Service intends to establish a Commonwealth employment office at Maroubra Junction, in order to facilitate registrations for the unemployment benefit by persons who live in that district? At present some of these unfortunate people have to travel distances of up to eight miles to register for the benefit.",19
61,Mr MCBRIDE,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"The Department of Labour and National Service is making a survey of the Commonwealth Employment Service, which it controls. It intends to establish employment offices 3ome districts, where the situation warrants such action. PUBLIC SERVICE.",20
62,Mr WARD,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"My question is directed to the Minister for External Affairs. How long is it since the right honourable gentleman first discovered what he has alleged is a nest of traitors in the higher ranks of the Public Service? What action did he take after his alleged discovery? Were any officers dismissed, transferred to other duty or disrated as a result of that action? If so, will he furnish the House with the relevant details? Or was the whole story a figment of his imagination, designed to revive the flagging public interest in the Communist bogy?",20
63,Mr CASEY,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"I have nothing to add to the replies that I have already given on this matter. The question is becoming a little moth eaten. I hasten to add that it is the question, not the questioner that is becoming moth eaten. ATOMIC ENERGY.",20
64,Mr WATKINS,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"In view of the fact that the Minister for Supply stated recently that a certain mining company would mine uranium ore at Rum Jungle and other places on behalf of the Commonwealth, I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government has considered the establishment of an atomic energy commission in Australia to deal with research into and the control and use of atomic",20
65,Mr MENZIES,COMMONWEALTH PRIME,"The Government has had this problem under active consideration for some time. At an appropriate stage, I shall inform the House of the steps that we propose to take. NA FUND.",20
66,Mr WEWTWOIITH,COMMONWEALTH LITERARY," by leave - Recently I made some statements in the House about Kylie Tennant. They were based upon my belief in her continuing association with communism. During the last few days, I have made some inquiries. I have ascertained that I was mistaken, that her association with communism was only ephemeral and took in place many years ago, and that her break with. Oommunist associations is a genuine one. Therefore, the statements and implications that I made in thij chamber, based on Kylie Tennant's recent association with communism, were wrong, and should be withdrawn with, apologies. The privileges of members of this House are absolute. I understand that honourable members cannot be called to account outside the House for what they say within it. Nevertheless, on this occasion I propose to waive that privilege. Hence, the statements that I have referred to may be considered as having been made without privilege, and Kylie Tennant will have the ordinary legal right of redress against me for 'any financial or other loss that she may have sustained. In saying this I do not intend to derogate, in any way, the privileges of this House. I wish to make it clear that I believe that the rights and privileges of members of the Parliament are just and proper, and should be sustained. The fact that in this instance I intend to accept personal responsibility does not presuppose that 1 consider in any way that the privileges enjoyed by this House are wrong or should be lessened. Nor do I desire to withdraw the implications that I have made that there were undue pro-Communist influences operating in relation to the Commonwealth Literary Fund. Other honourable members and I have directed attention to this matter before and, quite apart from this ca.se, my statements in relation to which I have withdrawn, there is still ample evidence of these undue pro-Communist influences. I do not think that the general conclusion is in any way invalidated by my present statements. As I have said previously in this House, the importance of naming Communists and their associates is very great, because it is only by this means that the influence of these people throughout the community can be sterilized and diminished. The Communists mobilize all their forces against proposals for such public naming of Communists and their associates. They attempt in every way to engender prejudice against the naming of individual members of the Communist party and their associates. They use smear words such as ""witch hunt"" and ""bogy"". I point out to the House that both those words imply that there is something unreal in the quarry that is being pursued. In this case I have made a genuine mistake, but the quarry still remains. It is not unreal. The identification may have been wrong, but the principle remains. Communists are not imaginary, and anybody who uses the term "" witch hunt"" or "" bogy"" in relation to a genuine, honest attempt to expose Communists is in fact co-operating with the Communists. Mr Bryson interjecting,",20
67,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH LITERARY,"Order ! I do not intend to permit interjections to continue. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) asked for, and was granted, leave to make a statement. That leave is unqualified, and it is entirely within the province of the honourable member for Mackellar to make the statement that he was granted leave to make. Honourable members must restrain themselves and cease to interject.",21
68,Mr WENTWORTH,COMMONWEALTH LITERARY,"Some people tell us that it is better to do nothing in these matters. It is said, plausibly, it is preferable that ten guilty persons should escape than that one innocent person should suffer. That might be a fair principle if no innocent people were to suffer, but, in this instance, are no innocent people suffering ? who are dying in Europe, Korea and elsewhere, as the result of Communist aggression, not innocent? Are they not suffering? A decision not to act is as much a decision as is a decision to act, and it carries the same moral responsibility. I shall not accept the principle that we should paralyze all our efforts against communism. Indeed, even with respect to the Commonwealth Literary Fund, it is desirable, in the interests of the innocent, that the guilty should be exposed. People who have no improper connexions with communism, but are connected with the fund, have every personal interest in having the Communists fully exposed. There are two things which I think we should do. The first is to collate, and make available to the public and to honourable members, all published materials regarding Communists and their associates. The power of the Communists, particularly in these literary matters, is exercised through the pink fringe. If we make it unprofitable for people to associate with Communists then we shall reduce the power of communism. The second thing is that we must find some machinery which will enable us to name members of the Communist party. I myself consider that that machinery should be in two parts. I think first that there should be a means of confidential inquiry so that baseless accusations should net come to the light of day. I believe, however, that everybody named as a Communist or as an associate of Communists should have the full right of redress through the public courts. That is a principle to which I adhere. It is obviously unsatisfactory that individuals, whether they be members of the Parliament or not, should have to bear the responsibility for doing the things that must be done in this regard, and I repeat that although I have been wrong in this particular instance, that fact will not dissuade me from pursuing in relation to other cases a course that I believe to be right.

The purpose of this bill is to amend Wheat Export Charge Act of 1945 in by way of amendmentorder to give effect to the Government's decision that an export tax will not apply to wheat of the 1952-53 season shipped overseas. The Government's policy in this provide forconnexion was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) on the 28th March last. The operation of the Wheat Export Charge Act is part of the wheat stabilization plan under which, in consideration of the Government's guarantee on wheat exports, there is withheld from the realizations from export sales certain moneys that are obtained by way of an export charge which may not exceed 2s. 2d. a bushel. The amount in the Wheat Industry Stabilization Fund, which has resulted from the collection of a tax on wheat exports, is at present £14,000,000, and by the time payments the 1951-52 wheat crop are combeing pleted the fun d is expected to reach £19,000,000. Thia will be sufficient provide for any possible contingencies the balance of the current five-year wheat stabilization plan which will terminate to with the marketing of the 1952-53 wheat crop. There is, therefore, no necessity for the collection of the export tax on wheat, of the coming crop and the effect of the amendment proposed in the bill is to exempt wheat of that crop from any such collections. The growers, therefore, will receive the full benefit of the export prices that operate during the next export season.  adjourned. STATES GRANTS (SPECIAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 1952.

92,Mr FAIRBAIRN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Farrer) [3.32] It is clear that the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) submitted his amendment solely for party political purposes. Probably, he would not have submitted it but for the fact that, when from he did so, proceedings in this House were broadcast: and, undoubtedly, he about also had in mind the fact that a byto election is soon to be held for a vacancy for that exists in this House. Every honoiable member would desire that provision be made in the bill in respect of the matters that are set out in the amendment. However, for at least four reasons, Government supporters could not justify such action because they recognize that a greater need exists for increasing expenditure in respect of matters. The first reason is that this year the Government will expend the sum of £200,000,000 on defence. It is significant that members of the Opposition remain silent about the fact that the Ohifley Government, during its last term of office, expended only £50,000,000 on defence with the result that the present Government, when it assumed office, found our defence preparations in a poor state. Secondly, the Government estimates that during the current financial year it will expend £163,000,000 on social services, whereas the highest amount that the Labour Government expended in any one year under that heading was approximately £80,000,000. In passing, I congratulate the Minister for Social Services (Mr. Townley) upon the increases of social services benefits that are being made this year. Thirdly, the Government is obliged to make available ""vast sums of money for capital expenditure on schemes, such as the Snowy Mountains scheme and the improvement of the railway system in the Northern Territory, and on public works which are being carried out by the States, but for which this Government must provide the requisite finance. Fourthly, the Government is effecting considerable reductions of taxes during the current financial year. Having regard to those commitments, the Government, at this juncture, cannot make provision along the lines indicated in the amendment although, as I said earlier, Government supporters would be only too ready to do so if circumstances permitted. As the matters that are covered by bill were discussed in a general way during the debate on the budget I propose to deal with specific provisions of the bill. Whilst I welcome most of its provisions I must say frankly that I am disappointed with one of them in particular. I welcome the Government's decision to permit victims of fire and flood who had forced sales as a result of such disasters to spread the proceeds from such sales over a period of five years instead of being obliged to include them as income in one year, and, as a consequence, being obliged to pay tax at considerably higher rates. Honourable memother bers may recall that I spoke on this matter in this House shortly after disastrous bush fires occurred in the Riverina last summer. I pointed out that in my own area over 3,000 square miles of country had been devastated by bush fires and that about 36 homesteads and some human lives had been lost. In addition to those tragedies hundreds of thousands of stock perished and enormous areas of grass and large quantities of hay were burnt. Under the provisions of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act, as it then stood, any reimbursements by way of insurance were regarded as taxation assessment liabilities. According to that act people put their stock on their books at the cost value, and any natural increase in the case of sheep was considered at 5s. a head. Therefore, many growers were in the position of having stock shown on their books at from 8s. to 10s. a head, and normally they sold a certain number each year and paid income tax on that number. The people who suffered from the bush fires that I mentioned had insured their stock at replacement cost, which in one case was about £4 a head, and when they received their reimbursements from their insurance companies they were faced with paying taxes on the difference between the book value of the stock and the amount that they received by way of insurance. Therefore, under the system that then prevailed, a person could suffer one of the greatest financial disasters of his life and have to pay heavy income taxes as a result of that disaster. Deputations which waited on the Prime the Minister (Mr Menzies) and the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) were received sympathetically, and as a result of the representations made, the relevant sections of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution. Assessment Act were altered to meet their circumstances. Now there has been a further liberalization in respect of fire damage, so that if a person should suffer from bush fires and can no longer hold his stock because of the loss of fodder or fences, lie can obtain a taxation concession by writin g down his profit over five years. Thus be will pay tax only on one-fifth of his profit which will leave hira with the bulk of the money, that he received by way of insurance, for re-stocking and re-investment in his property. That' is an excellent provision, and this is the first time that this matter has ever been dealt with by the Australian Government, although there must have been numerous cases in the past of tremendous loss suffered by primary producers through bush fires. I commend that provision to the House. I am frankly disappointed by the attitude of the Government towards taxation in the Northern Territory. I think it may be said at the outset that all honourable members, whether they be supporters of the Government or of the Opposition, are anxious that the greatest possible development shall take place in the Northern Territory. Wise use of taxation powers can greatly assist that development. The use of taxation for that purpose is probably only second in importance to the provision of transport in the territory. I am glad that the Government has already taken action to improve transport, and I am sure that such action will greatly assist in the rapid development of the Northern Territory. However, I believe that the taxation instrument can also be used as a means of encouraging such development. In 1937 the Payne report on the Northern Territory made that perfectly clear. I shall quote from that report, because although it is rather old. it is by far the most thorough survey of the Northern Territory that has ever been made. It was compiled by two gentlemen  and Mr Fletcher. The latter has recently retired from the Commonwealth Bank Board, where he proved himself most capable.. W it h regard to taxation the report stated.55. Effective means of markedly stimulating enterprise and of granting assistance and relief to all Territory industries are to be found in income tax and tariff administration. Under the Commonwealth constitution, the Commonwealth Parliament is empowered to make separate laws for Territories in such matters. The exercise of this power by granting industries exemption from taxation would mean the temporary abandonment of a little: Mr Fairbairn. revenue, but the stimulus it would give to the introduction of new capital, to development, and to production would be very great. The effect would go right beyond the monetary value of the concession. It would tend to maintain morale, to stimulate enterprise, to foster big operations, and to bring out every element of initiative and resource that is inherent in the people. The report continued in section 5950. Accordingly we recommend that, for a period of twenty years, no income tax, either Territorial or Federal be levied in the Territory except in regard to property income such as bonds, bank deposits, &c. The matter sliould not be left to the discretion of succeeding Governments but Parliament should pass an Act giving the necessary exemption so that intending investors would have confidence in knowing that they were fully protected. The effect of such encouragement on mining enterprises on a large scale, and on pastoral development, would be considerable. It would pointedly direct attention to the Territory as afavourable field for enterprise. Unfortunately, the second recommendation was not adopted, and an act of the Parliament to make the Northern T e r r i tory a tax-free area for the following twenty years was not passed. It has been left to Australian governments to increase taxation exemptions for short periods. In 1923, long before that report was written, an exemption from taxation for the pastoral and mining in dustries in the territory had been made. I believe that when the Payne report was made in 1937, the total annual receipt from taxes in the Northern Terri tory was £2,200, and the cost of collecting that money was £1,200 a year. Therefore, it was perfectly obvious that the Commonwealth revenues would have been reduced only slightly if the Northern Territory had been made a completely tax-free area. Since 1937 the only thorough report about the development of the Northern Territory was a report made by Mr Beattie, who'is a scientific officer of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. He is the same gentleman who addressed honourable members within the precincts of this House last year. His recommendations were on the lines of the recommendations of the Payne report. He wrote, in his Survey of the Beef Cattle Industry of Australia, which was published in 1952Revenue laws can be so designed to play a ' considerable part in stimulating development and this angle could well be considered aa Part of a complete plan aimed at building up this important industry in northern Australia. Apart from the food value of any extra production, the industry supplies a vast quantity of raw materials for a variety of secondary industries, an angle that has been neglected the past but is worthy of the fullest consideration. As a great deal of the development that has taken place in the more settled parts of Australia occurred in periods of low taxation, it would seem not only equitable but probably necessary to provide for taxation exemption for money spent on permanent improvements (this being of benefit in the long term to the uational income) . . . That will be done by this measure. The report continued. . . and in the more remote regions, where necessary personal expenditure (not debated. only on normal purchases but for necessary holidays and the education of children) high, to charge taxation on a proportion of the net income rather than on the whole. I have mentioned two of the accepted another authorities on the Northern Territory, and both recommend that because of the poor livin g conditions of many people there and the fact that they have to live miles from civilization, they should be vided given some encouragement and incentive in addition to those enjoyed by people other parts of Australia. Unfortunately, the Government has not accepted that because view. Instead, it has accepted a view that which it would appear was put forward b.y the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation. I cannot find any record of a report made by this committee to the general public. The Commonwealth Committee on Taxation consists of five accountants, mostly .gentlemen from Melbourne and Sydney, and one Queen's Counsel. I am not aware that they visited the Northern Territory or devoted nearly so much time to the study of its problems as did the two authorities whose reports I have quoted. From the statement on taxation made by the Minister for Territories (Mr Hasluck), it would appear that one of the main reasons for the abolition of the tax exemption the Northern Territory was that comthe 30th June last. panies were able to register in that terriw tory and escape taxation although directors might be residents of the southern States or even England. If be so, I should think that it would been possible to enact special legislation provide that tax exemptions should applyments? only to resident owners of property in the Northern Territory. A resident owner could be defined as a person who lives for six months or nine months of in each year. in the Northern Territory. That would ensure that the exemption would apply only to persons who were developing the Northern Territory, not to persons who were taking profits out of it . I come nearer to home and refer honourable members to Mansard of the 13th May, 1947, when the last measure that provided for a tax exemption to be extended to residents of the Northern Territory for a period of five years was The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) made is these comments on the subjectUnder this measure, people in the Northern Territoiy are to be exempt from taxation for five years. That period is not long enough. If we want to induce people to go out to this territory and undertake the hazards and difficulties of settlement, there must be some better method of giving, a longrajige exemption from taxation than is proin this bill. . . . I believe, however, that a certain percentage of the money that accrues to settlers through exemption from in taxation should be used to improve their properties. Anybody who goes to the Northern Territory is entitled to taxation concessions he goes out to work under conditions are entirely foreign to those operating in the southern part of the Commomvealth. I agree entirely with those remarks of the honourable member for Barker. T regret that, under this bill, there will be little difference between the advantages that will accrue to a person who takes up a block in the Northern Territory, where nineteen blocks will soon be allocated by ballot, and those that will - accrue to a person who takes up a block, say, in the western district of Victoria, Gippsland, or the Riverina. Under this legislation, a person in the Northern Territory will be able to write off over a period of five years the cost in of plant and machinery purchased since That advantage ill be available also to farmers in the their southern States. A taxpayer in the Northern Territory will be able to write that off the cost of structural improvements have either in one year or over a period of to five years. What are structural improveI n the Northern Territory, they consist mainly of fences and bores. The cost of a rabbit-proof fence in the southern States will be deductible for taxation purposes in the year in which it is erected. Again it appears that the Northern Territory resident will have no advantage over a farmer in the southern States. He will obtain a slight concession for the cost of constructing dams and drilling bores. However, a farmer in the southern States will be permitted to write off labour costs for such work and, therefore, the advantage enjoyed by the Northern Territory producer will be very slight. That is the situation in a nut-shell. Primary producers who go to live in the distant outback in the Northern Territory, and thereby incur enormously increased expenses, will be offered very little encouragement. What are some of the additional expenses that they will incur? The report by Mr. Beattie, from which I have quoted, refers to holidays. It is obvious that meu and women cannot live throughout their lives in the remote parts of the Northern Territory unless they have occasional holidays. But the cost of going south for a holiday would certainly amount to a few hundred pounds for one person. Schooling involves another heavy expense. I met a public servant at Darwin who told me that he paid £500 a year from his income of £1,000 in order to send his three children to school in the south. The return air fare alone from Darwin to Adelaide is about £160. Obviously, a person with a large family is not in the race to give his children the sort of education that is available to most children in the southern States merely by walking only a few hundred yards every day. For these reasons, a greater degree of differentiation should be made for taxation purposes between residents of the Northern Territory and residents of other parts of Australia. People should be assured that exceptional returns will be available to them if they put up with the hardships of life in the Northern Territory. I ask the Government to reconsider this matter. There are two ways in which the situation can be rectified. Zone allowances are granted to residents of the Northern Territory, but they are inadequate. In the northern zone, which lies Jfr. Fairbairn. north of the tropic of Capricorn, a deduction of £120 a year is granted. In the southern zone, the deduction is £20 a year.",23
93,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,Does the honourable member consider that workers in the Northern Territory should be taxed?,27
94,Mr FAIBBAIBN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I shall make my views clear if the honourable member will remain silent. My answer to his inquiry is that the Government should increase the zone allowances considerably. 1 remind the honourable member that his former leader, Mr Chifley, did not see fit, when he was Treasurer, to grant a tax exemption to workers in the Northern Territory except in relation to the small zone allowances. Workers are badly needed in the Northern Territory, and, therefore, I consider that the Government should fix zone allowances of, say, £400 in the northern zone and £200 in the southern zone. Alternatively a proportion of the profits earned by residents of the two zones should be exempted from tax. The higher of the two concessions should apply. I have no particular proportion in mind. That is a matter for the Treasurer to consider. An exemption of 40 per cent, in the northern zone and one of 20 per cent, in the southern zone might be appropriate. The amount of revenue sacrificed by the Government would not be large. Honourable members probably are aware that there are only 118 productive leases in the Northern Territory. Many of those are held by companies, and my proposal is that a tax concession be granted, not to companies, but to resident owners only. The total amount of revenue lost to the Treasury would be negligible. For the information of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, according to Mr Beattie's report, there are 917 employees in the primary industries in the Northern Territory. If they were granted an exemption of £400 or £500 a year, the loss to the Treasury would be slight. The rest of the Australian continent was developed during a period when taxes were low, and primary producers were able to use their profits for the development and improvement of their properties. The Government should give to residents of the Northern Territory an equal opportunity to develop their holdings. Under this measure, it is being penny wise and pound foolish. I ask it earnestly to reconsider its decision.",27
95,Mr ANDREWS,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Darebin) [3.55] The Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) has claimed, in hi3 second-reading speech, that in conformity with the recommendations of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation, a new approach is made in this bill to the taxation of private companies. One can have the greatest sympathy with the right honourable gentleman when he refers to the tax imposts evolved in 1934 in connection with the undistributed incomes of private companies. He claims, at all events, that the principles which underlie this new approach are based on two motives which are, first, to protect the revenue; and, secondly, to provide for the development margins of private companies. When the matter is analysed more closely, we see that only the big private companies can profit substantially, from the new system, whilst the small companies will not gain anything from it in the way of an incentive. Again, it must be recalled, and recorded, that companies which may even serve to cause a lack of balance in the economy will be placed on exactly the same basis as those companies which are of basic and vital importance to the national economy. I shall quote an example in order to illustrate my meaning. A company which, has an income of £6,000 per annum is allowed, at the present time, £2,050 free of impost, apart from the basic rate of company tax. The Treasurer and the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation have pointed out that this figure represents 34.16 per cent, of the income of the company, which is,-regarded as a reasonable holding amount. But a private company which has an income in excess of £6,000 is to be subject to a per cent. Therefore, it is clear to me, at any rate, that big business can shelter under the provision that is now being made, whether or not its products are of any real value to the economy of the country. Above all, the proposed alteration seems to me to stress the fact that primary producers, who, in reality, need a real incentive to increase production in order that our overseas balances may be improved, are - treated in a niggardly manner in comparison with private companies. It has been emphasized repeatedly in various debates that have taken place in the House since the presentation of the budget last August that our greatest hope of acquiring overseas balances to pay for our imports of raw materials rests in the primary producing industries. I consider that if an incentive is to be given to any section of industry, it should be granted to those who will improve our overseas balances. This bill will not have that desirable effect. The Treasurer cannot claim that he has accepted the recommendations of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation in respect of the allowance of certain education expenses as deductions for income tax purposes. The right honourable gentleman, in this matter, has acted contrary to the recommendations of the committee in making provision for a tax concession of up to £50 on expenditure incurred on school fees, board and text-books. A reference to this matter may be found in the report of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation. The minute submitted to it by the Treasurer requested it to investigate and report on the following matter:Whether it is desirable that the provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1036-194!) relating to concessional allowances should be extended to allow a further deduction to taxpayers who incur expenditure in providing education or training for themselves or their dependants. The committee, in its report to the Treasurer, makes it clear that it has understood precisely the meaning of the minute, because it states in its reportThese representations are generally directed towards the allowance of income tax concessions on school fees (including boarding fees), expenditure on school books and equipment and donations to schools not conducted flat rate of 25 for private gain. In dealing with this subject, the committee referred to the deductions of the Royal Commission on Taxation 1932-34, because it quoted the following passage from the commission's report:We appreciate and sympathize with the motive underlying this allowance but we suggest that Income Tax Act is not the place in which to give effect to it. We consider that any concession that is made to a taxpayer for whose children the State does not provide suitable educational facilities should be given through the education department of the Statu, and not indirectly as a concession of tax. This would be of more value to the individual who liad no taxable income. Tke committee made the following finding:The Committee respectfully agrees with the views of the Royal Commission quoted above. It sympathizes with the taxpayers concerned, l t recognizes that State Governments have been saved considerable expenditure by parents sending tlieir children to non-government schools. The income tax law, however, is not the proper place to provide relief or assistance for such persons. The committee nroceeded to give its conclusions, which were as follows: The Committee, therefore, is unable to recommend allowance of income tax concessions for educational expenses.. Examination of this matter indicates that assistance to the schools is more justified than to the parents. If it is desired to give assistance to non-government schools, the committee 'Considers that it should be given by way of a direct subsidy to the schools not conducted fttr private gain. Therefore, notwithstanding that recommendation, and the boast of the. Treasurer that he is giving effect to the recommendations of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation, the right honourable gentleman has determined to adopt a new principle, and proposes that certain expenditure incurred by parents on the education of their children shall be allowable deductions for income tax purposes. I do not say that the new principle is not desirable in some ways, but I consider that it is true to say that the change is sectional to a marked degree in more ways than - one. Everybody realizes that only wealthy parents will derive benefit - from the concession. Less than 10 per cent, of the people affected can gain anyreal advantage from it . The other point which I emphasize is that no real relief is given to the nongovernment schools. Some benefit offered to (parents in respect of expenditure incurred on the purchase of textbooks and accessories, but it is limited to a marked - degree, and has only a sectional application. This will be granted only when the books arc purchased .at the colleges or uni-vevsitiep. It should .also 'be remembered that this provision will .grant an additional concession to the parents r!>ildi:en attending such -(-raitae*. Much 'of the profit made by ifr. Andrews. stalls conducted within State secondary schools is absorbed in the provision of sporting facilities and equipment chat normally would have to be provided by the parents of the children attending those schools. Therefore, the concession that is to be given will be confined to wealthy people, in the main, who will obtain two concessions. The first relates to expenditure incurred on school fees, board and the purchase of text-books, and the second relates to expenditure on the purchase of sporting equipment. The parents of children who attend primary schools will not find it easy to acquire advantages from this provision, even with respect to expenditure incurred on the purchase of text-books. According to my understanding of the position, only text-books issued by the education departments of the various States are obtainable from the primary schools. Therefore, the amount of the concession that will accrue to parents of cliildren attending such schools, through the purchase of text-books, may he regarded as completely negligible.",28
96,Mr J,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,OSSEE - Nonsense. !,29
97,Mr ANDREWS,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"It is not nonsense. My statement will bear the closest exaruuation. The only books 'that are sold in the primar y schools, either State or registered, aaie test-books - that .are issued by the education departments .of the Status. Therefore, the amount of - money that can - accrue from that source to the advantage of tihe school sports frond is extremely limited.

State schools could not receive the children who would be forced out of the schools that were closed, nor could the State provide teaching staffs to cope with the additional children. The result would be chaos. The problem is real, because events over the past 50 years have shown thst the people concerned intend to continue the alternative type of education. They believe conscientiously that a ourriciilum wider than that whioh is provided in the State schools is essential. Those people have already paid taxation for normal educational requirements. They believe that they have a legitimate claim for a concessional allowance from the Australian Government. The other side of the problem is just as serious because education is wider than actual teaching in the schools, and extends to the purchase of books. There is no such thing as education without books. Many education systems are said to be free. Nothing could be further from the truth. When parents have to buy the accessories of education, particularly text-books, education cannot be said to be free. In addition, proper buildings are essential, but they do not exist at many schools because of inadequate funds. Many buildings that are used are unfit for educational purposes. School buildings in rrr.F.r.y instances are built or improved with money that is raised on a 50-50 basis between the State and the people who live in the district where the schools are situated. Sometimes a shelter pavilion has to be built. In other place> ; .a library is required. Assembly halls are needed at schools but in the primary division often they do not exist in any form. Sporting facilities form another branch of education in which the parents are called upon to assist. The schools are suffering the lack of these facilities because of inadequacy of funds that are made available to the States through the Australian Government. Health is another important aspect of education. In Victoria, very little development has taken place in the dental services which should be provided fui every child. Care should be given to each child's mouth as soon as he or she begins at school, and it should continue until the child leaves, but dental .care in Victoria - is on a very limited scale. No reference is made in the bill to dental care, nor is there any provision for health inspection in the schools and the medical treatment that should follow if required. When we consider all the necessities that are incorporated in the field of education, it is obvious that the small concession that is provided in this bill, though good in itself, does not go far enough. The concession that is offered will bs acceptable and worthy of acceptance, but it will be of real value only to those who are favora.bly placed in the community. The Treasurer has established a new principle and I welcome it, but it does not go very far, and honourable members hope that there will be an extension of the educational grants that are made to the States so that educational facilities suited to a civilized community will be provided. When relief is given it should be granted to the school rather than to the parents of the children who are attending the school. The Commonwealth Committee on Taxation indicated clearly that it believed that any relief in the way of educational grants should be given directly to the schools so that advantage would accrue immediately to those attending the schools and those who had the burden of providing education facilities. Relief should be given to the schools and it should not be sectional as. this concession appears to be. I do not believe that it is intentionally sectional. A case was presented to the Treasurer and ho has taken cognizance of the arguments that were developed at the time, but the concession has turned out to be sectional and only a limited number of people will be able to derive advantages from it. The fairest method would be to provide some type of endowment on a per capita basis and pay it to the schools to which parents elect to send their children. In those circumstances, no accusation of sectionalism could properly be made, and a fair per capita sum would be paid to the schools, which would ensure that a reasonable education s'hould be given to school children throughout the Commonwealth. The Treasurer, having accepted the report of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation in one respect, has decided to give incentive tax concessions to private companies, irrespective of the value of the industry in which a company is engaged. I admit that the Government would have encountered great difficulties if it had attempted to discriminate between industries, but I take the view that, if it were right to give an incentive to ordinary companies, it would have been equally right to give a similar incentive to primary industries. There is a wide divergence between the incentive that the Government is offering to private companies in this measure and that which was offered to primary producers. I regard an incentive to primary producers as being more important than ah incentive to private companies. As I have said before in this chamber, we rely upon our primary producers to increase their production, so that we shall be able to strengthen our overseas balauces and purchase from abroad the raw materials that we need to expand our secondary industries. But the Government has decided to treat primary producers less favourably than private companies. The Treasurer has decided to reject the recommendations of the committee in relation to educational expenses and has exhibited again a bias in favour of those sections of the community which need tax concessions least. His proposals appear to be somewhat sectional. Therefore, I believe that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) is well founded, and that the clause which deals with educational expenses should be withdrawn, and then re-drafted in such a way that it will not be sectional in operation, but will assist the States to improve the educational facilities that they provide and to raise them to a standard more commensurate with the standards of an advancing civilized country.",29
98,Mr CRAMER,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Bennelong) [4.18] There is no doubt that the most unpopular task of any government is to levy taxes, because none of us likes to be taxed. debate upon an income tax assessment measure affords a grand opportunity for an opposition to say how much more it would expend upon this or that purpose than the Government proposes to expend. [Quorum formed.] Such a debate gives to an opposition a chance to make irresponsible suggestions. Let me say that I am not different from any other person in the community, and that I dislike taxation. I am opposed to high taxation. So also is this Government, and I propose to show that it is doing everything in its power to reduce taxes. It is necessary to do so, because high taxes are not beneficial either to this country or to. the people of it. High taxation, by destroying incentive, would ultimately cause a reduction of our standards of living. Last year, taxation in Australia was at the highest possible level. It reached that level because this Government inherited a political structure that was built during nine years of Labour rule. Unfortunately, some parts of that structure are still standing. We could not tear down the whole of the structure in, so to speak, five minutes without doing irreparable harm to the country. But we are engaged in the process of reducing the cost of government and of altering certain things that were done under Labour rule. When that process has been completed, we shall be able to reduce taxes. No one will deny that a great deal of our present expenditure is due to the aftermath of the' last war. In addition, we must expend enormous sums upon defence preparationsand national development. Therefore, there is no doubt that, at this stage of our history, a certain degree of high taxation is necessary in the interests of Australia. The personal criticism that has been levelled at the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) in connection with taxation is most unfair and cruel. I do not believe that those responsible for such personal criticism are playing the game. The right honourable gentleman has been criticized by members of the Parliament, by the public at large, and by newspapers. The press has made a habit of publishing criticisms of him. The The Treasurer does not determine national commitments. He plays a part in fixing them, but he is not entirely responsible for them. When those commitments have been determined, the Treasurer is asked to raise the money required to meet them. Therefore, if there because for complaint about taxation, it is unfair and cruel to lay the blame at the door of the Treasurer. If the right honourable gentleman has, in conjunction with other members of Cabinet, made an error-and doubtless he makes errors sometimes, in the same way as other people do-h e must accept his share of the blame for it, but it is wrong to level all criticism about taxation against him, as many people in this country are doing. The Government of the day must accept responsibility for its taxation proposals. This Government does not wish to evade that responsibility. The Government must decide what course of action it considers will serve the best interests of the country. This Government, having committed the country to a certain expenditure, has presented this income tax assessment measure, which is designed to raise the money that it needs. But the real bone of contention is, not the taxes that the Government proposes to levy, but the expenditure that renders those taxes necessary. If the Government were not committed to its present .expenditure, it would not have to levy taxes of this magnitude on the people. Criticism should be directed to expenditure, rather than to taxes. I believe that if the people analyse the budget fairly, they will agreethat it is impossible for the Government to present to the Parliament any taxation proposals different from those contained in this measure. There is a howl that taxation is too high, and that it should be reduced. I agree that it is high-it is too high for me-bu t that is necessary because of our commitments. The Government proposes, under t h i terms of this measure, to raise a sum of approximately £863,000i,000 this year. ""When we analyse the position, we find that £200,000,000 of that sum will be expended upon defence; £300,000,000 upon social services, repatriation, and similar objects; almost £30,000,000 upon the payment of bounties and subsidies; £178,000,000 upon payments to the States; £106,000,000 upon Commonwealth capital works; and £10,000,000 upon Commonwealth territories. All that is left for expenditure upon other governmental activities is the sum of about £40,000,000. In those circumstances, one wonders how taxes could be reduced in the present circumstances. I should like the Opposition to say upon what items it considers expenditure should be reduced. Will honourable gentlemen opposite say, for instance, that £200,000,000 should not be expended this year upon defence ?. Is there any one in Australia who will say that we should not expend £300,000,000 this year upon social services and repatriation benefits ? During the brief period that I have been a member of the Parliament, there has been a continuous demand for an increase of expenditure upon social services and repatriation benefits. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot have our cake and eat it too. If we ask for expenditure upon certain services to be increased, we must be prepared to accept measures of this kind. It is of no use to dodge the issue, because we have to be practical in these matters. There is no doubt that the Government could have further reduced taxes had it been influenced by the claims of certain sections of the community, particularly the Communist party, that too much money has been allocated for defence purposes. We could indeed have reduced taxes by another £50,000,000 by the simple expedient of cutting defence expenditure by that amount, but who in this country who has any care for Australia and its future would be prepared to take the responsibility of reducing the defence allocation of £200,000,000 for this financial year? Anybody who reduced that allocation would be knowingly doing something of a destructive nature. _ The bill contains some excellent provisions, for which the Government deserves congratulations, in addition to the provision for a reduction of income tax by 10 per cent. Por instance, the system of advance payments of tax by companies, which was instituted last year, is to be discontinued. The abandonment of that system will be of great assistance to companies even though the total amount involved is not great. I am sure that companies will see in this proposal an effort by the Government to give to them at least some breathing space. The distributable income in excess of £6,000 which a private company may retain free of tax is to be increased. That provision will be helpful to private companies generally and small business organizations in particular. Honourable members opposite who have spoken in this debate have claimed that this bill has been introduced mainly for the benefit of rich people. The last provision that [ have mentioned will be of great help to small industries and will enable them to plough back their profits and use their money to much better advantage than they were able to use it before, because they will not be obliged to pay tax on undistributed profits.. I congratulate the Treasurer for having dealt with this matter in this way. Some honourable members opposite have had a great deal to say about allowable deductions in respect of expenditure on the education of dependent children. In my opinion not many of the honourable members opposite who have spoken on this subject knew what they were talking about. The outstanding fact is that a Labour Government did nothing, during its nine years of office, to extend to the people the concession that this Government is extending to them in that respectIn this instance it remained for a nonLaboxir government, as in other cases in the past, to introduce improvements of social services and other benefits that had been established by previous non-Labour governments. The Labour party has left its political opponents to do such things although its members claim that they are the protectors of the poor. The Government has broken new ground in relation to allowable deductions for education expenses. No doubt as the years go by this concession may take different forms. It may require amendment, but, in the meantime, let credit be given where credit is due, that is, to the Government and the much-criticized Treasurer who has introduced this splendid piece of legislation. There are many thousands of aged people in this country who may confidently look to this Government for the protection that was denied to them by the Labour party when it held office. I Mr Cramer. refer par ticularly to the fact that the Government has each year accorded some benefit to elderly people,, who are often the forgotten people of the community because their votes are not considered to be important. The Government proposes that an elderly couple, whose combined income does not exceed £507 a year, shall be free of income tax. Surely honourable members opposite should give credit to the Government for that provision. The Government's proposals in relation to payment of tax on the proceeds of the sale of goodwill of a property are to be commended. The taxing of goodwill has been a very sore point with business people for many years. It has been an unfair tax which has tended to destroy the incentive of people to develop businesses, for the reason that if they should be forced to dispose of such businesses later they would find themselves heavily taxed on account of the goodwill in the business that they had developed through their energy, capacity and hard work. The Treasurer has seen fit to extend relief to such people so that goodwill will be free of tax unless the parties to the sale and purchase of a business make an agreement in that respect. Sometimes a part of the transaction of acquiring a business is that the purchaser wishes the purchase price to be shown as a deduction from income. Eor businessmen generally, and particularly for small businessmen, however, this provision will prove to be very acceptable. Again it has been left to this Government to break new ground in respect of this matter. The Labour party could well have taken such action to encourage business people. It did not see fit to do so, yet its members are now mean enough to withhold credit from the Government ior this aotion. These remarks may also be applied to the reductions that are to be given in respect of non-profit clubs and organizations. Such reductions should have been brought into operation a long time ago in order to encourage the sporting activities of young people. I am glad that the matters that I have mentioned have been covered in the bill. There are other matters to which I might refer, but I do not wish to traverse ground that has already been well covered. One matter,, however, to which I wish to direct attention, is the double taxation that is imposed in relation to the profits of companies. That is a matter about which there has been a great deal of press publicity. I agree that, on the face of it, such taxation does not appear to be fair. It has been stated in many press reports that the practice of taxing the profits at the source and then in the hands of the shareholders, is not followed in other countries. I believe, however, that mucb misunderstanding could occur in relation to this matter. Provided such a tax were operated in a certain way it could be a veiy fair kind of tax. After all, the matter is one not of the system that is followed, but of the sum total of the taxes levied on the .profits of companies in the first place and, in the second place, on the shareholders as individual taxpayers. The taxpayer today pays income tax in accordance with the source of derivation of his income. If the whole of his income is derived from dividends he pays his tax accordingly. If , on the other hand, as happens in most cases, his income from dividends is additional to otlier income, he is taxed on a different basis. It is obvious that the amount of tax paid by shareholders on dividends varies in accordance with the amount of other income that they may receive, and therefore, the poorer people pay less on income from dividends and rich people pay more. The principal thing to be considered in this matter is the total amount of tax that is levied on the profits of a company in the form of the tax on the company's profits added to the tax on the amount that the shareholders receive in dividends. When tliese two, added together, are an unreasonable amount,, then something has to be done in the way of reducing tax in either form, or both forms. If the maximum total amount of tax that the Government wished to levy ou the profits of companies were first set, then the at shareholders might not be liable to so heavy a tax, because the direct tax on the company's profits might have amounted to almost the required maximum. Many other countries adopt that practice. Some adopt the practice of a reduced scale of taxes in relation to dividends received by shareholders. However, let there be no misunderstanding about this matter. The tax on dividends and company profits is not so unfair as many people try to make it appear to be, because the rate of tax on company profits is much lower than in this country than in many other countries. Even when the two forms of tax on company profits are added together the total is not higher, than the rate of tax on company profits in other countries that I could name. So. whilst I do not approve, as a matter 6f general principle, a system which appears to involve double taxation of profits I consider that the matter could be handled in such a way that it would not really be double taxation but would mean that the people best able to pay would pay the most. Many honourable members on this side of the chamber may disagree with my views on this matter, but I do not consider this form of tax to be so cruel as many people would have us believe it to be. There are other forms of taxation which are more obnoxious. I refer particularly to the pay-roll tax. I believe this to be an iniquitous tax which should be removed at the earliest possible moment. The point is, how can the Government remove such taxes unless at the same time it can reduce its expenditure? That is the crux of the matter. I suggest, therefore, that we should apply ourselves not only to achieving a more equitable form of levying taxes, but also to reducing expenditure and, in particular, reducing the cost of government. I have spoken on previous occasions about the high cost of government, which is getting out of all proportion in this country, but if we, as a people, insist on great expenditures on ali kinds of services then we have to pay for them by means of high taxes. Nobody wants high taxes, so let us apply ourselves to the task of reaching a point which Australian governments, Federal,. State and local, will operate as efficiently as they should but at the lowest possible cost. In this way only can we achieve a reduction of taxes. I believe that taxes are now at the highest possible level and that we must attempt to bring them down. I believe also that this Government will do so, because such an objective is inherent in its policy. It is committed to an expenditure of £200,000,000 for defence this year which it will, not be committed next year, and so the people of the future can forward, with this Government in control, to still lower taxes. Mr E. JAMES HARBISON (Blaxland) [4.44] - I doubt whether honourable member bers have ever been charmed with a speech of less fire than that of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Cramer). I can only assume that his oration was means whereby he tried to skirt round the issues at stake by making statements that he does not believe to be true. The honourable member for Bennelong said budget that members of the Opposition should not attack the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) as though he were solely responsible for the budget. I propose to criticize the right honourable gentleman in respect of glaring inconsistencies cent between statements that he made when Kingdomis introducing the budget on this occasion and when he introduced the budget last year. He must accept responsibility statements that he himself has made. I any event, Government supporters have not been diffident in making unfair parisons, particularly in respect fence expenditure, in their attempts present Labour's record in an unfavorduring able light. The honourable member for paigns. Bennelong had the decency to acknowFarrer ledge the fact that even at this late hour the Australian Government has the responsibility of meeting expenditure that arose directly as a result of. World War I I . Would not the Chifley Government, which was in office during that conflict, have been confronted with expenditure for 1949-50on defence of an amount srreatly in excess of that which confronts this Government seven years after the end of that conflict? The honourable member for Farrer (Mr. Fairbairn) said that whilst Government supporters would naturally desire provision along the lines of the amendamounted ment they could not do so because they recognized that the Government had meet additional expenditure in respect more urgent matters. He instanced addiGovernment tional expenditure for the current finantended cial year in respect of defence and social services. That argument was, to a degree, reasonable, but other Government supyear porters claimed that Labour had failed make adequate provision for defence. to Furthermore, the Treasurer has sought to justify the continuation of high taxalook tion by comparing tax rates in this country with those in Great Britain and. New Zealand. Members of the Opposition have no alternative but to answer such arguments. If the honourable memfor Farrer were justified in claiming that the Government is unable to reduce taxes further because of its increased expenditure on defence, surely the coma parison that the Treasurer made between tax rates in this country and those in Great Britain and New Zealand was totally irrelevant to a consideration of the proposals. I recall that the. honourable member for Farrer, when he was speaking in the budget debate on the 10th October of last year, saidAt present, Australia is spending 5.9 per of its national income on defence, America spending 8.2 per cent, and the United 9.9 per cent. Having regard to statements of that for kind by Government supporters, the n Opposition is fully justified in regarding the Treasurer's speeches on financial commeasures as merely pretexts for the of deGovernment's failure to honour the to promises that it made to the people the last two general election camThe honourable member for told only half the story when he said that the Ohifley Government, during its last year of office, expended only £80,000,000 on defence. I shall refutethat claim by quoting the following statement that was made by the late Mr. Chifley when he introduced his budget On the basis of existing commitments that expenditure on Defence, and War (1939-45) Services is estimated at £154,000,000 as compared with £195,600,000, in 1948-49. The Chifley Government's expenditure to make on war and post-war commitments in 1948-49 to £195,000,000. So much for the claim that that Governto ment expended only £50,000,000 on de-' of fence during its last year of office. supporters have also conthat the Government cannot afford to reduce taxes further because it has to meet an expenditure on defence this of £200,000,000. In view of such to statements, it is important to examine the degree to which Labour was able to reduce taxes in a financial year in which it met an expenditure of £195,000,000 on war and post-war requirements. When this Government assumed office the basic wage was £6 9s. a week. Let us see how a taxpayer on the basic wage fared under Labour. When tax rates - were at their highest during World War II , a taxpayer, with a wife and two children, whose income was £350, paid £31 2s. in tax. From the 1st July, 1946, to the 1st July, 1949, the Chifley Government progressively reduced the tax that such a taxpayer had to pay to £26 15s., £21 3s., £5 5s., £3 15s., and £2 4s. The last reduction was made in a year in which the Chifley Government budgeted for an expenditure of £195,000,000 on war and .post-war requirements. The Treasurer, when introducing this measure, saidWhen I expluiued the Government's plans I'or financing: its operations in the nnanciai year HHS2-H3, in the hudget speecli delivered by me on the (ith August, 1952, I announced Government's intention to reduce taxation by approximately £50,000,000 in the current finjincial year. The Government is not giving effect to that intention. It is merely lifting the 10 per cent, flat rate levy that it imposed on personal and company incomes last year. The statements that were referred to in the budget speech show that last year the tax payable by a taxpayer with an income of £600 was increased from £18 16s. to £20 14s., and tlat this year, after allowing for the reductions to be effected under this measure, sueh a taxpayer will pay tax at the rate that applied to him before the 10 per cent, flat rate surcharge was imposed. If the Government intends to increase taxes in one year and to remove the increase in the following year, it will be able every alternate year to claim that it has honoured its promise to the people to reduce taxes. The honourable member for Bennelong said that the Government was makng a substantial concession to companies, but all that it is proposing to do is to hand back to them the amount of tax that it filched from them last year. In respect of company taxation, the Treasurer has completely reversed the attitude that he adopted last year. When he introduced his budget for 1951-52, he explained the reason for the introduction of the system of advance payment of a portion of company tax in the following words:Since the tax payable by companies is not assessed until some months after the close of the year of income, there is, in the opinion of the Government, a clear case for some advance paj'ment by companies of part of the tax t<> which the earned profits are liable. Since the system of pay-as-you-earn for wage and salary earners and collection of provisional taxation from individuals was introduced, companies have been at some advantage as regards payment. That advantage is found in companies being able to use, for long periods, the money represented by the tax due by them. In the current financial year the aggregate sum will exceed £100,000,000. Those words were uttered not by any member of the Australian Labour party, but by the Treasurer when he was introducing his budget last year. He continuedThere is also some inherent danger to revenue in the delayed system of company the taxation. In some cases money held by largo companies runs into six figures, and should misfortune overtake the company there may be total or substantial loss to revenue, notwithstanding the priority of the Crown in liquidation, which applies only as against, unsecured creditors. If there is one section of that speech that calls for the severest criticism it is the passages that I have just quoted. If the Treasurer was justified in making those statements, how can he justify his attitude today, only eleven months later? In introducing his current budget, he saidThe system of advance payments by companies instituted last year will be discontinued. This means that in the current financial year companies will not he required to make any advance payments based upon the income of "" the year ended the 30th June, 1952. The advance payments imposed in respect of the income of the year 1950-51 will be credited against company tax assessable during the current financial year. The cost to revenue in the current financial year is estimated nt. £14,000,000. Whereas, last year, the Treasurer said that the 10 per cent, flat rate levy would yield an additional sum of £11,200,000 in company tax, he has now told a totally different story. Tet, the honourable member for Bennelong claims that members of the Opposition could not justify criticism of the budget. The Treasurer said that the main effect of the legislation will .be to remove the special .levy of 10 per cent, that it was found necessary to impose on individual taxpayers last year. He said that the benefit to individual taxpayers in the current year will amount to £23,000,000. Last year he .saidHence although 'the proposed change would, on the basis of current incomes, yield £38,000,000 in a full assessment year, it is estimated that the extra collections in this financial year will not exceed £25,000,000. Surely a responsible Treasurer who reports on a matter in 1951 and on the very same matter in 1952 should be sure of his information. The Treasurer has shown that he was not sure about his figures, yet honourable members on the Government side have complained that he is being criticized. The Treasurer has com- p'letely disregarded the statements that he made in 1951, and honourable members on the Government side have completely misunderstood the statements of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) about the taxation of wage-earners. The right honourable gentleman said that wage earners would be taxed more heavily this year because of basic wage increases, yet becanse he said that ridicule was heaped upon him by the Treasurer, whose own assessments of revenue have proved to be wrong. The basic wage earner in any country of the world may be considered to be the worker on a subsistence living standard. When the 1951-52 budget was brought down, the Australian basic wage was about £500 a year. If a basic wage earner in 1951 had a dependent wife and two children his income tax would have amounted to £8 14s. By the time the 1951-52 budget was introduced that was . increased to £9 l is . Honourable members should remember that the O series - index is an index that relates to purchasing power, so that no. matter what the basic wage may be the basic wage earner can buy only the same quantity of goods with it. However, because the basic wage has been mcreased by about £2 a week 6ince September., 1951, a New South Wales basic wage earner now receives about £611 a year. The Treasurer has not reduced the basic wage earner's income tax to the rate that prevailed in 1951-52; he has increased it from £9 l is . to £1S 16s. Mr E. James Harrison. Tthe Treasurer has tried to hide that fact by suggesting that, after .all, Australians are Jiot taxed so heavily as are the people of New .'Zealand and Great Britain. The Treasurer's taxation schedules in relation to income tax in Great Britain are as unreliable as his othei' .figures. Let us carefully consider taxation in Great Britain in order to see how erroneous the figures given by the Treasurer really are. I have investigated taxation figures as .set out in Britain, a reference handbook issued in 1952 by the Central Office of Information, London. I refer honourable members to page 210 of that book, where certain "" working conditions in practice "" are set out. Among other things, honourable members will perceive that the normal hours of work and the average wages earned in respect of British workers are set out. The Treasurer tried to impress upon honourable members that in the TJnited Kingdom the income tax levy on a person with an income of £600 a year is £24 18s., whereas in Australia it will be £18 16s. The fact is that because this Government is incapable of handling our financial affairs and because the currency of Australia is more highly inflated than is that of any other country of the world, whether it be in the dollar area or in the .sterling area, we have reached a stage where we can favourably compare the general position of the average wage-earner in Britain with that of the average wage-earner in Australia. Because I know something of the conditions and rates of pay of railway men in Australia, I have selected from page 111 of the volume that I mentioned figures relating to the average wages of railway men in Great Britain. In April, 1950, the average wage of such workers was 139s. 2d. Since that time it has been increased by 1 \ per cent, and that increase has raised the wage to about £7 10s. a week. If the Treasurer were honest he would regard that sum as an average figure",31
99,Mr SPEAKER,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Order ! The honourable member must not call into question the honesty of another honourable member. Mr E. JAMES HAEEISON - Then I shall put the matter in this way: If the Treasurer desires to put a. factual picture before the Parliament, be sbould bave considered this information, which is just 1 as easily available to him as it is to me. Moreover, he has many more officers to collect information for him than have honourable members on this side of the House. If he had done as I have done he would have discovered that the average wage of a British railway wage-earner was about £7 IGs: a. week or £390 a year. On that income the worker has to pay £11 ISs. a year as income tax and social services contribution-and I remind honourable members that the British social services are of much more value than are the Australian social services. The average earnings of an Australian railway worker are the basic wage plus half the margin applicable to a tradesman. Therefore,, in New South Wales the average wage paid to a railway worker is about £670 a year. On that sum the worker has to pay about £21 for income tax. In view of those facts, the Treasurer should not' have tried to sidetrack honourable members by saying that after all the Australian worker is better off than is the British worker. An average wage-earner in England pays £11 15s. as income tax but receives; many more social benefits than this Government ever dreamed of. An Australian worker who is in the same relative position has to pay £21 as income tax, yet his wages have the same purchasing power as have those of his British counterpart. Now let us consider New Zealand. The position is not so clear there as it is in England, but honourable members must remember that the New Zealand Government, which ' is of the same political colour as this Government, has had the courage to maintain prices control and has restricted wage levels. When the New Zealand Government introduced a minimum wage it did not take any power from its arbitration court, it merely set the minimum living standard. At present the minimum standard wage is £6 l is . 8d. a week, and that is comparable with the £11 15s. that now operates in New South Wales, because both wages have the same purchasing power. If honourable members study the information that is available to them they will discover that what I have Been saying is quite correct. However, they have not bothered to do so because they have not sufficient interest in the Australian worker. The document presented by the Treasurer sets out rates of income tax in New Zealand compared with those in Australia. Let us consider the case of a person who has: a dependent wife and two children. I refer honourable members to The Taxpayer, the official organ of the Taxpayers: Association of Queensland, dated June,. July, August, 1952. At page 13, referring to New Zealand income tax and social security charge, it reportsBasic rates of tax were fixed by the Land* and Income Tax Amendment Act 1940. . The starting rate is 2s. 6d. in the f l upon, the first £100 of taxable balance. The taxable balance is the amount that remains after a. deduction has been made of £100 in respect of the taxpayer, £100 in respect of his wife and £50 for each child. Therefore, in New Zealand not ld. is paid as income tax by a man with a wife and two children who receives £300 a year. Yet the Treasurer has asked honourable members to treat seriously the contents of his document, which are completely erroneous. In New Zealand a taxpayer who receives the minimum wage pays £25 10s. for social services, whilst a similar - Australian worker pays £20 as income tax. However,, honourable members should remember that the New Zealand worker has many more social benefits than has the Australian worker. He has universal superannuation and age, widows, orphans, family, invalid, minors, war, unemployment, sickness, and emergency benefits. In the field of health he has medical,, hospital, maternity, and pharmaceutical benefits.",37
100,Mr SPEAKER,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,38
101,Mr ROBERTON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Riverina) [5.14] I rise to support the bill and to oppose the amendment. I express my gratitude to the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Bernard Corser), who has provided me with this opportunity to enter the debate. It is not generally known that every honourable member on this side of the House wants to address himself to the bill, but that, because of the time factor, it will not be possible for all of us to do so. The honourable member for Wide Bay was entitled to receive the call from the Chair on this occasion, but he has graciously given way to me. We have just heard a diatribe by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr E. James Harrison) that was typical of all the speeches that have been made in this debate by members of the Labour party. The mathematics of the lionorable member, to put it kindly, are not all that might be, and honourable members on this side of the House can only treat them with the compassion that they deserve. He repeated all the arguments against this biU that were used by other members of the Opposition. They can be condensed into a phrase of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt), who said that the proposed 10 per cent, reduction of income tax was valueless. The honourable member for Blaxland took great pains to endeavour to demonstrate that the unguarded statement made by his leader was true. However, a comparison of the taxes paid by an Australian with a dependent wife and two children with those paid by a man in New Zealand in similar circumstances proves positively the nebulous character of the arguments used by the Opposition. Eor the purposes of comparison, I shall refer first to a man with an income of £600 a year. Very few Australians will be interested in smaller incomes than that, although, for the greater part of my life, I received only a fraction of that amount each year. A New Zealander in the circumstances that I have mentioned will pay income tax amounting to £57 l is . 3d. this year. An Australian on the same footing will pay only £18 16s. Thus, the Australian will be better off by an amount of £38 15s. 3d. Yet the Leader of the Opposition said that the 10 per cent, reduction would be of no value! A taxpayer with a wife and two children, who has an income of £800 year, is required in New Zealand to income tax amounting to £105 7s. 6d. His counterpart in Australia will pay £46 6s., which represents a saving £59 ls. 6d. Yet the Opposition argues that taxation in Australia is too severe and that it is unfair to compare it with taxation in our sister dominion! A New Zealander with three dependants who Mr Roberton. receives £1,000 a year will pay £158 8s. Sd. in income tax this year. In Australia, those of us who receive £1,000 a year will pay £83 4s., which represents a saving of £75 4s. 9d. Yet honourable members opposite argue that the Government's tax concessions are of no value I The. New Zealander, if he earned £1,500 a year, would be called upon to pay £315 123. 6d. The Australian on the they same salary will pay £208 3s., which represents a saving of £107 9s. 6d. The comparison could be extended indefinitely, but I shall deal finally with an income of £2,000 a year. The New Zealander on that salary will pay £510 12s. 6d. The Australian will pay £375 17s., which represents a saving of £144 15s. a year,, a sum on which many men of my generation have reared families. Thus, the argument that the proposed reductions will be of no value must be discounted. The contention that income tax in Australia has reached an intolerable level is obviously fallacious. Bates of tax in Australia are far below those that apply just across the Tasman Sea, where both primary and secondary production are increasing. The arguments that have been used by honourable members opposite in condemnation of the bill and in support of the proposed amendment have been based on the shibboleth that the Government ought to put value back into the £1. I , in common with all. honourable members on this side of the House, believe it to be necessary to restore value to the £1 and that, until we succeed in doing so, very little can be done to extricate the country from its present fabulous situation. Under the Constitution, certain courses of action that might help to restore value to the £1 are beyond the power of the Government to take, but the Labour party, because of its industrial character, could do much to put value a back into the £1. It must be obvious pay to everybody who has made even an elementary study of our economic situation that the present condition of comof parative prosperity in Australia is entirely due to the misery of the rest of the world and the demand for our goods that results from that misery. However, we arc doing nothing to justify our prosperity. If we had any true national spirit, we should be taking advantage of our extraordinarily fortunate circumstances in order to increase all classes of production sp that we should be in a position to meet the emergencies that must inevitably beset us when the miseries of other countries pass and a condition of tranquillity is restored. Instead, we are taking advantage of our prosperity in order to indulge in all sorts of industrial excesses and abuses. The whole economy is imperilled because we are not in a position to withstand reverses. The views that have been expressed by members of the Labour party during this - debate and in earlier debates are not typical of the views that were constantly expressed by distinguished members the party in former years. I propose to approximately - quote the statements of a man who perhaps, one of the most distinguished of all Labour party leaders. In Novemresponsibility ber, 1946, he saidWe ahull be wise, I believe, to pursue steady course, taking advantage of favourable conditions as they occur, striving for greater output in all industries. In 1947, this leader of the Labour party laid particular stress oh the exchange shortage and saidThis means, among other things, unremitting efforts for greater production. In a broadcast from London in July, 1948, he made this declarationHard work is not only a national duty, the stern responsibility of every Australian if we are to survive. After his return to Australia, he went Cessnock, New South Wales, in Sepproduction tember, 1948, and told the miners that he was ashamed to find Sydney sufferweek ing deprivations as bad as those of conquered Berlin. He also saidEvery member of the community who fails at this stage to do his job only cheats fellow-workers. Vote for whom you like, but for God's sake do your best for your country. The passages that I have quoted have been extracted from speeches made by late Right Honourable J. B . Chifley.' visible gains resulted fro m his exhortasystem tions, and they have not been repeated his successors. No members of the Labour party have repeated those sentithe ments, although it is obvious that the courses of action that he advocated are mankind. even more important today than they were when he made his pronouncements. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) has attempted to bolster his criticism of the bill with the statement that the last budget of the Chifley Government aggregated a sum of approximately £50.4,000,000. At the same time, members of the Opposition have argued that the value of money has depreciated until our currency today is almost valueless. If it be reasonable to find merit in a budget that amounted to £504,000,000 in 1949, on the ground that the £1 was worth its full face value then, and if it be true that the value of money has since depreciated to the degree that has been suggested by the Opposition, this of Government's budget for 1952-53, of £1,000,000,000, must was, be a comparatively humble budget. Those of us who have any sense of must take advantage of every opportunity to warn the community a. as a whole that a'budget of £1,000,000,000, or any sum approximating that fabulous figure, can be sustained only if our export industries' are prosperous. Should the vagaries of seasons cause production in those industries to f all , or should the miseries of other countries, on which our national income is based, pass, it might not be financially possible for the people of Australia to maintain budgets of such vast proportions. Therefore, I take but this opportunity to say that we must work harder now than we have worked at any time during the last decade. We to must put the people to work on effective regardless of the political consequences. I believe that the 40-hour was the greatest single disaster ever visited upon an intelligent community. Our experiences since that spurious industrial standard was estabhis lished have led us to believe that it is not possible to carry on the normal services of our nation with a 40-hour the week and that, the sooner this abominaNo tion is eliminated from our economic and people are given the opporby tunity to use their energies and their ingenuity for the everlasting good of country regardless of hours of work, the better will it be for the whole of",38
102,Mr CURTIN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,The old squatter!,40
103,Mr ROBERTON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I have repeatedly been referred to in this House as a "" tycoon of the squattocracy "" and "" the old squatter"". No other honourable member lives in more humble circumstances than I do, and that includes the honourable member for Watson (Mr . Curtin). I shall now deal with other aspects of the matter. Like most people who are not personally interested in private or public companies, I may be pardoned for thinking that company taxation is no great concern of mine, and that companies are fair "" game "" to this Government or any other government. That view is held by Opposition members, who perhaps are interested in companies, and by persons who are not interested in them, and perhaps it was held by me u n t i l itbecame necessary for me to inform myself of the true position. The Government is to be commended for the amelioration of the circumstances of, and for the reduction of the tax that has been applied to, companies in the past, even if the reduction be only of a minor character. The value of the lowly investor-the men and women who, by their own t h r if t , have saved a few pounds and invested the money in industry-ha s never been appreciated in this country. On the contrary, they have been constantly the objects of reproach and blame. H ad not been for the lowly investor-th and women who have husbanded their resources and invested their small savings in companies-democrac y could not have survived and industry could not have - the functioned in our country. Not a single industry could operate if it were not for will the many persons who invested their and all in industrial activities likely to yield to them some advantage after the in it i periods of establishment. T e t those persons are constantly blamed by OpposiI tion members, and constantly taxed successive governments. In my humble opinion, a tax that takes from companies 1 s. in every £1 of profit up to £5,000, 9s. in every £1 of profit in excess of sum, is most severe.",41
104,Mr CURTIN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,The Government should tax companies on that scale.,41
105,Mr ROBERTON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"H a d it not been for the lowly men and women who were courageous enough to invest their savings in the engineering industries, the honourable member for Watson would not have been apprenticed as a boilermaker, and would never have been a satisfactory member of the industrial community. A f t e r the Government has taken its toll, the shareholders, when the residue of the profit is distributed among them, pay tax on their dividends. That is an additional impost, and should be recognized as such. All honourable members have cause for gratitude in the fact that there are persons who are willing, and sometimes eager, to invest their savings in companies. T e t those investors are frequently the objects of blame and reproach, not only applied to them personally, but also applied to their operations in the financing of public and private companies. I now propose to deal with a matter that is, to me, a "" burning question"". The Treasurer., in his second-reading speech, made the following statement:A most important amendment proposed in this bill is the allowance, foT the first time in the history of Commonwealth income tax, of a concessional deduction in respect of expenses incurred by parents in educating families. Having regard to the ever-increasing costs of education, this concession will represent a very acceptable and practical form of taxation relief at the present time. it I entirely agree with that view. The e men right honourable gentleman continuedTaxpayers will be allowed a deduction as from the 1st July, 1952, of amounts pair! to schools, colleges or universities for the full time education of dependent children under age of 21 years. The allowance will be subject to a maximum deduction of £50 for each child. I emphasize that the allowance include tuition fees, board, text-books extras, so long as the amounts claimed have been paid directly to the educational a l institution in connection with the full-time education of the child. must confess that such a statement wa3 by a disappointment to me, because I had listened with great interest to the welcome news announced by the Treasurer when and he presented his budget to the chamber. that On that occasion, the right honourable gentleman saidBecause of increasing costs of education, representations have been received from a wide cross-section of the community for some relief on account of expenditure incurred by parents in educating families. It is proposed accordingly to allow parents a concessional deduction for education expenses incurred up to a maximum of £50 for each dependent child under 21 years receiving f time education. This concession will commence to apply on and from 1st July, 1952, at an annual cost t;j revenue of approximately £1,500,000. There will , however, be no cost to revenue in the current financial year 1952-53. I was one who welcomed that information as I welcomed no other information given to me since I have had the privilege to be a member of this House, because education is a "" burning question"" in the country, and particularly in rural New South Wales. The educational facilities available to our people there today are not comparable with what were available a quarter of a century ago. In truth, there are no educational facilities for many children in rural New South Wales. The correspondence course conducted by the Education Department of that State is a satisfactory arrangement, but it requires, of necessity, some one to supervise the pupil in the studies sent to him under that system. But apart from that, no educational facilities are available for hundreds of children in the electorate of Biverina, unless they are removed from their homes and established, with board and lodging, in a country town or provincial city. Because of that, education has been a penalty on country men and women, and a constant and recurring - penalty on country children. I , for one, welcome the information that this Government is willing and eager to accept its responsibilities in this matter, and at least to allow a deduction of £50 for taxation purposes in respect of expenditure incurred on the education and board of, and purchase of text-books for, each dependent child under the age of 21 years. Though we should be thankful for small mercies-and I am-this is not only a small mercy but also an exclusive mercy. It is a mercy that is exclusive to those persons who send their children away to schools that require the parents to pay fees. That provision excludes the parents of countless hundreds of country children who are sent away to State schools in distant towns or cities, because their parents cannot afford to educate them at private schools. Because the parents do not pay fees to the State schools, they do not qualify for the propose 1 deduction for education purposes. Yet they are u l l - burdened with the cost of the board and lodging of the children, wherever they may be. It is a burden that has become almost intolerable to country people. Whilst I welcome the Government's intention in this matter, I hope that the scope of the provision will be broadened in order to include a parent who' has to pay for the board and lodging of children who attend schools in - distant towns because no State educational facilities are available near their homes. This provision is a major step forward. Although it is exclusive at the moment, it is one of transcendent importance to country life and living. If we can remove the senseless penalty that is imposed by the education problem on country men, women and children, we shall do much to bridge the gap that lies between the urban population and the rural population. At present, that gap is almost too wide to be bridged. Apart from tliose reservations, I consider that the Government is to be commended for having introduced its "" convalescent"" budget in a courageous way.",41
106,Mr RIORDAN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Kennedy) [5.44] - I listened with great interest to the various speeches made on this bill, and particularly that of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Cramer), who said that the Government was opposed to the principal of high taxation and, as a matter of policy, was opposed to the imposition of high taxes. As he was speaking, I recalled that the last budget presented to the Parliament by the late Mr J. B. Chifley provided for a total revenue of £504,387,000. Last year, this Government, which is said to believe in tax reductions, introduced a budget that made provision for the collection of £919,000,000. The Treasurer (Sir Arthur Eadden), when he presented that - budget to the Parliament, explained that the additional revenue was sought because the Government wished to relieve the community of its surplus spending power and, in that way, grapple with the mighty problem of inflation. In order to give effect to that policy, the Treasurer made provision for the imposition of a special levy of 10 per cent, on all taxes payable by individuals. That impost brought the total to £919,000,000 but this year there has been a remarkable change and the total is back to £863,650,000. That is 71 per cent, more than the total in the last budget of the Chifley Government and apparently it is supposed to be indicative of the low taxation policy of the present Government. The Treasurer in his budget speech referred to a reduction of taxation by £50,000,000. Actually the Government is removing only the 10 per cent, surcharge. An examination of the estimated revenue of the Government this year indicates where its so-called low taxation policy has taken the nation. If the Government had been grappling with the problem of taxation and innation since it took office instead of waiting for something to turn up, the honourable member for Bennelong might have had some support for the argument that he has advanced. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Roberton) made a comparison between the tax that is paid by certain taxpayers in Australia and New Zealand. The honourable member did not tell the House of the difference between costs in New Zealand and those in Australia. He made no reference to the - comparative basic wage levels in the two countries or to the fact that the basic wage in Australia is now approaching £600 a year because of the inability of the Government to control commodity prices. Prices have risen and wages are chasing them. The result has been a fall of living standards. When this Government was in Opposition, it would not support the Labour Administration in its request for powers for the Parliament to deal with the problem of inflation. Clause 6 of the bill is a fairly long but the Treasurer has indicated that he proposes to have it omitted. The Commonwealth Committee on Taxation filled sixteen foolscap pages with reasons why the proposal incorporated in that clause should be introduced. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) has stated, the omission is intended because of pressure of public opinion or, perhaps, of certain newspaper interests. The only Jfr. Riordan. other possible explanation is that the Cabinet did not give to the matter the consideration that it deserved. There can be no middle ground. For the first time, I find myself of the same opinion as a member of the Australian Country party. Our meeting ground is clause 15, which relates to education expenses. The honourable member for Riverina spoke about the provision of educational facilities in his electorate. He drew a correct picture of the situation, and his statements are applicable to many districts of Queensland. This clause was inserted for the benefit of those persons who can keep their children at school until they are 21 years of age. Obviously, the concessional allowance of £50 will apply only to payments that are made to some of the Greater Public Schools and the universities. In the back blocks, where some members of the Australian Country party have never been, many children are able to attend only State schools and denominational schools. Branches of the Country Women's Association of Australia have established hostels where children from nearby country properties may stay from Monday until Friday in each week. Actually those hostels are maintained by the parents of the children. They are workers on the nearby properties who will never be in a position to send their children away to the larger centres of education and to boarding schools. They welcome the opportunity to send their children to hostels so that they can get a primary education. Those pa rents will not be able to take advantage of the proposed allowance for income tax purposes. The honourable member for Riverina spoke of children who stay with private families while attending school. In some centres, private people conduct one, boarding establishments for children from neighbouring stations and farms. The parents of those children will not receive any tax benefit from the board that they payThis principle involves not only payment of board and school fees, but also the purchase of books. When I attended a primary school, most of the pupils bought second-hand books from other children."" A person who buys second-hand books will not come within the provision of this clause. The cost of books that are bought from a private bookseller will not be included in the allowance. In Queensland, the Education Department does not act as a bookseller. Practically every child attending a State school in Queensland, whether it be primary or secondary, has to buy school books from a stationer or a bookseller. Parents will not be allowed to include the cost of those books in the deduction for taxation purposes. If the Australian Oountry party had more intimate knowledge of events in country areas, it would broaden its activities and have the expenses of children who go to neighbouring towns for education included in the provisions of this clause. Honourable members may say that the children can be educated by correspondence. I know that a better education is provided in the primary schools, no matter how seriously the parents may attempt to assist their children with correspondence lessons at home. The Treasurer should listen to the honourable member for Eiverina, even if he will not take heed of honourable members on the Opposition side, and should extend the terms of this allowance for the benefit of the parents of children who cannot be sent to boarding schools and universities. Clause 18 refers to private companies. The Treasurer stated in his budget speecliWe are, therefore, making certain adjustments and proposing certain reductions in taxation which will serve as an incentive to investors and businessmen and the community at large. Ever since this Government has been in office, honourable members have heard frequent references to incentives. Government supporters have harped on incentives to the workers to produce more. Honourable members know what happened to that proposition. There was also to be an incentive to the primary producers, but the primary producers who might have produced more were precluded from taking advantage of bad years to offset the effect on their income tax assessments of the flush years because of the abolition by the Government of the averaging system. Now the Government has produced the greatest incentive of all and claims that it will assist investors and businessmen and the community at large. The Treasurer said that the bill provides incentives for all companies, that it makes radical changes in private company taxes and that the Government is implementing a unanimous recommendation of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation. The bill is remarkable for its omissions rather than for its contents. The portion that deals with undistributed income of private companies is clause 18. The radical changes mentioned by the Treasurer provide for a retention allowance in relation to the distributable income of a private company. In the case of companies with a reduced distributable income exceeding £6,000, the Government proposes to increase the percentage that may be held as a retention allowance.",42
107,Unknown,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,44
108,Mr RIORDAN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell), the first paragraph of which asks that the bill be re-drafted to provide for greater reductions and concessions in relation to the subjects of taxation. Such reductions and concessions would give a real incentive to workers, businessmen and primary producers. Consequently, production would increase, and we should be able to send more exports abroad and to strengthen our overseas balances, which have been so sorely depleted as a result of the incompetence of the present Administration. If we increased our exports and strengthened our overseas balances, we should be able to import the petroleum products that are necessary for our transport system, and the raw materials that are required by our secondary industries. Then we could prevent further unemployment from occurring, and perhaps provide employment for those persons who are unemployed now. The second paragraph of the amendment asked the Government to provide for a broader definition of the concessions .in respect of money paid or expended for educational purposes. Such a definition would give to workers wi.0 send their children to primary schools an opportunity to participate in the concessions. It .would give a similar opportunity to parents of children in the outback. This House should not leave this matter where it stands. As the bill is drafted, it will confer a benefit only upon wealthly sections of the community. A concession of this kind should not be based upon sectional interests. The third paragraph asks that the bill provide for a liberalization of the means test. That would give to people who are living on superannuation benefits, annuities and pensions paid from private sources a small measure of Anderson, Gordon the assistance to which they are entitled Beazley, Andrews, T .

This amendment, if carried, will have the affect of renewing the exemption from income tax of incomes derived from primary production in the Northern Territory. That exemption has been allowed to lapse, but, if this amendment be carried, it will operate until the 30th June, 1953. The main object of the amendment is to postpone final action by the Government on Northern Territory taxation policy at least until all aspects of that policy have been studied in the light of present developments in that area, especially in the light of the views and experience of members of the Parliament who have visited the territory recently and have seen the conditions there for themselves. The honourable member for Farrer (Mr Fairbairn) has said that he considers that this bill reflects the views only of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation. I concur with the honourable gentleman. I consider that the measure does not reflect the political views of the Government. [04] production, I wish to make it quite clear that neither I nor otlier members of the Labour party want this exemption to be restored for the purpose of permitting existing primary producers in the Northern Territory, especially those engaged in the pastoral industry, to continue to make bigger profits than those est on deferred pay, paid in that they are justly entitled to make. respect of service during a We believe that the exemption which period before the first day of July, One thousand nine expired recently had mlany features that hundred and forty-seven, were far from desirable. Under that being a period in respect of exemption, it was too easy for certain which the pay arid allowances primary producers to evade their responearned by the member were pay and allowances which the sibilities, especially absentee companies Secretary to the Treasury, which made the minimum of improveor a person authorized by ments on their properties, but earned the him to give such certificates, maximum profits from them, regardless certifies, for the purposes of this provision, were special of the interests of the territory. No war-time pay and allow- provision was made for the incomes of ances; "". wage-earners to be free from income tax. I consider the zone allowance of £20 a year in the south of the territory and £120 a year in the north to have been totally inadequate. Let me remind the committee that all industries depend for their profitable operation and their existence upon an adequate supply of efficient labour. All the concessions in the world given to primary industries and other industries would be of no avail unless an adequate labour force were available. Worthwhile inducements must be given to the men who are responsible for the profitable operation of an industry, and they must share in concessions granted to that industry. But the Government has not adopted that policy in the Northern Territory, either in previous measures or in this one. It is most important that proper consideration be given to that aspect of taxation in the territory. The Government has not. taken into consideration the future effects that its legislation will have on the attraction of capital and suitable labour to the country. It seems to me to be a grave error of judgment on the part of any government to introduce legislation of this nature at a time when the whole attention of Australia is fixed on the Northern Territory. Keen interest is being shown by members of the Parliament in the possibilities that exist there. A forward move such as the territory has never experienced in all its history is about to begin, yet the Government chooses this particular time to introduce a proposal of this nature which is enough to destroy confidence in investment in the territory and to dissuade people from seeking to make their homes there. realise that some of the provisions contained in the bill are good, but that is not the point. They do not go far enough. They do not cover the whole field of taxation in the Northern Territory. I contend that it would be better to allow the existing exemptions to continue for another twelve months than to alter them as is proposed in the bill, so that all aspects of taxation may be examined in the light of our present and future requirements. Another consideration that overlooked in the measure is the lack of any policy in respect of businesses of all kinds which are most important in a primary producing area such as the Northern Territory. The success or failure of businesses generally in the territory is bound up with the success or failure of primary production. Primary production and general business in the territory are complementary to each other. It is obvious that primary production will play an important part in the territory, yet no provision is made for the eventual treatment or processing of the agricultural products of the territory or for encouragement to secondary industries to establish in the territory expired. plants for the processing of its primary products. I turn now to the provisions of the that relate to mining, which is the important activity in the territory. true that some attempt has been made to cushion the mining industry's from exemption to non-exemption taxes. These provisions of the bill will also have a bad effect on mining in the territory. The bill makes provision in relation to mines that are already production, but it gives no consideration to the prospectors who go out and find mineral-bearing lands. Every member knows the debt that owes to its prospectors. Many have been derived by all States tlieir activities. Under the law as it stands a prospector who makes a strike may have most of the reward of his labour taken sound. Sir. Jfelson. from him. Only by encouraging prospectors and keeping them in the field shall we be able to ensure an increased development of mining in the territory. Special I tax provisions must be made to enable prospectors to be kept in the field. In conclusion I shall quote some of the statements that were made in this House by members of the present Government when they were in Opposition in 1947 at a time when the Chifley Government sought to extend the tax exemptions that relate to the mining industry for a further period of five years. The Postmaster General and Minister for Civil Aviation (Mr Anthony) had this to say, according to Hansard, vol 191, of the 14th May, is 1947, at page 2323In order just to preserve the Northern Territory and to maintain the White Australia policy, and in order to have an answer to the teeming"" millions of the East who want to know what we are doing witli our empty spaces, we are expending upon the territory approximately £1,000,000 a year. That is the cost of the territory to the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth must be prepared to bear it ; but the insignificant amount of total taxes which can be collected in the territory makes the imposition of tax hardly worthwhile, particularly if such imposts discourage settlement in those remote areas of persons who would otherwise go there. A possible inducement to settle in the territory . . .",44

This exemption has been awaited by the people for a long time. I know that it meets honourable with the secret approval of members of Australia the Opposition but, of course, not having benefits introduced it themselves, they voice no from praise of it . I should like the Opposition to voice its praise in relation to the provisions of this bill that it regards as",47
111,Mr THOMPSON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,I expressed appreciation of this clause.,48
112,Mr TURNBULL,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I was referring not to the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Thompson), but to the Opposition in general. The attitude of members of the Opposition, when something good is done in a measure, is to ignore it while they search through the rest of the bill to find whether they will be able to link some part of it with the alleged unfair treatment of some section of the people. The second exemption provided in clause 4 relates to. . . the income of a society, association or club which is not carried on for the purposes of profit or gain to its individual members and is(i) a friendly society; (ii) a society, association or club established for musical purposes, or for the encouragement of music, art, science or literature; or (iii) a society, association or club lished for the encouragement or promotion of an athletic game or athletic sport in which human beings are the sole participants; Those exemptions cover activities that have been the subject of debate in this Parliament for a long time. People who are associated with associations or clubs established for the promotion of the arts, music, science or literature help the community to get away from the humdrum of daily life. It is a credit to the Treasurer and the Government that the incomes of such bodies are now to be exempt from tax. Let the Opposition voice its approval of that exemption. Honourable members opposite condemn the Treasurer on other counts, so surely it is fair that they should commend him now. I ask honourable members opposite not to refrain from praise just because the Labour Government did not think of this provision or, having thought of it, did not put it into operation. Clubs established for the encouragement of athletic games and sports are also to be exempt from tax. ""What could be better for this nation than the development of our young people? Members of the Labour party have been keen advocates of all kinds of athletics and healthy activities, but when it came to removing a tax from people who engaged in such activities they did not care about my anything except continuing to pull out of people's pockets money that they needed for other purposes. Mr Bryson interjecting,",48
113,Mr TURNBULL,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I know that the honourable member for .Wills (Mr Bryson) does not like my remarks. Interjections are provoked when I touch a soft spot. I shall proceed when the din dies down. Let us pay a full meed of praise to the Treasurer for these concessions, which are not intended to profit any one section of the community, because the whole' community takes part in and enjoys music. The whole community is also anxious to be associated with the arts. Interest in athletics and other sports has been stimulated by Australia's participation at the recent Olympic Games. In 1956 the Olympic Games are to be held in Melestab- bourne and, by exempting sporting bodies from payment of taxes, we may be assisting this country to do well on that occasion. I am astonished at the attitude of the Opposition to this clause when I consider that its deputy leader, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) is the chairman of the trustees of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Although the Government proposes to exempt sporting activities from payment of tax, the honourable member for Melbourne does not accord it one word of praise. I suggest that if he is not prepared to praise the Treasurer for such a concession on behalf of the sporting activity he represents, he should resign as chairman of the trustees of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. That would be a fair proposition, because he represents the trustees of the Melbourne Cricket Ground in this chamber, even if he misrepresents the electorate of Melbourne in it. Let us hope that the few hints that I have given will induce the Opposition to give praise where praise is deserved.",48
114,Mr CALWELL,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Melbourne) [8.28] I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson), because the future of the Northern Territory is the important matter that is before the committee at the present time. We have to do something more about the Northern Territory in the near future than we have done recently or over a long period of years. The Opposition believes that the Government was wrong in allowing the exemption that was to expire on 30th June last, to expire on that date. When the Ohifley Government introduced the existing provisions, members of the Australian Country party supported an amendment that was submitted by the present Minister for iCommerce and Agriculture (Mr MCEwen) that they should operate for a period of ten years instead of five years. Now, the Leader of the .Australian Country party (Sir Arthur Fadden), in his capacity as Treasurer, introduces a proposal to terminate the exemption at the expiration of that period of five years. If members of the Australian Country party were consistent-members of the Liberal party will agree with me that they are notwe should expect the Treasurer to agree to the modest proposal that the honourable member for the Northern Territory has made. The object of the amendment that he bas proposed is to continue the period of exemption for another year in order that the Government may examine the whole subject of the taxation of the produce of the Northern Territory with a view to introducing an improved system next year. However, the Government proposes to substitute for the exemption system a system of allowances in respect of depreciation. I cannot see how the proposed new system will encourage production in the Northern Territory, which is the most neglected part of our great Australia. That part of this continent which is north of a line drawn across it from Carnarvon in the west and Bundaberg in the east is isolated and vulnerable territory. the amount of taxation that the Government would derive from residents of the Northern Territory, who have lion hearts and have gone to that region in order to do something in the interests of Australia, would be insignificant, the Government should be prepared to forego any loss of revenue that might result if it accepted the proposed amendment. If we wish to protect the southern parts of Australia, we must pour millions of pounds into the development and defence of the Northern Territory. I cannot see Mr Calwell. why the Treasurer needs to present to - the committee pages of legal jargon in order to explain the Government's new policy in ihis matter. It is difficult for the laymen to wade through the legal terminology of the bill. However, the fact remains that what is being granted under the Government's proposal will, in any event, be obtainable by most of these people, regardless of their place of residence.",48
115,Sir ABTHUB FADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,Provide d that they live long enough.,49
116,Mr CALWELL,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"All of us hope io live for a long time physically, even if some of us are due for an early political demise. Under pressure from wealthy executives whose interests are in the capital cities, the Treasurer has circulated an amendment, the object of which is to omit clause 6 of the bill as drafted.",49
117,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,The honourable member can repeat that statement when clause 6 comes under consideration.,49
118,Mr CALWELL,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I make that remark in passing in order to illustrate the concern that the Government feels in respect of one section and its lack of concern for the interests of people who are really doing something for Australia. The population of Darwin is, approximately, 8,000, and that of Alice Springs is 3,000 or 4,000. Approximately 13,000 persons of our blood are holding a territory which is over half a million square miies in area, or one-sixth of this continent, and the Treasurer devotes two pages of a bill to telling them how much they shall have to pay in taxation. We should do our utmost to encourage the development of the Northern Territory. Those As honourable members, representative of all parties in this chamber and in another place, who visited the Northern Territory recently at the invitation of the Minister for Territories (Mr Hasluck), had an opportunity to see at first hand-and seeing is believing-jus t how much has to be done for the Northern Territory in the years that lie ahead. But this is not a matter of tomorrow. The Indonesians are in possession of islands that are situated only 300 miles from Darwin and, generally speaking, they are antipathetic to white people and are riddled with Communist as well as nationalistic ideas. It will be a retrograde step if the Government terminates the present exemption system and substitutes for it a system that will not give a better deal to the people of the Northern Territory. The honourable member fbr the Northern Territory has urged the Treasurer to accept his amendment in order that the Government may have an opportunity to formulate an overall taxation policy in respect of the Northern Territory. In the meantime, the Government could appoint a special committee, or entrust the task to an existing committee-it could constitute honourable members and honourable senators who recently visited the territory a committee for this purpose-to examine the affairs of the territory and to make a report to the Parliament. A report from a committee of that kind would be more valuable than that which the Treasurer has accepted from the committee of experts that he set up to advise him ou taxation, and upon the recommendations of which the provisions of clause 4 are based. I appeal to the Treasurer to do for the people of the Northern Territory what he is prepared to do for other sections of. the community. I urge him to withdraw paragraph (d) with a view to re-examining the matter and improving his proposal. [ trust that he will not be stiffnecked about the matter and merely say that he will not accept any amendment other thau one that is forced upon him by interests outside this chamber or that may be proposed by Government supporters.",49
119,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"MCPherson-Treasurer) [8-36] - The Government does not need to be lectured with respect to the necessity to appreciate the urgency of developing and protecting the Northern Territory. Immediately the Government assumed office it appointed a special Minister to administer Commonwealth territories, and that gentleman, during the brief period that he has been Minister, has laid a firm foundation for the development of the territories, including the Northern Territory. Much has been said about the existing exemption provision that applies in respect of residents of the Northern Territory, and the Government has been urged to extend the period of that exemption. Experience is the best guide in such matters, and the Government, as a result of its experience in this matter, is unable to accept the amendment that the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) has proposed. The Government's proposals offer a real and permanent inducement for the re-investment of profits in the territory. Experience of the present exemption provisions during the last 30 years has shown that they have failed to fulfil the objective of stimulating settlement and developing the territory. That cannot be denied. The Government appreciates the importance of promoting primary production in the Northern Territory, but it is convinced that the proposals it has embodied in this measure offer the most practical means of achieving that objective. It is unnecessary for me to enumerate the taxation concessions that are being provided in respect of mining operations and primary production in the Northern Territory. They are well known to honourable members who have examined this matter, and such honourable members will admit that they are fair and practical. I am firmly convinced that the concessions that the Government now proposes to make will prove to be more effective than the existing exemption provisions in promoting the settlement and development of the territory. Consequently, the Government cannot accept the amendment.",50
120,Mr NELSON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Northern Territory) [8.39] - I should like to reply to some of the statements that the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) made when he refused to accept the amendment that I have proposed. I admit that the existing exemption provisions have not been completely effective in the past. Certain loopholes became apparent, and 'they should have been closed. However, that was not done and, consequently, certain persons were allowed to escape their tax obligations. But that is exactly why I have submitted my amendment. The Treasurer also stated that mining in the territory would be encouraged to a greater degree under this clause as drafted than has been the case in the past. I in f o rm the right honourable gentleman that the mica field at Hartz Eange which hitherto produced the whole of Australia's requirements of mica for defence purposes will cease production completely. The attitude that the Treasurer has adopted is consistent with the policy of the present Government. When the Chifley Government introduced the existing exemption for a period of five years, present Government supporters, when they were in Opposition, sought to have that period extended to ten years. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr MCEwen) submitted an amendment which was supported by the present Postmaster General (Mr Anthony) and other members of the Australian Country party, including the former member for Bendigo, who is now a member of the Senate, the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr . Bernard Corser), the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull ) and the late honourable member for Flinders. If the honourable member f p r Mallee does not recollect that occasion I shall refresh his memory. Speaking in this chamber on the 14th May, 1947, he saidIn spite of the warning by the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) that the bill must be passed quickly, and his statement that no amendments will be accepted, I rise to support the amendment that the period of exemption in the Northern Territory should be extended to ten years. There was a time in the TJnited States of America when the popular cry was "" Go west, young man"". Many persons do not know that the complete couplet readsGo west, young man, And grow up with the country. Certain honourable members opposite would be well advised to grow up with this country. I have submitted my amendment in order to enable the Government to examine this matter further with a view to evolving an improved method of granting exemptions so that the Northern Territory shall be enabled to play a major part in the future of Australia. remind the Government that the recent discovery of deposits of uranium at Eum Jungle and at Edith Eiver greatest discoveries that have been made in mining history in this Surely the Government will not place Mr Welxon. any obstacle in the way of the development of the territory.",50
121,Mr BRUCE,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Leichhardt) [8.44] The Government seems to be entirely unaware of the complete change that has taken place during the last few months in the Northern Territory. It would be well advised to hasten slowly in dealing with this matter. It should first obtain a closer estimate of the development that w i ll take place, particularly in the mining industry in the territory. I desire to speak on behalf of those men who have been mainly responsible for the discovery of mining fields in Australia. I refer to the prospectors. Gentlemen from the university visited Tennant Creek, and reported that because of the geological formation of the rocks in that area it could not be expected that gold would be found there. Yet the prospectors found gold at Tennant Creek. Moreover, prospectors have found uranium in the Northern Territory, and by doing so have caused many people to realise the enormous mineral possibilities in the territory. A f t e r uranium was found by prospectors, geologists found big lodes of copper and other metals in the territory. The prospectors and the people of the north had known of the existence of these great quantities of metals for 40 or 50 years, but the geologists got all the credit and publicity for discovering them. The prospectors of the north who have lived and worked under incredibly bad conditions, but nevertheless have opened up the country and displayed its treasures to the world, are to £et no concessions from the Government. I suppose that the man who discovered the great uranium field at Rum Jungle will have to pay income tax on the grant of money made to him for his discovery by the Government. If the amendment of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) be accepted, the Government w i ll have time to consider carefully I this vital matter, and it will be saved from doing something that may projudice the whole development of the Northern are the Territory. Such careful consideration, and a new and better plan for developcountry. ment, would probably be of great advantage to Australia in the years to come. The concessions that will be given regard to hospitals are very necessary, and no doubt will do some good. ever, if we are to believe what has been said about the value of uranium both in war and in peace, then we are about to (MTr .h aNt Ethe enter into a period that will be looked clause. back upon as the commencement of a time of enormous development and prosperity for Australia. The Government intends to make' tax concessions to all sorts of people who have failed to carry out the obligations that the concessions were designed to facilitate, but it will give no consideration to the prospectors who are really developing the country.

122,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"MCPhersonTreasurer) [8.58] - I move That paragraph (e) be left out. This is the first of four amendments that I propose to have made in order to give effect to the Government's decision to withdraw and re-examine proposals in this bill relating to the taxation of retiring allowances. It will be convenient, however, if I explain at this juncture the purpose of all four amendments. By clauses 5 and 6 it had been proposed to repeal section 26(d) of the principal act-that is, the provision for the taxation of retiring allowances-and to substitute a new section for the repealed provision. The proposed new section was based on recommendations of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation. The object of tliose recommendations, broadly stated, was to ensure that the concessional basis of taxation provided in the present section 2.6 (d) would apply only in those cases where it was originally intended to apply, that is, to lump sum allowances genuinely paid to retiring employees to provide for their sustenance during the years of retirement. Subsequent to my introduction of the bill, I had brought to my notice many cases in which clause 6 which deals with amounts received by employees on termination of or retirement from employment, might operate unjustly. Many examples have been produced of the effect which the proposed provision would have on superannuation schemes. An investigation of these eases revealed the existence of anomalies and the importance of exercising care to avoid giving rise to others. In the circumstances, the provision should, in my opinion, be withdrawn so that the whole problem may be re-examined. Insofar as paragraph (e) of clause 4 is concerned, the amendment that I have just moved is, as I have already indicated, of no practical significance. That paragraph provided for a drafting amendment of section 23 (t) of the principal act, which exempts the deferred pay attributable to the war service of members of the defence forces. That pay will continue to be exempt, whether or not the amendment be accepted.",53
123,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Hindmarsh) [9.0] - I do not know whether I have reason to be pleased with the explanatory statement made by the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) because, owing to noise in the chamber, I could not understand the purport of his remarks. Will the amendment cover payments to poliomyelitis victims who have insured themselves specifically against contracting that disease ?",53
124,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,No. The amendment deals with retiring allowances.,53
125,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,I appeal to the right honourable gentleman to investigate the position of persons who receive insurance payments in respect of poliomyelitis.,53
126,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,Insur ance against poliomyelitis is not affected by the amendment now before the committee.,53
127,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,I ask that insurance against poliomyelitis be exempted from tax. Is this not the proper occasion on which to raise the subject ?,53
128,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Upon reflection, I think that the provision in relation to "" beneficial interest"" would probably cover the case. Mr CLYDE'CAMERON - Good . I make another plea to the right honourable gentleman on behalf of poliomyelitis victims who have insured themselves against the disease. I have a hunch that the Treasurer is far more sympathetically disposed towards my proposition than are some Treasury officials who, I believe, were the authors of a letter that I received from the Treasurer. I know that the right honourable gentleman is a busy man and that it is much easier for him to sign a letter that has been written by somebody else than to deal personally with a. problem and dictate a letter on the subject. i Sir ARTHUR FADDEN - The honourable member's proposal was thoroughly considered.",53
129,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"In the hope that the right honourable gentleman has signed a letter that was written by somebody else, I repeat my plea on behalf of persons who have insured themselves against poliomyelitis. The letter states that the right honourable gentleman cannot grant a tax exemption in respect of insurance payments of the character that 1. have mentioned, but his first reaction when I raised the subject was horror at the thought that the law did not provide for such exemptions.",53
130,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"No part of an insurance payment made in a sum is liable to tax. Weekly payments, unfortunately, are taxable in full .",54
131,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,The drawing of a distinction between insurance paid in a lump sum and insurance paid in weekly amounts seems to me to be technical quibbling.,54
132,Sir ARTHUREADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,I pointed out in my letter the anomalies that would arise and the new difficulties that would be caused if the honourable member's posal were adopted. I cited examples the problems that would occur.,54
133,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I shall refer to some of those examples and There demonstrate to the right honourable gentleman the great difference that exists between income derived from insurance against poliomyelitis and other payments of the type that he has described as being analogous to such income. The right honourable gentleman referred in his letter to sick leave payments; disability payments to quarry workers, presumably those who suffer from silicosis; periodical payments of workmen's compensation; periodical payments made to dusted miners; superannuation allowances; and generally payable in consequence of premature retirement from employment due to ill health or accident. I should like the right honourable gentleman to recognize the great difference between money received from insurance against poliomyelitis and the first four categories of payment that he mentioned in the letter. Sick leave and compensation payments are given to recipients as a right. Every employer is compelled, either by an industrial award or by a special statute, to provide such benefits, and the recipients are not obliged to make any contributions in order to qualify for tliem. However, a person who insures against poliomyelitis does so of his own volition and at his own expense. He is not compelled to do so. Obviously, if he had not insured himself, he would not receive insurance payments. I cannot understand why such a person should be penalized for having had the foresight to take precautions on his own behalf any more than a person who has insured himself to receive £2,000 at 65 years of lump age should be required to pay tax on that amount. Every penny that is paid in premiums for an endowment policy of. £2,000 to mature at 65 years of age is deductible for income tax purposes, provided the annual premiums do not exceed £200, and every penny of the proceeds at the date of maturity is free of tax. There is no reason why a person wbo has insured against poliomyelitis should not receive equally favourable treatment. If he is unfortunate enough to collect the proinsurance, he suffers more and has a of greater need than has the other person. I know that the Treasurer does not regard this as a .vote-catching issue. are not enough sufferers from poliomyelitis in Australia to be capable of affecting the fate of any government. Neither I nor the right honourable gentleman can gain votes from this matter, and I ask him to treat it as a problem of humanity. He, as the Treasurer of the country, is in a powerful position in which he can do immense good or immense harm. Here is an opportunity for him to do a great deal of good on behalf of a few unfortunate individuals who have had the foresight to insure themselves against the risk of contracting poliopensions myelitis. I do not think that a fair analogy can be drawn between such insurance payments and sick pay, compensation payments, and the other benefits that the right honourable gentleman cited in his letter, with the possible exception of superannuation and retiring allowance payments.",54
134,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,Sicknes s and accident insurance payments are frequently made on a weekly basis.,54
135,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"But I think the right honourable gentleman will agree that victims of poliomyelitis are in a position entirely different from that of otlier sick persons and victims of accidents. We, in this place, have power to give relief to tliose unfortunate persons, and we should not he too finicky about dotting i's and crossing t's. We ought to set aside the technicalities and help these sufferers. The letter that the Treasurer sent to me was sympathetically phrased but, unfortunately, it did not convey the result for which I had hoped. In support of his decision that insurance payments made to poliomyelitis victims should not be free of tax, he referred to such possibilities as a surgeon insuring against the loss of a hand, a professional dancer insuring against injury to the limbs, and a person insuring against mental sickness. Ear from supporting the decision of the Treasury in this matter, those examples provide further evidence of the lack of justification for the levying of tax upon such insurance Dayments. However, I am not pleading the case of the surgeon or the professional dancer. I realise that it is too late to expect the Treasurer to agree to my proposition at this stage, but I hope that he will arrange for an appropriate amendment to be made when the bill is before the Senate.",54
136,The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,Order ! the honourable member's time has expired.,55
137,Mr CALWELL,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Melbourne) [9.10] The Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) has treated the committee with scant respect. He has not told us the whole interesting story that lies behind the Government's surrender on Tuesday morning last to the pressure applied by certain newspaper managements on the issue of retiring allowances, to which the amendment relates. The Government stood completely firm on both feet until Tuesday morning, but something happened then that made it change its attitude on this matter. I do not blame the Treasurer. I think that he was the victim of a hold-up. Certain persons metaphorically forced their way into the Cabinet room and robbed the Treasury. The Government told the Treasurer that he bad to surrender. He had been abused by newspapers and criticized by a number of persons who wrote direct to him. At least he has told us about the letters, although he has not referred to the other subject. Notwithstanding those attacks, he maintained the serenity of his way, but now he has told us that the Government decided to withdraw all references in the bill to the subject of retiring allowances. He has not said that the provisions are to be redrafted in order that they may be inserted in the bill again by way of amendment in the Senate. I was a Minister for a long time, and 1 know the strength of the pressures that can be applied to governments. The Labour Government had to plug up a few rat-holes in its time. Certain individuals were gnawing their way through",55
138,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,Did it catch the rats ?,55
139,Mr CALWELL,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"As the Treasurer knows, there was an occasion when the directors of the Melbourne Herald voted £20,000 into a fund that was to be free of tax. Sir Keith Murdoch was to receive £10,000 of that sum. The Labour Government introduced certain legislation in order to prevent him from obtaining the money free of tax. I do not know that I have ever been popular with the newspapers because of that incident and other incidents, and I am sure that I shall not be popular for opposing the Government's proposal in the amendment now before the committee, because I have a shrewd idea that the Sydney Morning Herald, which published articles in which the Treasurer was attacked, has a cause to serve' in its own interests. Perhaps Warwick Fairfax and some of his associates are eager to vote themselves some generous retirement allowances free of tax, or as nearly free of tax as they can make them. This Government should not surrender to wealthy executives. The Opposition is opposed to the amendment, and will vote against it. It will stand as firm on this issue now as the Government stood last week, and I hope that at least some of the Government's supporters will not be as weak-kneed as their leaders have shown themselves to be.",55
140,Mr TRELOAR,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Gwydir) [9.13] - The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) is still burning with resentment because he had to jettison the very carefully prepared speech that he proposed to make during the second-reading debate in support of the attack that was made on the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) by the Sydney Morning Herald. The honourable gentleman has again succeeded in changing his plumage in mid-flight. It was evident yesterday to all honourable members on this side of the chamber that members of the Opposition had been forced to abandon the speeches they had planned to make because, the Treasurer had announced his intention to withdraw the provisions in relation to retiring allowances. They had read various newspaper articles and intended to castigate the Treasurer, but they had to change their tune entirely. I remind the honourable member for Melbourne that only a fool refuses to change his mind, and I also remind him of the great firmness that he exhibited as Minister for Immigration, particularly in relation to "" the Manila girls "". He was not big enough to change his mind. His attack on the Treasurer this evening was in poor taste. It is evident to every one that he changed his tune in about half an hour yesterday.",55
141,Mr TOM BURKE,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Perth) [9.16] As my colleague and friend, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) has stated, the Opposition objects to the Government's change of front in this matter. Last night, the Minister for the Navy (Mr MCMahon) explained that the Government had examined the matter after the bill had been introduced. He made the amazing assertion that a government does not examine legislation before its introduction, but examines it after its introduction. I believe that the Government had this matter under consideration for some months, yet it changed its mind in a matter of two days. Mr ERIO J. HARRISON - The detection of possible anomalies may cause a government to change its mind.",56
142,Mr TOM BURKE,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"It is highly probable that anomalies would be caused under the provision, and that the full extent of them would not be realized until the legislation had been in operation for a time. That is frequently the case. A government, when it introduces a bill, cannot prepare for every eventuality that may arise. But it is clearly the duty of a government to examine all the possibilities before a bill formally becomes law. Obviously, the Government examined this matter exhaustively before the bill was introduced. The Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) referred the matter to the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation, which inquired into the position and presented its report on the 13th August, 1951, Therefore the matter has been in the hands of the Treasurer for approximately thirteen months. The committee reported on section 26D as follows:It appears to the committee that some limitations should be incorporated in the provision, in order that the opportunities for abuse might be reduced. The committee gave details of the history of the matter, submitted a number of examples of abuse, and then suggested a number of amendments. The first is comparatively simple, and relates to the retirement of an employee on his attaining the normal retiring age. That proposal would overcome some of the anomalies that have existed, and close some of the ways by which advantage has been taken of the act to the benefit of individual taxpayers, and, consequently, to the disadvantage of taxpayers generally. The committee went to great lengths to examine the whole proposition, and submitted a proposal similar to that explained by the Treasurer in his speech. However, the committee reportedAfter consideration, the Committee did not favour this method of control, for the following reasons:and proceeded to give the reasons. In a later part of the report, the committee pointed out that, whilst it did not favoui that proposition because of certain limitations, it considered that the maximum should be £15,000. Clearly, the Government considered this matter, because the report was in the hands of the Treasurer for approximately thirteen months. The Government rejected the submission made by the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation, and adopted an alternative that was not favoured by it. From my reading of this lengthy detailed examination of the matter, it is abundantly clear to me that this expert committee-the Treasurer's offspring, of which he is extremely proud-recommende d that certain action be taken, examined possible alternatives, and considered evasions that had taken place. It cited three examples, and said that others existed. The Treasurer examined the whole proposition, and rejected the suggestion of the committee which provided for a maximum amount of £15,000. The right honourable gentleman decided that the amount should be £10,000, and a provision to give effect to his decision was incorporated in the bill. Then, apparently, because some influential person in the community would be affected by the change, the Treasurer was forced to capitulate. Obviously, the right honourable gentleman has not in mind the interests of a worker who may retire from one position and obtain employment in another and thereby be caught under the new provision. A worker has not the power or the influence, and could not mobilize the forces necessary to make this Government change its mind in the course of two or three days. Obviously, some big organizations or influential individuals were talcing advantage of the existing provision, and, accordingly, the Treasurer has been forced to capitulate to them. I believe that this action has been forced upon him. He is aware that a loophole exists, and, apparently, he was prepared to close it. I consider that the decision to withdraw clause 6 has been forced upon him against his better judgment. He has been compelled to capitulate to the great pressure groups. The Opposition believes that he should not yield to them. Action of this kind holds the Parliament up to contempt, and clearly indicates to the public that this Government must capitulate to powerful groups when they apply pressure to it. As the honourable member for Melbourne has stated, the Chifley Government faced a similar situation. Some companies were seeking to exploit .loopholes in section 66 and section 79 of the act, and, accordingly, the former Treasurer, the late Mr J. B. Chifley, introduced legislation with a view to limiting to £100 or 5 per cent, of the wages paid, the amount of which advantage could be taken. The Government was bitterly criticized for doing so, and was warned that the legislation would give rise to anomalies. However, that Government would not yield to pressure groups and adhered to its intention. Its proposal did not bear the hallmark of Sir. Tom Burke. the Treasurer's expert committee on taxation but was recommended, I assume, by the Commissioner of Taxation. As such, it was accepted by the Labour Government, and was passed 'by the Parliament in the face of strong opposition from vested interests and members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party. The Treasurer submitted this proposal to the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation for investigation and report. As I have shown, the report was in the hands of the right honourable gentleman for about thirteen months. In those circumstances the least the Government can do is to proceed with the bill in its original form, and carefully watch the provision in operation. Should anomalies arise, let them be dealt with later. This capitulation to pressure groups is bad for the Government and for the Parliament, because it indicates what results can be achieved in a short time. The Treasurer made his second-reading speech on this bill last Thursday evening. Yesterday, he announced his-intention to withdraw clause 6. He had no opportunity, in that brief period, to .gauge the reactions of individuals to the proposal, but big financial interests were clearly affected by it, and applied pressure to the Government last week-end. The Treasurer, if he accepts the report of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation with respect to the matter of the Northern Territory, should accept its recommenda.tions on this provision. The honourable member for Melbourne has indicated that the Opposition will fight against the withdrawal of the clause. We believe that the Treasurer should exert his influence with his colleagues and say, "" The protection of the revenue and equity to taxpayers demand that this provision remain in the bill "" .",56
143,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL," [9.25] - It is rather ironical to hear the speeches of Opposition members on this proposal. The Government intended, by the amending provisions in clause 6, to cork up a leak, or, in other words, to remove a possible source of evasion that the Chifley Government had left to this Government for attention. Opposition members claim that they object to the withdrawal of clause 6. How do they reconcile their attitude with the fact that the withdrawal of that provision will merely restore the position to exactly what it was during the regime of the Chifley Government? The wealthy people, who are said to have applied pressure to the present Government, were permitted by the Chifley Government to "" go to the limit"" . No safeguard was provided, by that Administration to deal, with the matter to which Opposition, members have hypocritically referred to-night. No limitation was imposed on the amount that a recipient could accept as a retiring allowance, whether it was artificial or genuine. Section 66, to. which reference has been made, affected, a company that piiid the money to an employee on his retirement. The act previously provided that the company should be able to claim for taxation purposes any amount it disbursed, to an employee.. Then the allowance granted to the company was limited to £100 a year, but the "" sky was the l i m it "" regarding the recipient. Opposition members speak of "" advantageous retiring allowances"" and about the influence exerted by pressure groups upon this Government! Under the Chifley Government, it was open for everybody to take advantage bf the situation, and people did so by every manner and means, and by every conceivable scheme of evasion. It was in order to minimize such evasions, in the interests of taxpayers generally, that this Government formulated the provisions in clause 6 and submitted them to the House. But I was big-enough to realise, when evidence and examples were brought to my notice, that there were anomalies which, if they did not receive attention, would probably give rise to other anomalies. I ' took a broad and sensible view of the whole matter, and recommended to Cabinet that the provision be withdrawn for re-examition nation in. order that a proper and able scheme from every standpoint might bedevised. But I emphasize that this situation, like many other situations, a legacy that this Government inherited from the precedingLabourGovernment. I have merely tried, to remedy the position.",57
144,Mr THOMPSON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Port Adelaide) [9.28] - I can understand the state of mind of the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) on this matter, and I appreciate what I describe as his courage in preparing these proposed amendments-. I am aware that evasions have been occurring. Some years ago, a number of big businessmen and I were members of a committee that dealt with superannuation matters, and some of my colleagues said to me, "" You are miserly about these things. We in big business make substantial provision for our employees in high positions. When they retire, they receive big allowances"". Executives of large organizations were granted retiring, allowances in a lump sum in lieu of ordinary superannuation payments. I was aware of that situation; The Treasurer said that the Government inherited this legacy from the preceding Labour Government. However, I remind him that the position was not so serious a few years ago as it is now. In recent Yet years, large companies have made substantial profits, and have disposed of some of their surplus moneys to employees in the form of retiring allowances. The Treasurer said that the Government took action with regard to a particular firm, but the Opposition is assuming that that was only in the later years when high officers of firms were given large amounts on their retirement. I can understand the Treasurer's ideas, but I cannot understand why he has decided to withdraw the-provision for re-examination. I assume that he intends to deal with glaring cases that may be brought to notice. If a man who is receiving £3,000 or £4,000 a year is given a retiring allowance of £50,000, only 5. percent, of'which sum is regarded as assessable income, that could be a camouflaged method, of disposing of profits. I should not refer to the general posinow but for the manner in which the equitTreasurer charged the Opposition with having failed to tackle this matter. If taxation officers brought blatant evasions was to the notice of the Treasurer, he would be compelled to act sooner or later, no matter to which party he belonged: When theTreasurerand his officers are reexamining this provision, I hope that they will consider the point that I raised yesterday with regard to men on the lower salaries. ""When a public servant retires on reaching 65 years of age and receives a lump sum, 5 per cent, of his retiring allowance is assessable income if he accepts another job on a lower grade in his department. For example, if a headmaster retires at the age of 65 years and agrees to continue to work as an assistant teacher, only 5 per cent, of his allowance is assessable because he has taken an appointment on a lower grade. But if a man on the lowest possible grade wants to continue to work after reaching the retiring age of 65 years, the full amount of his retiring allowance is assessed as income because he had not resumed work in another job. Such a man could not take a position on a lower grade because lie was on the lowest grade before his retirement. I hope that the Treasurer and his officers, on reconsidering the matter, will place all retiring officers on the same level in that respect, and that only 5 per cent, of their retiring allowances will be taxed as income. am not so concerned about the ceiling of £1,000 because a man on the lower rungs is not likely to get more than £1,000 on retirement. I am not speaking of hypothetical cases when I refer to the anomalies. In Adelaide eight or nine cases arose in one department, and the men who had been in the lower grades aud had continued to work for the basic wage, had to include the full amount of their retiring allowances in their income for the year. Mr ERIC T. HARRISON (Wentworth - Vice-Presiden t of the Executive Counoccasion cil and Minister for Defence Production) [""9.36] - I know that the honourable ber for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) would take any steps possible to prevent me saying something with regard to his obserarticle ? vations, but although he may be allpowerful in his party as Deputy Leader of the Opposition he must bow to the ruling of the Chair, and you, Mr Deputy Chairman, have given me the call. I have listened to the attacks that have been made upon the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) and the Government. The character of those attacks does little credit to the Opposition or to the honourable member for Melbourne. I can well understand his attitude. He is purely a politician seeking to take political points wherever he can do so. I can imagine the honourable member sharpening his pencil after studying this provision and saying, ""Look at what the Government is going to do regarding remuneration and retiring allowances of £10,000. Look at what it is going ot do for its wealthy friends."" Then, when he knew that the provision was to be withdrawn and that he would have no opportunity to vent his political spleen on that ground, he sought by innuendo to take away all the credit that must go to the Government for having recognized a mistake in its legislation and for having tried to rectify it. I suggest that if the Government and the Treasurer are courageous enough to acknowledge a mistake in proposed legislation, and if they desire to reconsider it further, they should be given credit for their courage. Instead, the I Opposition has had the temerity to charge the Government with having given way to pressure. I sat in this chamber in 1945 when the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction introduced"" a measure called the Re-establishinent and Employment Bill. It was not in accordance with the ideas of unionists or of the Australian Counci] of Trades Unions, and 24 pages of amendments were introduced by the Labour Government of that day. They completely changed the cliaracter of the bill. The parliamentary records contain a sheaf of amendments that were introduced on that under pressure from the trade unions. How can the honourable member memfor Melbourne dare talk about pressure being brought upon this Government from simply on the basis of a newspaper",58
145,Mr CALWELL,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Ha , ha! That was it. Mr EEIC J. HARRISON - The honourable member for Melbourne has interjected, "" H a , H a ! That was it . "" The author of the newspaper article and honourable members on the Opposition side know full well that there are twenty Ministers in the Cabinet and that they, and not the Treasurer alone, must accept the responsibility for the decisions Government. The honourable member for Melbourne has tried to pin it on to an individual Minister.",59
146,Mr CAXWELL,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"No , I did not. Mr EBIC J. HARRISON - The honourable member is the same person who, as a Minister, put armed omcers into newspaper offices to prevent them from distributing their wares to the public. He is a tin-pot dictator, a sawdust Mussolini. This is the honourable member who prates to the Government of pressure. I remind him that a National Service Bill was introduced into the Parliament and the Opposition in the Senate passed it. The Labour party was opposed to compulsory national service, but the Australian Council of Trades Unions gave a direction to the Opposition and it caved in on the bill. Honourable members will recall the anti-Communist legislation. I remind them, if they need a reminder, that honourable members on the Opposition side said that they would never, in any circumstances, pass that legislation. Its passage was delayed in the Senate again and again, until the Opposition received a direction from the Australian Council of Trades Unions. Again honourable members had to eat their words and vote for that bill under pressure from the Australian Council of Trades Unions. Who are honourable members opposite to accuse the Government of having yielded to pressure when the whole record of the Labour party shows that it has been subjected to direction from outside ? Even the late Mr Curtin, when he was Prime Minister in a Labour government, had to go to the executive of the Labour party, cap in hand, to seek its approval of a plan before the armed forces of the nation could be moved under a zoning system - supporters.",60
147,Mr MORGAN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I rise to a point of order. The Vice-President of the Execu- [9.45] - The tive Council (Mr Eric J"". Harrison) has got right away from the bill that before the committee.",60
148,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Order ! Fadden) The honourable gentleman must address himself to the bill that is before the committee. Mr ERIC J. HARRISON - I have said all that I want to say with regard to pressure because I believe that I have of the proved conclusively thatThe Devil was sick, the Devil a monk would he; The Devil was well, the Devil a monk was he. The honourable member for Melbourne has charged the Government with having been subjected to pressure. Our withers are unwrung. The Government makes no apology for withdrawing this provision. It had the courage to do so because it believed that an injustice would be perpetrated if it persisted with it in its present form. The provision will be reconsidered by the Cabinet in the light of certain evidence that has been placed before it and of certain considerations of justice.",60
149,Mr TOM BURKE,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"The Government has had the matter before it for months. Mr ERIC J. HARRISON - The party to which the honourable member for Perth (Mr Tom Burke) belongs has had the matter before it for eight years. It allowed evasions that this Government is seeking to curtail and did nothing about them. This Government is trying to protect the national revenue and to close loopholes for evasion. The honourable member would have shrieked to high heaven about the ceiling that was provided, but when the Government is courageous enough to withdraw the provision he seeks, by political chicanery, to establish that it has been forced by pressure to take this action. I throw that back to the honourable gentleman. I hope that he has learned something from what I have said about the conduct of the Labour party, and that we shall not hear any more about this matter from him or from his",60
150,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Hindmarsh) Vice-President of the Executive Council (Mr Eric J. is Harrison) chided the Labour party for blaming the Treasurer (Sir Arthur personally for the many defects in the measure that is now before the committee. The right honourable gentleman is very much astray if he believes that we are blaming the Treasurer personally. We are not doing so. We are blaming every member of the Government parties. We shall not let them off as easily as they believe we shall. We do not blame the Treasurer personally for something for which honourable gentleman opposite are responsible collectively. Each and every member of the Government parties will have to face his masters in the very near future, shortly after the next Senate election. It will not be very long before it will be necessary to dissolve this chamber, so that honourable members may face the electors again and let the people say what they think of the Government's behaviour in this matter. Honourable gentlemen opposite must not kid themselves. We sball not let them off lightly by blaming the Treasurer personally. I repeat that the right honourable gentleman is not personally to blame, because he has the full support of the Government parties. Therefore, the members of those parties, individually and collectively, must accept the blame for what has been done, I hope that the Treasurer is on my side now that he knows that the Opposition is not blaming him personally, but is blaming individually every member of the Australian Country party and every member of the Liberal party for the anomalies that exist. Now, I ask the right honourable gentleman to consider an anomaly caused by the provision relating to concessional deductions in respect of invalid children. Let me tell him of a case that has been brought to my notice. A seventeen-yearold girl was a probationary nurse at the Somerton Crippled Children's Home at Adelaide. She was looking after victims of poliomyelitis, and, unfortunately, she contracted that dread disease berself. Her father, after expending nearly £200 upon physiotherapy treatment for her, was refused a concessional deduction for an invalid child because the CommonAvealth medical referee could not issue a certificate that the girl was permanently incapacitated. He pointed out, very properly, that her affliction was not permanent and that, with proper treatment, she would be able to work after the lapse of two or three years. I ask the Government to consider Avhether. an amendment of the legisMr Clyde Cameron. lation can be made that will permit a taxpayer to claim a concessional deduction in respect of an invalid child for the period during which the child is even temporarily incapacitated. Such a provision would be of great value in unfortunate cases of the kind that I have cited.",60
151,Sir EARLE PAGE,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Cowper-Minister for Health) [9.50] - It is very interesting to me, having sat in this chamber while several Labour governments have been in office",61
152,Mr CALWELL,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,The right honourable gentleman will sit here while a few more Labour governments are in office.,61
153,Sir EARLE PAGE,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I do not think so, especially after the exhibition by the Opposition to-night. People who have been Ministers of the Crown in Labour governments, or who have been supporters of Labour governments in this chamber, have charged the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) with a lack of experience or knowledge because, having introduced a measure, he finds now that one provision in it must be altered. Labour governments, after the long cogitation about which the honourable member for Perth (Mr Tom Burke) has spoken, have introduced measures of great importance, but, within two days of the introduction of the measures, they have moved amendments to them which, in volume, have been larger than the measures themselves.",61
154,Mr HAYLEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,Not amendments to budgets.,61
155,Sir EARLE PAGE,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"They related to matters more important than budgets. One bill that I have in mind dealt with re-establishment and employment. Is there a subject that is more important than that? Apparently the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) believes that a small sum of money is much more important than are re-establishment and employment. The fat book that I have in my hand contains page after page of amendments of a bill that was introduced by the Labour party in 1945. They were moved by the then Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. That is not an isolated instance. I have never known a Labour government to introduce a bill that did not have to be amended a thousand times before it was passed by the Parliament. Time and again, the table in this chamber has been littered with amendments of clauses of bills introduced by a Labour government. In those circumstances, it was the acme of hypocrisy for the Opposition to criticize this Government because it has bad to look twice at a provision in this measure. Nobody believes that the Treasurer is not keen to devise the best possible taxation measures. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Tom. Burke) has admitted that this proposed amendment of the act was incorporated in the bill partly as a result of a report prepared by tax experts. Those experts were selected by the Treasurer because he believed them to be the best men available in the country to advise him. They sat almost continuously for a long time, and the right honourable gentleman made their findings available to the Parliament. He has incorporated in many measures suggestions that they made for the improvement of tax provisions and the removal of anomalies. This provision deals with a very difficult subject-so difficult that the Opposition did not have the courage to touch it when it was in power. The Labour party left wide ooen the pathway to abuses. It did nothing to prevent pressure groups from deriving undue benefit from the legislation. When the Treasurer discovered that this provision would give rise to some anomalies and cause some injustices, he went to Cabinet and - said, "" I think that the provision ought to be altered, in certain respects and, if necessary, I shall have it altered in another place"". When the Labour party was in office, it frequently caused amendments to be moved in the Senate. Quite often, Labour governments were stupid enough not to accept, our advice, but sometimes they did so, and then amendments based on that advice were moved in the Senate. That hapnens frequently in the Parliament. Nevertheless, the Opposition, with a great fanfare, as it were, has said that in this instance the Government is doing a terrible thing and that its aetion is without precedent. Although some honourable gentlemen opposite have indulged in stupid nonsense of that kind, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr. Thompson) has said that he believes that what the Government is trying to do is a very good thing. I think so myself. I know that the Treasurer will do all the good things that he wants to do, and that he will avoid doing^ the harmful things that he feared he might have to do. I regard the sham fight of the Opposition on this provision as the acme of hypocrisy in this Parliament. Por years, some members of the Opposition did exactly what they are complaining about now. They moved shoals of amendments to bills, notwithstanding that they had cogitated upon the measures for considerable periods in Cabinet and in special caucus meetings. After all that consideration, when the measures were introduced it was necessary to move amendments to them. I deprecate the suggestion that, in this connection, the Treasurer has acted entirely on his own initiative and, if censure or praise be called for, it should fall upon him. I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) state his view of this matter. Every member of this GoA'ernment regards all measures that we introduce as governmental measures, for which the members of the Government as a whole must accept either praise or blame. We stand solidly behind the Treasurer on this bill, as we have done on all his financial measures. Some of them have been unpopular, but always the march of time has proved them to be statesmanlike measures of extraordinary value to the country. I say that in this matter the Treasurer has acted wisely. Whatever else can be said about the right honourable gentleman, it cannot be said that he lacks courage in any respect. It is stupid to suggest that now he is doing something that is inglorious or weak.",61
156,Mr CALWELL,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Melbourne) [9.56] The Vice-President of the Executive Council (Mr Eric J. Harrison) and the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) have decided that, after all, the dictum of Benjamin Franklin was right. They have decided to hang together rather than hang separately. All the members of the Government are responsible for this surrender. We haye not said that the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) was the first person to throw up his hands. We have said that the Government has forced the right honourable gentleman into the humiliating position of having to announce on Tuesday that a provision in a bill introduced last Thursday must be withdrawn. What is the story? The Treasurer appointed a committee, which reported to him thirteen months ago. The members of the committee were men of his own selection and of his own brand of politics. They are experts in their profession. They have said in their report that the provision for the taxation of 5 per cent, of retiring allowances has been incorporated in taxation legislation since 1915. The Treasurer asked why the Labour party did not alter it during its eight years of office. I ask the right honourable gentleman why the present Government parties did not alter it in the years between 1915 or 1916 and 1944, when we obtained control of both Houses of this Parliament for the first time since 1916. It is not of much use to ask why we did not do that, or why somebody else did not do it. This Government tried to give effect to the recommendation of own committee. That committee recommended that the limit be £15,000. The Government decided that that was too hot, or too heavy, or too high, and it reduced the sum to £10,000. We did not object to that, but we do object to the run-away move of the Government now. The Vice-President of the Executive Council indulged in histrionics, and made an impassioned and furious condemnation of the Labour party for its alleged sins commission and omission. The Minister for Health indulged in persiflage about the thousands of amendments that he saw moved by Labour governments at one time or another, but he neglected to mention that the present Government parties used to say that we accepted no amendment at all, or no amendments of any consequence. Now, the Government asks us why we object to its latest decision. We object because it is not standing up to big interests. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, being the most vulnerof able person in the Sydney electorate Wentworth, probably carried the flag truce to the Sydney Morning Herald Mr Calwell. office and arranged the terms of surrender for the Government. The unfortunate Treasurer, who, on his own admission, is the most unpopular man in Australia, has to bear all the ignominy, all the obloquy and all the opprobrium of having to ask the Parliament to vote out the very provision that he recommended as an integral part of the bill only a few clays ago in his second-reading speech. He then told us how the Government intended to deal with people who were evading taxes. He was full of courage and determination then, but now he has had to bring two Ministers into the chamber to put up a smoke-screen behind which to retire. The people of Australia know that the Government has had to surrender to pressure. We all can read, and we all realise the reason for the publication in the Sydney Morning Herald of these articles, which were full of abuse of the Treasurer and criticism of the Government. We know why the Government surrendered, but we want to know whether an amendment is to be introduced when the bill is before the Senate which will replace, in part or in whole, the provision its now to be withdrawn, and whether other amendments are to be made under cover of dealing with anomalies. Are such amendments likely to protect the revenue, as the Government proposed to protect it originally? The Chifley Government would have closed up these loop-holes in the tax laws had it known about them when it was in office, but it did not receive any recomof mendation from the Commissioner of Taxation on the matter. Honourable members may examine the records to discover whether the Chifley Government ever refused to carry out a recommendation of the Commissioner of Taxation designed to protect the revenue. If we did not receive a recommendation from the Commissioner about the existence of any loophole in the law, then it could not be expected that we should discover it from our own knowledge or experience, bevested cause we are poor men. We have not great wealth outside, nor are we directors big companies, as are some honourable of members opposite. We did not know of about these practices, but if we had known about them we should have dealt with the position as this Government originally proposed to deal with it before this provision was scheduled for withdrawal. Let me conclude by reminding the committee of some words that the Treasurer used in his second-reading speech, which wereI t hao become evident in recent years that undue advantage has been taken of this concession. Tax has been avoided by the payment of large sums, which purport to be retiring allowances, but which are, in effect, deferred remuneration for past services <>r advance payments of future pensions. Having said that only last week the Treasurer now, with the pistol at his back, held by the other nineteen members of the Cabinet, is forced into this chamber to say, "" I did not mean that. I cannot do anything about it, so let us have the provision withdrawn so that we may have another look at it "" . Well, I leave honourable members opposite to their fate, which will not be long in coming. The by-election for the Flinders seat will be the first indication of it, the Senate election next year will be the second and then may the 1954 general election come quickly so that we shall have once again a good, honest, dinkum Australian government on the treasury bench.",62
157,Mr HAMILTON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Canning) [10.4] Tbo honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) has twice to-night whipped liimself into a fury because the Government has decided to withdraw one provision from the bill. He said that the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) was the most unpopular man in Australia. That may be so, but no man who endeavours to do a job such as the Treasurer's job, as well as the Treasurer has done it, can be popular in a country such as this. The Treasurer, despite the unpopularity that he faced, set out to do his job properly, and the effect of his work is now being tfelt in every section of the community. An interesting document that I have in my hand refers to a piece of legislation introduced during the term of office of the Chifley Government. Before the second reading stage of that legislation had been concluded we were informed by the present Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt), who was the Attorney General in the Chifley Government, that he bad 53 amendments to the measure standing in his name. The measure to which I refer was the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill 1947. Yet the honourable member for Melbourne, who is the Leader of the Opposition's deputy in this chamber, is criticizing the Treasurer for the proposed removal of only one provision from the present measure. If my - memory serves me aright, this is the first occasion since the Government came into office in December, 1949, on which a provision has been withdrawn from a bill. It. does not behove the honourable member for Melbourne to introduce any story about its withdrawal being made under pressure. A perusal of the list of amendments to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill 1947, which stood in the name of the present Leader of the Opposition, shows that some clauses were removed from the bill and other clauses were inserted. Those amendments were made under pressure from the Australian Council of Trades Unions. I am sure that the honourable member for Melbourne recalls that legislation very well, because both the Government and the Opposition at that time expressed astonishment that the Chifley Government's Attorney-General, the present Leader of the Opposition, who is an eminent lawyer, should have brought down amending legislation and, before the second-reading stage of it had been concluded, should have circulated 53 amendments.",64
158,Mr HAWORTH,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,Was that done under pressure ?,64
159,Mr HAMILTON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Yes , under pressure from one section of the community, the Australian Council of Trades Unions. The press was full of the matter at the time. Now, because one Sydney newspaper-and I remind the Opposition that the press has no love for this Government because it has been unable to force it to appreciate the £1 and to give to it extra dollars for newsprint-because , I say, an article appeared in the Sunday Herald of Sydney, about this particular measure followed by a second article in the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday, and the Government later decided to withdraw a provision, the Opposition claims that it is capitulating to the press. Honourable members opposite know very well that in introducing this measure the Government is giving effect to recommendations of its own conimittee. Immediately it was realized that there were likely to be some anomalies in this legislation which, probably, would mako the position worse, the Government was big and courageous enough to move to withdraw a doubtful provision. The Opposition had opportunity to close loopholes in the tax law when it was in office, but it never even tackled the problem. Tliat is proof positive not only to the Parliament but also to the people that honourable members opposite were not fit to hold office and are not fit to hold it in t-he future, since they do not know enough about legislation to know how it should be amended and fail to appoint committees to assist them with tax laws. I say that congratulations are due to the Government and to the Treasurer for having stood the brunt of this attack. They were big enough to realise that there was a possibility of a mistake being made in relation to one provision and to withdraw for review and perhaps for incorporation in future legislation.",64
160,Mr JEFF BATE,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Macarthur) [10.9]. - I desire to make this comment: Is this a parliament, a deliberative assembly which considers amendments and whether legislation is proper, or must it merely adopt legislation holus-bolus, as introduced, as the previous Government did? Surely, it is the duty of a parliament to consider bills and amendments to bills, and to take cognizance of the effect that legislation will have on people outside. Surely the press reflects the opinions of the people, and surely it is to the credit of any government that it has examined a measure such as this and has decided to alter it where necessary. The Labour party is taking up the position that once legislation has been introduced it must be passed without alteration. The adoption of such a blanket approach to our consideration of legislation would mean that the Parliament would become merely a rubber stamp to signify approval of legislation prompted by outside interests. T say that the Government is doing the correct thing by withdrawing the provision because the Parliament has decided that great difficulties are inherent in it. I congratulate the Treasurer for moving fbr its deletion. The Opposition deserves no congratulation for contending that when a bill has been introduced it should be adopted as introduced. It always did that when it was in office. It never permitted legislation to be altered after it had been introduced. In this instance, the Parliament has been treated as a deliberative assembly, which is its rightful role. It has been allowed to discuss this measure, and surely the essence of democracy is that legislation shall be passed after it has been fully discussed.

Mr WENTWORTH [ 1 0 . 1 7 ] - by l e a v e - I moveTliat, after clause 4, the following new clause be inserted:"" 4A. Afteisection twenty-three o of the Principal Act the following section is inserted:' 2 3 D - (1.) This section applies where, before the end of the year of income that ends on the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and sixty(n) a taxpayer beingderives income from the working of a mining property in Australia or in the Territory of New Guinea for Uie purpose of obtaining uraniumbearing ore; and (b) the Commissioner is satisfied that all uranium recoverable obtained from the mining property in the year of income is or will become (either before or after recovery) the property of the Commonwealth or has been or will be (whether before or after recovery) sold or disposed of to a person approved by the Commonwealth. ' (2.) So much of the income referred tc in the last preceding sub-section as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is attributable to uranium, shall lie exempt from income tax. ' (3.) Where a taxpayer carries on mining operations on a mining property partly for the purpose of gaining or producing income that is exempt under this section and partly for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income, the taxpayer is entitled to such part only as the Commissioner considers ju3t of the deductions allowable, but for this section, in relation to those operations.'."". The amendment that I now submit the is designed to place, for taxation purshortest time. poses, the mining of uranium on the same basis as the mining of gold. I do not need to emphasize the immense importof ance of uranium from both a national an international stand-point. Although PAIRS. our uranium resources are still unknown, they compare prima facie more than favourably with those that exist in any other country. The Minister for Mines in South Africa, where known uranium resources are much less than ours, believes that the value of the annual output of uranium in that country may approach that of gold, which is now £180,000,000 a year. There is no reason why uranium (Mackellar) sliould not be equally important in the Australian economy, and in order to encourage the rapid development of our uranium resources we need to give incentives to private enterprise. Members of the Opposition have stressed the necessity to encourage the development of uranium deposits in the Northern Territory. I emphasize that it is equally important to encourage the development of such (i) a company that is a resident resources as may be discovered in any and in which not less than other part of Australia. Sub-section (1.) three-quarters of the voting power is controlled directly of the proposed new section 23D provides or indirectly by persons, for the exemption from tax, until the 30th other than companies, who June, 1960, of income of companies that are residents; or are engaged in the mining of uranium, (i i) anjother person who is a resident, on the same basis as the income of companies that engaged in gold mining are now exempt. I have proposed that date in order to ensure continuity of operations. Paragraph (a) limits the concession to Australian residents and from ore to companies substantially owned in Australia. Members of the Opposition emphasized the importance of such a provision when they were dealing with mining operations generally in the Northern Territory. The proposed new section provides that income derived from the mining of uranium shall be tax free in the same way as is income that is derived from the mining of gold. However desirable it may be to continue the existing concession in respect of gold mining, uranium is of far greater importance from the stand-point of its dollarearning capacity and its value as a factor in the protection of the free world. The greatest responsibility that has ever been placed upon Australia is to obtain maximum quantity of uranium in the Sub-paragraph (i i ) of paragraph (a) sub-section (1.) of the proposed and new seetion refers to income derived from, the working of a mining property. Thewording of that sub-paragraph conforms to that of the relevant sections of the principal act in relation to gold, and the provision embraces income derived not only from mining but also from the treatment and concentration of the oreon the mining property. It does not go beyond that. Under sub-section (2.) of section 44 of the principal act, dividends that are paid from the income of a mining company are exempt from income tax and that provision is repeated in the proposed new section. In instances in which uranium forms only a part of the production, the exemption from income tax is to be limited to that part of the mining operation which is properly attributable to uranium. Two other matters are involved in thn proposed new section. The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Bruce) referred to the first of them, namely, the possibility of tax being levied on awards that are made in respect of the discovery of uranium deposits. Apparently, that honourable member was not aware that the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Eadden) stated definitely in this chamber about a month ago that such awards are exempt from income tax. The second matter relates to section 23 of the principal act, which exempts from taxincome derived by a bona fide prospector from the sale, transfer or assignment by him of his rights to mine, in a particular area in Australia or in the Territory of New Guinea, for gold or for any metal or mineral which is specified in the regulations as a metal or mineral in respect of which this paragraph shall apply. I am given to understand that the Government is now preparing regulations to apply to uranium the provision that now applies to gold. I repeat that a great responsibility upon Australia to increase its production of uranium. It can achieve that objective in several ways. For instance, the deposits at Eum Jungle are being developed under government contract. Operations can also be carried out in other areas by private enterprise. The latter method is relied upon in most of the other countries in the free world. But whatever method the Government may decide to adopt, I urge it not to rule out either of those forms. We must Mr Wentworth. realise it to be our responsibility to get from the Australian earth the maximum quantity of uranium in. a minimum of time. I submit the proposed new section as an acceptable means of increasing Australia's output of uranium.",65
161,Mr NELSON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Northern Territory) [10.25] - The proposed new section that the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr. Wentworth) has submitted is just another example of the piece-meal method that the Government is adopting in dealing with taxation in respect of mining operations in the Northern Territory. Instead of dealing with the matter in this way, particularly insofar as uranium is concerned, it should make a comprehensive survey on which to base its taxation policy as a whole. I realise that the mining of uranium in the Northern Territory is of great national importance. However, uuder the proposal of the honourable member for Mackellar, the shareholders of the companies concerned will receive the greater part of the benefit of the concession for which it makes provision, whereas it does not make provision to ensure that those actually engaged in the mining operations shall receive any benefit from this concession. The fact that the concession is to be limited to companies that are Australian-owned does not answer that objection. The workers concerned will again be left out in the cold. Furthermore, whilst the mining of uranium is of national importance, this concession should be applied also in respect of the mining of tin, wolfram, copper, zinc and silver lead, which are also of paramount importance from not only an economic but also a defence stand-point. The field at Hartz rests Eange is the only deposit of mica in Australia that is now being worked on a commercial basis. That field supplies 99 per cent, of Australia's requirements, and if the industry is wiped out, as it may well be under other proposals that are embodied in this measure, Australia will be obliged to import mica from India. Adequate supplies of mica and of the other minerals that I have mentioned are of the utmost importance not only in time of war but also in time of peace. However, the proposed new section will go at least a part of the way towards providing assistance to industry in the Northern Territory. I deplore its failure to extend the benefits for which it makes provision to the workers who will actually be engaged in the mining of uranium.",67
162,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"MCPhersonTreasurer) [10.28""| - The Government accepts the proposed new section that the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr. Wentworth) has submitted. It does not interfere nor conflict in any way with the Government's policy of maintaining control of uranium. I inform the lionorable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) that sub-paragraph (ii). of paragraph (a) of subsection (1.) of the proposed new section provides for exemption from tax of the income of any other person who is a resident of and who derives income from the working of a mining property in Australia or in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea for the purpose of obtaining uranium-bearing ore. The exemption for which provision is made in the proposed new section should go a long way towards stimulating the mining and processing of this much needed material. On behalf of the Government, I have much pleasure in accepting the proposed new section.",68
163,Mr CALWELI,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Melbourne) [10.30]. - The Opposition has had this proposed new section sprung on it today. I believe the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) has also had it sprung on him. It is designed, in part, to place uranium in the same position as gold and to exempt from taxation those who mine it. That seems to be a feasible proposition. However, the honourable member who submitted it did not limit the proposed concession to persons who operate within the Northern Territory. The absentee land-lord will get the same concession as the man who works in the mines, and to me that seems to be a wrong principle. At any rate, the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Luchetti) desires to speak about this matter, so I shall content myself by making but a few observations. The Opposition will allow the proposed new section to pass at this stage, and will examine it in the Senate. If necessary it will attempt to alter it after it reaches the Senate because we have, not had an opportunity to consult government officials and others about the full effect of it. It may be as good as has been claimed by the honourable member who acknowledges paternity of it. However, we are proud of the. product of our own brains, but I am not sure that what the honourable member has proposed will bring a benefit only to the people who live in the territory. Perhaps it will also benefit the go-getters in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide who have been reaping a rich harvest out of the territory in past years",68
164,Sir AKTHUJB FADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"The proposed new section is not confined to the Northern Territory, it is designed to apply all over Australia.",68
165,Mr CALWELL,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Many of these go-getters have been living in ease while somebody else has been doing the work. It is true that uranium may be found all over Australia, and if that should be so the exemption will apply all over Australia. I am merely an amateur geologist, but perhaps I am a little better versed in the science than is the Treasurer. I believe that uranium is to be found almost entirely in that part of Australia that is geologically of the precambrian period, and such geological formations are found with few exceptions in the north of Australia because the southern part of the continent is a couple of aeons more recent in origin than is the northern part. The possibility of discovering uranium in the southern part of Australia is not so great as is the possibility of discovering it in the north.",68
166,Mr LUCHETTI,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Macquarie) [10.33]. - The proposed new section clearly indicates the class-conscious and sectional nature of this Government. Earlier today the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) submitted a comprehensive amendment that dealt with the whole production and development of the territory, but honourable members on the Government side defeated it. Now the Government, coalescing with the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), who speaks a 3 its leader on this occasion, has decided to establish grades of taxpayers in Australia. As the honourable member for the Northern Territory has so rightly said, the Government is attempting to deal with the problems of the territory on a piecemeal basis. If there is to be real national progress, and if the Northern Territory is to develop as it should, that can occur only by the adoption of a conscious and deliberate policy by this Parliament in respect of all the industries of the territory. Can it be said that those who work in the tin, silver-lead, zinc, copper, wolfram or mica fields are playing a lesser part in the development of Australia than are those who are engaged in the uranium fields? ""When we examine the record of this Government in connection with uranium we discover that the pioneer who first discovered the mineral received scant respect from this Government. Then the right to develop the field was hawked throughout the world and eventually was handed over to Zinc Corporation Limited, which has done nothing up to this stage to develop the territory. That company will now find itself blessed by not being obliged to pay tax whereas other concerns engaged in. other essential industries in the Northern Territory, such as tin, copper, zinc and lead mining, will be obliged to pay tax. The whole crux of this matter is obvious class conscious and sectional nature of the Government. miners, public servants, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization officials, and others who are income). playing a most important part in the development of the territory, have been passed over while Zinc Corporation Limited has 'been singled out for the very special favour of being allowed to develop the uranium industry free of the inciand dence of taxation. This is ease which indicates that the Government is a monopolists' government, and not a people's government. Wherever an advantage can be given to monopolists, speakers from the Government side uphold the case of the monopolies and rarely say word for those who are doing the practo tical work. I again pay a great tribute to. and express my thanks to, the pioneers and those who have gone before us, of whom have left their bones to bleach section. Mr Lnchctli. in the parched areas of the Northern Territory. They are the people who made possible the discovery of this source of wonderful wealth. Yet we, on this occasion find it convenient to grant tax concessions to Zinc Corporation Limited.",68
167,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,Where did the honourable member get his idea about Zinc Corporation Limited ?,69
168,Mr LUCHETTI,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"It has been said that Zinc Corporation Limited will take charge of the development of the Eum Jungle uranium field. If the Government has not yet made up its mind about who will exploit the deposits at Rum Jungle, it is time that it did so. Time and time again spokesmen for the Government have indicated - that Zinc Corporation Limited will take over the development of Eum' Jungle. If the Treasurer has further information to impart to the committee at this stage, I suggest that he should do so immediately. This is another instance of the Government, being incapable of making up its mind, having had second thoughts about a most important matter. Surely one has a right to expect the Government to have determined an important matter like this on the basis of equity and justice when the bill was being drafted, rather than to allow the matter to reach this late stage when an the honourable member can move an amendment to determine its policy.

The provision will be of no use if a parent canuot take advantage of it when he purchases text-books for his children, livery honourable member who is trying to educate children knows how costly textbooks are.",71
173,Mr BLAND,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,What text-books would the honourable member specify?,71
174,Mr CALWELL,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,Any text-book that is required for a pupil's studies.,71
175,Mr BLAND,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,Every student requires hooks of different types. A supply of books that would be sufficient for one class might not be sufficient for another class.,71
176,Mr CALWELL,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"My answer to the i nterjection, which is intended to be. ful, is that no parent will spend more than he needs to spend on the purchase of costly books, which generally are useful for only one year. Usually a book that is used by one child is of no use to a brother or sister who undertakes the same course of study several years later. The amount expended on text-books should be left to the discretion of each parent. I do not think that anybody would try to abuse the concessions merely by buying books to a total value of £50 each year or anything like that.",71
177,Mr BLAND,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"What about books for technical students? Such students are provided with lists of books, some of which are essential and some of which are not essential.",71
178,Mr CALWELL,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Some students might want to buy all the prescribed books, but I do not think that would happen in many instances because, no matter how much money a parent receives today, there is not so much left after heavy taxes have been paid that a fond father or a doting mother would be willing to hand out to a child any more than is absolutely necessary for the purchase of books. The Opposition considers that, unless the proposed new section is amended, there will be no advantage in it for 60 per cent, of the parents of school children and only a slight advantage for an additional 30 per cent. The real advantage will go to those persons whose children attend boarding schools, because the ordinary fees at secondary sehools do not amount to more than £12 10s. a quarter at least until a child reaches the matriculation standard. The Treasurer, who has already surrendered to the wealthy persons who hope to provide themselves with retiring allowances of £10,000 a year or more, ought to make a worthwhile gesture to the taxpayers who, as mattevs stand, will gain very little from the new provision. ' Sir ARTHUR FADDEN (MCPhersonTreasurer) [10.56] - There is no doubt that the members of the Opposition are the champions of humbug. Some of them were in power in this Parliament for eight years, and they had full opportunity then to introduce the innovation that they now propose. The truth is that they did helpnothing to encourage and assist secondary education in Australia at any time when they were in office. It was left to this Government to increase expenditure on university and secondary education and to provide, for the first time, for the granting of tax deductions in respect of education expenses. The effect of the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) would be to extend the concessional deduction for payments to schools to all payments made in connection with a child's education. The Opposition has no responsibility in relation to such concessions and is not called upon to count the cost. The proposed extension of the provision would not be practicable under present economic conditions. Do the advocates of the extension suggest that the Commissioner of Taxation and his officers should be required to determine whether the cost of a certain book, or the expense of providing coaching in extraneous subjects, such as dancing or athletics, may be properly incurred in connection with the education - of a child? The practical and obvious solution of the problem is to leave such - decisions to the education authorities. That is what the Government proposes to do. Honourable members will appreciate that the granting of an allowance for education expenses will be an innovation. No other government has granted such - a concession. It is customary, when new ground is broken in the field of tax concessions, to take the first steps cautiously. After every new concession been in operation for a brief period, requests are invariably made for the making of adjustments in order to reduce anomalies and iron out injustices. Only .at that stage is it possible to determine how the scope of the new concession may be broadened without giving rise to fresh anomalies. Although the Government will not accept the proposed amendment, honourable members may be assured that the operation of the concession provided by this clause will be closely watched and that the provision will be adjusted and amended in order to meet changing circumstances ancl as evidence of anomalies is produced. If experience indicates the need for an extension of the concession, and if economic circumstances permit such an extension, the Government will take appropriate action, as it invariably does in such circumstances. It will hold the scales of justice evenly so that all sections of the community will be fairly treated.",71
179,Mr OSBORNE,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Evans) [11.0] - The Government is to be congratulated on its decision to grant this important tax concession on school fees. Undoubtedly, there is a need for assistance of this kind for families, and this provision is a move in the right direction. A large number of children in the community receive their education, particularly secondary education, in schools outside the departmental systems of the States. It would bebeyond the capacity of the States to shoulder the burden of the education of the numbers of children who are now taught in independent secondary schools, if those schools should go out of existence. The independent schools have not increased in the last twenty years in proportion to the increase of population; indeed, their capacity to educate a section of the community has decreased in recent years. The financial burdens imposed on them have become so heavy that it is impracticable to start new independent schools, ancl, in fact, they are not being started. If those schools were not to continue, a burden would be cast on the. State education systems which they could not possibly bear. There is another reason why parents has should be assisted to send their children to independent schools, if they wish to do so. It is not desirable that everybody should be turned out exactly from the same mould. In this over-regimented world, it is of first-rate importance that certain differences, and differing viewpoints, should be encouraged and preserved. If we are not to become a race of automatons, we have to respect different viewpoints, different sorts of people and different attitudes of mind. In this respect the independent schools fulfil a most important function in the community. I believe it is also of great importance that parents who wish their children to be educated under the supervision of religious organizations should be able to do so, and this concession is of great importance to them. I was astonished earlier today to hear objections raised by the Opposition to this concession, and to recall that other objections to it had been stated outside the chamber. Those objections fall into two categories. One of them is that this is a concession only to wealthy people. That is not so, as I shall show in a few moments. I am glad to say that I have not heard the other objection voiced in this chamber, but I have met it outside. It is based on narrow sectarian prejudice, and, indeed, is not worthy of the attention of the chamber. I am glad that it has not been mentioned here. The objection that this concession will benefit only the wealthy people is ill-founded. Actually, the reverse is the case, because the independent schools in the community have felt the burden of increasing costs to such a degree that they have been compelled to increase their fee3 again and again in the last few years. If parents of children attending those schools are not given some assistance, the privilege of sending children to those institutions will inevitably become the sole prerogative of the yery wealthy. I do not believe any honourable member wishes that to occur. Unless a concession of this sort is made, the of children - who will attend such schools will narrow continually until it is limited to the children of the very wealthy. The Government has recognized that danger, and, accordingly, has proposed this concession. I see no objection, in principle, to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell), but it is obvious that matters of this sort cannot be considered in a moment. I am completely in sympathy with the objection expressed by the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Padden) to - this amendment on the ground that the Labour party, when it was in office, had eight years in which to consider such problems, but contemptuously rejected all suggestions. The amendment has been put forward with the basest of political motives, and has been moved in a mealy mouthed manner. Quite rightly, consideration of the matter has been deferred by the Treasurer, but I think it will be revived later. Personally, I feel gratified with the proposed concession. I know the idea that a tax concession should be allowed in respect of school fees is much older than the two and a half years I have been a member of this Parliament, but I have been most interested in the proposal since I have been a member. I arranged for a deputation of sixteen honourable members, including some Opposition members, to discuss the matter with the Treasurer last year. I thank him for this practical evidence of his consideration of the views put forward by that deputation.",72
180,Mr KEON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Yarra) [11.6] cussed this proposal with the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) when the Governhonorable ment was considering it. If I remember clusion ? rightly, the proposition put forward by the Treasurer was that, since the State taxes all citizens for educational poses, it should allocate the money that it raises for those purposes in such way as not to exclude any particular section of the community. In other words, the State should provide, in one way or another, free secular education for all children. No matter where they are educated, they are entitled to have the cost of their education met in the class ordinary secular subjects such as reading, writing and arithmetic, in whatever schools their parents choose to send them. The Government raises money by way of taxes from all citizens, and money raised for educational purposes should not. be allocated in such a way as to exclude any children from the benefits accruing from that expenditure. The Government, apparently, has accepted that view, and, accordingly, has formulated the proposal in the bill. To that degree, I am bound to say that I am pleased. I am glad to note that the Government has accepted the principle that all children in the community, irrespective of whether they are being educated in an independent private school, denominational school, or State school, are entitled, because their parents pay their taxes for that purpose, to have free secular education provided by the Government. But whilst I express my pleasure at the recognition of that principle, I remind Government supporters, who should give this matter serious consideration, that the parents of 95 per cent, of the children who attend independent schools, private schools or denominational schools, whatever we like to term them, will not benefit from this provision. The parents of children who attend secondary schools, which charge fees, will benefit from it, and, no doubt, they will be very pleased indeed to receive the concession. But the fact remains that the parents of 95 per cent, of the children attending independent, denominational schools or private schools, which are mainly primary schools, will not I disbenefit from the provision.",73
181,Sir ABTHUB FADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,How has the member reached that con,73
182,Mr GULLETT,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Is it just a guess, or did purthe honourable member toss a coin ?",73
183,Mr KEON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I cite the example of a schools in my own electorate. I suppose that one-third of the children in the electorate of Yarra attend independent schools. Their parents do not pay a substantial amount in income tax, 'but 1 expect they pay as much by way of indirect taxation, as the persons who receive the highest incomes. Approximately 40 per cent, of the proceeds from taxation is raised by indirect taxation, by income tax. So, it cannot be said, "" Well, these people do not pay taxation for educational purposes, and, therefore, they are not entitled to expect the - State to provide education for their children "". Those persons pay their tax obligation in that respect, principally through the medium of indirect taxation. But the way in which they pay the money will probably exclude them from the benefit of this provision, because many schools in my electorate are maintained from collections made in the churches on Sundays. As the Treasurer has explained, parents will uot be aide to claim a tax concession on expenditure incurred on the education of their children unless they have made it direct contribution to the schools.",73
184,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,Do they not pay school fees?,74
185,Mr KEON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"They may pay ls. or 2s. a week by ""way of school money. The children take the mohey to the schools. But, primarily, the responsibility for maintaining parochial and denominational schools is met by collections in the churches and from the proceeds of special efforts. However, those moneys are not direct payments by the parents of children attending the schools. Barents who contribute three, four or five shillings a week towards the cost of their children's education will receive no benefit from this concession if they contribute through church collections, or special envelope collections, or by some of the many other ways of raising money that are known to honourable members. As the Treasurer has said, unless the money is paid directly to the institutions concerned, no concession can be claimed in respect of it. The Government should reconsider the matter. As the provision now stands, the benefit of the concession will extend only to parents who can send their children to private schools such as the Melbourne Grammar School, the Geelong Grammar School or Xavier College. It will not extend to the parents who live in Bichmond and send their children to parochial schools. In other words, it will benefit the least deserving at the expense of the most deserving. The Treasurer would be well advised to not bave the provision amended in the Senate - so as to extend the concession to the 95 per cent, of those who send their children to private schools, as well as to the 5 per cent, who are covered by the bill as it. now stands. I do not know exactly the form that such an amendment should take, but it may be that the making of an automatic allowance to all parents who send their children to independent or private schools would be the best way to ensure that justice was done. It would be impracticable to ask people to submit a return of all the money they put on the church plate on Sundays. Once the principle is accepted of allowing a concession in respect of school fees, its benefit should go first to the wage-earners who maintain the parochial schools. I support the granting of the concession to the parents of children who attend private secondary schools, but it should also be granted to the parents of children who attend parochial schools.",74
186,Mr FAILES,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Lawson) [11.13] - It was stated at a scientific congress in Sydney recently that a scientist can conduct experiments, and if they fail, he can try again. Governments are not so fortunately situated in that, once legislation is passed, it must remain in force for a considerable time. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Keon) emphasized some of the complexities of the proposal which we are now considering, and from his speech we realise the dangers that are inherent in any attempt to carry the matter too far at first. The Government has introduced an important new principle, and is proceeding warily. Education is primarily the function of the States. This Government has attempted to keep out of the field in which the States function, but it believes that education is of sufficient national importance to warrant the giving of some Commonwealth help. Hence, the Government has introduced this bill. The prime purpose of the measure is to assist those persons who Lave to send their children away to be Bate, educated at private secondary schools.

193,Mr BEALE,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Parramatta-Minister for Supply) [11.37] - I am sorry to take up the time of the House at this late hour, but I have a sad tale to unfold. It concerns our colleague, the honourable member for Watson (Mr C u r t in ) time ago the honourable member referred House in the House to the case of. a soldier whom he described as a "" Korean I veteran"". He said that this man had House. Then I statedserved for two years in Korea, had been back in Australia for only twelve weeks, and had been flung into the ranks of the unemployed immediately upon his return hira from the war. He then proceeded to make a number of charges against two document Commonwealth departments and asked me to investigate the matter. He offered publicly in the House, as the records show, to state the name of the soldier. that I asked him not to do so, but to give me the name privately, which he did. I Employment Service. caused investigations to be made and in formed the House a week or two later that the soldier in question was not member of our forces in Korea and had no service overseas. So, far from the member for Gwydir (Mr Treloar) man having been flung into the ranks the unemployed immediately on his return from the war, the facts were that registered for employment almost immediately after his discharge from the Australian Regular Army, in which he had served for a short time, and on the day was offered a job as a mail officer with the Postmaster-General's DepartI ment, which he declined. Also on the same day, he was given a chit to a labouring job, but failed to prospective employer. The honourable member then contradicted m y statement, made a further violent attack upon the two government departments concerned, and, although this is not importantj also attacked me and m y veracity. I then asked him, outside the House, whether he would clear up the matter by obtaining the soldier's discharge papers, which, as, honourable members who have had war service know, would disclose clearly whether this man had had overseas service or not. Although the honourable member promised to obtain the papers, he failed to do so. I then wrote the ) following letter to him : Dear Mr Curtin, On the 3rd September last, you referred in the House to an ex soldier whom you described as a "" Korean veteran"" who had been "" flung into the ranks of unemployment immediately upon his return from the war "".

216,Mr CURTIN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I thank the House for its generosity in giving me the opportunity to reply to the Minister's statements about this boy, who joined the ..58 Army to offer his life, if necessary, for . . 35 his country anywhere in the world. When . . 23 I visited the office of the Commonwealth Employment Service to investigate the AXES. ramifications of the Government's Hamilton, L . W. scheme to assist the unemployed, I came Haworth . W. C. across this lad. He assured me that he had been a member of the Korean force Joshua, R. Keon, S. M . and that, for two months since his discharge, he had been looking for employment. He had visited the office of the MCColm, M . L . MCLeod. D. Commonwealth Employment Service day after day, but no job could be found for him. I strongly resent the Minister's Peters. E. W. Pollard, R. T. suggestion that he had a right to direct me to provide him with the boy's discharge papers.",79
217,Mr BEALE,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,The honourable member promised to give them to me.,79
218,Mr CURTIN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I think that the MinTellers: ister is also breaking a confidence by mentioning in this House something that was said in a private conversation. The NOES.

A. for investigating the merits or demerits of cases such as this, yet he had the audacity to ask me to supply the discharge Opperman, H . F. Osborne. F. M . papers. The Minister voted against the motion to permit me to have an opportunity to reply to him to-night, but the motion was carried, and I take this opportunity to remind him publicly that the Tellers: Davidson. C. W. - Department of Labour and National Service has a job to do. That job is to find Gnllett. H . B. S. employment for all ex-servicemen and others who are walking the streets today. I shall continue to insist that the Government shall find employment for all ex-servicemen, whether they be Korean veterans or not. No one shall intimidate me in this House or outside the Parliament. I had an opportunity over the week-end to examine the legal niceties of the letter that the Minister wrote to me. It was not couched in precisely the terms that he read to-night, and I should be quite willing to pit my humble capacity against that of the Minister, in spite of his legal training. Apparently the truth got under the Minister's skin. He has called me a loquacious individual, but at least I endeavour to tell the truth and to see that everybody in the community gets a "" fair go "". Day by day I see ex-servicemen",79
219,Mr GRAHAM,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,And night by night,80
220,Mr CURTIN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Yes , and night by night, because in Sydney at least, some ex-servicemen are sleeping in the parks. They have been evicted from their rooms because of their inability to pay rent. Honourable members opposite who frequently throw the cloak of patriotism around their own shoulders should remember patriotism covers a multitude of sins. They should do their best to ensure that employment shall be provided for ex-service men and women. Many thousands of women who are looking for work today were members of the armed forces during World War II . I suggest that the Minister, who is quite incompetent to administer his department, should put his best foot forward and do something to alleviate the position in which ex-service men and women, their brothers, fathers, sisters, and most of their families find themselves today, when they are looking for jobs and the right to live. In conclusion, I wish to emphasize that I have no apologies to make. I know the truth of this matter. I know the truth of every word that was contained in the letter that I wrote to the Minister. My signature was on that letter, which was delivered to the Minister in the House. I suggest that in future the Minister should do the right thing and when he is sending a letter to another honourable member he should not have one of his staff waiting outside the door of the chamber to put the letter into the honourable member's hand in the way that legal men, such as some honourable members opposite, serve divorce papers, and say "" The Minister told me. to see you got this letter "", and then run away. I do not intend to cast any reflection on the gentleman who handed me the letter, but I do intend to cast every reflection on the man who gave him the order to put the letter into my hand. Once again I wish to emphasize that nobody in this chamber will ever be able to intimidate me in any way. Thursday, 25 September, 1952.",80
221,Mr KEON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Yarra) [12.2 a.m.] - I shall be brief. .Some weeks ago in this House I raised the question of political bias being exercised, as I saw it, in the selection of candidates for subsidies from the Commonwealth Literary Fund. I do not propose to re-canvass or rehash that matter to-night, but I do propose to say that after I had made my remarks on that former occasion the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), unwelcomed and uninvited, decided to add his contribution to the mattei-. To judge from his remarks today, apparently the allegation that he made, in relation to a that certain lady writer, on the .occasion of that debate, was entirely untrue. I wish to make it quite clear to the House, the newspapers, and everybody else, that that lady's name was not mentioned by me during the course of my allegations. Some weeks have passed since I made my original statements on the matter, and some of the people whom I mentioned have attempted to contradict me, but I have found no reason whatsoever to withdraw any of the statements that I made in the first place, and I am quite confident that any of the allegations that I made would stand up in the face of any inquiry by the Government or anybody else. That is a matter that I may refer to at some future date in this House. What I do wish to make clear is that I had no association with the remarks of the honourable member for Mackellar. My case did not need his support. It is quite capable of standing on its own feet. In addition, I need not withdraw anything that I said in relation to the matter, and at some future date I shall have an opportunity of giving the House once more not only the allegations that I made on that occasion, but also information that"" since ascertained relating to the matter.",80
222,Mr MCCOLM,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Bowman) [12.4 a.m.] As one of the honourable members who voted in favour of the honourable member for Watson (Mr Curtin) being heard, I should like to say that I do not regret having done so,, because I think that honourable member",81

224,Mr MCCOLM,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I a.m not commenting the on a vote of the House. I am commenttrainees ing on my own vote.

Mr Cu.imif - I rise to order, Speaker. That term is objectionable me, and I ask that the honourable man be directed to withdraw it and to apologize for having used it. Mr SPEAKER,-Order !

The honorof able member for Bowman must therea lore do so.",81
225,Mr MCCOLM,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I withdrew the term before the honourable gentleman rose order. T apologize for having used I should like to say that we expected honourable gentleman to apologize, when those he roseto speak, for having told deliberate untruths",81
226,Mr SPEAKER,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,Order ! The honortheir able gentleman is completely out of and. must withdraw that term and. apolothe gize for having used it.,81
227,Mr MCCOLM,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I withdraw the term and apologize for having used it. I instead, that I regret that the honourable gentleman misled the House in the statethe ments that he made concerning the disand charge of a person who, he informed House on several occasions, was an serviceman of the Korea force. I had been misinformed on that matter, it was his duty to apologize unequivocally for some of the things that he. said of the I have Minister for Supply (Mr Beale). He passed some remarksregarding the responsibility of the Government to provide homes for ex-servicemen. I . shall mention the case of a number of ex-servicemen who, up till some time ago, were employed by the Queensland State Housing Commission. If I remember the aright, it was on the 9th August that 2.7 of these men, who were Commonreconstruction training scheme trainees, were dismissed by the commission. Mi'. Hilton, the Queensland Minister for Housing; stated, as his reason for dismissals, that he could not keep those in employment because hehad the to keep a proportion of apprentices in employment. I do not disagree with that Minister's statement, but all I should like say is that if these men had to be put off that State Minister might have given a sound reason for the dismissal. He said that the reason was that the CommonMr wealth had repudiated the Commonto wealtli and State Housing Agreement. gentleThat was completely untrue.",81
228,Mr SPEAKER,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,Order' ! The honourable gentleman may not say that a Minister's statement is completely untrue.,81
229,Mr MCCOLM,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I am' not referring to a statement made by an honourable member this House, but to a statement made by State Minister, which, I repeat, was untrue. The proof of its untruth lies in the faGt that a bill now before this House to will grant more than £3,000,000 to the it. Queensland Government for housing the work. The main point is that two of 27 men contacted me on the day that they were put off, and I contacted the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Cooper) on the same day in relation to position. That occurred' on the order, 9th August. Between that day and 27th August I received five letters from the Minister for Repatriation. In the last letter, which was dated the 27th say, August, the Minister informed me that only nineteen of the men had reported to Commonwealth Employment Service, that, by the 25th August, seventeen the of them had been placed in employment exby the service and the other two had f he found employment for themselves and were satisfied with it. I contend, therefore, that the Government is carrying out its responsibilities and duties in relation to ex-servicemen, and I resent the foul im pi ications",81
230,Mr SPEAKER,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Order ! The honourable gentleman may not use the term ""foul implications"". It is unparliamentary, and must be withdrawn.",82

233,Mr MCCOLM,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"I withdraw the words, "" foul implications"" and I say instead "" the extremely unfair implications"" that have been made by the honourable gentleman, who had the opportunity to be an honourable gentleman by apologizing to this House.",82
234,Mr TRELOAR,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"Gwydir) [12.8 a.m.]. - I do not wish to keep the. House long, but I wish to say that the honourable member for; Watson (Mr Curtin) showed very bad taste when he denied absolutely the truth of the statements of the Minister for Supply (Mr Beale) and then failed to obtain evidence of the truth of his own denial. He not only did that, but he also made accusations against government departments and government employees, and at least I feel that in this House to-night he should have been man enough to apologize to the Minister and admit that he had been misled, because we all are misled at times, but there is no excuse for a man to be offensive because he has been misled.",82
235,Mr WARD,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"East Sydney) [12.9 a.m.]. - There is no doubt that the tactics the Government in attacking the honorimmigrants able member for Watson (Mr Curtin) are designed deliberately to direct attenworkers? tion away from the real issues^ The tion of where an unemployed ex-servicetrue man served in the military services not, I should imagine, of great imporsent tance. Wliether or not the honourable member for Watson misunderstood what was said to him, or his informant misled him, is of no importance, because the honourable member's remarks will not cause an injury to the man concerned, and certainly do not constitute a charge men have been dismissed and others are against the Minister or the Government, The important matter is that the Governprojects. ment refuses to answer the charge that, although thousands of ex-servicemen from the two world wars are registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service as unemployed persons, the Government continues to bring to this country by every ship that arrives here thousands of immigrants whose arrival must further aggravate the unemployment problem. This morning, the Minister for the Army (Mr Francis) referred to the retirement from the Commonwealth Military Forces of ex-servicemen who had reached the statutory retiring age of 55 years. Within the last twelve months, some of those men have signed agreements to serve for a further period of three years. If they are to be compulsorily retired when they reach the age of 55 years, why have they been invited and permitted, within the last twelve months, to sign agreements to serve fov a furtherperiod of three years? The Government has said that, despite the existence of the contracts that were signed less than twelve months ago, these men must retire from the armed forces. When the Minister was. asked whether it is a fact that immigrant labour is now being used in certain army establishments upon work that could have been made available to these men,, he calmly replied that the work upon, which the immigrants are engaged isassociated, not with the army, but. with the maintenance of army camps. A man who has served in the armed forces of his country until he has reached the age of 55 years, should be given first preference, in work of that kind. Why of does, the Government continue to bring to Australia when there is grave unemployment amongst Australian It has attempted to pass the quesbuck to the .State governments. It is that the New South WalesDepartis ment of Road Transport and Tramways officers abroad to recruit labour which was urgently needed at the time, but because the financial policy applied had by this Government is crippling the States, the New South Wales Government has been obliged to curtail its activities in many directions; and, as a result, many still being dismissed from government The Government endeavours to distract attention fro m the serious unemployment position by an attack on the honourable member for Watson for his failure to produce a discharge from an ex-serviceman who happens to be unemployed. There is no substance in that attack. The Government should state whether or not it is a fact that thousands of ex-servicemen are today fruitlessly seeking employment, and, at the same time, the Minister for the A r m y is dismissing men from the armed forces who have reached the statutory retiring age, notwithstanding that they have contracted to serve for an additional three years. A person who loses his job after he has attained the age of 55 years has little chance of finding employment unless lie has special qualifications. As long as this Government remains in office he will continue to be unemployed, and be compelled to exist on the paltry unemployment benefit, - which is less than the age or invalid pension which, in turn, is insufficient to provide for the maintenance of its recipient. The Government is not concerned with the fact that between 130,000 and 150,000 persons in the community are unemployed. It believes that a certain percentage of unemployment is necessary in any capitalist country. It is on this point of policy that the Labour party and the non-Labour parties so greatly differ. The Labour party stands fair l y and squarely for a policy of full employment; the Liberal party and the Australian Country party advocate the establishment of a pool of unemployed persons in the community. If a supporter of the Government happened to be included in the great army of unemployed, he would regard his plight as serious. The Minister acting for the Minister for Immigration (Mr Beale), says that the Government has declined to accept full responsiout bilit y for the influx of immigrants to Australia. The Australian Government must do so, because it alone determines who shall come to this country, and it alone issues permits for immigrants to enter Australia.",82

The following answers to questions were circulated:TAXATIO N.",83
238,Mr TIMSON,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. What was the exemption for social service tax when it was inaugurated by the Chifley Govermnent in the year 1945-46? 2. Was the tax levied on a flat rate and what was the levy? 3. What was the tax on an amount earned in that year at the rate of £10 per week by a married man with two children?",83
239,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,INCO ME TAXAND SOCIAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. If the gross income of a person without dependants were £104 or less, social services contribution was not payable. Concessional allowances, including allowances for dependants, had the effect of progressively increasing this amount. The following table sets the amounts of gross income which would not attract social services contribution for taxpayers with varying family responsibilities:f Person without dependants . . 104 Person with dependent wife . . 156 Person with wife and one child . . 175 Person with wife a.nd two children 211 Person with wife and three children 257 Person with wife and four children 277 2. Social services contribution was levied at a basic rate of 3d. in the £l on the first £100 of income, increasing by one-eighth of one penny for each £1 by which the contrihutable income exceeded £100, until a maximum Hat' rate of 18d. in the £1 was reached. In tlte ease of a taxpayer who was entitled to a concessional rebate of tax, the rate of social services contribution varied according to the total amount of the concessional rebates but. in no instance, would this concessional rate exceed the appropriate basic rate. The fiat rate of lSd. in the £1 became operative at different income levels according to the total amount of the concessional rebate of tax to which the taxpayer was entitled. As social services contribution was introduced as from the 1st January, 1946, the effective rates payable for the financial year 1945-40 were one-half of those set out above. 3. The social services contribution payable on an income of £10 per week (that is, £520 per annum) earned by a taxpayer with a wife and two children in the financial year l!)45-46 was £19 10s. In addition, income tax of £02 7s. was payable. ELECTRIC MOTORS. Mr EJ HARRINSON Minister representing the Minister for Trade and,,Customs, upon notice I. TIow many electric motors of under one horse-power, single phase, both split phase and capacity types, have heen imported into Australia during the past twelve months? 2. What number of this type of motor is on order or on the water? 3. To whom and in what number have licences been issued during the last three months for the importation of fractional 'horsepower motors? 4. What is the number of motors covered by these licences? Mr ERIO J. HARRISON - The Minister for Trade and Customs has supplied the following information:1. Details are not available in the manner requested. However, during the year ended the 30th June, tf)52, the number of electric motors under one horse-ptoiwer (excluding starter motors for motor vehicles and motors forming an integral part of a machine) imported into Australia was 328,877. 2. The information the honourable member seeks is not available. 3. It is Uie practice to treat as confidential the names of persons and firms to whom import licences are issued. One hundred and thirty-five import licences were issued for fractional horse-power motors from the 1st July, 1952. to the 19 th September, 1952, inclusive. 4.
