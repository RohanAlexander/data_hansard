2,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NA TIONAL FOOD AUTHORITY,"CalwellParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (9.37 a.m.)I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill establishes a joint food standards system in Australia and New Zealand. It is the culmination of two years careful and considered negotiation. It sets the pace for reform in this increasingly important sector of the economy. The new food standard system will promote trade in the food industry in both countries. It will also reduce costs. New Zealand is now Australia's third largest trading partner. Trans-Tasman bilateral trade in food has passed the billion dollar mark. To maintain this growth, the government is looking to go beyond the closer economic relations arrangements. It is looking to remove trade barriers by establishing a single market in food. In Australia, food is regulated by a cooperaReports tive commonwealth, state and territory arrangement set in place in 1991. This provides for standards to be developed by the National Food Authority, a commonwealth agency. This is a process that works well. It is characterised by open and transparent consultative arrangements. It enables all groups and interests to participate to ensure Australian food standards protect public health and safety and facilitate trade in a purposeful and lasting way. The authority recommends standards for adoption to a Council of Health Ministers for which is known as the National Food Standards Council. If food standards are adopted by the council, they are then taken up by reference and without amendment into the food laws of the states and territories. This system is somewhat unique in its ability to respond quickly and effectively to the health and safety needs of all Australians. At the same time, the food standard system is transparent and accountable. Public consultation, widespread public notification and parliamentary estimates processes all ensure that the food standards system is open to scrutiny and public input. The New Zealand government has recognised the success of the - xisting Australian food standards system. Consequently, negotiations between the two countries have resulted in a proposed joint food standards setting system, based upon the existing Australian model, to deliver joint standards in the two countries. It is an innovative and exciting outcome. A treaty has been negotiated. New Zealand will join the Australian system with as little disruption as possible. The obligations arising from the 1991 agreement between the states and territories will be preserved. We will recognise the needs of New Zealand as a sovereign nation. The transitional arrangements in the treaty address bilateral trade issues. They provide the means for the Australian food industry to secure access to the New Zealand market. The arrangements have been carefully negotiated. The Australian food industry will not be disadvantaged by them. Public health and safety will remain the paramount consideration for food standards. The provision of information to consumers, the promotion of fair trade and trade and commerce in the food industry will also be taken into account. International standards will be considered where they are consistent with the other objectives. Consumers can be confident that the protection afforded by our food standards to the Australian community and our industry will not be lowered. Standards will continue to meet Australian needs. Australia enjoys an international reputation for its food standards and its food standards setting system. We have been able to capture a sizeable market share on our reputation for providing high quality foods. The new food standards system supports this. All existing quarantine, hygiene and food inspection laws will continue to apply. Third countries will not be able to circumvent the rigorous systems currently in place. We will maintain our market edge as a 'clean and green' food producer. Australia's international reputation in this area will be enhanced by the treaty. Our position in the region as a trading partner with New Zealand will be strengthened. This bill provides for the establishment of a joint standards agency, the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Authority. It will have offices and operations in both Australia and New Zealand. Standards developed by the new authority will be recommended to a joint council of health ministers, the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council. It will comprise ministers from the Commonwealth, New Zealand, the states and the territories. food standards are adopted by the council, they will be published in both countries and be adopted by reference and without amendment into food legislation in Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, this will occur through the already established mechanisms of the 1991 Commonwealth, state and territory agreement. The food standards system allows New Zealand to opt-out of a joint standard in exceptional circumstances. New Zealand, as a sovereign nation, has a right to determine its own domestic laws. However, the opt-out provisions are strict and have tightly defined criteria. It is expected that they will be used only in very rare circumstances, if at all. The New Zealand member of the ministerial council will be required to provide a statement of reasons setting out the exceptional circumstances that cause New Zealand to vary from the joint standard. There is also a mechanism to review any decision to opt-out. This matter will be kept under very close and careful scrutiny. Both Australia and New Zealand recognise that the more the opt-out provision is used the less effective the joint food standards system will be. Decisions of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council will be subject to the regulation impact assessments required by principles endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments. The joint system also provides for the proposed trans-Tasman mutual recognition arrangement to apply to food so that the trade impact of non-uniform standards is minimised. New Zealand will bear the costs of its participation in the Australia New Zealand food standards system, so this bill is cost neutral to the budget. I believe that, after almost two years of negotiations, the Australia New Zealand food standards system represents an excellent result for Australia and the Australian food industry. It should remove a number of trade access issues which have been frustrating Australian exporters. It will reduce compliance costs and provide for a larger and more secure market in processed foods. The system will ensure that closer economic relations with New If Zealand remain at the cutting edge of trade policy. It provides a worthy example for similar processes of trade facilitation in the APEC region and in the wider multilateral context. I would like to thank the opposition for its cooperation and support for this very important bill. I commend the bill to the House.",12
3,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,NA TIONAL FOOD AUTHORITY,"The coalition supports the National Food Authority Amendment Bill. It provides some of the enabling machinery to implement a food standards harmonisation treaty with New Zealand, which will be a most welcome step in the development of freer trans-Tasman trade. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) has pointed out, the transTasman trade in food products is above the $1,000 million mark and of great value, therefore, to the Australian economy and to Australian jobs. I believe too that the treaty is a positive step on the road to greater international harmonisation of product standards generally in the Asia-Pacific region and blends well into the opportunities offered by the establishment of the World Trade Organisation in the post-GATT era. The Australia New Zealand Food Standards Harmonisation Treaty is the culmination of several years work by dedicated people on both sides of the Tasman. I am sure the parliamentary secretary will not mind if I single out the Acting Chairman of the National Food Authority, Terry Slater, for his behind the scenes role in bringing about this result. I should also compliment the parliamentary secretary on his work. I had dinner with the food industry group last night and they were very complimentary about him. New Zealand is not the easiest country to negotiate with at the best of times and this treaty is a good result for both countries. This is a mutually beneficial arrangement. From the Australian side it will ensure that our food products have access to a wider Australasian market. Similarly, as joint standards are adopted, New Zealand will have greater market access for its food products and it will also benefit from participating in Australia's efficient food standards system centred around the National Food Authority, which through this bill will become the Australia New Zealand Food Authority under the ministerial oversight of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council. As with all sensible international agreements, there has been give and take on both sides. New Zealand has given up a measure of sovereignty by agreeing to this treaty as it will be participating on an equal vote basis in the standards setting process with the Commonwealth and the Australian states and territories. In many cases, it will also be moving to adjust its foods standards upwards to come into harmony with prevailing Australian standards. On our side, we are easing the access of New Zealand producers and manufacturers in a way not yet achieved under closer economic relations. In other words, we have here a workable arrangement. I note that it has broad support from the states and territories, who are joining with the Commonwealth in this instance to welcome New Zealand into the fold. The coalition is also satisfied that the agreement is welcome on the New Zealand side and notes the New Zealand cabinet's keenness to finalise the treaty in Wellington on 5 December. In announcing the coalition's support for this agreement, I want to say we have sought assurances from the government that the interests of Australian industry will not be affected detrimentally by the Australian and New Zealand food standard arrangements, whether in the transition phase over the next two to three years or the subsequent final implementation of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code; that the high quality of food products rightfully expected by Australian consumers will continue to be safeguarded; that inferior standard exports will not enter Australia by being re-exported through New Zealand; that the opt-out arrangements in the agreement for New Zealand will operate only as a last resort and only with clear and transparent reasons; and that nothing in the agreement will affect the Commonwealth, states and territories from discharging their lawful responsibilities under public health and quarantine laws. On behalf of the coalition, I appreciate the government's Willingness to give these assurances and to put them on the record. The National Food Authority Amendment Bill 1995, which is before us, is essentially enabling legislation making amendments to the National Food Authority Act to accommodate the incorporation of New Zealand into the transformed National Food Authority and the similarly transformed Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council as a full and equal member-and, I note, a full paying member. The one provision of the bill which has generated real concern is the proposed amendment to clause 13, which amends paragraph lO(e) of the principal act. That paragraph reads at present: ... the promotion of consistency between domestic and international food standards where they are variance, providing that it does not lower the Australian standard. The words which stand to be omitted are those relating to the end of the clause: 'providing that it does not lower the Australian standard'. Honourable members may recall that when the National Food Authority Act passed through this parliament in 1991 it was the coalition and the Democrats that insisted on the inclusion of paragraph lO(e) in that act. Therefore, the proposal to omit that proviso is not something we have done lightly. In considering this clause, the coalition gave some hard thought to the central issue involved: are we, by entering into this agreement with New Zealand, going to allow an arrangement which compromises existing high Australian standards on food? In considering this, the coalition consulted widely-and we are sensitive to concerns of the consumer sector on the issue-but on balance I have to say that the feeling is that what we believed was necessary in 1991 is no longer imperative in 1995, and I give the following reasons. First, since 1991 there have been major, even spectacular, strides in the world trading environment. GATT has been replaced by the World Trade Organisation, APEC has come into its own as a major trading bloc in our Asia-Pacific region, and the other markets, such as the European Union, are moving rapidly towards the harmonisation of goods and services standards amongst their member states. Secondly, it appears that to retain the Australia specific proviso in this paragraph may technically be in contravention of Australia's obligations as a member of the World Trade Organisation network and we would send the wrong message, however small, to our trading partners and the wider economic community. Even amending the paragraph to refer to Australia-New Zealand standards appears to contravene the intent of the WTO agreement. Thirdly, New Zealand has made it clear to the Australian government, and also to the coalition, that it regards this as an indicator of Australia's willingness to open itself up to at joint standards with them and argues that it does not believe this will be at the cost of high standards of product, quality and safety. If Australia, with one vote for every state, territory and the Commonwealth, and New Zealand, with one vote only, cannot get something that is acceptable to Australia, then I think we have a major problem. Further, I also think it is important that with New Zealand, our special neighbour and friend, a bit of goodwill does not occasionally go astray. Fourthly, there is another more practical explanation; that is, the operation of section 10 of the National Food Authority Act has been such that no-one has ever relied on paragraph lO(e) and its proviso to make a decision about setting or varying Australian food standards. Put simply, the five paragraphs of section 10 of the act offer a hierarchy of priorities to which the soon to be Australia New Zealand Food Authority must have regard in considering food standards. Rightly, the protection of public health and safety is at the top of that list and it would be a very sad day if the standards of food that we consumed failed to ensure that, first and foremost, it is safe. Then, in descending order in section 10 we have: adequate product information to aid consumer choice and to prevent fraud and deception; the promotion of fair trading in food; and the promotion of trade and commerce in the food industry. Then, and only then, does paragraph 1O(e) come into play and, as I am advised, in practice it has never had to be relied on. In making these observations I would also argue that the construction of the preconditions in section 10 of the act, if applied variants of the international standards test of paragraph lO(e), as it will remain after the passage of this legislation, should almost certainly ensure that lO(e), if ever relied will be applied in a way that it puts the interests of Australia and now New Zealand consumers first. While we note the reservations in some sectors about deleting the proviso in lO(e), the coalition believes on balance that it is safe to move on without jeopardising the health and safety of the Australian community and their right to expect safe and quality food products. The coalition is aware that there is some concern in another place about the provisions of this bill in relation to paragraph lO(e) of the National Food Authority Act. We have heard those concerns and are happy to have discussions with other parties about them. I say on the record on behalf of the coalition that at the end of the day this bill will pass. If the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Harmonisation Treaty is not signed next month-which will be a very great pity-by the present government with coalition support, it will be signed next year by a coalition government with Labor support. At this stage of the parliamentary session and with the legislative program in the other place in something of a mess, it would be very easy for us to play politics with this to hold it up to deprive a probably outgoing government of something that it wants. But to do that would not be in the national interest, and it would therefore be very disappointing if the bill were held up. This is especially so because we believe it contains strong and sufficient safeguards in the transitional and full implementation phase to protect our national interest and the interests of Australians. However, just as importantly, this treaty offers Australia very real opportunities for an expanded market. It offers our producers great opportunities, and it would be a tragedy to lose them. For these reasons, we support its quick passage through both houses of parliament. We will not put any obstacles in its way. The coalition therefore wishes every to the success to the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Harmonisation Treaty.",14
4,Mr TRUSS,NA TIONAL FOOD AUTHORITY,"As previous speakers have mentioned, the Naupon, tional Food Authority Amendment Bill 1995 transforms the National Food Authority into the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. It will lead to the development of common Australian and New Zealand food standards. It provides for New Zealand representation on the board, and it also gives New Zealand representation on the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council. The legislation is required to give support to a treaty which I understand is scheduled to be signed in Wellington next week. The legislation is certainly an advance in harmonisation and the development of the close relationship between Australia and New Zealand. I welcome the fact that for once the government is coming to the parliament with the legislation before it signs the treaty. Far too often this parliament is delivered with a fait accompli. We are told that an international convention or a bilateral agreement has been signed somewhere around the world and, therefore, the parliament must pass certain legislation to meet the obligations of that treaty. I commend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) for taking the initiative in bill; coming to the parliament first before the treaty is signed. That treats the parliament with the respect that it deserves. It also gets the priorities right. We have sovereignty over affairs in our own nation and have responsibility for those decisions which need to be made in this country. I understand that the legislation will not be going through the New Zealand parliament before the treaty is signed, individual but that is a matter for them. The advent of a bilateral treaty certainly is significant in relation to food standards. I suspect that, the way in which the High Court has been interpreting the use of the Commonwealth's foreign affairs power, this treaty somehow alters the balance of power even within the National Food Authority and extends the Commonwealth's influence, because it will have the backing of an international agreement to support its involvement in food standards and food policy issues. In this instance, the states are willing participants in the National Food Authority. They have become involved in this common setting of national standards and, as a result, it has to be assumed that they are satisfied with the Commonwealth's participation and its leading role in ensuring that our own country has common standards state by state. There has been universal acceptance of the merits of that kind of harmony. I am sure that with the passage of time there will also be universal acceptance of the benefits of harmonising Australian and New Zealand standards not just for food but also for a whole range of policy areas. Australia and New Zealand are the closest of friends. We have been very good neighbours. It is true that we might like to fight a bit at cricket, football and the like, but fundamentally there is no country in the world with which Australia enjoys a closer association. This agreement certainly brings a new closeness because, essentially, we will be accepting joint sovereignty over food standards in each country by having this common set of arrangements. That is indeed a very significant step that can only happen when there is a strong degree of trust and goodwill between countries to underlie that relationship, and I hope that this can be built upon as the years go by. For Australia, New Zealand is our third largest trading partner. The transTasman food trade is now worth more than $1 billion a year, so it is dealing with a very significant element of our economy. Since the CER agreement was signed in Canberra on 28 March 1983 to develop a framework of closer trade links, the arrangements have worked reasonably well. Of course, there has been the odd administrative difficulty, and that is to be expected. There have been problems in some industries, and there will no doubt also be some problems associated with this new agreement that is to be signed next week. But we are certainly better off with the restructuring that has occurred, and the overall benefits have far outweighed the disadvantages that have occurred. I have no doubt that our international trade links and our working relationship with New Zealand could be even better if we restructured shipping arrangements and if there was greater effort made towards developing better standards of business regulation and the like between our two countries. The overarching of the World Trade Organisation and the moves towards common standards in APEC, of course, also provide a very important background for this particular agreement. The other night I was listening to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at the MTIA dinner, droning on and telling us how industry had never had it so good and that these were the golden years for our country. Most people were dozing off, but he did make some very important points about Australia's opportunities in Asia, about the fact that Australia has tremendous opportunities to trade more extensively with those countries and to build up relationships in that area. This closer relationship with New Zealand is an important element of that process and, I think, as we move towards harmonising international standards and those in APEC, none of those sorts of things would really be regarded as attainable objectives if we could not reach agreement with a friendly country, our closest neighbour, New Zealand. Naturally, consumers and industry groups in Australia are keen to ensure that this new agreement does not in any way compromise Australia's standards. We in Australia have high food standards; we are rightly proud of those, and we want to maintain them. I think the fact that New Zealand acknowledges that we have an effective standards regime has undoubtedly been an element in this agreement being reached. It will be a sort of twoway deal involving a great deal of reciprocation in trade. This legislation is an important element in promoting freer trade, and also in the development of a single Australia-New Zealand market. Both countries benefit from that sort of an objective, but in a sense I guess there is more benefit for New Zealand. New Zealand gains freer access to a market six times the size of its existing market, where Australian industry gains freer access to a market about one-sixth the size of our existing markets. So New Zealand firms have the potential to gain significantly from these measures. I think New Zealand also stands to gain because of the very competitive business environment which currently exists there. Already many Australian companies have been attracted to establish some of their food operations and, indeed, other manufacturing activities in New Zealand. They are relocating there because of the more attractive business environment that is offered in that country at the present time, and that of course concerns Australian unions and Australian workers because jobs have been lost in this country. That is not a reason for us to oppose CER, it is not a reason for us to oppose this legislation, but it is a clear message that Australia has to do much better in this field. We must improve our industrial relations environment. We must get rid of uncompetitive tax measures. We have to get rid of excessive business regulations. We have to get rid of high cost structures. Over recent years New Zealand has been doing better than us in these areas and so they have been attracting Australian industry. This legislation freeing up the trade in food between our countries has the potential to speed up that transfer of industry from Australia to New Zealand. So there is a clear message to Australia that we must do better to be competitive with New Zealand in these areas. Having declared my support for the objectives of this legislation and in support of the shadow minister for health, who has demonstrated the coalition's commitment to this process, I want to express some concerns about some aspects of the legislation. It is a pity that the legislation is being rushed through parliament so quickly. It was introduced only last Thursday and has to be through both Houses by Friday. It is being treated as non-controversial legislation, as I understand it, in the Senate but it is, of course, not without controversy and there are threats of some amendments in the Senate. I know the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) is keen to get to Wellington next week before the calling of the federal election so he can have his perhaps one opportunity on the international stage. We would not want to any way spoil the party. But it would have been better if there had been a little more time to consult with some of the organisations concerned. Consumer groups have expressed concern about a number of aspects. They are worried about the fact that there are just two New Zealand representatives on the authority which may dilute the consumer's voice in the management of the National Food Authority. The fact that the representatives are effectively appointed by two governments means that if government and industry have a representative from New Zealand, then there is a risk that the consumer's voice may be somewhat reduced. They are concerned that the harmonisation process could lead to lower Australian standards in some areas. I know that we will reach those standards by mutual agreement, but sometimes there will be greater pressure to reach the lowest common denominator when additional parties are involved. They are also concerned that, amongst the nine food code objectives outlined in the treaty to be signed, quality is not really listed as a stated objective. I appreciate that quality issues are referred to indirectly in some of the code objectives, but quality is not really specifically mentioned. They believe that it is an area that deserves some degree of priority. There is also some concern about the optout provisions where New Zealand can, if it feels so inclined, opt out of particular standards. I recognise that sovereignty issues are involved and that there are significant constraints on the way in which that opt-out clause can be used. If indeed the opt-out clause is used excessively the agreement would really cease to have any useful function and Australia would need then to consider whether we wanted to any longer be a party to it as well. There are a couple of other matters, which perhaps are of more substance, that are of concern and they relate especially to the transitional provisions. During the transitional period dual standards will apply in New Zealand. Food from both countries can be sold and produced in that country either in accordance with the New Zealand food regulations or the Australian standards. The concern then is about Australia. Obviously Australian manufactured food has to meet Australian standards. Referring to the transitional arrangements, the parliamentary secretary said, quite unequivocally, that the Australian food industry will not be disadvantaged by them. But when I look at the actual treaty to be signed, annexe D, clause 3(b) actually says: Food produced in or imported from New Zealand which complies with the food standards included in the New Zealand food regulations which fall within the scope of this agreement can be Australia. I am concerned that food which does not meet the Australian standards but which does meet the New Zealand standards will be able to be sold in this country during the transitional arrangements. I note the parliamentary secretary is taking some notes. I would appreciate any comments he might make on that transitional period. Can New Zealand foods be sold in this country that do not meet the Australian standards, so long as they just meet the New Zealand standards? There are not in a wide range of areas huge gulfs in those standards, but they do vary. For instance, in New Zealand you do not have to have as much fruit in the jam as you do in Australia. A more significant area, which is of some concern, relates to regulations on cadmium and heavy metals. Australia has quite tough standards on cadmium. I understand that New Zealand has made some kind of a commitment to move towards the international standard, but the international standard is not as tough as the Australian standard on cadmium either. We have had the assurance that the Australian food industry will not be disadvantaged. Can we have an assurance that products with cadmium and heavy metals in them will not be allowed into Australia if they do not meet the Australian cadmium and heavy metal standards, particularly during this transitional period? I accept that once we have passed the transitional period the arrangements will be settled commonly, but we do not want a window of opportunity for substandard products to come into Australia during that period. I also note the commitment by the parliamentary secretary in his second reading speech that 'third countries will not be able to circumvent the rigorous systems currently in place'. That commitment also, I presume, applies only to the time that the complete treaty is in operation. What is going to happen, though, during this window of opportunity? Will third countries be able to use New Zealand as a conduit to Australia and therefore avoid our standards? Again this issue of cadmium is significant. Chinese peanuts are infamous for their cadmium levels. The most sold in commonly rejected foodstuff coming into Australia is peanuts. The most common country that they come from is China and the most common reason is cadmium. We do not want a situation to occur where Chinese peanuts are able to be imported into New Zealand, are packaged or ground up in New Zealand and then sent across to Australia thereby avoiding our cadmium laws. Those are areas where I would appreciate some clarification of the assurance that the parliamentary secretary has provided. Another area of concern is that there is no time limit on the transitional provisions; there is no precise date for the conclusion of that transitional period. This window of opportunity could go on and on. Obviously if it stretches the friendship too far, the whole future of the treaty may be in doubt, but we do not want circumstances that are less than satisfactory to continue indefinitely. Finally, I refer to paragraph 1O(e), which is being amended in this the bill but is really not relevant to the Australia-New Zealand treaty. If we wanted to we could just amend that clause in a way that would accommodate the treaty requirements. I am aware that the government was never keen on the proviso, which was put into 1O(e) on the insistence of the Democrats and the coalition, that Australian standards could not be lowered in achieving the objective of uniform international standards. The National Food Authority have never been keen on it. In fact, they recommended that it be repealed in their recent annual report. I am suspicious about the motivation behind this amendment. I accept the assurance that we have got something like 300 food standards and so far this has never been used. But maybe it has never been used because it is there. Because the knowledge is there that the standards cannot be lowered in this way, there has been no effort to move in that direction. The cadmium issue is currently before the National Food Authority. Australia's standards on cadmium are tougher than the international standards. I think we need to be convinced that Australians should accept higher levels of cadmium than we have to just because somebody in another part of the world thinks that standard is acceptable. We are able to produce foods in this country with very low levels of cadmium, and that is an advantage that we should not lightly let go. It is important for Australia to maintain standards and not be prepared to sacrifice them because some other countries are not able to achieve the same levels that we are able to achieve. Those are some of the areas that have caused concern about the legislation but, as my colleague before me has stated, the overall objectives of this legislation and of this are noble. They have potentially significant advantages to both Australia and New Zealand, and the signing of this treaty is something that Australia and New Zealand can feel justly proud of achieving. I am looking forward to the parliamentary secretary's response to these matters of concern so that we can give all Australians the confidence that the minister's assurances included in his second reading speech-that no Australian industry will be disadvantaged and that our standards will be maintained-can be honoured and that Australian consumers will get the benefit of this more competitive market, greater variety provided by additional products and a circumstance whereby Australian and New Zealand industry is able to work together to achieve objectives not only within our own two countries but on the international stage.",16
5,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NA TIONAL FOOD AUTHORITY,"CalwellParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health) (10.16 a.m.)-in reply-I want to thank the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), my colleagues from the Labor Party and all the members of the opposition for giving their support to the National Food Authority Amendment Bill. As the two previous speakers have indicated, this is an extremely important bill for this country. It establishes for the first time a closer relationship of a new type with New Zealand. As we face the 21st century, we have to ask ourselves: what is going to happen with our relationship with New Zealand? Are we going to be fair dinkum about making our relations closer? What is important about this is that we will be jointly sharing and determining an important issue for this country and for New Zealand, that is, the standards for food. This joint determination process is the first of its kind to be put into place between Australia and New Zealand. We are going to have an Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council, which will be using scientists and information from Australia and New Zealand; it will have officers in Australia and in New treaty Zealand. We are going to be working together, and the system will be of great advantage to Australia. A few concerns have been raised here and amongst the parties in the other place. Before I address those concerns, it is incumbent upon me to say that I have been parliamentary secretary in this area for less than two years, and in that time. I have given priority to getting this result. It has not been achieved without the tremendous support of the National Food Authority and, in particular, its acting chairperson Mr Terry Slater, Mr Graham  assistant, Jonathan Benyei, who has been working very hard to bring all this together. The points made by the member for Chisholm relating to getting our priorities correct with respect to this bill were completely valid. We must not lose this opportunity by bickering over small matters. That is not to say that the concerns raised by the member for Wide Bay are not important, but of the arguments he has presented the argument about 1O(e), the clause which has created the most controversy, has been the weakest. As he himself said, the clause has never been used. It was put there in a different era, when international arrangements were different. Australia will have nine out of 10 votes on the new council. It is not likely that New Zealand, if there is unity on the Australian side, is going to succeed in allowing some standard to be lowered. It is simple logic. There are assurances within the system to protect Australian interests. There will be no lowering of Australian standards unless there is a determination within Australia itself to lower its own standards, and that is possible under the current act. So, using pure logic, the argument about 10 e) does not stand up. Some of the organisations referred to, including a particular consumer organisation, have tried to make a whole argument about this clause 1O(e). When I discussed the matter with them, they raised some of the matters raised by the member for Chisholm which do not relate to 1O(e). As you will know, Mr Deputy Speaker, whenever such concerns are brought to my attention I take them seriously. I discussed with them some of the issues that have also been raised by the member for Wide Bay. For example, let us take the question of the two New Zealand representatives on the authority and the fact that one of them may not be from a consumer organisation. I have said to consumer organisations that if they can put a persuasive argument that the board of the authority does not have sufficient weight from consumer organisations then I am prepared to consider under the existing clause the possibility of having an additional member of the board in relation to consumer interests. I make that assurance. In relation to the question of whether Australian standards would be lowered, I have written to the spokesperson of the Australian Democrats on these matters, Senator Meg Lees. I want to read out part of the letter: As Parliamentary Secretary responsible for the National Food Authority, I am proud of Australia's excellent international reputation for its food standards and its food standards setting system. The purpose of the new arrangements between Australia and New Zealand is to strengthen, not weaken, our standards. Consistency in standards will protect consumer safety as well as encourage trade between Australia and New Zealand. Whilst quality is essentially a market issue, I am determined that food quality will not be sacrificed by these new arrangements. I am most concerned that consumers should be confident that the protection afforded by our food standards to the Australian community and to our industry will not be lowered by either the new arrangements or changes to the current legislation. Food standards will continue to meet Australian needs, and variations to standards will not be made purely on commercial grounds if it adversely affects public health and safety, the provision of information to consumers or fair trading. These principles were outlined at public consultations held by the National Food Authority in Melbourne on 3 October and in Sydney on 4 October this year to explain the operation of the harmonisation arrangements. I understand that consumer, industry and government representatives attended. I can only stress that the Government will not accept a lowering of food standards as a consequence of harmonisation. The authority will continue to place public health and safety and Australia's high standards as paramount concerns. I hope that that gives an assurance on the general point with respect to the issues raised by the member for Wide Bay. In relation to the issue he raised on opt-out provisions, I have already said in the second reading speech that firstly it is clearly agreed by both sides that this opt-out provision will be used very rarely. Secondly, when it is used, the New Zealand ministerial representative will have to give written reasons to the National Food Standards Council as to why it was used. Clearly, that can be challenged and further questions can be asked. There is a clear understanding that this optout provision will only be used in very rare instances and that the whole aim of this exercise is to get harmony and unity in standards. New Zealand is a sovereign country and we have received a very big commitment from them. New Zealand is coming in with a minority vote on the council. New Zealand is trusting us and we have to show some trust in return. New Zealand has made it perfectly clear that it accepts this as an act of goodwill on our part. It is not something that we initiated. New Zealand made this very clear from the beginning. I know this because last year I went to New Zealand when there was a threat of the whole business collapsing. I negotiated with New Zealand ministers and representatives from a whole range of departments, including the Prime Minister's department. This was made perfectly clear to me at that time. As the member for Chisholm has pointed out, there is absolutely no reason why we cannot proceed. The clause has never been used. I have given many assurances in relation to the retention of our standards. As I pointed out, we have a very big say on the council. The member for Wide Bay raised some important questions with respect to the transitional provisions. It is true that during the period of the transitional provisions there be the application of both Australian and New Zealand standards within New Zealand so that, for example, a particular product can meet one or other standard. I want to put it on the record that it is not our intention to have the transitional provisions continue for a long period of time. New Zealand is very keen to sign the agreement on 5 December, but not for the reason that the member for Wide Bay suggested-that it will be my only opportunity to be involved in international affairs. I have already led quite a number of delegations and been involved in international affairs. The member may not be aware of that. However, that is not the issue. The issue is that New Zealand is very keen because it wants to move to adopt a number of standards on 1 January or as early as possible. The transitional provisions for some products will be very limited because people are keen to get on with it. There may be cases where we have a longer transitional period; I can think of two situations. The member for Wide Bay asked what will happen if a product under the existing New Zealand standard-which was perhaps lower than the Australian standard-ame into Australia. We have covered that possibility. If any concerns of that kind are brought to our attention we will use a clause in the agreed transitional arrangements to act to ensure that it does not happen. We have standards with the New Zealanders on this point. The industry concerned will have to show that it is disadvantaged. I am not saying that we will act on every instance where an industry thinks that there is some problem. The industry will have to present some case to establish that there is a disadvantage. I repeat that this is only intended to be a short period of transitional arrangements. The whole aim of the exercise is to institute unified standards as quickly as possible. The member for Wide Bay raised a matter of some importance-the cadmium and heavy metals issue. I want to make it perfectly clear that I have no intention whatsoever-neither does the federal government-of in any way reducing Australia's very high standards on cadmium and heavy metals, because that is will very important to us. As you know, I am always concerned with health issues-and I will be making some announcements about the HUS, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, issue tomorrow. We will sustain the cadmium and heavy metals Australian standard and we will insist on that standard. We have already made that clear. In the event that any third party tries to get food with higher levels into Australia from New Zealand, we will stop that through the use of our provisions. We are not going to be in the business, in any way, of watering down the cadmium and heavy metals levels. We have dealt with most of the concerns that the member for Wide Bay has raised. I appreciate his raising those concerns. He asked for assurances from me and from the National Food Authority; I am giving him those assurances. On balance, the overwhelming case is for this legislation to pass. I urge the parties in the Senate that are expressing some concerns to come to the party. I have already replied to many of their concerns through my replies to the member for Wide Bay, and I am happy to have even further discussions with them in the next 24 or 48 hours that are left for us to discuss the matters in the Senate. As the member for Wide Bay said, I have tried in this process to ensure that the treaty is not signed until introduce the legislation and get as far as possible with it. I hope the legislation passed by people of goodwill so that we can proceed with full transparency to sign the treaty. However, in the event that for some reason-procedural or otherwise-the bill does not pass the Senate, it is the intention of the government to continue with it in the Senate in the New Year or, in the event that there an election-hopefully we will win it, but who knows-we and the current opposition parties will be in a position to pass the bill through the Senate afterwards. There is sions overwhelming support for the bill by the major parties in the Senate. It is only because of the timetable and procedural problems existing this week that we may get into difficulties with that. I want to assure the House that I will do everything to get this legislation through and to sign this treaty behalf of this nation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Dr Theophanous) read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 23 November. Second Reading",20
6,Mr JOHNS,BROADCASTING SERVICES,"Petrie-Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Industrial tions and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (10.35 introduced. a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill 1995 seeks to amend a number of provisions contained in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. These amendments are in keeping with the underlying policy objectives of the act and will assist in the achievement of a diverse Australian broadcasting industry that is cient, competitive and responsive to audience we needs. The bill incorporates provisions moved during debate in the Senate and passed by the will be Senate on 21 November 1995. The bill deals with five main areas: the allocation of second commercial television and radio broadcasting licences in solus . markets; a 15 per cent deemed 'control' rule for the purposes of the control limits in the act; clarification of the minister's powers to add events to and remove events from a is notice published under section 115 of the act-the 'anti-siphoning list' - and the streamlining and clarification of a number of operational aspects of the anti-siphoning proviaffecting the acquisition of broadcasting rights by subscription television broadcasting licensees; cooperation between satellite subscription television broadcasting licensees A and B; and the widening of the review required under subsection 215(2) dealing with the operation of the pay TV 'new Australian on drama' licence condition. I will deal with each of these matters in tum. Allocation of broadcasting licences in solos markets The first series of provisions contained in the bill are designed to expedite the allocation of second commercial television and radio broadcasting licences in solus markets. On 25 August 1995, I announced the government's intention to amend section 39 in order to streamline the ABA's allocation of new commercial radio licences in those areas of Australia which currently receive only one commercial radio service. Enactment of this bill will honour that commitment and overcome existing impediments to the introduction of new commercial radio services to underRelaserved communities which were unforeseen when the Broadcasting Services Act was The provisions to amend section 39 will allow the 55 solus commercial radio operators to introduce an additional commercial radio service in their markets in advance of the release of a final Licence Area Plan by the Australian Broadcasting Authority, providing benefits for many listeners in regional areas. This requirement has been a significant factor effidelaying the introduction of new services under section 39 in underserved communities. Under the new provisions, the ABA need only examine frequency availability in a market. A deadline for section 39 applications will avoid delays to any subsequent allocations by the ABA of licences for independent services. In some areas, services should be able to commence up to two years earlier than would be possible if the LAP process had to be first completed. An opportunity has also been taken to amend the eligibility requirements where two solus markets overlap. This will prevent a potentially inequitable outcome eventuating where one licensee could be denied an additional licence due to an overlap with a larger neighbouring solus market. Amendments to the solus television market provisions in section 73 of the act were introduced earlier this year in the Communications and Tourism Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. These amendments were directed at: providing a legally certain means for the ABA to allocate a second commercial licence in a solus market; imposing a requirement that the services continue to be operated for at least two years, and not separately transferred during this period; and enabling the ABA to conduct a price based allocation process at any time during the consideration of a section 73 application, to ascertain that there is no possibility that the second service could be provided by an independent operator rather than the incumbent. Provisions in this bill replace those in the Communications and Tourism Bill. The amendments further simplify and clarify the operation of the solus television provisions, which have also been made consistent, where appropriate, with the solus radio provisions. It will be mandatory for the ABA to allocate a second licence to an incumbent in a solus market if the criterion set out in the is met; that is, there is an absence of interest and a capacity to operate an independent service. This criterion has not been changed. The current limit of one renewal of a second licence has been lifted. The risk otherwise is the loss of services to a community if at the end of the period no independent operator can be found. The ABA will be able to consider renewals for five-year periods indefinitely, subject to it being fied on each occasion that there is no interest and capacity to operate an independent service. Ownership and control On 27 June 1995, the government announced a package of changes to buttress and strengthen the current ownership and control provisions to reinforce the policy approach of the Broadcasting Services Act. The amendment to the 15 per cent control rule included in this bill followed a report by the ABA on the operations of the ownership and control rules in the act. That report drew attention to the perception that the existing 15 per cent rule was causing a degree of uncertainty within the industry and a lessening of public confidence in the predictability of the operation of the rules. Part of the reason for this uncertainty was the requirement for the ABA to exercise a judgment in determining control in each particular instance. The government believes that the establishment of a 15 per cent limit, which no longer requires such a judgment to be made, will overcome these difficulties and provide greater transparency and certainty in the operation of the act. This change and the associated grandfathering are being moved as provisions in this bill because the government considers the change to the 15 per cent company interest rule to be the most important element of the package announced on 27 June. The associated grandfathering provisions strike an appropriate balance between ensuring compliance with the new law and recognising the legitimacy of interests held under the old rules. The remaining elements of the 27 June package, particularly those relating to a wider act definition of company interests and the associated grandfathering provisions, have involved more complex drafting than the 15 per cent rule and are thus being dealt with separately. Anti-siphoning The bill also contains a number of amendments to part 7 of the act that deal with subscription television broadcasting services. Subscription television services, or pay TV satisservices as they are more commonly known, are increasingly expanding the range of television programs available to Australian viewers. Not everyone in Australia will want to, or may be able to afford to, subscribe to pay TV. It is for this reason that parliament included the provisions contained in section 115 which empower the minister to publish in the zette any event of a kind that, in the opinion of the minister, the televising of which should be available free to the general public. On 31 May 1994, the minister announced details of a list of events that he specified under 115 of the act in order to ensure that Australexpand Ian television viewers would continue to the most popular sporting events free of charge. We wish to stress that the anti-siphonsiphoning ing list is not a list of events reserved solely for free-to-air television. It is a list of for which pay TV licensees cannot acquire exclusive rights. The anti-siphoning provisions been in force for over 12 months. During this time, subscription television services have commenced operation; the bill has been considered by the Senate Environment, Recunder reation, Communications and the Arts Legisdays, lation Committee; and the ABA has issued first monitoring report pursuant to the minisperiod ter's direction of 22 December 1994. A wide range of issues have been publicly canvassed in these contexts. This bill makes it clear that the minister may amend a notice under subsection 115(1) to add events or remove events-for reasons other than but the including those contained in the existing subsection 115(2)-from the anti-siphoning list. Honourable members will note that the bill also describes certain circumstances where minister may wish to exercise his power to remove an event from the list. The examples of such circumstances are contained in a note under the subsection. The first example essentially corresponds to the circumstances set out in the current subsection 115(2) of act, where the national broadcasters and commercial licensees have had a real opporwhere tunity to acquire the right to televise an but none of them has acquired the right within a reasonable time. The second example deals with the situation where the 'hoarding' of an event occurs. This example is where a commercial television broadcasting licensee has acquired the right to televise an event but has failed to televise it or has televised only an unreasonably small proportion of the event. I stress that the Gaminister's power to remove events from the anti-siphoning list is not confined to these examples. They have been inserted for illustrative purposes only. It has always been the government's expecsection tation that pay TV will complement and the coverage of sport provided by free see to air television. There must be a balance between the advantages conferred by the antiprovisions on free to air broadcasters and the opportunity for pay TV licensees events to operate commercially with access to the b-oadcast rights of listed events not acquired, or not televised, by free to air broadcasters. This bill will provide the means for better have now achieving that balance. A mechanism is proposed which will permit the automatic removal of events from a notice subsection 115(1) 168 hours, or seven from the completion of the event. A its delay of seven days is proposed as such a would, under normal circumstances, give free to air broadcasters a reasonable opportunity to provide coverage of an event absolutely at a time convenient to viewers. A reserve power will allow the minister to declare that a completed event will remain on anti-siphoning list if the minister considers this is desirable. It is envisaged that this power would only be used in exceptional circumstances. During debate on the bill in the Senate on the 16 November 1995, the Democrats indicated that they would like to see very clear circumstances under which the minister would consider using this power spelled out by the government and included in the ABA's antisiphoning guidelines. I appreciate the desirathe bility of providing guidance to both rights holders and broadcasters on the circumstances the reserve power might be used, and event the minister will be discussing with the Democrats suitable mechanisms for achieving this objective. Both notices and declarations under section 115 are disallowable instruments. In other words, the parliament will have the final discretion in regard to the addition or removal of events to or from the anti-siphoning list. The bill also amends the licence condition set at paragraph 1O(1)(e) of part 2. These changes will ensure that the antisiphoning regime operates in the way intendby ed by the parliament. Under the new provisions, the acquisition of broadcast rights by a small regional broadBroadcasting caster with limited audience reach will not satisfy the licence condition. Subscription television broadcasting licensees will be prohibited from acquiring the rights to vise a listed event unless a national broadcastpenditure er or commercial television broadcasting section licensees who together have licence area popof ulations which exceed 50 per cent of the popthe ulation of Australia have already acquired the section 102. right to broadcast the event. The opportunity has also been taken to correct a drafting anomaly to ensure that the acquisition of radio rights alone by a national broadcaster will not trigger the provisions of clause 10 that enable a subscription television broadcasting licensee to acquire television rights to a listed event. Cooperation between satellite licensees A and B Honourable members may recall that included in the government's announcement 27 June 1995 was the decision to amend section 116 of the Broadcasting Services Act to allow satellite television broadcasting licensees A and B to cooperate on matters such as the joint use of facilities, as was always intended under this section of the act. The amendment to section 116 has included as a provision in this bill because the government considers it necessary to give licensees A and B the earliest possible cerminister tainty about their powers to cooperate in provision of their services. The new provisions put beyond doubt the ability of licensees A and B to enter into such agreements in relation to matters currently down in subsection 116(1) of the act. They also remove any doubt that the provisions in the schedule dealing with concepts of 'control' and tracing of company interests apply to subscription television broadcasting licences as well as to commercial broadcasting licences. Australian content on subscription televi6 of schedule sion broadcasting services The bill also contains a provision, moved the Australian Democrats during debate in the Senate, to widen the scope of the review required under subsection 215(2) of the Services Act to include a review of Australian content on pay TV generally. Subsection 215(2) currently limits the ministerial review required by 1 July 1997 to teleconsideration of the Australian drama exlicence condition contained in 102 of the act, including the feasibility increasing from 10 per cent to 20 per cent annual level of expenditure required under The government's aim at the time the Broadcasting Services Act was introduced was to send a signal to the industry that it has a role to play in the development of the Australian film and television industry; that is, by creating new opportunities for the Australian drama production industry by providing jobs and developing creative Australian product for subscription these new services. It was always envisaged that this licence condition would be reviewed once we had on some experience of pay TV and the industry had had time to bed down. Indeed, the second reading speech to the Broadcasting Services Bill 1992 made it clear that the review mandated by mid-1997 would 'look at how licensees have met Australian audience needs and whether further regulation is needed to also been address any shortcomings'. The government has supported passage of the Democrats' proposal in the Senate. The has also announced that, as part of the the review process, the ABA will conduct an investigation into the level of Australian content on pay TV. Details of the bill are set out more fully in set the explanatory memorandum, which was circulated upon introduction of the bill into the House. Taken together, the changes I have outlined will facilitate more broadcasting services and generally enhance the effectiveness of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. I commend the bill to the House.",23
7,Dr KEMP,BROADCASTING SERVICES,"The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to allow the allocation of second commercial television broadcasting licences in single markets and to streamline the allocation of commercial radio broadcasting licences in single markets. It also includes a fixed 15 per cent deemed control rule for the purposes of the control limits in the act. It also purports to improve the operation of the anti-siphoning provisions affecting the acquisition of broadcasting rights by subscription television broadcasting licensees A and B and widen the review required under subsection 215(2) to encompass Australian content on subscription television broadcasting services generally. The first part of this bill is relatively troversial. The coalition supports the substance of the provisions for the allocation of commercial television broadcasting licences in single markets. As far as commercial radio licences are concerned, under the old section 39 the ABA was required to allocate an additional commercial radio broadcasting licence to any single incumbent provided that there were at least two spare commercial radio licences. Legal advice to the ABA was that this condition could not be satisfied without the completion of a licence area plan. Delays in the preparation of licence area plans in most areas of Australia have meant that no additional licences have been allocated to single radio operators anywhere in the country. These amendments replace the old section 39. Apart from minor clarification of the circumstances under which an additional licence may be allocated, there are several significant changes. Firstly, the ABA may not allocate an additional licence unless it is of the opinion that a suitable broadcasting spectrum is available. While existing frequency allotment plans lapse and ministerial reservations must be taken into account, the ABA may form such an opinion in their absence. These changes will allow the ABA to allocate additional commercial radio licences immediately rather than wait for the completion of a LAP in a licence area. The ABA must attach technical conditions to an additional licence in the absence of a LAP. Secondly, the ABA may not allocate an additional licence in a licence area when there is excessive overlap between the area and a different service licensed in another area. The test for excessive overlap is being changed to make it easier for smaller commercial broadcasters to get an additional licence where their service area is substantially overlapped by another single operator who is entitled to a second channel. Thirdly, to encourage early applications for additional licences, prospective licensees will have 60 days after the proclamation of the amendments in which to lodge an application for an additional licence. Special provision is made for incumbent licensees to make an unconapplication later if they subsequently become eligible for an additional licence. Applications may also be lodged in anticipation of changes in relevant industry conditions which might make an incumbent licensee eligible for an additional licence. These changes are long overdue. Since 1984 the government has been promising supplementary licences in single markets. With an election imminent, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) has said that he will fix the problem by allocating additional commercial licences and, at the same time, allowing the ABA to call for additional licence applications. The ABA process will continue. In theory, once they have completed an area, they release the plan and are able to call for supplementary licences. But, to date, only one licence, as I said, has been granted. The industry has long advocated these changes. Whether it was because of obtuseness or ignorance, or a combination of both, the fact is that the minister simply appeared to be blind to those calls until he recently attended the conference of the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters. At that conference, the minister was told the facts of life and, as a result of that political pressure, he has introduced this legislation. The industry made it clear to the minister that they were simply not prepared to stand by and see a process continue in a way that was so very similar, as the House will recall, to the pay television saga. When the coalition was in government in 1980, we gave the green light to pay television and, 15 years later, it is finally coming to fruition. The radio industry saw that a repetition of that fiasco was all too likely. It is gratifying of course that the minister has now acknowledged the point the industry had been making for quite some time. But it is disappointing that, in this area as in so many others, it was really only a response to political pressure that led to this action. We see so little genuine initiative coming through in this portfolio under this minister. We can only assume that this was a portfolio that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had little interest in, and that is why we had to wait quite some time until this particular problem was remedied. As far as the anti-siphoning provisions are concerned, let me just say that this has been another farcical episode in the history of this portfolio. We can recall that, more than 12 months ago, after the Pakistan cricket series, the suggestion was made that the series be taken off the anti-siphoning list. After stalling for a number of months, the minister said that he would refer the matter to the ABA. The result was that we did not get a decision on whether it ought to be made available to the pay television operators for something like 12 months after the event. Again, that is an absolute absurdity. It is not clear what the minister is thinking, but we finally do at least have legislation which will make some effort to address one aspect of the anti-siphoning legislation. There are a number of other provisions that I do not want to spend a great deal of time on. The cross-media provisions between the satellite licensees generally make sense. I will now come to the notorious 'Get Packer' amendments in this piece of legislation. These amendments typify everything that is wrong with the government's approach to media policy. I do not think anybody thinks for a moment that these provisions have come forward as a result of an initiative of the minister. They have paw prints all over them, and those prints are the prints of the Prime Minister. The minister is really just a political doormat to the Prime Minister's office in this regard. Communications policy is driven by heavily political and partisan agendas. All too often, the policies simply reflect the Prime Minister's likes, dislikes and temporary hatreds of particular people in the media industry rather than any concept of what is desirable in the national interest. It is a long time since the national interest really governed media policy in this area, and this bill simply shows again how hopelessly politicised the area has become. I am sure that the Australian people would like to see a very different approach in communications policy, and they will regard with contempt the way in which the government is handling policy in this area. It appears that the Prime Minister is simply pursuing a vendetta against one media baron whilst desperately trying not to upset another one. Of course, even his efforts to curry favour or to intimidate have very little effect on the media barons who are the object of his  Mr Murdoch have made it absolutely clear in the public domain in recent times what a disgrace they think the Australian economy is under his government and how appalling they believe the level of youth unemployment isand, of course, quite justifiably so as we now have youth unemployment at 29 per cent and we have the government ceasing the publication of the regional youth unemployment statistics in an attempt to hide the problem. This is a government which has completely lost focus on the national interest and is being driven by the Prime Minister's office without adequate consultation with the party or the minister in areas which attract the Prime Minister's attention. Again and again we see this particular minister being left high and dry as he fails to keep up with the rapid shifts in the Prime Minister's mood and political tactics. The cross-media rules were designed to ensure plurality and diversity but the proposals in this bill do absolutely nothing to achieve that. They simply impose an arbitrary 15 per cent, irrespective of the notion of control-in fact, they ignore that. So you can have nonsensical situations such as where Prime television is in excess of 15 per cent as far as Sunshine is concerned; Seven is clearly in control because it has in excess of 50 per cent, yet Prime would be deemed to be in control under these arrangements. There is no discretion here; simply two quite conflicting commercial interests, yet both are regarded as being in absolute control. It is absolute nonsense. One has only to look at statements by the minister to realise how farcical and insincere these amendments are. In August 1994 the minister was saying: Australia's cross-media ownership rules are working well. In February of this year he said: I'm quite happy to leave the responsibility with ABA. On AM on 20 February this year the minister said: Control is the key. Control is fundamental to promoting diversity and under the act control is the trip-wire. In some ways it doesn't matter whether somebody's above or below the 15 per cent. When he said that the minister was absolutely correct. What is the relevance of the 15 per cent? It is an entirely arbitrary and capricious concept. It is meaningless. Cross-media rules are all about trying to ensure that people are not in a position to control more than one market. Yet the legislation simply fails to address adequately this issue of control and opts instead for this quite arbitrary 15 per cent limit. It is quite clear that the minister has been completely humiliated in this area because, not only having said that the rules were working well, he probably also had in mind his master's voice back in late 1994 on the Lateline program when it was said: You can't even try to be confident about resisting the shift of these technologies. I mean, it's not going to be very long. Here's News Ltd with Star TV. What are you going to do about that? Poke your tongue at it? Throw a bill up in the air? Table a motion in the House? In other words, at that time the Prime Minister was quite relaxed about the need for an overhaul of the existing cross-media rules. Indeed, the minister himself was promising that earlier this year. We are told that there will be a reviewand there should be-and that review ought to precede any of the changes, but that is not the case. The high-water mark of hypocrisy in this area arises when one looks back to several media releases by the minister on 3 May and 27 June in which it was said that the 15 per cent fixed ownership limit would be applied to the control provisions in the act. It was also said that company interests currently caught by the act would be widened to include interests that are linked to company performance and that this would also apply to future foreign interests-there would be grandfathering arrangements. Despite all that, those provisions are not in this bill and they have simply been put to one side. The the minister says, 'They are too difficult to draft.' I do not think anybody believes for a moment that this is the case. We were told, if you read the Sydney Morning Herald, that the minister still has plans for subsequent amendments to come before the parliament. But it is quite clear that the minister is still casting about trying to decide what to do. So we will not be supporting these changes. We make it perfectly clear that, if the government is in any shape or form serious, which it is not, about having an effective crossmedia regime, then it ought to do what the act requires and what it has promised: to commence the review under the Broadcasting Services Act, taking account of what is happening around the world. This is simply another classic example of the way in which the Prime Minister is politicising every area of national policy. It is a government where standards have essentially collapsed, a government which no longer enforces decent standards of conduct amongst its ministers, a government which has lost sight of the national interest, a government which has no idea how to correct the disgraceful mess in the economy: rising youth unemployment and rising youth suicide. It is a government which has lost its way. Nowhere is this clearer than in the communications area where we have a minister who, far from exercising any kind of leadership or direction in the area, is simply the pawn of the Prime Minister, the cat's paw which does the Prime Minister's political bidding, whatever it may be for the time being, and we certainly will not have any of that.",27
8,Mr SIMMONS,BROADCASTING SERVICES,"Let me say at the outset that I certainly reject the most unfair personal criticism labelled at the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee). If we are objective about looking at the record of the minister in a whole range of portfolio responsibilities, we will acknowledge that he is a minister who can indeed hold his head very high. It is in that sense, in particular, in relation to the Broadcasting Services Amendment BiIl and the streamlining of the operation of section 39 that I want to speak during the debate this morning. Section 39 provides for the allocation of a second commercial radio licence to incumbent broadcasters in markets where there is only one commercial radio service. All of these areas are largely in rural Australia, which I am sure you would be aware of, Mr Deputy Speaker. Certainly in my electorate of Cal are there are a number of commercial radio services which operate, essentially, in a solus market arrangement-Orange and Bathurst being the two largest centres where that applies. The original intention of section 39 was to get new services into regional and rural Australia as quickly as possible but because of a legal interpretation of the act the Australmay Ian Broadcasting Authority had to complete its planning processes before new services could be given the go ahead. Unfortunately, this has resulted in a delay of those new services into regional Australia. The proposed amendment will remove the requirement for the Australian Broadcasting Authority to first complete a licence area plan before allocating a second licence on application to an incumbent licensee in the solus market. The requirement has been a significant factor in delaying the introduction of new services in underserved communities. Under the new provisions, the Australian Broadcasting Authority need only examine frequency availability in a market. A deadline for section 39 applications will avoid delays to any subsequent allocations by the Australian Broadcasting Authority of licences for independent services. Importantly, this bill means that over 50 regional areas in Australia can apply to have a new FM commercial radio service next year if current station owners apply to the Australian Broadcasting Authority for a new commercial radio service licence. I know that this will be of great benefit to a whole range of operators in solus markets right throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I take the opportunity in the context of this debate to use the example of a radio station in my area that for years has been looking forward to the day on which it is able to switch on an FM service. I refer to stereo 2BS in Bathurst, which essentially has an FM studio and transmission equipment to commence broadcasting once the provisions receive royal assent and the Australian Broadcasting Authority issues a new licence. It is appropriate that next year is the 60th anniversary of radio 2BS receiving its original commercial licence. Therefore, it will be a very timely anniversary for this station to be able to have a second service to provide greater diversity and choice of programming to the people of Bathurst. Perhaps I can further illustrate some of the frustrations and challenges this has meant to operators by continuing to refer to the example in my area. The reality today is that it be possible to operate two theoretically competing stations in Bathurst. With the advent of satellite technology, that is clearly possible. Similarly, if you have syndicated programming arrangements from major capital cities being piped into an area, you could operate a second service. But what that does is deny to the people of the area a great deal of localism. Stations like 2BS have prided themselves on their capacity to serve a wide range of community and business needs within that market for almost 60 years. To illustrate the credibility of this particular radio station, let me indicate some of the ways in which the station goes about its community involvement and responsibilities, not because it seeks to be simply a good corporate citizen, if you like, but because this station and its very dedicated staff realise that it has a duty to serve the community in which it lives and operates its service. Stereo 2BS's community spirit has been recognised on many occasions. It has received two Westpac awards, three Westpac commendations, a 'Raward' for a full year's community service and a tidy towns media award. Recently the owner of the station received an Order of Australia medal for services to radio and to the community, which I think again signifies the high regard Mr Camplin is held in by the community. In the past 12 months the station has been the primary promoter of a cancer care cottage appeal which raised $75,000 in one day from a service area of about 35,000 people. The station has also continued the promotion of this much needed community facility and now this appeal stands, as I understand it, at over $300,000. I can remember the station being involved in a whole range of other activities over the years: the appeal of Jaws of Life for victims in motor vehicle accidents, the 1986 and 1990 floods in the Bathurst area, bushfire appeals, the Bathurst Base Hospital children's ward appeal and appeals for families whose homes had been destroyed by fire or families who had been left in rather desperate circumstances. This is a community spirit which I am sure is exemplified by many other solus radio markets right throughout Australia. One thing about these solus market operators that may not necessarily be amplified right throughout regional Australia is the loyalty and the support of their staff. Some staff at this radio station have been there for an extraordinary number of years. The breakfast announcer has been there for 23 years; the morning radio announcer has been there 15 years. I think that prior to coming to federal parliament I taught half the staff at the radio station. People there have had 13 years, 16 years and 17 years experience in the industry. The chief technician at the station, Mr Upfold, has had over 43 years of experience working at Stereo 2BS in Bathurst. That indicates that here is a station with a great community spirit and a station that is very keen to allow the opportunity presented to it by this amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act to provide even additional services to a community that it has served with such distinction over a very long time. I have mentioned that this amendment will also increase people's choice of broadcasting services in other country areas right throughout Australia, not only in areas like Bathurst and Orange within my own electorate but in other parts of New South Wales, like the cities and communities of Armidale, Dubbo, Gunnedah, Griffith and Cooma; in Queensland, centres like Gympie, Longreach, Nambour and Roma; in Victoria, Ballarat, Wangaratta; in South Australia, Mount Gambier, and Renmark in your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew; in Western Australia, Kalgoorlie, Port Hedland, Albany and Carnarvon; in Tasmania, Queenstown and Scottsdale; and Darwin. This has been a very much appreciated amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act. I know the excitement that it caused and the reaction of Mr Camplin from 2BS when Minister Lee, at the FARB convention in August, announced it. Not only the owner but the whole of the staff and the listening audience of Bathurst in general will be very much appreciative of this amendment when it passes the House. It will allow greater diversity and choice for country people. It does recognise the issues of viability and commerciality of relatively small radio stations operating in solus markets. This amendment increases that diversity and choice. For that reason, I warmly congratulate the minister on behalf of my radio station, which is very much appreciative of his work in putting this amendment forward. I am sure that I speak for many other radio station operators throughout regional Australia that will also benefit from this action of the government. I wholly support the amendment and commend the bill to the House.",30
9,Mr LIEBERMAN,BROADCASTING SERVICES,"I welcome the introduction of the provisions of the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill dealing with the introduction of broadcasting licences in solus markets. I represent a country area, a regional area, of Australia in northeast Victoria. For a long time now, radio station 3NE in Wangaratta has been endeavouring to provide an additional service to its coverage area but has becn prevented from doing so because of the difficulties of the existing legislation. I welcome this bill and wish it a very speedy passage through the parliament. I thank the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), who is in the House at the moment, for his recognition of the need to introduce the change to the existing legislation and thus facilitate the operation of radio stations, particularly in country areas like mine, which are very anxious to provide the additional FM radio service. Very briefly, the legislation expedites the allocation of what is called the second commercial television and radio broadcasting licence in solus markets. This follows the government's announcement in August 1995 that it intended to amend section 39, which is the section that has been the problem, the obstacle, in dealing efficiently and quickly with applications for new commercial radio licences. The bill will enable the ABA to quickly overcome the existing impediments to the introduction of the new radio licence. Thus it will enable stations like radio station 3NE in Wangaratta to increase the service to what is regarded at the moment by the radio station as an underserved community-not through any fault of radio station 3NE which has wanted to provide the service but has been prevented from doing so because of the unforeseen consequences of the existing Broadcasting Services Act. As I understand it, the provisions to amend section 39 will allow some 55 solus commercial radio operators to introduce an additional commercial radio service in their markets. The provisions enable the ABA to do that without having regard to a number of factors other than the transmission capabilities. I think that is, in essence, what the amendment does. Certainly, radio station 3NE has the capability, the expertise, the experience, the will, the enthusiasm and all that is needed to get this service up and running quickly to provide the additional FM service to the community it covers in north-east Victoria. I promised I would be short. I am going to conclude by mentioning that radio station 3NE serves a very important part of the community operation. It is a radio station that has given a deep commitment not only to its customers and its advertisers-the lifeblood of any radio station-but also to the community in the way in which it has sponsored, supported, encouraged, publicised and become involved in many community activities such as supporting the local hospitals when they have needed help, as well as Legacy appeals and Salvation Army Red Shield appeals. In virtually every facet of society in a region like north-east Victoria you will find that radio station 3NE plays its part in promoting and assisting particularly the volunteers in the community. I commend the management and staff of radio station 3NE for their dedication and for their achievements to date. I know that thcy will be happy to receive the news-when I ring them in a moment-about this legislation going through this parliament. It has gone through the Senate. I hope the minister has got his car waiting to go up to His Excellency the Governor General. We hope that we can see this piece of legislation enacted and proclaimed as law in this great countryperhaps even, by some miracle, by Friday evening.",31
10,Mr LEO MCLEAY,BROADCASTING SERVICES,"I guess after hearing the member for Calare (Mr Simmons) and the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) you would have to think that 3NE and 2BS would certainly need to run their local member a bit more and 2GO would certainly need to run the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) a whole lot more, because I have never seen two better as for their local radio stations. Some people would tell you that the minister probably only did this to help 2GO anyway. I think the comments that people have made on the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill show the importance of radio particularly in regional Australia, which is sometimes missed by people in the capital cities. As the member for Indi said, this bill has been before the Senate and has gone to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee. The committee has suggested some amendments. The government has also suggested some amendments to the legislation. We believe that the amendments will improve radio broadcasting services to communities that have only one service by speeding up the process for allocation of the second licence and, similarly, allowing allocation of the second commercial TV licence in such markets. The legislation also further clarifies the ownership and control provisions, specifying a 15 per cent limit. It will tighten up the anti-siphoning provisions for the acquisition of broadcasting rights by pay TV operators and it will ensure that satellite TV licences A and B can cooperate with each other without breaching the control provisions. As the member for Calare and the member for Indi have said, commercial radio licences in solus markets is an issue that has been in people's minds for some time. Under the current provisions of the Broadcasting Act the ABA is required to prepare a licence area plan for radio broadcasters. That procedure has meant lengthy delays in establishing extra radio services for communities where there is only one broadcaster. In August the minister announced that that process would be speeded up to allow extra services for such communities. The changes mean that some communities will get an extra service up to two years earlier. This will be of great benefit for those 50 or more areas which are currently serviced by only one radio station. These are all stations that are outside the capitals and the large urban areas of Australia. For many years-for generations in fact-most of those places have not had any choice at all. This process will create a bit more diversity in commercial radio outside the capital cities. The ABA has undertaken some technical planning to make sure that a suitable frequency is available. Whilst that may delay things a little, the process will be a lot quicker preparing a licence area plan. These amendments are in line with the objectives of the Broadcasting Services Act of encouraging greater diversity. In the bill the provisions for commercial TV licences in solus markets are also brought into line with these new provisions for radio licences so that once again we have more diversity and greater facilities are provided for people in country Australia. These provisions are a good example of the government's commitment to ensuring equity of access to information services throughout Australia. I guess we sometimes forget how big a place Australia is. When we think that 30 years ago very few homes in Australia had television, we realise how far we have come in communications technology. Things are moving so fast now that legislation may sometimes be a step behind what is happening in the technological area. These amendments are part of a process of responding to the communication needs of Australia swiftly and fairly. On that point I note that the comments by opposition senators during the debate on the bill in the Senate were rather petty. Senator Tierney complained that we did not get the regulation of pay TV right initially and he did not think that this bill was the right answer. After saying all that, he said that he was going to support it anyway. I was equally astounded to see that the opposition criticised the government for not developing planning strategies for pay TV and communications generally, yet they have come up with no other suggestion, constructive or otherwise, as an alternative. It is interesting to note that Senator Tierney said that what had absolutely amazed him was how rapidly this field had developed and how the landscape in pay TV now looked so totally different from the way it looked at the time of the pay TV inquiry. He criticised the government in the press for not foreseeing how pay TV would tum out, but at the same time he admits that he did not foresee it either. There are other areas where the government has needed to make some change and the than ownership and control provisions is one of those areas. These changes were announced on 27 June this year by the minister, following a report from the ABA. The changes mean that there will be a fixed 15 per cent ownership limit in all areas; that is, a 75 per cent audience reach limit, the one licence to a market limit, the cross-media ownership rules and the foreign ownership rules-which members will note are already capped at 15 per cent. These changes are designed to strengthen the media ownership and control provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act. There were problems with the existing control test, which was subject to any number of interpretations of the meaning of control. Depending upon which lawyer you went to see or which proprietor you talked to, they all had a differabout ent view of what control meant. I recall seeing one article in the press that suggested that you could own 20 or 30 per cent of the shares in a company but arrange your situation so that you did not actually have any control; or you could own five per cent and it could be said that you dominated it. The argument went on and on about what was the control provision. By fixing the ownership limit at 15 per cent and retaining the control test for interests under this 15 per cent mark, there will be much more certainty about what the government means by control and that will provide more certainty for the industry. By removing the opportunity for people to prove that they did not control a company at levels greater than 15 per cent, we are tightening the threshold. All the evidence points to the need for it to be tightened. Under the new rules, if a person holds more than 15 per cent of an interest in a company they will be deemed to be in control, without the need for an inquiry. Obviously, this will make the ABA's task easier and more transparent. Diversity of control of the media in Australia is one of the objectives of the legises lation and is always one of the government's main concerns. Diversity of ownership and avoidance of concentrated control furthers these other objectives of competition, plurality and independence. Some media owners, of course, have complained that these provisions are specifically directed at them. We have heard the opposition suggest this as well. That is simply not the case. The ABA reported on its investigations into the control of the Fairfax newspaper group--and these measures are a response to that report. The provisions will place limits on News Ltd's interests in the Seven Network as well as PBL's and CPH's cross-media interests in the Fairfax group. The startling thing about the 15 per cent control provisions is that the opposition voted against them in the Senate. They refused to support the amendment to set a fixed 15 per cent cross-media limit. Once again it seems that the government- Mr Howard commented Mr Black wanting to acquire a larger share in Fairfax last week-has to try to divine what the opposition's policy is. Obviously, the proprietors and the industry are trying to divine that as well. You seem to have to wait for a particular circumstance. It is just like a piece of litmus paper. You dip the opposition into the cauldron of media regulation and you see what colour they tum. If it was not for the fact that they have to respond to pieces of legislation that the government brings in, we might never get an inkling of what their policies are. The government's policy on media ownership is clear. The minister articulated our view on newspaper percentages very sharply last week and the opposition would do well to take the same point of view. The minister has also provided some amendments in this legislation to the antisiphoning provisions. Members will recall that, after the initial excitement about pay TV, people started to ask questions about what sort of programs they would see. The answer from the operators was, 'Everything you are seeing now and a hundred times more'. One of the big drawcards was the prospect of being able to view all the big sporting matchthat are not currently run on the commercial networks. That was greeted with great interest by people, but then questions started to be asked about the events that people do see on the commercial networks. Would pay TV buy up everything so that you would be forced to subscribe to pay TV to watch, say, your local rugby league game or the cricket test matches? Would pay TV start to provide only synopses of those games? Would we see the unfortunate paring down of the match of the day on free-to-air television now from 80 minutes to 60 minutes? Would it become 15 minutes of highlights? They were people's genuine concerns. The government's response to those concerns was the anti-siphoning provisions, which have worked reasonably well. The government did not want to see a situation arising where people who could not afford to subscribe to pay TV would not be able to watch the programs they currently enjoy on free-to-air television. This would not be in line with the government's policies of diversity and equity of access. Under section 115 of the Broadcasting Services Act the minister can list events which cannot be exclusively acquired by pay TV licensees. This list does not reserve the events for free-to-air TV, but gives free-to-air broadcasters the first opportunity to acquire those rights. It does not mean that the events cannot be broadcast on pay TV. That was an assumption of some people out in the community. The Minster for Communications last year published a list of events which included the Melbourne Cup, the AFL, the ARL and rugby union, test and world series cricket, major tennis opens, major soccer and netball matches and others. What we have discovered over the last year or more since the list has been in existence is that there are problems not with the minister putting items on the list but with taking events off the list. It is no use having events listed if the commercial networks have no intention of screening them, to hoard the event and prevent pay TV from screening it. That is not the purpose of the list. The amendments before the House provide for the automatic removal of events from the list seven days after completion of the event. This would give the broadcaster a reasonable opportunity to cover the event and pay TV operators the opportunity to pick up the event if they do not. Under the amendments proposed, the minister's power to amend the list of events will be discretionary rather than limited to the circumstances described in the current section 115, subsection (2). Examples of circumstances where the minister may want to exercise this power are given as notes under the subsection. This may be where commercial broadcasters have a real opportunity to apply rights to televise but have not done so or where a commercial broadcaster is hoarding an event, buying a right so that a pay TV operator cannot screen it, but not screening it themselves. It is the government's hope that these changes will have the dual purpose of ensuring that Australians who cannot afford to subscribe to pay TV will be able to view major sporting events and other cultural events, but at the same time ensure that commercial broadcasters-the free-to-air people-do not abuse their first pick privileges. A national or commercial broadcaster must have acquired the rights to televise a listed event to an area exceeding 50 per cent of the population of Australia before pay TV operators can do so. Members will realise that this bill encompasses some much needed reforms to the broadcasting industry. They are attempts to catch up with reality. As all members who want to sensibly follow issues in the broadcasting and communications area will realise, technology takes no account of regulation. The government is ensuring that we set a framework where we can get quick changes where necessary but that will enhance and improve the diversity and access of broadcasting services across Australia, which can only improve the quality of services that people receive. Most importantly, as this legislation relates to the regional market, for the first time in many years there will be a lot more diversity for people in regional Australia. The additional radio and television licences that one can have in those solus markets will be of significant benefit to the people in those markets. It will also help the further development of commercial radio in Australia, which tends to be the prime information source for Australians. I commend the bill to the House and commend the minister for his quick action on these problems.",32
11,Mr LEE,BROADCASTING SERVICES,"Dobell-Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism) (11.40 a.m.)-I want to respond to a few remarks by honourable members about the proposals to allow radio broadcasters in solus markets to proceed with establishing their second radio station prior to the ABA finishing their final frequency allotment plansFAPs and LAPs is the official technical jargon. The honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) challenged me to jump in the car and rush out to Government House as soon as the debate is concluded to ensure that this Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill is proclaimed. The reason I was not here for the second reading speech is that, as a member of the Executive Council, I was at Government House about issues that have been decided by cabinet in the past. So I will have to wait for another time to go back to Government House on this legislation. Naturally, the government is very keen for a number of measures in this legislative package to go through as soon as possible. I take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation for the support that I have received. People like the honourable member for Cal are (Mr Simmons) and Rob Allen and others in the Bathurst district have supported a speeding up of the process of section 39. FARB and people like Tony King have been extremely helpful in trying to make sure that we could address the very complex legal issues that have had to be considered and balanced in putting together this package for radio. I will now tum to the one issue in the package that continues to divide the government and the opposition, which is whether we should move away from a control test in the cross-media ownership rules to an upper limit of 15 per cent. That is the one issue that the opposition spokesman has indicated we will be dealing with in the consideration in detail stage. It is the government's view that, having received the ABA's report into the control of the Fairfax group early this year, there really was an increase in the amount of uncertainty in the broadcasting industry about how well the cross-media ownership rules would be applied in the future. It is for that reason that the government decided that there should be an upper limit. We then sought the advice of the Broadcasting Authority as to what number that limit should be. The firm conclusion of the ABA's report, after looking at all the various options, was that 15 per cent would be the fairest and would follow past practice to the closest degree. For that reason, the government has picked a number out of many that were considered by the Broadcasting Authority. We have responded to the concern in the industry that we needed to buttress and strengthen the cross-media ownership rules. We have wanted them to stay there. We have done that in a calm and rational way. The opposition's response to this has unfortunately been to dub these as the 'Get Packer' amendments. It is true that they affect  ownership of Channel 9, he will not be able to buy more of the Fairfax group. Otherwise he would be in a position to own an unacceptable level of Channel 9 in Sydney and the Sydney Morning Herald in Sydney and Channel 9 in Melbourne and the Age in Melbourne. That is why we have these crossmedia ownership rules, which try to limit the cross-media ownership of various media entities.  Ltd and Mr Murdoch. Their investment in Channel 7 is also restricted by their investments in newspapers. Under these rules, News Ltd will not be able to purchase more than 15 per cent of Channel 7 in Sydney, because they own the Daily Telegraph in Sydney. Because they own the Herald-Sun in Melbourne, they will not be able to own more than 15 per cent of Channel 7 in Melbourne. That limit is not an attempt to get any particular media proprietor; it is a matter of responding to the concern in the industry that the ABA report into the Fairfax ownership and control issues left open the chance that people could significantly increase their investments in cross-media holdings. This limit will ensure we do get the diversity that everyone in this parliament says they support. We say it is important for Australia to have a number of media owners because that increases the chances of different points of view being covered in the media. In fact, I would suggest that by buttressing and strengthening those cross-media ownership rules we are trying to achieve the goals of a number of petitioners-including perhaps the shadow minister, who will speak in a few minutes, but certainly the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard)-who in 1991 argued that the Fairfax group should not be  resulted in increased media concentration in Australia. The people who signed that petition certainly subscribed to the theory that diverse ownership is healthy for public policy in Australia and that we should try to maximise the number of media owners in Australia. I do not understand why the people who signed that petition in 1991-which said that Fairfax  people, if that concentrated the media-are today saying that it is unfair to put a cap of 15 per cent on these cross-media investments. Ultimately, it comes down to one question: should a person be able to own a television station and a mass circulation newspaper in the same city? If Mr Howard says yes to that question, he is saying that one person can reach 75 per cent of the population through the TV stations of pretty well all the capital cities as well as all the newspapers. So you are not just saying it is in one city; you are saying it is in enough cities to reach 75 per cent of the population right round Australia. On the government side, we think that is giving one person, whomever that person may be, too much power. We do not think a person should control a TV station and a mass circulation newspaper in a capital city. That is why we stand by the cross-media ownership rules. That is why we are buttressing and strengthening them today. The opposition's response at the moment is that it will hold a review. I noticed in today's Financial Review that Tom Burton made the following remark: The Coalition has been highly critical of many aspects of the Government's communications policy, but when it comes to articulating its own position it has resisted making firm commitmentsinstead using the time-honoured technique of promising a review. That is the current position of Senator Alston and the Leader of the Opposition. Senator Alston's position has evolved over time. Initially in a few debates in the Senate he argued that the 15 per cent allowable crossmedia ownership limit was too high and that perhaps it should be five per cent or zero, then he argued that perhaps it was too low. Lately he seems to be articulating the position that a review should be conducted. The difficulty is that the people in the gallery and the voters of Australia would like to know where the opposition stands on this important public policy issue before the election, not after some uncertain review is conducted in a year or two if the opposition wins the next election. For that reason, we do not think it is good enough for the opposition to say this will be decided some time in the future. We think the issue is too important for it to be decided after the election. The people of Australia have a right to know where the opposition stands on this important issue, just as they know where the government stands: we think those cross-media ownership rules should be buttressed and strengthened. Voters have every reason to be a bit worried because the Leader of the Opposition is on record as saying that he thinks the crossmedia ownership rules should not be on the statute books. He thinks they should be abolished and, in his opinion, should rely only on the Trade Practices Act. This is the position he articulated when he was the Leader of the Opposition in the mid-1980s, a position he has repeated in the year he has had his second go at being the Leader of the Opposition. If the chairman of the Trade Practices Commission knows anything about this, it would mean that there would be no restrictions on owning newspapers and television stations in the same city. The claim that in some way you can rely on the Trade Practices Act to stop these cross-media ownership constructions coming together has been shot down by Professor Fels. It is really a bit of a cover for the Leader of the Opposition letting slip his long-term view that people should be able to build up mass concentrations of media across television and newspapers. For all these reasons, the government is not prepared to accept the opposition position to delete the attempts in this legislation to provide that certainty, to provide that cap of 15 per cent on cross-media ownership. We think this is something that is good for ensurtion ing diversity in the media and we think it is something that, perhaps on reflection, the opposition might be persuaded to support in the longer term. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Clauses 1 to 4-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 5.",36
12,Dr KEMP,BROADCASTING SERVICES,"Goldstein) (11.52 a.m.)Clause 5 is consequential on clause 12. I will make remarks that bear on both these clauses, but with specific reference to clause 5. In concluding remarks, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) raised the issue of the government's 15 per cent limit on cross-media ownership. He says that this provision is going to provide certainty and that it is clear. The member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) supported him and said that the minister made a statement on this last week and that the government's position on this was now clear. The problem the opposition has with this is that the government's position constantly changes. This position is the government's position today. It has been the government's position for a short time. It is a position which the government appears to have adopted when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) became distressed over remarks that Mr Packer had made, indicating that perhaps Mr Packer saw the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) as a satisfactory alternative Prime Minister. That infuriated the Prime Minister. Until that time, the minister was quite relaxed about the rules as they previously existed and the Prime Minister himself had made remarks indicating that he saw no need to introduce any rigid restrictions into the legislation that were not already there and that the control test was adequate. So we have a government which is seen by the public and seen by the media to, by making theses changes, be responding solely to political pressures and political motivations. For the government to claim that its posiis clear will convince no-one. It has made changes without conducting any substantial review in this area, as the opposition has called for-a review which could provide the basis for a clear, long-term and agreed national strategy in this area. Instead of laying this firm foundation for a stable policy, all that is clear is that this is the government's current position. What is not clear is whether or not this position is going to be stable into the future. It is clearly not the position that the government has advocated in the past. The opposition have made it quite plain that we believe this is a politically motivated amendment to the legislation. It symbolises his the way in which this government is going about the politicisation of this and other areas of policy. I have some sympathy for Minister Lee, who is at the table, in that when you have a Prime Minister who is essentially now out of control, who is rampaging through the party and the policy areas as they take his fancy and as they express his current political views, he demeans everybody on his side of the parliament in the process. We saw the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) demeaned yesterday regarding decisions taken about the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) which he was not told about. We have seen the Speaker demeaned. We have seen the minister for communications demeaned, because he is placed in a position where he has no option but to go along with the Prime Minister's current preference. That is why, in the end, leaders like this do not last. That is why, in the end, leaders like this cannot give certainty to anybody. Nobody knows what the next preference of the Prime Minister will be. Consequently, because of the politicisation of this measure, the opposition will be opposing clauses 5 and 12 of the bill.",38
13,Mr LEE,BROADCASTING SERVICES,"Dobell-Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism) (11.57 p.m.)-The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) has tried to suggest that in some way these amendments are the  Current Affair in I think February or March of this year. That is completely false and untrue. You have actually forgotten some of the history that has taken place in the last 12 months. You alleged that I, as minister, was relaxed about this until that particular program went to air. In fact, I was relaxed until  going on A Current Affair; it was the report from the Australian Broadcasting Authority on the position in Fairfax. Many of the news reports of the ABA's report outlined the concern in the industry about the conclusions that could be drawn from that ABA report, which I think came out in late May. Certainly, at the cabinet meeting on 22 June I took a proposal to the government to strengthen the rules to respond not to  report. The reason we responded was that people were concerned that people-whether  else--could have owned much more than 15 per cent in cross-media holdings and argued that they were not in control. From 1987 until 1992 we had a limit of 15 per cent. The 1992 amendments were expected to keep the cap at 15 with the control test. We are simply making sure that that cap of 15, which has been there essentially until 1987, is restored. It is not a matter of the government changing the rules to suit particular circumstances. The 15 per cent limit has been there for cross-media ownership since 1987. This amendment is simply there to make sure that those cross-media ownership rules are sustainable. The opposition's real problem is that they do not want cross-media ownership restrictions. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has made that clear. I said that there was one question we wanted them to answer. The question was: should one person be able to own newspapers and television stations in all the capital cities? They say yes. In voting against these clauses, they are saying yes. By supporting this amendment, the government is saying no. That is what this debate is all about. Clause agreed to.

The amounts that have been adjusted relate to the imposition of a tax across the entire general aviation industry for the purpose of funding certain regulatory activities of the government in relation to general aviation and the operation of Airservices Australia. Yet this particular service, which is unlike the safety services, is one that is frequently not used at all by certain agricultural operators and other people who operate in general aviation at a distance from controlled air space and in other areas of that nature. The coalition welcomes the government's acceptance of our amendment which reduces the amount-in fact, apparently by even more than we thought necessary because, in the interim, there has been an adjustment by way of indexation which was not taken into account in the amendment.

22,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-It gives me litre'."" - great pleasure today to table these three reports by the Joint Committee of Public I shall briefly talk to each report in tum, starting on report 341 on financial reporting for the Commonwealth. The recommendations in this report, if adopted by the will result in the most significant in changes to financial reporting for the this Commonwealth since federation. In this report, the Joint Committee of Public Acbe counts maintains the momentum for moving the Commonwealth away from its often outdated cash accounting system into the accrual accounting culture. Australian business, of course, has long operated in the 1995. accrual accounting environment. As many members would be aware, accrual of accounting recognises revenue and expenses the accounting period in which they are incurred, irrespective of whether cash is paid or received. Accrual accounts for government departments would include depreciation and assets, employee entitlements such as long service leave and the value of goods and services received free from the Commonwealth or other bodies. Accrual information better reflects the true cost of providing The Australian Bureau of Statistics advised the committee that, by the tum of the century, the International Monetary Fund will be accrual based information from advanced nations. The recommendations in the report Financial reporting for the Commonwealth: towards greater transparency and accountability, if adopted, will ensure that Australia is well placed to meet international requirements for accrual information on the financial position of the CommonReports wealth by the year 2000. In 1992, the then Minister for Finance, the present Treasurer (Mr Willis), announced that financial reporting framework for Commonwealth agencies would be recast to reflect accrual accounting concepts. For the 1994-95 financial year, all government budget sector agencies have submitted annual financial statements on an accrual basis, most for the first time. The challenge now is to move all aspects of Commonwealth financial management, including the Commonwealth budget cycle, into the accrual environment. The committee takes up the challenge in this report. Building on the recommendations contained in report 338, Accrual accounting: a cultural change, the committee proposes in its report Financial reporting for the Commonwealth: towards greater transparency and accountaone to be avoided. bility that the accrual reports of government agencies, including government business enterprises, should be consolidated into an accrual based whole of government report the Commonwealth. But the preparation of whole of government reports is not the final stage in the transition from a cash to an accrual culture. There is little point in preparin ing the latest and greatest financial reports for the Commonwealth unless there is also a mechanism for feeding this information into financial planning and ultimately into the budget. If the Commonwealth produces tion excellent whole of government reports that on the shelf, the whole exercise will have been an horrendous waste of administrative resources. What's more, government agencies cannot be expected to take accrual reporting and accounting seriously if they are still required to budget on a cash basis and concome. tinue to be funded by cash appropriations. In this report, the committee proposes a financial reporting framework that ties the budget process into the accrual environment. At the moment, the form and content of the budget papers is at the discretion of governof ments and their advisers and there are no plans to move the budget process away from cash reporting. If the government ignores recommendations in the committee's report Financial reporting for the Commonwealth: towards greater transparency and accountareports. bility, the media and the community will continue to focus undue attention on the cash deficit or surplus. It is just not sensible Commonwealth budget cycle to continue on a cash basis once government agencies have moved to accrual reporting and once the Commonwealth itself has started to publish accrual based whole of government reports. There has been enough confusion about the Commonwealth's financial position when all the Commonwealth's financial reports have been prepared on the same basis. The prospect of having the Department of Finance publish a set of accrual numbers for the Commonwealth and the Treasury publish another set of cash numbers for the Commonwealth, and the public trying to understand why the numbers do not add up, is clearly In its report on financial reporting for the Commonwealth, the committee recommends that budget appropriations, forward estimates for and the budget process itself should move into the accrual accounting environment by the year 2000. In the committee's view, it is important that the parliament playa key role determining the form and content of financial reports tabled. After all, such reports are prepared principally for parliament's use. Accordingly, the committee also recommends that the government introduce legislato be called the fiscal reporting act in sit which parliament can determine the type of fiscal reports to be presented by governments. A fiscal reporting act, as envisaged by the committee in this report, would formalise the tabling of the budget papers, the Treasurer's mid-year review and the actual budget outThe committee recommends the preparation of two additional budget cycle reports: firstly, a pre-budget fiscal strategy statement to be tabled three months prior to the budget and, secondly, a user-friendly condensed version the budget papers that would be easily understood by the general public. But, more importantly, the fiscal reporting act would be the the vehicle by which the parliament could require the budget cycle reports to be prepared as accrual based whole of government The committee has also examined the possibility of enhanced parliamentary scrutiny for the of the Commonwealth financial reports. At the moment parliamentary committees examine the financial performance of government departments and agencies, but not the Commonwealth as a whole. The committee recommends that whole of government reports produced by the Department of Finance should stand referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The committee also recommends that budget papers should stand referred to a parliamentary committee to be established for the purpose under the proposed fiscal reporting act. By heeding the recommendations in this report, the government has an opportunity to ensure that Australia is at the forefront of the international trend to accrual reporting for governments. I shall now tum my attention to the second of the two reports being tabled by the committee today, namely, report 342, The administration of specific purpose payments: a focus on outcomes, which is the result of the committee's inquiry into the administration of Commonwealth-state agreements for specific purpose payments. A central feature of Australia's federal fiscal arrangements is the flow of Commonwealth financial assistance to state and local governments. Commonwealth financial assistance to the states is divided into two categories: specific purpose payments, SPPs, and general purpose payments, GPPs. In 1995-96, the Commonwealth paid out approximately $18.3 billion in accordance with the 90-odd SPP agreements between the Commonwealth and the state governments, local governments, universities and nongovernment schools. In the last decade reviews at the Commonwealth and state levels have highlighted considerable potential for improvements in the administration and structure of SPPs and the effectiveness and efficiency with which SPP funded services are delivered to the public. The weight of evidence prompted the JCPA to establish its own inquiry, which has culminated in this report. The JCPA made an early decision to confine its inquiry to the adminiscontrols tration of SPPs and avoid entering into debate on the appropriate balance of SPPs and GPPs to the states or the merits of individual SPP objectives. These issues are matters of policy and are well canvassed at the regular Council of Australian Governments-better known as COAG-and Commonwealth-state ministerial meetings. Despite arguments to the contrary from some state governments, the committee believes that SPPs are a legitimate vehicle for ensuring that Commonwealth policies and priorities are implemented, even if this is done by complementing or topping up existing state government services. As such, the Commonwealth should have the primary responsibility for setting the broad policy and national objectives of SPPs. In its report, The administration of specific purpose payments: a focus on outcomes, the committee argues, however, that the Commonwealth should shift its focus from the micro-management of SPPs and leave state governments with greater responsibility for service delivery planning. The trade-off for granting the states greater autonomy in service delivery planning is that the Commonwealth will place a correspondingly greater emphasis on measuring service delivery performance. The committee became concerned that too few SPP agreements clearly articulate what the SPPs are designed to achieve in terms of impact on the community. The result is often a continuing preoccupation with the activity associated with SPPs rather than with the results of the activity. The committee has recommended that all SPPs should have concise statements of what the SPP is trying to achieve, expressed in terms of measurable outcomes. Associated performance indicators should also be specified in the specific purpose payment agreements. Correspondingly, and importantly, state governments and other parties receiving SPP funds should be held accountable for their performance towards meeting program objectives, or what they achieve, rather than so much on how they achieve the objectives. However, the committee believes that input such as maintenance of effort clauses, match funding agreements and caps on the proportion of funds that can be spent on administration should not be phased out of SPP agreements before performance agreements are phased in. Furthermore, most Spp agreements will need a more sophisticated framework of sanctions in place for non-compliance with the terms of SPP agreements before the Commonwealth can give responsibility for service delivery planning to states. Such sanctions might include a temporary return to a greater Commonwealth involvement in service delivery planning and oversight. While the continuous collection and assessment of performance data should be the main way of measuring SPP performance, the committee believes it important for SPP administrators to be subject to external scrutiny by independent valuators. The Auditor General is the Commonwealth's major external reviewer and has the mandate to conduct performance audits for public sector entities and programs. However, the mandate does not extend to allowing the Auditor-General to evaluate the performance of the state agencies also involved in administering SPPs. The former Commonwealth Auditor-General has argued that Commonwealth auditorsgeneral should be able to conduct holistic performance audits that follow the Commonwealth dollar through. Such audits would best be performed by Commonwealth and state auditors-general conducting the audits with joint teams. There is a practical difficulty, however, that not all state auditors-general have the same performance audit mandates. The committee believes that the ultimate goal should be uniform audit legislation in all Australian jurisdictions. A less ambitious but more achievable goal which the committee has recommended in its report on SPP administration is that all audit legislation be nised to allow auditors-general to conduct joint performance audits of SPPs. In the short term, the committee sees greater potential for coordinated audits between the Commonwealth Auditor-General and those state auditors-general who have a mandate to conduct performance audits. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the Auditor-General investigate the possibility of conducting coordinated performance audits of SPPs with state auditorsgeneral. In its report on the Administration of special purpose payments: a focus on outcomes, the committee has recommended major changes in the way that the Commonwealth acquits the many hundreds of millions of dollars that it provides to the state governments, universities and non-government schools each year as part of SPP agreements. Let me state at the outset that the committee believes it is fundamental for the Commonwealth to be assured that SPP funds are spent on the basis on which they were allocated. However, the committee believes that it is possible to streamline SPP financial accountability mechanisms and still allow a full acquittal of SPP funds. In essence, the committee believes that the Commonwealth should be satisfied with the audited and appropriately annotated annual financial statements of SPP fund recipients for SPP acquittal processes. The advantages of this model are numerous. The agency receiving SPP funding does not have to prepare separate accounts for the Commonwealth, the audit task is not duplicated and the Commonwealth can be assured that the statements will be prepared promptly. There will thus be a saving in time, effort and costs, and one set of documents that satisfy the financial accountability requirements of all parties. On a related matter, the committee has recommended that Commonwealth departments administering SPPs should liaise with the Department of Finance to determine whether SPP payments are being made on an optimal schedule and dates to minimise the Commonwealth's recourse to short-term harmoborrowing. Such a recommendation has the potential to save the Commonwealth considerable sums of money, as badly timed transfers can place pressure on the Commonwealth's cash holdings and contribute to the need for short-term borrowings to cover any cash shortfalls. This recommendation complements recommendations made in an earlier report by the committee, report No. 340, concerning cash management in the Commonwealth. The committee believes it is important that both the public and the service deliverers are aware of the Commonwealth's financial contribution to the delivery of SPP funded services. In the committee's experience, it is all too easy for the Commonwealth's contribution to joint Commonwealth-state programs to be ignored. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that all SPP agreements should include arrangements to ensure that the Commonwealth's contribution is recognised in application documentation, approval announcements, media releases, official openings and other program publicity. The committee acknowledges that implementation of some of its recommendations will not be easy, particularly for the large, ongoing SPPs in the health, education and community services areas. Reforms will be gradual, not just because of the difficulties measuring outcomes and performance, but also because of the impossibility of quickly reorganising complex systems without service delivery suffering. Despite the practical difficulties, it is important that the momentum for reform continues. The committee believes that its recommendations, if adopted, will ensure that the momentum is not lost and that SPP administration and accountability as a whole is improved. Most importantly, those individuals or groups in the community who receive SPP funded services, of whatever form, should receive more efficient and effective service, delivered in the most economical way possible. I now tum to the third report being tabled by the committee today: report 343 entitled Tax law improvement: a watching brief In February this year I announced to the House that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts would be keeping a watching brief on the work of the tax law improvement project. This report is the first tabled as a result of that brief. The tax law improvement project is engaged in the task of completely rewriting Australia's income tax legislation. It is a of national significance and one which the Joint Committee of Public Accounts supports. Indeed, the improvement project was established in response to one of the recommendations in the committee's report 326 entitled An assessment of tax, which was tabled in parliament in November 1993. The report on tax law improvement contains the committee's comments on evidence taken at a public hearing held in October this year. At this hearing 17 witnesses from government, from tax and accounting bodies, and from academia were invited to give their views on a range of issues relating to tax law improvement. Our intention in presenting this report is not to call into question the work of the improvement project, much of which has been strongly supported in the parliament and in the wider community; rather, our interest is to ensure that the opportunities we now have to reform our tax law come to fruition. There are three main themes which emerged at our hearing and which are reflected in the in report. These are: the scope of the terms of reference for the improvement project; the way in which the re-written law should be delivered to parliament and implemented; and the need for a separate forum to examine matters of tax policy. I would like to refer briefly to each of these matters. It has been said that the capacity of the improvement project to produce simplified tax law is limited by its inability to examine and proposed changes to tax policy. Since the beginning, its mandate has been to re-express, in simpler language, the law as it currently stands-not to review current tax policy. After weighing the evidence, the committee believes that the mandate of the improvement project is appropriate. To encumber the project with a broader responsibility at this stage would jeopardise the chances of producing better tax law within the sort of time frame set for the project. The second main theme discussed at the hearing was the delivery schedule for the rewritten legislation. The project team is proposing to deliver the new law to parliament progressively, as it is drafted, and to seek progressive implementation, with each instaltask ment of the re-written law commencing for the income year beginning after royal assent. An alternative view, which has some currency within the tax industry, is that a deferred commencement date should be set for the rewritten law at the completion of the projectthe so-called 'big bang' approach. There are valid arguments in favour of both approaches, but on balance the committee considers that progressive implementation of the re-written legislation is a better option than deferring commencement of the legislation until the conclusion of the project. The final and most contentious issue emerging from the hearing was in relation to the need for a separate forum to consider tax policy issues. The evidence we received indicated widespread frustration in the tax business communities about the way in which tax policy has evolved and is debated in Australia. This frustration generated a number of views about the need for an alternative tax policy forum, about how such a forum might be constituted, and about what such a forum might consider. Although the committee is sympathetic to the concerns underpinning these views, in the end the committee does not support the calls for a new external forum for the development of tax policy. The development of tax policy is, and will always remain, a government's prerogative. The Treasury is rightly the focus of tax policy development in Australia. This is not to say that Treasury always gets it right, nor that tax policy should be determined in a vacuum. We received evidence which was strongly critical of the way in which Treasury deals with stakeholders in the tax system. It seems to the committee that Treasury could improve its performance in this area by adopting the sort of open and inclusive consultative processes used by the improvement project in its work. Even though we believe Treasury is the appropriate body to convene and direct any consideration of the strategic direction policy, there is a legitimate role for parliament to play in ensuring that issues emerging from the work of the improvement project are given close consideration. To this end the committee intends to continue its watching brief in the area improvement. While I expect that most tax policy matters emerging from the improvement project would, in the normal course of events, be taken up by Treasury and the ATO, the committee will follow up any significant matters which appear not to be receiving appropriate attention. Mr Deputy Speaker, opportunities for reform are rare and it is important that the momentum for change initiated by the establishment of the improvement project be not only maintained, but built upon. The improvement project shows every sign of achieving the objectives set for it. This is to the great credit of all involved in the project. I would like to particularly acknowledge the efforts of and the project director, Brian Nolan, who is performing a difficult job with distinction. Nevertheless, the committee agrees with those who have argued that the improvement project should be seen as the first step in a more ambitious reform of the tax law. Ultimately, a tax simplification program must focus on more than re-writing the tax act; it must be seen to review tax policy and simplify both the full body of tax law and the administrative systems underpinning the law. This broader goal is the challenge which will confront governments over the next decade. In summary, I believe that the recommendations in these three reports, if adopted, will contribute significantly to the better administration and accountability of the Commonwealth public sector. A number of individuals and public and private organisations, internationally and at the Commonwealth, state and local levels, have provided written and oral evidence to the inquiries that have culminated in these three reports. I would like to express my thanks, on behalf of the committee, to all those who have offered their assistance. I would like to take the opportunity to thank the staff of the secretariat, including our secretary Grant Harrison, and the secretaries of tax of our respective subcommittees: Susan Johnston, John Carter and James Catchpole. I wish to acknowledge the hard work done by the people behind the scenes who are always in there doing their bit. They are probably the unsung heroes. I refer to Laraine Brennan, of tax law Laura Gillies and Yolanda Rao. I thank the House for the opportunity to table these reports today. The committee certainly has had a busy three-year period starting with taxation report 326 and finishing on the tax law improvement project. I believe that the members of the committee have made a contribution and I thank them for that. I believe that the work of the committee is always first class as a result of all the hard work that is put in by the committee members and the staff of the secretariat. I commend these reports to the House.",41
23,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I, along with the chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, commend the recommendations contained in these three reports to the House. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts, over the life of this parliament, has been extremely busy in looking at a number of different areas of the operations and financial activities of the Commonwealth, the collection of Commonwealth revenue and. more particularly, the expenditure of and accounting for the expenditure of that Commonwealth revenue. The reports that we are tabling today are certainly a very important part of that series of inquiries that have been undertaken by the JCPA. Report 341, Financial reporting for the Commonwealth: towards greater transparency and accountability, looks at a couple of elements of government activity and operation in looking after the finances of the Commonwealth. The first element is that aspect of whole of government reporting which flows on from the report we did on accrual accounting and accrual reporting, moving the way the Commonwealth operates in that area up into the 1990s along with the private sector. We have moved in that direction as far as the commercialisation aspect of GBEs is concerned, but it is time the Commonwealth now looked at a much better accounting and reporting practice for all its agencies. Certainly there are some very important recommendations about that contained in this report. The second aspect of this report refers to fiscal responsibility legislation and the whole fiscal responsibility area. It all revolves around the words 'transparency and accountability'. It is important to note that recommendation 1 in this report is about getting the government to commit itself to the preparation of audited whole of government reports beginning with the 1997-98 financial year. To achieve that target, the report recommends that the government undertake a number of different activities in a number of areas. It is very important that the government take note of these reports. We have consulted very widely in these activities both within and outside Australia on the best accounting and reporting procedures that the Commonwealth can undertake, with the notion in mind that the broader population of Australia should be able to understand exactly where we stand, what is being done and where we are going in the future. An important part of that process and the process of moving towards accrual accounting is the way that we value the assets of the Commonwealth. We struggled with this a little bit and a lot of people gave very different advice on the way the government should value those assets, but certainly it is an integral part of the accrual accounting process. Recommendation 5 is fairly lengthy and has regard to the valuation of Commonwealth assets. In the report, recommendations 12, 13, 14 and 15 revolve around the recommendation to implement a fiscal reporting act. Recommendation 12 states: The Government should prepare and introduce into Parliament legislation to establish a fiscal reporting framework binding on Commonwealth governments, such legislation to be called the Fiscal Reporting Act. It goes on to say in recommendation 13: The proposed Fiscal Reporting Act should require: (a) that fiscal reports be prepared in the form of the whole of government reports on an accrual basis: and (b) that the form and content of fiscal reports for the Commonwealth accord with the Committee's recommendations in Chapter 2 of this reportthat is, whole-of-government reporting. Recommendation 14 says: . The proposed Fiscal Reporting Act should require: (a) that the Commonwealth adopt accrual budgeting following the tabling of the first audited whole of government reports for the Commonwealth; and (b) that the first accrual budget for the Commonwealth be introduced into Parliament for the 1999-2000 financial year. Then recommendation 15: The proposed Fiscal Reporting Act should require the tabling or publication of fiscal reports of specified format, as follows: (a) that an agreed set of indicators of the government's financial performanceincluding net debt as a proportion of GDP-be specified in the legislation; (b) that governments be required to report against these indicators their achievements and future policies in each report required under the legislation; (c) that fiscal reports incorporate estimates for budget year and the following four years of all major fiscal variables (such as net debt); (d) that the fiscal reports specify the macroeconomic assumptions on which estimates are based; (e) that fiscal reports incorporate forecasts or projections for the budget year and the following four years of all appropriate economic indicators on which fiscal estimates are based; (f) that fiscal reports contain a statement of sensitivity of fiscal estimates to economic conditions; and (g) that the format and content of the fiscal reports prepared under this Act remain constant over time to allow historical comparisons. I suppose that is the most salient point in that whole recommendation. We have to give the broader community in the Commonwealth the opportunity to be able to compare on the same set of internationally accepted standards within the fiscal reporting structure under this proposed 'Fiscal Reporting Act' the performance of an incumbent government to the performance of previous governments. Too often we see in political debate today the flexing of figures, the flexing of statistics, to suit the purpose of the government of the day. The people of Australia need to know exactly where the Commonwealth stands financially and need to be able to understand how a government of the day is actually performing on a set of benchmarks that can be used for successive governments. The people of Australia and commentators on economic performance need to be able to easily compare the performance of a government with that of the governments that preceded it. Report 341 is a very important report to come before this parliament. I urge the government to be cognisant of the recommendations in that report, to look at the drafting of the proposed 'Fiscal Reporting Act' and to move towards the dates that have been recommended to try to achieve whole of government reporting. We have highlighted in this place under a previous report evidence that was taken by a number of representatives from the bureaucracy, Treasury and Finance regarding their willingness to drag their feet on the issue of accrual accounting. It is incumbent upon the government to crack the the whip in that area to ensure that those dates are met. It is important that we get up to that level if we are to remain credible as financial managers, whoever is in government, to the Commonwealth, the people of Australia and the other nations that we are dealing with. I tum to report 342, The administration of specific purpose payments: a focus on outcomes. That is exactly what this report is all about-a focus on outcomes. Too often during the inquiries that were undertaken and in evidence we took it became apparent that the focus was not on outcomes but on inputs and outputs-that is, a tick was given by the bureaucracy, 'Yes, we will receive the money,' and a tick was given when the money was spent and that was the end of the issue. Not enough emphasis was put on the outcomes and whether the goals that were set right at the start when the SPP was raised and drafted and put into place were achieved. It is important that these recommendations are followed through by the government. I noticed that in the chairman's tabling speech he referred to a recommendation concerning performance audits. At the moment there are no performance audits. The best way to check on the delivery of outcomes from SPPs is if there is some arrangement between the Commonwealth Auditor-General and the state auditors-general to audit performance. It is easy to do a financial audit-it involves just confirming that the money is being spent in a particular area-but it is a different story for the Auditor-General to say that the government's objectives with this SPP have been achieved. That is not the case now, and recommendation 13 highlights it. It is important that the government take that on board. It is interesting to note at the start that, in the 1995-96 budget, total gross payments by the Commonwealth as SPPs were estimated to be $34.2 billion. That is 28 per cent total Commonwealth outlays. That is a very large slice of the Commonwealth it is important that a focus be placed on those outcomes. That is one area that the governleave-I ment needs to look at. Recommendation 11 highlights the need for incentives and sanctions for achieving those outcomes. Recommendation 13 highlights the need for performance audits. Recommendation 19 focuses on SPPs that go through the states to other service deliveries. The most efficient SPP was the local capital works program the end of 1992. The administration costs that SPP to the money out laid by the who Commonwealth was about 0.6 per cent, which makes it the most efficient and effective that we have seen. That was only mailboxed through the states because of the constitutionappreciate al arrangements. We probably need to see greater focus on those type of SPPs. The brief as I can. worse that could be instanced is the HACC program, where almost 19 per cent of the allocated amount of money going from the Commonwealth is absorbed in administration. My time is more than up on this matter. know that the member for Charlton (Mr series Robert Brown) will labour this point, but want to flag it as well: Commonwealth inmittee. volvement in SPP funded projects undertaken by the states is not often enough acknowimproving ledged by the states. Two major activities have been undertaken in my electorate under the black spots program. One is the Possum Brush deviation and the other is the Heron's Creek deviation. In neither of those cases was the Commonwealth recognised nearly enough. In both those cases, it was Commonwealth money, but the states took kudos. The states did the opening, and the Commonwealth was put well and truly in the background. In the Possum Brush not one representative from the government, the opposition or even the bureaucracy was involved. They were all state RTA people state members. I hasten to add that that was under a coalition government at the time. I know that the member for Charlton will have more to say on that issue. They are the important recommendations in this report. I commend all of those recomof mendations to the government. I certainly hope that they will take them on board in budget. So reviewing these reports.",47
24,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"by endorse the comments that were made in what I thought was an excellent tabling speech by the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott). Like him and the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), I commend to the government all the recommendations in those three reports. I also at commend the reports as a whole to members of of this parliament and the wider community have a continuing interest in issues of this kind. There are a couple of matters that SPP I want to refer to; the member for Lyne correctly anticipated that I may do so. I that we are under a major time a constraint, so I will keep my comments as Report No. 341 follows closely the tabling of report No. 338, which was concerned with accrual reporting and accounting in Commonwealth agencies. The consideration that was given in report No. 338 and now in report No. I 341 represents, in effect, a continuum of a of related initiatives that have been I recommended by the Public Accounts ComAll of those initiatives are directed towards what should be our primary goal of public sector efficiency, transparenroad work cy and accountability. Public sector accountability will no longer focus almost exclusively on spending limits and on cash based reporting. Increasingly, the focus will shift to accountability for outputs all and outcomes. This necessarily encompasses the performance auditing, benchmarking, best practice, program costs and service deliverythe totality of the management and use of deviation, public resources. Report No. 341, which has been tabled today, is entitled Financial reporting for the and Commonwealth. The core recommendation of that report is that the accrual reports of government agencies, including government business enterprises, should be consolidated into an accrual based whole of government report for the Commonwealth. Whole of government reports will give a picture not only of the government's revenue and expenditure but also of its assets, liabilities and resulting financial position. We have attempted to reach a sensible compromise with, say, the effort-and in some cases it is quite an absurd effort-that is made by some states in the United States and other jurisdictions overseas in pursuing what is commonly referred to as fiscal responsibility. I believe this present government since 1983 has been fiscally responsible. The record stands for itself. We have suggested some very important provisions in this report in connection with this move towards accrual accounting. The committee believes, and I strongly endorse this suggestion, that in the process of a government increasingly adopting an accrual accounting approach it should also extend that to an accrual based budget. A lot of nonsense is spoken about that bottom line, that deficit which to a very large extent means nothing. I have made the observation on previous occasions that in most budgets since the Second World War we have not had a recurrent deficit. The deficit often resulted from capital investment that government sensibly should undertake. On that basis, it lacks any significance. These quite absurd attempts that are made by some states in the United states and elsewhere overseas, including some aspects of the New Zealand legislation, to achieve what is referred to as fiscal responsibility often give rise to what is also called creative accounting. So those budgets can be manipulated in order to bring about the outcome required in the legislation. I commend this report very positively. It is a very sensible report, and I have indicated that I commend all the recommendations. I emphasise that the three reports are unanimous reports between all parties represented in this parliament and by both chambers. It is a joint statutory committee which is chaired by the member for Oxley. The second of the three reports, report No. 342, is entitled The administration of specific purpose payments. The chairman referred to the fact that in excess of 50 per cent of the total funds that are made available by the Commonwealth to the states for various purposes are in the form of these specific purpose payments. We know that for decades they have been a traditional source of conflict, tension, misunderstanding, dispute and duplication between the Commonwealth and state governments. There is always a legitimate acceptance on the part of the Commonwealth that if the Commonwealth raises the funds-that is, if we take the dollars out of taxpayers' pockets-we have a responsibility not only to apply those to a large extent according to Commonwealth priorities but also to make sure they are being correctly spent. Of course, the states often see the Commonwealth intruding into areas which they believe to be exclusively theirs. We dispute that. I believe that it is an appropriate area for the Commonwealth to be involved in. I said that all of these reports were unanimous. I do harbour some reservations about the question of the specific purpose payments. I am aware-this is one of the things to which the member for Lyne was alluding-of some of the petty and childish positions, attitudes and actions which are adopted and taken by state governments. Some of them are quite absurd and petty, even to the point of vindictiveness against the Commonwealth because the funds are provided by the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth has certain expectations of them. The member for Lyne referred to road openings and road projects where all the national taxpayers' dollars are provided to the states for those projects to be undertaken. He referred to some of the subterfuges that some state ministers get up to, I believe often encouraged by their Premiers and encouraged positively often by their bureaucrats. I think that reflects very poorly on them. If we are going to move to these performance based indicators-I believe we should; I think that is appropriate-I want to make sure they are clear, precise, quantifiable and not vague, high-sounding abstractions which can become an excuse for Commonwealth governments and Commonwealth bureaucrats to opt out of effective scrutiny in the application and use of national taxpayers' dollars. The chairman of the committee quite correctly said that we will not retreat from some of those other precautionary procedures we have adopted, and which are inherent in the funding of those programs, until we are satisfied that those performance based indicators are appropriate. I endorse absolutely the comment that the chairman of the committee made in connection with that. In relation to those performance based indicators, it is interesting that just yesterday in the Sydney Morning Herald there was a reference to our housing programs. The federal minister indicated that there would be established performance targets that would have to be met by the states in return for $3 billion worth of assistance. That is the move in the direction to which we have been making reference. I will very quickly make some comments about the tax law improvement project. I want to congratulate, as did the chairman, Brian Nolan, the project director. We have made only two recommendations in that report, but we addressed the major issues that were involved. I will quickly refer to them. While they are clearly contained within the report, I would like to emphasise and identify them separately. The first related to whether the project should proceed-there was some dispute about that-and if it should proceed, then how. The committee came down on the side of its proceeding. It is a valuable exercise which should be undertaken and I endorse the action that was taken and the encouragement and support that has been given by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in this connection, by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) himself and by the Treasury officers-by the government as a whole. This is a very sensible exercise. I know some reservations have been expressed, but generally we have endorsed the approach which has been taken. We believe it should be continued. The second issue related to the results of the tax law rewriting exercise. That is really what it is. It is not improving tax legislation; it is improving the way in which that tax law is expressed. Another point was whether, in rewriting that tax law, it should be introduced piece by piece or whether you should hold the lot and introduce it in to to at the end. We came down on the side of endorsing the approach which I am sure was being sought by Brian Nolan, and the Assistant Treasurer, that it be introduced piece by piece so that people have a chance to absorb it, adapt to it and accommodate it, rather than hitting them with a big rewriting of the tax law. I think the chairman suggests that that might amount to hitting them between the eyes with a big rewriting of the tax law in to to at the end. Another question we had to address was whether the rewriting exercise should include restatements of and changes to the tax law. We said, 'No, it should not. The purpose of this exercise is to simplify the way in which that law is expressed, to restate the law as it is, and then to clearly identify in subsequent legislation as is necessary any amending legislation to tax law, to tax policy.' We also acknowledged in that context that if, in the process of rewriting the law, there are occasions where some minor modification is necessarily inherent in that rewriting, then that should be identified in the explanatory memorandum so that we know exactly where those modifications are. If there are any more significant changes which inadvertently intrude into the rewriting of the legislation, it is the responsibility of this parliament and the wider community to identify them and seek to do something about it. The fourth issue to be resolved related to whether the improvement or reform project process should be continued through the creation of a comprehensive forum to advise on tax policy. The chairman of the committee has indicated that we said it should not. It is appropriate that the government of the day have the prerogative for the development of tax policies and legislation, but with the guidance, coordination, assistance and advice of Treasury. That is not something which any government should abrogate and leave to some type of external agency or group people. The fifth issue the committee gave conwith sideration to was whether a possible role for a parliamentary committee was the considerposition ation of emerging tax policy issues. Although that issue was flagged by the committee, committee agreed not to pursue it vigorously at this stage but to monitor any developments. I know that the chairman referred to that point as well. The sixth issue we gave considerable consideration to was the question of for whom tax legislation should be written. I am taxpayer. I do not read tax legislation very much, so I do not know that rewriting it and making it simpler would be of much value me. The question was whether we should rewrite the legislation for people in community who pay tax, or should we not rewrite it because we know that the profesam sionals in the industry are the only people who read it? I read the brochures and the advisory stuff that George Gear sends out me; but do not send me the tax act, George, because I do not go through that That is not a part of my late night reading at all. We accepted that the government does have the responsibility to make legislation readable and understandable to those people who constrained in any way by it or who are under any sort of obligation or requirement as a result of it. It is a question of getting a sible balance. I believe that the approach relations. Brian Nolan is taking to that is the appropriate one. Another issue that we had to consider was whether or not the rulings and determinations of the Australian Taxation Office should incorporated into the rewriting of the legislaaffairs tion. We said that, in general, that should be done, because in effect it would be saying that we would rewrite the tax law in terms the interpretations the tax office had put existing legislation, and we said not appropriate. It is interesting that Brian Nolan has now indicated that there will be some incorporapurse tion of rulings and determinations in the capital gains tax. The committee will seek of advice from Mr Nolan in connection with that, because that appears to be at variance the approach that he has adopted and that we have endorsed. We will determine our in light of that advice. I apologise to my colleague the member for the Macarthur (Mr Haviland), who is to follow me in this debate, but these were matters that I wanted to raise. I commend these reports and the recommendations to the government, and I commend the content of the reports to anybody who is interested in these issues. I found the exercise involving these reportsa under the chairmanship of our excellent chairman, Les Scott-to be very satisfying. I endorse Les's comments about the secretariat to as well-they are competent, qualified, professional people. Without them, these the reports simply would not be written.",49
25,Mr HAVILAND,COMMITTEES,"Macarthur}-by leave-I pleased to speak briefly on the reports that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts has tabled. Because time is short, I will confine to my comments to report No. 342, entitled The administration of specific purpose payments: in detail. A focus on outcomes. In the three years that I have been here, the one issue which has continued to cause frustration across a whole range of policy areas-in terms of the implementation of are government policies, particularly social policies-is the ongoing difficulties inherent in our federal system and constitution and the senresultant difficulties with Commonwealth-state When Federation was adopted in 1901, the states still retained power in most policy and administration areas. In 1901, the powers of the new Commonwealth of Australia were be limited to areas such as defence, foreign and immigration. It was not until after not the Second World War that the Commonwealth adopted primary responsibility for of taxation. So the states still ran most policy on areas--certainly areas such as health, educathat that was tion, housing, et cetera. Under section 96 the Commonwealth does have financial powers, as it largely controls strings. By the time the Whitlam government was elected, it was found that the states did not have a tremendous track record, especially in some of the areas of social policy, such as mental health or Aboriginal health. The Commonwealth, and certainly the new Whitlam government, felt that we had to do more to show leadership as a national government. That was when the SPP, specific purpose payments, became more prevalent. As the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) pointed out, ever since the 1970s, about 50 per cent of Commonwealth grants to the state have been in the form of specific purpose payments, and I believe that that is a good thing. When we talked to the states during the hearings in this inquiry, they had a different view. Understandably, they would like us to hand over all the money through untied grants and not even have a say in how the money is spent, even though it is Commonwealth money in the sense of being taxpayers' money. We have a different view here. As one of my colleagues said during the drafting of the report, 'Why should we trust state governments? You cannot.' I guess that is a frustration that a lot of us share, but the reality is that states have constitutional power and occasionally people in state governments want to do the right thing. The report process has been useful. We have had a thorough look at the way the SPPs operate. They are not perfect, and we have come up with a lot of evidence that the administration of them is less than wonderful. As an example I refer to recommendations 1 and 2. Recommendation 1 reads: Commonwealth departments should ensure that all SPP agreements include an explicit statement roles and responsibilities of each party to the agreement. Recommendation 2 reads: Commonwealth departments should ensure that each SPP agreement clearly indicates the arrangements for consultation between the parties to the agreement. On reading that, most people would shake their head and ask why that was not always the case. The reality is that we found in the inquiry that many of the agreements did not have those straightforward processes in them. We have recommended what the title to the report suggests: a focus on outcomes. It has been a very useful exercise to examine the role of the Commonwealth and the states in the implementation and the administration of SPPs. The SPPs need to be reformed and reviewed so that governments at all levels focus on outcomes, particularly in those very important social policy areas. While the Commonwealth has a responsibility to monitor the states, to ensure that the money is spent in the policy areas and that the money reaches the areas targeted by the programs, state governments are in a good position to run the programs on a day-today basis and to ensure service delivery. That is the report in a nutshell. This comprehensive and worthwhile report has been a particularly important undertaking by the Public Accounts Committee, which does a lot of important work, as we all know. There has been no more frustrating area in politics in Australia in recent years than Commonwealth-state relations, about which there was a big debate in 1991, leading to the setting up of a Special Premiers Conference in November, which never happened, as I recall, because the states boycotted it. There was a lot of debate in the community at the time, which I remember quite well, although I was viewing it from an industrial point of view. Nevertheless, we have never really come to grips with the difficulties in relations between the Commonwealth and the states. This report will not change the constitution. It will not tell state governments how to run their business but if, in any small way, this of the report can assist in bringing about a more efficient and rational approach to specific purpose payments while nevertheless maintaining the integrity and the need for those specific purpose payments, then the report will have been well worthwhile. I commend the report and endorse the comments of the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) about states, particularly the issue of recognition of the Commonwealth's role in some of the openings and some of the things that happen that I have experienced as well. I endorse the comments of the other speakers, the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) and the chairman, the member for Oxley. I commend the report to the House.",52

28,Mrs CROSIO,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (1.06 p.m.)-I am delighted to take the schools, opportunity to speak in support of the stateand ment of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) on the Australia Remembers gives campaign. In so doing I would like to give the House, and perhaps the rest of Australia, an example of how my community has been touched by the program's success, and most particularly the commitment it has had from the community as a whole. Over the last 12 months we have all enreport joyed commemorating the momentous events at of 50 years ago. In our newspapers and magazines, on our televisions and radios, the struggle and sacrifice of Australian men women have been brought home to us once fashion. more, back into our national consciousness where it belongs. The Australian people have shown that the events of 1939 to 1945 and our role in that war are still very important within our hearts. Just as the futility and the heroism of Gallipoli and the sacrifices World War I have long since ingrained themselves into our collective memories, so too have the deeds of Australians who particiia pated in all areas of World War II. Yet, while all Australians have looked on with pride as the events of the last year have unfolded, it is now time that we stood back as a government and asked, 'Did we do enough to involve all Australians in the commemorations? Were we successful in our campaign?' I do not believe we want these months to have passed and find that our celebrations have featured all of the pomp, ceremony and pageantry that we could muster, all of the famous faces and all the grand words, but that the people of our local communities had sat back in their armchairs or their kitchen tables and thought, 'I wonder what happened where I live; I wonder for the what happened in my community?' Thankfully, the great success of the government's Australia Remembers campaign is that it was not solely the domain of politicians and dignitaries paying lip-service to the deeds of our fellow citizens and it was not purely about remembrance events in our national and state capitals. It has been and is about generating remembrance and commemoration in our own communities-in our RSL clubs, sporting clubs and local associations involving our own businesses. The basic strength about Australia Remembers is that it ordinary Australians a chance to express their feelings, their gratitude, in local events organised by local committees. The minister outlined in his speech in February the level of commitment the government had displayed in organising Australia Remembers. It gives me great pleasure to that all of the hard work-and I think times all of the logistic nightmares-and all of the selfless volunteering have certainly paid off. Australians of all ages, backgrounds and and beliefs have been involved in some In my electorate of Prospect, like so many other areas around Australia, people threw themselves wholeheartedly behind the Australia Remembers campaign with a great strength of purpose. We all desired to see that of our veterans of World War II and other contributors to the war effort received the thanks and the respect they deserved. AustralRemembers focused our community, and I am happy to report that we have more than risen to the occasion. I would at this juncture like to place on record my sincere appreciation to the members of my committee who worked so keenly over 12 months: Bruce Short, the president of the Fairfield sub-branch and Fairfield RSL 12 Club, accompanied by his committeemen John Burgess and Jim Crossan and secretary-manager of that club, Terry Buck; Jack MCCosker, the president of the Smithfield RSL subbranch; and Ken Thomson and Fred Taylor from that sub-branch. We formed the Australia Remembers committee in Prospect in October 1994. One of the first tasks we set ourselves in my area was to build two eternal flames. We wanted to have one constructed at the Fairfield RSL and the other in the memorial park, directly opposite the Smithfield RSL. In March, on behalf of the Australia Remembers Task Force, I presented two cheques of $10,000 each to the Fairfield and Smithfield RSL sub-branches to assist them in the building of the flames. It provided only a very small amount of assistance because the clubs became very committed financially to making sure those projects came to fruition. People asked, 'Why did you use the eternal flame?' The concept of the eternal flame is described by the Australian War Memorial as follows: By burning in perpetuity, the flame parallels a nation's never ending gratitude to, and remembrance of, its war dead, and the never ending it places on freedom. Our community wanted two eternal flames to commemorate those words; two eternal flames to commemorate the actions and deeds of so many valiant men and women. We had never before had such a thing constructed within the city of Fairfield. I am proud to say that the Prospect electorate will now have two flames, where previously, as I have stated, there were none: two flames to remember the men and women from our area who died to keep this country free; two flames to remember those who fought and came back or who worked tirelessly in the war effort; and two flames for the people whom we now share fences with, shop with and work with. I had the privilege of unveiling the first flame at the Fairfield RSL on 15 August. I unveiled the second in the Smithfield RSL memorial gardens on 11 November, Remembrance Day. When Minister Sciacca discussed the government's blueprint for the commemorative year, one of the main problems he focused on was how little our schoolchildren knew of the threat facing Australia some 50 years ago. He hastened to point out that that was not a criticism of our children, nor was it a criticism of the education system. Our children needed to be reminded of the sacrifices, the fears, the hopes and the dreams of other young people, not much older than themselves, who embarked on a voyage to fight for Australia in the world's most frightening conflict. At the same time, one thing which the minister did not mention, but which was also of importance to the government during the planning stages of the program, was the need to make new Australians aware that the reason why Australia still enjoys such a robust and flourishing democracy is as a result of the action of their fellow citizens some 50 years ago. With one particular event in the Prospect electorate we were able to bring both of these separate groups of Australians together and to provide a stunning example of how well we have done as a nation. As many would know, the Prospect electorate has a young and value growing population. It is growing because of the large number of migrants who have decided to settle in that area and make it their home. We decided that the best way to unite an entire community was to hold an essay competition, aimed at our schoolchildren and, by gaining their contribution, we would naturally capture the interest of their parents, many of whom are of ethnic origin, and local businesses which would sponsor-and did sponsor so generously-that enterprise. The children were asked to write on the topic of why Australia should remember the end of World War II. We received hundreds of entries from the majority of schoolsprivate and public, primary and secondarywithin my area. Entries were judged by the Quota Club of Fairfield. Following a civic reception of some 250 people, provided through the generosity of Fairfield City Council, the winners were announced, congratulated and awarded their many prizes. It is important to remember that the entries did not just come as a result of pressure from teachers or parents. The competition was not part of the curriculum. Participation was not mandatory. Yet the hundreds of entries we received were certainly encouraging. These children wanted to be heard. Obviously, remembering wartime Australia and its people was very important to the younger generation and they were very keen to show it. The competition proved to be a remarkable success, not only because of the number of entries and the interest it generated in the community or because many local business people stepped forward to offer prizes for the winners, but because of the standard of the entries and the opportunity it provided for our young people to express how they felt about Australia's role in the Second World War. It crystallised their emotions and resulted in some extremely tender and thoughtful responses of which we can certainly all be proud. I judge it a success on yet another level: many of the entries came from schoolchildren of ethnic backgrounds-Vietnamese-Australians, Croatian-Australians, Italian-Australians and so many more. All submitted entries and all gave reasons why we, as a country, should remember the end of World War II. I judge it a success on another level. So many of the entries came from school children of ethnic backgrounds-Vietnamese Australians, Croatian Australians, Italian Australians and so many more. All submitted entries and all gave their reason why we, as a country, should remember the end of World War 11. I would like to record in Hansard a few extracts from some of the winning entries from those students. One was Sylvia Spagnola, a 6th grade student from St Gertrude's Primary School. She wrote: My grandfather fought in the war. He survived. The war was so terrible and it hurt my grandfather. so much on the outside, but on the inside. Sylvia's classmate, Susan Cirillo, wrote: My opinion ... is that we should remember World War II and any other war because Australians want freedom, respect and peace. We have comments from two year 9 students who were winners in their category, Kiet Nguyen of Prairiewood High, and Melina Napoletana from Mary MACKillop College. Kiet wrote: Australia feared that they too would be invaded by Japan so they withdrew many of their troops in North Africa back to fight in the Pacific. And Melina: Letters and diaries of the men and women from that period reflect an intense feeling of loneliness and longing for home. Vesna Arbanas, who is a Croatian Australian girl from year 10 at Prairiewood High School, made this very poignant comment: World War II changed Australia ... Australians began to realise that our freedom had been taken for granted. Its importance was realised when it was almost taken away ... by the war. Irene Gabra, of year 10 from Mary MACKillop College, writes: It's easier to forget than to remember. Why let the pain live on? ... because if Australians forget the end of World War II, then they forget a generation that lived-and died. Finally, the winning student of year 12, Peter Tollens, from Westfields Sports High School, wrote: World War II and its end must always be remembered ... to pay homage to the millions of patriotic and self-sacrificing Australians involved and because of the powerful lessons it provides for modern life. These were just a few of the essays that I could read--every one of them is moving. It is important to note that 12 months down the track we have achieved, among our kids and among our new citizens, an understanding of the price of victory and of the freedom that they themselves are now depended on to protect. These are objectives that have been central to the Australia Remembers program. I would particularly like to commend and Not congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and his staff for their fantastic work, as well as all the numerous state and local organisations that have carried the Australia Remembers banner so successfully into all parts of our society. I hope that, by giving you just a very small glimpse of what we have been able to achieve in Prospect during the year, I have been able to convince the members of this House of a job so very well done. Again, it could not have been achieved without the dedication and hard work of the volunteers who worked to make sure we had such a successful year. It was not an easy task to construct the flames. We had some technical difficulties as to where we could put gas lines. We had to seek the cooperation and assistance of the local council on more than one occasion. The unveiling of the eternal flame at Smithfield on 11 November-just prior to the 11th hour-was something for all to observe. It was a moving ceremony. The hundreds who attended on that day will never forget, and that flame now sits there with pride. The memorial garden in Smithfield is unique in our city. It is dedicated to people who wish to have their ashes interred there. It was during my time as mayor that the Smithfield RSL approached me and asked if they could have that area as a garden dedicated to memory. It was within that garden that we built this sandstone flame. Their request gave me the motivation to get that committee up and going, to see all of the services recognised in that way; otherwise the Australia Remembers flame is something that I believe would never have come about. Over a period we had discussed what we should do with the money that was given by the government, when the suggestion came forward from the Fairfield RSL, 'We know it is going to cost us a lot more than that, but we want something that will live on. We want something that will be there, even after we have all gone.' The Fairfield flame is constructed in the centre of their club, as you walk in through their front door. It is magnifichildren cent granite and glass. The flame bums there in perpetuity, in honour of so many wonderful service men and women who not only are members of the club, but who also enlisted from that district. Through that wonderful committee we have achieved what we set out to do. We set out to honour and commemorate the Australia Remembers program but, most particularly, we made sure that we left a memory for many years to come. Again I place on record my sincere appreciation and my congratulations to the community for a job well done. I thank all of those, too numerous to thank, who got involved in projects such as this. For example, the Quota Club women just came forward and said, 'We'd like to be involved and be able to help you. We will judge the essays.' These were things that people did. They did not have to be pressured into it, they just volunteered. I put on record my congratulations to them all and I thank them for their assistance. I particularly thank the minister for providing an opportunity to an electorate like mine which enabled us to participate in such a wonderful program.",54
29,Mr REID,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is an honour and a privilege to speak to the ministerial statement made by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) on Australia Remembers 1945-1995. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 14 August at the Australian War Memorial launched Australia Remembers 1945-1995. That launch signalled the commencement of 12 months of activities designed to commemorate and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War on 15 August 1945. The major objective of that program, initiated by the federal government, was to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. I am pleased to say that there has been a bipartisan approach to the program. The coalition has fully supported it and the program has had my total support during this year. The program's other objectives were to encourage all Australians to remember and to thank the veterans who fought in the World War II campaigns, to recognise and appreciate the sorrows and difficulties of the widows and of those veterans who did not return or who died in the intervening years, to encourage all Australians to remember and thank all who remained at home and kept the home front running, to recreate a sense of relief and excitement which marked the end of the war in 1945, and to educate the nation about the horrors and impact of World War II. I take this opportunity in the parliament today to thank all Australians involved for the magnificent contribution that they made to the war effort both overseas and in Australia, and I thank those who maintained the home front. If it had not been for the great contribution and efforts that were made by all of the people during the Second World War, and the people in my electorate in particular, people like me and all of the young people in Australia today would not be able to enjoy the freedom and the wonderful lifestyle that we have here in Australia. On behalf of people like me and the young people of this nation, I want to take the opportunity to thank all ex-servicemen and women and all of the people who kept the production lines open and Australia operating while our troops were away fighting in the Pacific, in Europe and throughout the world during the Second World War. I thank them for the magnificent contribution they made to Australia. When you think about the magnitude of the Second World War with deaths totalling approximately 40,000, the wounding of some 67,000, the internment of over 30,500 and the 992,600 service personnel who left our shores or fought against attacks on Australian soil, including the many civilians killed or injured from such attacks-and they fought in that fashion to protect our values-it is just too important for everyone in Australia not to remember their efforts. It is quite staggering when you go through country communities in particular and see the honour rolls and the memorials, the names and the number of people who were involved in the conflict of the Second World War. The Second World War was-and I hope will remain-the only time when the Australian continent has come under attack from the modem war machine and when Australian citizens have died on our land from such attacks. Sadly, even this situation is little known or understood by contemporary generations. However, the Australia Remembers program has aroused a curiosity amongst our young people wishing to find out about that important part of our history. I believe that is appropriate under the circumstances that young people understand such a significant period in our lives. The year 1995, as the 50th anniversary of the end of the conflict, is the appropriate to remind all Australians, young and old, of the threat and horror of war and of the contribution and sacrifice that was made by so many Australians in those grim days to successfully protect our land and the values for which Australia has been internationally recognised. The Bendigo electorate responded magnificently to the Australia Remembers program, and a number of committees were formed. It was too difficult to organise one committee to cover such a large geographical area, so I enlisted the support of a large number of organisations, including the Campbells Creek RSL which held a memorial march, a concert and visits to local schools. The St Arnaud RSL had a reunion lunch and march. Mr Bruce Ruxton was in attendance as the guest speaker and gave a very compelling message on that day. In Maryborough the involvement of the RSL through its president, Mr Frank Prime, and secretary, Mr Jack Looney, was magnificent. They were supported by the Central Goldfields Shire and the chief commissioner of that shire, John Gault. A band concert, supper and a very moving concert were held at which I had the honour and privilege to be in attendance. There was also a commemoration ceremony and presentation of Australia Remembers certificates. I was assisted by the RSL president, its secretary and the commissioner of Central Goldfields. We had so many people respond in that area that we had to divide the presentation day into morning and afternoon segments. In all, we probably presented over 400 certificates. It was a magnificent day and an opportunity to recognise people's contributions. Charlton RSL had a commemorative picnic. I recently unveiled a plaque to a project at the Travellers Rest whereby heavy-duty tables and chairs had been provided. It was a very fitting occasion. I visited the Clunes RSL Sub Branch with my colleague the member for it Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) for an open day at the RSL hall where there was a magnificent display. The Huntly committee, under the chairmanship of Mr Keith Kelly and his active committee, had erected a cenotaph, time held a victory ball and a commemorative service. The Talbot RSL Sub Branch unveiled a commemorative plaque and planted a tree to remember the occasion. The Castlemaine committee held an Australia Remembers concert and a magnificent march, which included a whole range of vintage motor vehicles. It was a magnificent day. I had the honour of unveiling a plaque, and we also had a morning tea ceremony to present Australia Remembers certificates. I was assisted by Commissioner Mos Thompson, the Chief Commissioner of the Mount Alexander Shire. That was an occasion to remember, with almost 250 certificates being presented during that morning. It was a fitting recognition of the contribution that people of that Castlemaine area have made. I also attended the Heathcote RSL where I presented a number of Australia Remembers certificates. At WedderburnlKorong Vale RSL a remembrance rose garden and plaque had been completed. It was a unique and ongoing way of remembering the contribution to the Second W orid War of Australians from that area. The Bendigo RSL, combined with the subbranches at Eaglehawk and Kangaroo Flat, had a magnificent victory parade. The whole length of that parade was flanked by school groups, young Australians who are enjoying their freedom as a result of the contribution made in war by our service personnel. They lined the streets and waved their Australian flags. This victory parade and service was followed by a barbecue in Rosalind Park and was a magnificent way of recognising the contribution made by our Second World War personnel and in fact everyone who had made a contribution, whether it was overseas or at home. The Bendigo committee, under the chairmanship of Mr Cliff Clohesy and with great assistance from Mr Alan Holmes and the secretary, Mr Jack Barnes, and all the other members, also put on two extremely good concerts to commemorate the Australia Remembers year. Those two concerts were very well attended. They were outstanding events and the public of Bendigo were very generous in their support. I commend that committee for the magnificent way in which it organised commemorations for the Australia Remembers year and the contribution that was made by all of the people of Bendigo. We are still distributing Australia Remembers certificates. Remembrance Day, the 11th day of November, reminded people once again of the contribution that people have made in the whole area of defence of Australia. That initiated fresh inquiries from people who wish to have an Australia Remembers certificate. I want at this point to thank my own staff and my own office, because this has been a huge task. I am not sure of the total number, but we have certainly printed and distributed more than 2,000 Australia Remembers certificates. That has been a big task for them which they have performed magnificently, and I want to publicly place on record my thanks to my staff. I mentioned the bipartisan approach which was adopted by the government and the coalition in the Australia Remembers year and I want to pay a tribute to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who was most cooperative and was very fair and just in the manner in which he arranged the whole program and the responsibilities which he entrusted to me as a local member to organise and oversee the Australia Remembers year in my electorate. I received good support from his department and I thank the minister for his contribution there. The only other matter which I wish to raise is the restoration program, which was also an initiative of the government, to restore a number of memorials and memorial halls throughout my electorate. This was done in cooperation with a number of job schemes through the Department of Employment, Education and Training. It was an opportunity to do refurbishment and restoration work on a lot of the memorials and memorial halls, which probably would not have been able to have been done without that initiative and without that contribution. A number of halls and a number of memorials in my electorate have benefited as a result of that initiative. Those halls, which had to some extent been a little neglected, have been able to be refurbished and given a new lease of life. The community have responded well to that and are using those halls much more than perhaps they previously did, because they have all been refurbished and are very attractive. The Australia Remembers year was a fitting way to recognise the magnificent contribution of all of the people who were involved in the Second World War, whether they were here defending our home, whether they were overseas, or whether they were keeping the home fires burning while our personnel were overseas.

30,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," Mr Deputy Speaker, 1995 has unquestionably provided a major opportunity for Australians right across this continent to revisit the experiences of World War II and revisit that great feeling of relief which accompanied the end of the war in Europe and the end of the war in the Pacific. The nature of war results in bringing about two diametrically opposed qualities of the human character. We saw those two qualities emerge during that war. We found on the one hand incredible and inspiring displays of heroism, self-sacrifice, loyalty, mateship courage, and on the other hand we saw unconscionable, appalling and degrading displays of destruction and brutality. I would like to congratulate the government, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) and so many other people who established the model of community involvement which was adopted. I congratulate the government and Con Sciacca's determination to ensure that Australia would recognise the 50th anniversary of the end of that world war and recognise it in away, hopefully, that people would long remember. They ensured that there were major national commemorative events and in addition to that, at the local level, they provided seeding grants of $20,000 for each electorate. I endorse that model. I think the way in which members from both sides of this parliament responded to that program indicated that they did want to be involved and that they did want to be identified with their own communities, those men and women and those children that they represent in this national parliament, in the celebration of what was such a major event. I have seldom worked with a more cooperative or committed group of people. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know and we all know that when you have the responsibility for disbursing funds it is often very difficult because everyone wants a slice and no-one generally believes that the claims of others are superior to their claim. In my electorate of Charlton there were applications for in excess of $100,000 but we only had $20,000. Therefore, it was the responsibility of the committee which I was privileged to bring together to determine how those limited funds would be applied. Of course, there were disappointments but there was no ill-will on the part of any of those individuals, organisations or interests that did not get funded. They all recognised that the committee had done its job and I too acknowledge the job that committee did. I acknowledge it to the point where I want to identify each of them. I want to mention Mr Harry Creek, Chairman of the Charlton Australia Remembers committee, RSL District and President and Secretary of Toronto RSL; Cec Donaldson, President of Toronto RSL; Tom Best, Secretary of Wangi RSL; Frank Drew, President of Wangi RSL; Neville Ayliffe, President of Cardiff RSL; Arch Adams, Secretary of Cardiff RSL; Lyall Scott, former President of the Boolaroo-Speers Point RSL; Ray Gifford from Morriset RSL; Councillor Alan Hunter from Lake Macquarie Council; Mayor John Kilpatrick from Lake Macquarie Council; Ms Helen Webster from the Department of Veterans' Affairs and her colleague, Ms Julie Brooks; Mr Bob O'Hearn, an RSL state councillor; Keith Ayres, President of the Boolaroo-Speers Point RSL; John Heathwood from the Lions Club; Stephen Garz, one of my electorate officers who acted as secretary for the committee; Herb Howlett from Morisset RSL; Kevin Frazer, a resident of Fennell Bay; and Mr N. Jackson, Vice-President of the Cardiff RSL sub-branch. That is a comprehensive group of people from lots of different areas. There is a preponderance of RSL members, as one would expect. All those people responded magnificently to my request that they participate. They were enthusiastic and cooperative. It was a great pleasure to be associated with them. That was the Second World War, as we know. My paternal grandmother, Annie Brown, later MCCormack, had four sons, all of whom--including my father-served in World War II, three of them overseas. My maternal grandmother, Mabel Johns, also had four sons. The eldest served in World War I and was wounded, but survived, in France. The second eldest served in World War II, including the Kokoda Trail. I remember as a kid observing the fact that that uncle of mine carried the psychological damage of his experiences until the day he died. I am one of the older members of this parliament. I was 11 years of age when the Second World War ended 50 years ago. The Australia Remembers objectives were summarised in the Australia Remembers booklet that was published and provided by the government. It says: Australia Remembers aims to: thank the veterans who fought in World War II; recognise the widows and children of those who died; remember all who kept the home front running; recreate the joy at the end of the war in 1945; and educate the nation about World War II. The themes were commemoration, celebration, education and legacy. When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), spoke about Australia Remembers at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra on 14 August this year, he said in part: The generation we will commemorate and thank was a heroic one. They fought a war in defence of the country they loved, and they bequeathed to their children the opportunities which they had denied. They were nation builders. Referring to what they had done for Australia, he said: But they left us more than that. They passed on a tradition and a faith for us to live by. By their example they taught us about the ties that bind us, and our common cause. And by the same example they compel us now, not just to remember them, but to pass on the lesson to our children. We hope that the planned commemorative events will do this. We also hope that at the end of the celebrations Australians will have a much more thorough appreciation of the war itself and the nature and extent of Australia's involvement. He continued: I hope Australia Remembers will add to our nation's understanding and confidence about our place in the world and our capacity to play a creative and humane part in it. The Prime Minister concluded with these words: We want to involve every Australian community. We want all Australians to be touched by it-all who contributed to winning the war and making the peace, and all those who have benefited from those triumphs. I think that was a profound statement. He referred to the sacrifices that had been made. Let me put that in context. The gross enlistment of Australians in the Second World War was 993,000. Over 27,000 were killed in action or died as prisoners of war. That is the whole population of a typical Australian provincial city. Some 23,500 were wounded in action. Almost 23,000 were prisoners of war. That was the contribution made by Australians. Let me now put Australia's contribution in context. In World War I, the number of deaths in combat--or we might identify them as military deathswas just over eight million throughout the world. In addition to that, 6Y2 million civilians died in World War I-and that was the war to end all wars. It did no such thing. Nor did the Second World War end all wars. In World War II, that war which ended 50 years ago this year, the total number of deaths in combat was 15 million. As for the total been number of civilian deaths, of various estimates the lowest is 26 million and the highest is about 35 million. It was a slaughter. It saw the massive destruction of human achievements, achievements which often had remained in place for hundreds-and, in some cases, thousands--of years, and the massive slaughter of men, women and children throughout the world. They are the types of things that we need to recall. They are the types of things which, I believe, emphasise to all of us the absolute necessity that circumstances of that kind are never in place again. I sometimes wonder whether we learnt the lessons, when I look at some of the events which have occurred since the Second World War. At the present time, military expenditure equals $1 trillion-that is, one million million dollars-every year, year after year. Of that total expenditure on defence, military purposes or war preparation-however it is expressed--one quarter would eliminate most of the problems of the world's people. The World Bank has estimated that, in the past 90 years, wars have caused 87,000,000 deaths. The cost of the Second World War to Australia was Â£2,107 million. That is just in monetary terms, of course. In today's money, that represents at least $75,000 million-an enormous outlay of national resources. Of course, that does not include the trauma and the anguish visited upon families and individuals as a result of those horrifying experiences. Con Sciacca, when he spoke at the launch of the Australia Remembers commemoration at the Australian War Memorial on 14 August 1994, said, in part: The theme of this commemorative year is Australia Remembers. We will encourage all Australians to remember and thank the veterans who fought in World War II campaigns. We will recognise and appreciate the sorrows and difficulties of the widows and children of those veterans who did not return or died in the intervening years. We will remember those who worked so hard for their country in the factories, on the farms, who provided the supplies so vitally needed to fuel the Australian and allied war effort. We will remember those women who served in uniform at home. We will remember the Aboriginal Coastwatchers, the Fuzzy-Wuzzy Angels and all others deserving recognition. We will remember too, those who came to Australia after the Second World War to start a new life. We will recognise that many of these people endured years of deprivation and suffering at the hands of a brutal enemy. We will remember those who have done so much to help the victims of war; the widows, the mothers, the grieving children. Australia has a proud record of care for its veterans and victims war and we should remember the men and women who have given so much with a real sense of gratitude. Indeed, we should remember them. That was the purpose of that exercise. We should remember the people who provided incredible displays of heroism, self-sacrifice, loyalty, mateship and courage; the people who made the personal and the family sacrifices; and the children who did not see their fathers or, in some cases, their mothers while they were growing up, and those children who never saw their parents again. It was a traumatic period. Out of all the circumstances of that kind there were varying results. As I said, one of the results within my electorate was that those people all recalled their own experiences and the experiences of others during those four or five years and the feeling of relief, of camaraderie, friendship, mateship, achievement, hope and optimism which came with the end of the Second World War. We all have a responsibility to ensure that the heritage of this nation in relation to those matters is never forgotten. (Time expired) Debate interrupted.

The Senate, in considering the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill 1995, agreed to one amendment to the bill. The amendment provides that annual reports to the Privacy of Commissioner that will be required to be made by those agencies involved in the data matching program should also be laid before each house of the parliament. As this House will recall, the bill as introduced annual interim reports to be provided by agencies to the Privacy Commissioner and for agencies to make reports to the parliament every three years. As the House will further recall, the government had indicated that it would be amenable to a program of annual reporting to the parliament if an appropriate amendment was moved. Accordingly, the government accepts the amendment made by the Senate.",62
32,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) for his outline of the matter. I did indicate previously that this was an amendment that the opposition would be seeking in the Senate to the Social Security Legislation (Carer Pension and Other Measures) Bill 1995. Data matching is a process that the government claims is yielding important results. We are not satisfied that that is yet evident. We have some significant criticisms of the government's performance in dealing with fraud issues generally in the area of social security. Data matching was claimed to be able to produce significant results in addressing those issues. We think those results remain quite ambiguous in terms of the expectations that were first outlined as to the results that might be achieved. It is for this reason that we are still seeking to maintain a sunset clause so that, if parliament at a future date comes to a view that data matching should be discontinued, it can come to that view. The sunset clause ensures that that can happen. A sunset clause with comprehensive reporting requirements to the parliament that wants to review this matter-that is, without delegation to some intermediary such as the Privacy Commissioner-is the only appropriate way to deal with the matter. Our amendment was to ensure that that regular reporting, which has been a feature of the data matching regime to this point in time, is continued. The amendment is worthy of support. I am glad that the government has come to the view that it should be continued, and has supported this amendment.

33,Mr DUNCAN,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The Senate agreed that two amendments relating to the extended deeming initiative should be made to the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. The amendments would specify, in both the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, when listed securities and market linked managed investments might be revalued. The government had intended to consult the community before introducing revised administrative arrangements for valuing assets. It had already informally discussed some options for better administrative arrangements with groups such as APSF. However, the non-government parties were keen to have the arrangements set out in legislation. Although the government would have preferred the opportunity to consult more widely, it does support the general principles of providing pensioners with certainty and clarity in the revaluation of assets. For this reason, the government moved an amendment in the Senate. The Senate also agreed that a clarifying amendment should be made to proposed section 1073 of the Social Security Act 1991. The government also supports that amendment.",64
34,Mr RUDDOCK,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I would like to take the opportunity to speak to this amendment and other amendments that in depart- were considered, in a cognate way. It is important, in the context of the extended deeming arrangements, to understand what we are doing here. This legislation resulted from the government's efforts to implement a system whereby any increase in the capital value of assets held by pensioners or part pensioners might be taken into account for the purposes of the application of the income test that is applied to all pensioners, so that, if values of a managed investment or a share sub- rose during a defined period, that could be nodeemed to be income. Nobody could ever reap a capital gain, but it was deemed to be income and their pensions were reduced accordingly. The measure was exceedingly unpopular, as one might well imagine, with pensioners and part-pensioners alike. In the end, after an inquiry undertaken by a Mr Barber of Ageing Agendas, the government came to the view that it needed to repeal that measure. But it did not want to do so without obtaining the benefit of additional savings for the government, in terms of expenditure. So it moved, in relation to the income testing regime, to deem that people would obtain a certain level of return on financial assets whether they got that return or not. The extended deeming arrangements envisage a five per cent or a seven per cent return depending upon the value of financial assets that a pensioner or part pensioner might have. It was in that context that we were having to look at the application of this new system which the government said was going to deliver certainty to pensioners and part pensioners. That is why we have had to turn our mind to this issue. Obviously, if we were to oppose the government's extended deeming arrangements, we would have been seen as stopping the repeal of the unrealised capital gains measure. So, in a sense, even though we have quite significant doubts given the large number of people who will see their pensions reduced or who are likely to lose the benefit of fringe concessions that they now haveand the government admits that some 207,000 people are likely to be affected by this measure--our view has been that the government's legislation has to be reluctantly supported. It was deficient, nevertheless, in a number of important respects. The first area in which the legislation was deficient was that there was no indication as to the way in which financial assets were going to be valued. The government told us that there were existing administrative arrangements which they would continue, and they also indicated that they were going to consult, as the parliamentary secretary outlined in his speech. But it was clear that there were a number of important aspects of the administrative system that is now in place that the government relied upon, and it seemed to me that, if they were part of the system, the government ought not to object to them being outlined in the legislation. The issue of valuation is important because, if pensioners or part pensioners see an increase in the value of their shares, other managed investments or other forms of securities that they might have, that increase in value could lead to a higher deeming rate outcome. The reality of a situation in which there might be a reduction in the value of assets that they have might also be important. In fact, it may determine whether they are eligible for a part pension at all and could determine whether or not they are entitled to eligibility for fringe benefits. The government assured us that if, of course, there had been a reduction in the value of people's assets, they could in fact request a revaluation at any time if they were so adversely affected. But there was nothing in legislation to give a guarantee that that would occur. The government told us it would occur, but there was no guarantee. I must say-and I want to thank the minister and the parliamentary secretary for at least being prepared to enter into some dialogue in relation to the implementation of a valuation regime and for proposing these particular amendments to give effect to what was proposed-that a number of factors have been taken into account. Valuations will occur six-monthly. The valuations are to occur at the time when pensions would normally be adjusted in accordance with the CPI. So the dates of 20 March in each calendar year after July 1996 and 20 September in each calendar year after 1996 were specified as being the dates for valuation. But the clause also is worded to allow a revaluation to occur when the person requests a revaluation of one or more of the person's listed securities or managed investments. Of course, the amendment also accommodates a situation in which the government might give a person a notice requiring them to give the government some advice as to their asset situation, and that seemed to be an appropriate arrangement to also continue. It seems that the proposal does address the important issue of determining regularity of revaluation, but also maintains in legislative form a capacity for a person to get a revaluation at a point in time when there may be a significant change in the values of their listed securities or managed investments. So the measure is certainly one worthy of support. I am glad the government has proposed it. But as the parliamentary secretary's speech made clear, it was only at the insistence of the opposition parties that we were able to reach agreement to set out these matters in this comprehensive form providing the protection that it does. The one other matter that I want to deal with is friendly society investments. Friendly society investment deposits are now to be the subject of the extended deeming arrangement. That will mean that certain forms of investment where tax is pre-paid will be deemed to produce a return which, because of the nature of the holdings and the tax pre-paid on it, will be very unlikely to reach the deemed return of five per cent or seven per cent. It is likely that, as a result of this change, many people who are investing in friendly societies will be re-assessing their investments. I did raise in the debate previously the concerns that we in the opposition had about this measure. It was referred to a Senate committee and the Senate committee came to the view that no change should be made to this legislation. They did so on the basis that many pensioners, particularly those who are not in the tax system, are not necessarily well served by maintaining investments in a form which provides for tax to be paid by the institution before it pays a dividend, which is what happens in this instance. That will mean that many friendly society depositors, particularly pensioners, will be reassessing their position. I do not know what that will mean in the viability of friendly societies; there has not been a great deal of comment about that. I understand that some friendly societies are in a position to offer alternative forms of investment for their depositors where tax is not pre-paid, and there should be no difficulty there. I understand that others may be the subject of restrictions in offering alternative forms of investment to their depositors. I would certainly like the government to be on notice that this is a matter that we will be watching closely. I think the government needs to keep a very close watch on these matters, not just in the area of the Department of Social Security because it seems that perhaps this is not the area in which the matter needs to be addressed, but also on the issue generally if it has a concern about ensuring that organisations like friendly societies do have a sufficiently wide depositor base to maintain their viability. This is a question that ought not to be dismissed lightly. It is a matter that will be of concern, particularly to those people who have over a long period of time had great confidence in friendly societies. While we have accommodated the government in relation to the legislation and not proposed amendments in this matter, the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, because it would not have been appropriate to do so and the Senate committee has come to that view, it is obvious that there may be a requirement to keep a watching brief on this matter in other areas of Commonwealth legislation which do provide limitations on the way in which friendly societies are able to operate. Question resolved in the affirmative.

35,Ms WORTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"This year, 1995, has been a year for remembering and thanking those men and women who served their country and fellow citizens during the Second World War and to acknowledge the sacrifices that they made. Celebrations have been held to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the war which came to a relieved nation on 15 August 1945. It has been a wonderful year. It provided those who were still away from home in 1945 with an opportunity to celebrate, some doing so for the first time. I have already had the opportunity in this place to speak about the success of the Victory Ball held at the Adelaide Town Hall on 19 August this year and to thank all those who made it such a success, including the committee members who assisted me with the allocation of funds for special events and projects during this Australia Remembers year. I am pleased today to have the opportunity myself to pay tribute to those who served so that generations to follow would benefit. On the inside of the souvenir program of the Victory Ball, along with reproduced photos from the original Victory Ball 50 years ago, is the order of the day by General Sir Thomas Blarney, Commander in Chief, Australian Military Forces. It is dated 15 August 1945. I take this opportunity to read it to the House because it records not only the act of surrender by Japan but also the emotions of the time. On military stationery it is headed 'Surrender of Japanese'. I quote: The Japanese have surrendered. Our long and arduous struggle has ended in complete victory. The climax has come at the time when all six Australian Divisions are fighting strenuously, each on its own area, in the far flung battle line. No divisions amongst the Allies have contributed more to the downfall of our enemies than ours. Our general officers and our commanders of all grades, our regimental officers and our warrant and non-commissioned officers have led you unfalteringly to victory. Under their guidance, the troops have been formed into a magnificent army to the pride and glory of Australia. We have fought through the buming days and the freezing nights of the desert. We have fought through the ooze and sweat of tropical jungles. We have defeated the Italians and the Germans and we would soon have destroyed completely the Japanese before us. We are now to go to our homes, having done our part in ensuring freedom, for which we have fought so long and successfully, and so let us stand together in future years to ensure that it remains crowning heritage of Australian people. Above all, we give thanks to the Almighty for His greatest and crowning mercy that marks for all people the total downfall of tyranny. Millions of words have been devoted to World War II, of the rights and wrongs, of the suffering and of the great victories. But there must have been terrible personal and private tragedies. No-one who did not live through it can fully understand. However, it has been highly significant that my generation and those younger-school children in particular-have had the opportunity to hear first-hand from veterans and those close to them of their war experiences. Many experiences have been too painful to recall. Those who helped gather these stories and the memorabilia for displays and exhibitions have told me that veterans usually told the amusing stories and avoided the horror. No doubt this is understandable. My own parents were married during the war, and I am one of the baby boomers. I recall my father wearing his air force coat, cap and goggles on the tractor at night when it was particularly cold. I remember being kept occupied looking through a shoe box of wartime photos, some of which survived and were framed for the Prospect Remembers exhibition. But I heard little of the difficulties and the suffering. My father, Yin MCInerney, was asked to write down his wartime experiences as part of a project being undertaken to record the history of those who went off to war from his local district. Consistent with his fellow veterans, it is in the main a light-hearted account. At the risk of embarrassing my father, I would like to quote him: After a stint in the army at Woodside in late 1941, I decided this wasn't for me ... so I enlisted in the RAAF as aircrew. Mates of his like Sim Jenkins, Frank Swincer, Keith Miller and American Lou Nagy all get favourable mentions. He wrote of his engagement and then marriage to my mother, Ursula Kerin from Kapunda, and how he used to fly over her farm. He wrote of how the dentist he was the seeing over that Christmas period kept making other appointments for him so that he could have a threeor four-day honeymoon before going away. He wrote of his younger brother, Frank, my late uncle, who suffered malaria while at Milne Bay, New Guinea. He also wrote of how important mail from my mother was when he was in New Guinea and of her experience in the wartime organisation known as the Transport Drivers Division. He said, 'They learnt to drive trucks, change tyres, did some elementary mechanics, so we were ready should an emergency arise.' I mention these things because they are so typical of what veterans and their families have had to say to me during this year. My own electorate has had exhibitions at Prospect and Unley; a concert in the park at Prospect; veterans speaking to school children; the Victory Ball; and picnics and singalongs of favourites, which some of us seem to be getting to know, such as Kiss me goodnight, Sergeant-Major, Bless them all, Lilli Marlene, Siegfried line, Pack up your troubles and It's a long way to Tipperary-songs that I can remember my mother and my aunts singing to me as a very small child. The Vietnam veterans who are based at the Walkerville RSL in my electorate held a dinner for World War II veterans. I found that a moving experience. It was certainly an interesting experience to be one of their guests, as it was mainly men who attended. I can remember saying on that occasion that the Vietnam veterans themselves would have to be honoured in a better way in the future. We still have some ceremonies to come to present certificates of appreciation. I have already presented a good number of these at the war veterans home at Myrtle Bank, and we have some ceremonies lined up in local council areas. I am particularly grateful to Mayor Michael Stock at Enfield, who will assist me there on Tuesday, 5 December; to Mayor Michael Kennan, who will assist me at the Unley Civic Centre on Wednesday, 6 December; to Mayor Rosemary Craddock, who will assist me on 11 December at the Walkerville Town Hall; and Mayor Annette Eiffe, of the Prospect council, who will assist and entertain, as the other mayors will, on Monday, 11 December. I am also grateful to the members of the Croydon-Kilkenny RSL, who are having a special occasion and ceremony so that we can again present certificates of appreciation. I cannot miss the opportunity to comment at some length upon the celebrations held on 15 August in Adelaide. I do not think that I as the member for Adelaide have had a prouder moment or a more meaningful time than I did on that day. Here in my own streets, in my own electorate, was the Great March. To be in the official party that day with Dame Roma Mitchell, the Premier of South Australia, Dean Brown, and others was a superb experience. It was slightly worrying-by then I had got to know the organisers well-because a short time before it was to commence the streets were bare, there was a deathly silence and we all wondered how it was going to go. But it was just magnificent. I do not think I could describe it any more accurately than the Advertiser did the next day. Chris Brice and Peter Hackett, in a piece written under a huge headline 'Simply unforgettable', touch on this certain irreverence that I was commenting on that day. I would like to read from that Adelaide Advertiser report: Victory brought Adelaide to a standstill yesterday for the second time in half a century. And it was almost as sweet this time around as it was that mad, glad day 50 years ago. With tickertape raining on the parade and multicolored balloons drifting over the city skyline, tens of thousands cheered, whistled and clapped ""those ragged bloody heroes"" who, two generations ago, answered the country's call to arms and sacrifice. But this was no ANZAC Day march with its pomp, ceremony and reverence-this was a celebration, a mardi gras. And the crowd was as much part of the parade as those of creaking limb, wrinkled face and jangling medals who marched. The people had taken to the streets to kick up their heels, just like they did 50 years ago to the day. People hung out of high-rise windows, draped themselves from balconies and perched atop bus shelters. By the time the parade reached North Tce, the revellers on the sidelines-in places 10 or more deep ... And the article goes on. I can certainly say that the irreverence that is referred to there is true, but it was a wonderful irreverence. People were leaving their marching lines, coming over and shaking Dame Roma Mitchell's hand and saying, 'Good on you, Roma.' She was waving back and was very much a part of the whole atmosphere. So that was terrific. After that there was the picnic in the park and dancing and big bands. The headline describing that was 'War forged a lifetime bond for young lovers', and there they were dancing again. It has been a special year for me as well as for many others because associations that have been built around ANZAC Day celebrations and dawn services have been extended to far more jolly occasions. There has been an involvement from people such as Ray Green and Morrie Stanford from Enfield RSL, Danny Brock from Prospect, and women like Coral Farrelley from the Returned Women's Association. In my own newsletters to the electorate I have been able to give this coverage and I have had letters from people in the electorate in response. Many of the older women have written to tell me how they had listened to the radio in those days and how dreadful it was just waiting for news, always hoping that it would be good news and not bad news. Many of them went on to comment how wonderful they thought it was that the children that I had written up in the same edition of that newsletter were protesting about the French nuclear testing. They saw the two as being quite meaningful because they felt that their generation had made enough sacrifice and they were determined that there would be peace for those who followed. They wanted to encourage children and others to make active demonstrations to ensure that peace would be an important part of our future. It is up to me now to thank everyone who has been involved with the celebrations and remembering this year. I congratulate Con Sciacca, Wilson Tuckey and people in all their electorates who have put in some effort to ensure that it has been a memorable year. In South Australia. I congratulate Dick Fydock and Judy Newport for the role that they played, and also Mario Cattapan from Veterans' Affairs, who I think did things beyond the call of duty. It has been an important time because it has been bipartisan. It has been something that we have been able to work together on. For me and I hope for many others, the words 'We will remember them' will have greater and more significant meaning after this year.",66
36,Mr LATHAM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," Mr Deputy Speaker, it gives me tremendous pleasure to participate in this debate, especialthat ly given the fact that 32 members of the Australia Remembers committee from Campbelltown in my electorate are present in the public gallery. They have just been presented with their certificates of recognition for their contribution to our program by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). I welcome the group to Parliament House and I take this opportunity to thank them and the many others in Campbelltown who made our Australia Remembers program such an outstanding success. Indeed, it is too rare in Australian life that we have the opportunity for one generation to say thanks to another. I think that has been the lasting success of Australia Remembers right throughout the country. It is true of the Australian character that we do not very frequently show public emotion. It has been quite a moving experience for most members in this place to participate with their local communities in the Australia Remembers program and to recognise the contribution of those Australians who, in the Second World War, secured our freedoms, secured our rights, and secured the benefits of our democratic institutions. It has been a great privilege for me to have been involved with the Campbelltown Australia Remembers committee. I believe this has been one of the best programs in Australia. We have had an outstanding committee which has contributed so much to helping all generations-particularly the young people in our city-to remember the Second World War and to have a full understanding of the contributions made at that time. So many people on the committee have made such an important effort and have dedicated so much of their time to the program. If I could single out one person it would be our committee coordinator, Mick Scrase. Mick is a tremendous contributor to Campbelltown and also a great Australian in his own right. He has dedicated himself virtually in a full-time capacity to making sure that Australia Remembers in Campbelltown has been such a success. I pay tribute to him and offer lasting appreciation to Mick and Linda Millar, his partner, for the work they have undertaken on behalf of the committee. I would like to thank the other members of the committee: Steve O'Halloran from the City of Campbelltown RSL sub-branch; Bert MCDonell, who acted capably, as always, and took good care of the committee's funds as treasurer. I also thank three tremendous contributors from the Veterans Recreation Centre, Frank Donovan, Marty Hyland and Roy James. They participated fully in all the work and in the deliberations of the committee. I wish to thank the First Brigade at Holsworthy under Brigadier Jim Molan for his efforts. Campbelltown City Council has provided so many extra resources and given full support to Australia Remembers in Campbelltown. I should not let this occasion pass without paying tribute to the work of Raewyn Sinclair-Kydd, Sioux Garside, Paul Tosi, Jan Mayer and Helene Buckman who is present in the gallery representing the council today. The schools in Campbelltown were involved in a very useful art competition and other activities as part of Australia Remembers. Tony Rae, director of schools for Campbelltown, provided so much assistance in that regard. The crowning glory of Australia Remembers in Campbelltown was the military tattoo conducted four weeks ago. I wish to recognise the efforts of Val Mills and Clay MCDonald as two people who dedicated themselves fully to the success of that event. . I have two RSL clubs in my electorate. Ingleburn RSL is at the northern end of the city of Campbelltown and it was ably represented on the committee by Ron Hattander. He achieved a great deal for the club as part of Australia Remembers in 1995. This has been a collaboration not just community, not just of RSL clubs and not just of members of parliament, but also of government departments. I wish to thank the DEET representative on our committee, Darryl New, for his contribution which was above and beyond the call of duty. He dedicated himself most successfully to the success of Australia Remembers in the city of Campbelltown. I should also pay tribute to the work of Agnes Donovan, one of the great raffle ticket organisers and sellers in the city. I also Ken Langcake and Meryl Ryan for the work that they have undertaken. I will try not to miss too many of the people involved. I wish to pay tribute to Nicole Abrahams, Ruth Boylen, Nader Christofferson, Barbara Cotton, Wendy Connolly, Cheryl and Melissa Foti, Mary Greer and Gail Hazell from my office who acted as secretary to the committee. I also pay tribute to her predecessor in that role, Jan Betts. I also wish to thank Debbie Knapp, Camille Lee, John and Joy Lysle, Noree MCGRATH, Rachelle and Nathan Mills, Becky Robinson, Betty Scrase, Neil Turner and Jan Watkins. I should also thank Chris Haviland, my parliamentary colleague, who was involved in the committee's work and provided resources for the committee's success from the seat of Macarthur. All those people have contributed effectively to Campbelltown's commemorative activities as part of Australia Remembers. I trust that they have had an enjoyable day here in Parliament House. It was really nice of the minister Con Sciacca to find time to personally present the certificates of recognition. There are about another 20 people who will be receiving their certificates later. Unfortunately, they could not be present for our activities today. It has been a tremendous effort by all parts of the committee, all parts of the community in Campbelltown. I will give the House, the government and the minister a guide to some of the projects that have been undertaken in Campbelltown. On VE Day there was a tremendous ceremony at Dredge's Cottage and the establishment of stone tablets in a memorial wall, tablets which provide a lasting of the reminder of, and one of the tremendous monuments recognising service by, Campbelltownians in World War I and World War II. On VP day there was another ceremony and the presentation of certificates of appreciation. The military tattoo, I have mentioned, was a tremendous event. The Campbelltown art gallery participated in an exhibition of World War II cartoons. This was opened by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It reflected the way in thank which Australia's military personnel spent some of their time reflecting on their experience by undertaking works of art and cartoons. We had those on display at the Campbelltown art gallery. That was supplemented by our school art competition, which I think was one of the most meaningful activities of Campbelltown Remembers, because it gave the young people of Campbelltown the chance to participate. The works of art they submitted as part of the competition reflected well on the way in which young Australians-not just in Campbelltown but throughout the countryremember World War II. From their art it was very clear that they were commemorating the service of so many Australians who secured our freedoms and institutions during World War II. They also had a very strong message that the errors and tragedy of war should never be repeated in our time. I took great encouragement from the way young people in Campbelltown remembered and participated in that art competition. We have had the new works opportunity program, one of the DEET initiatives under way in Campbelltown to produce remembrance driveways and a range of other projects such as the expansion of the Ingleburn RSL Memorial Gardens. One of the benefits has been the new work opportunities program. The minister has had the foresight to expand the program into activities where DEET could provide a subsidised work force as part of Australia Remembers. Our committee was also able to sponsor the Campbelltown RSL Youth Club gymnasts who travelled to Berlin-the trip of a lifetime for those young people. Mick Scrase in particular was a very strong contributor to program. They had a very successful time in Berlin. We were also able to sponsor the Hurlstone Agricultural High School honour roll, recognising the service of that great school's-my old school-former students in both world wars. Concerts were held at both the RSL clubs in my electorate-Ingleburn and Campbelltown. We sponsored the Campbelltown Remembers bowling club tournament and, to cap it all off-you will appreciate this, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, as a keen race goer-we had two race days at Menangle trots. I should caution people-you would know this, Mr Deputy Speaker, with your experience on the punt-that they were not trotting races in the style of Harold Park. was Menangle Park. They were clean run events. I did not get too many of the winners, but we all had a good time and benefited from the Australia Remembers sponsorship at the Menangle Park paceway. Mr Deputy Speaker, you can understand from the list of activities the full range of commemorative events that have been held in the city of Campbelltown. They have been for young people, old people and sporting people. For everyone in the community there has been an opportunity to pay tribute to the veterans who served in World War II and to join in the government's Australia Remembers initiative. I feel that our program in Campbelltown has paid full tribute to the city's tremendous record of war service. Australia Remembers in Campbelltown has been a great reminder of and a great tribute to the city's vast contribution to Australia's war effort. Whenever the Australian nation has been called on to fight in defence of democracy and freedom, Campbelltown has been in the front line, from the army camps and recruitment centres at Inglebum, Menangle Park-the site of the paceway these days-and the Campbelltown showground to VC winners like John Edmondson from Hurlstone and Kevin 'Dasher' Wheatley in Vietnam, to the hundreds of enlisted personnel from the Boer War, both world wars, Korea, Vietnam and the Gulf War. It really does underline the tremendous contribution that the City of Campbelltown and its that citizens have made to all Australia's war efforts for over a century. Let me quote from the official history of Campbelltown in relation to the Second World War: War was declared on 3 September 1939. Once again a military camp was set up at the Campbelltown Showground. The first Machine Gun Regiment was training there when Billy HughesI think it is fair to say one of the predecessors of the member for Berowravisited in October 1939. Menangle Park Racecourse became a training ground for men of the 45th Battalion of the militia and later a base for the Air Force. Construction work at Ingleburn military camp continued around the clock in late 1939. Eschol Park was taken over to intern the staff of the German embassy. This Campbelltown's roll of honour records the names of 459 volunteers, 20 of whom were killed in action in World War II. The list of men included the Ingleburn Town Clerk, Harley Daley, Alderman Hosking and a former local federal member of parliament, perhaps remembered by some in this place, the former member for Macarthur, Jeff Bate. This reflected a tremendous community effort in which standing and social background were low order considerations. The war effort and defence of Australia were all important. We have paid tribute to that contribution in Campbelltown through our Australia Remembers program. I believe we have done the contribution and the memory proud. We have remembered effectively throughout all parts of the city and among all generations in Campbelltown. That is due to the efforts of the people gathered in the public gallery here today. Again I pay tribute to them and also on their behalf I pass on our deep appreciation of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Con Sciacca, who has supported all of our activities as much as any minister could be expected to support one part of the country. So well done, Con-a tremendous effort for what you have achieved with Australia Remembers and good on all the people in Campbelltown who have been part of our program, particularly those who have visited Parliament House today.",69
37,Mr COBB,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The Australia Remembers celebrations, the 50th anniversary celebrations of the ending of World War II, have been a great reminder to Australians of all ages of the marvellous contributions made by so many citizens of this nation so that Australia and the world could be free of the tyranny of Nazism and also Japanese hegemony in the Pacific. We can all be proud that the parliament has acted in such a bipartisan manner with these celebratory activities. In this regard I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Con Sciacca, and the shadow minister, the member for O'Connor, Wilson Tuckey, for their infectious enthusiasm and assistance in all our electorates. It is important that we all acknowledge that none of us would have enjoyed the freedoms and living standards we do today without that earlier sacrifice on our behalf. One cannot but help wonder, for example, what would have happened to our parliamentary system of democracy if the war had gone the other way. The Australia Remembers spirit that pervaded us all this year was captured in the official logo. We know that famous photograph with Ray Walsh on the front, a returning soldier from the war, held in the embrace of his wife and revered and loved by his children. Ray was born in Cowra in 1909 and died in Sydney in 1988. That meant a lot to me as my family knew the Walsh family and had contact with them in Cowra. The celebrations had four purposes: to honour those who had died, to thank the remaining servicemen, to appreciate the sorrows and difficulties of those who became widows or the children who lost a parent and to acknowledge the role played by those who kept Australia running while the war went on mainly overseas. The purpose of the celebrations has been to involve all citizens in Australia, all sectors of the community, to include not only those who fought but those who made contributions and who remained behind in Australia while the war went on and also those who have been born since the war. It is vital that our children learn of the sacrifices made and learn of what happened so that they can take the memory forward, cherish the peace and maintain a proper defence vigilance to lessen the chances that we will ever have to go to war again. The celebrations commemorating these ideals have been held in many centres in my electorate, especially between August and the present day. Before I touch on them, I want to dwell for a moment on the sacrifice that was involved. In World War II, 993,000 Australians enlisted, which is a massive number for the population of that day; 27,000 were killed or died in prisoner of war camps; 23,500 were wounded; and, in total, 22,300 were prisoners of war. In today's dollars, it cost the nation $74,000 million, which is equivalent to about 30 per cent of national income. The civil work force at the time decreased by 40 per cent because of the war effort. We had a loss of export markets, particularly rural export markets. We had the severe rationing of food, clothing and fuel. That was all part of the sacrifice. Especially popular in the celebrations were the Australia Remembers certificates, which we have all handed out to those who made a contribution to the war effort. My office has spent hundreds of hours preparing hundreds and hundreds of these certificates to hand out. Mr Ruddock-You've got writer's cramp, have you?",72
38,Mr COBB,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Yes, almost. I have it from signing them. They have been handed out at centres as diverse as Tottenham, Bourke, Broken Hill, Dubbo, Parkes, Peak Hill and Nyngan. I still have some to go. The applications are still rolling in. We are still posting those certificates out and, in some cases, holding functions to present them in person. It has been a very worthwhile exercise. The families have been very appreciative of what has been done. Some people are laminating the certificates while others are framing them as a permanent record of what that family person contributed. They can then be handed down to later generations in the family. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Con Sciacca, gave $20,000 to each electorate to be spent on celebrations in one form or another. It was a more difficult and time consuming exercise to divide this up than I first envisaged, but it was a very rewarding effort indeed. I am very grateful to the committee who helped me with this. I actually had two committees, because my main office is in Dubbo and my other office is in Broken Hill, which is 800 kilometres away. One committee was run by Andy Dowd in Broken Hill, who did a magnificent job there. The main committee in Dubbo was headed by Bert MCLellan of the Dubbo RSL along with John Whittle from the Dubbo RSL. Keith Lowe from Bourke and Les Garth from the Orana Far West Vietnam Veterans' Association of Australia pitched in, as did Keith Mulhall of the Parkes RSL. Elizabeth Smith from the Dubbo Regional Art Gallery and John Summers, the Principal of South Dubbo High School, also helped. I am very grateful to them for balancing all the competing interests and allocating the money appropriately. I will just mention a couple of the functions that I was able to attend. At Bourke, there was an amazing gathering of people in the main street, including elderly people, all the school children and many citizens. I pay tribute to Keith Lowe and his magnificent committee for what they did there. The state president, Rusty Priest, unveiled the plaque. I will just read to the House the words on that plaque written by Keith Lowe: This stone stands in tribute to all Australian men and women whose sacrifices contributed to peace at the end of the 1939-45 war. We honour the memory of those who gave their lives in defence of our country. We remember those whose lives were burdened by battle scars. We sympathise with families broken and wounded by death and injury on the battlefield. We renew our welcome to all new Australians who have sought refuge in our land from war and oppression. We acknowledge our debt to all the rural community, to those in industry and to all who loyally served on the home front. God bless them all, lest we forget. Over 100 Australia Remembers certificates were handed out that day. The committee had the people who made the contribution all seated in alphabetical order in the main street. Everyone who was presented with a certificate had read out to the gathering some history of their individual contribution to the war effort. After lunch that day, we travelled to a very small village south of Bourke called Byrock. It does not consist of much more than a pub, a store and a school. It is a little town that is mentioned in Henry Lawson's stories. Perhaps, in its own way, that was the most moving ceremony of all. Again, a plaque was unveiled on a big rock there. David Creenaune, the publican, actually wrote the words that are on the plaque. If any members ever travel through that little village they should pull up and read them. The plaque says: In lasting memory of all who pioneered the outback regions of Australia then at the call of duty stood united as a nation at war. Their hardships and endeavours in remoteness and in battle are our foundations of mateship and freedom. Time shall never erase their determination and gallantry. Perpetual peace be forever with them. That is just a small example of what was done. There were other committees around the electorate. The Orana and Far West Vietnam Veterans' Association conducted tours and transport for diggers to the Newcastle area looking at army camps and other sites. The Warren RSL and shire council, with the help of Mayor Rex Wilson and RSL sub-branch President Doug Housler, had various activities in the town. I was pleased to be able to attend those. The Tullibigeal RSL committee refurbished the RSL building there. The Trundle RSL restored the Trundle Memorial Hall and held a victory dinner dance. The Trangie RSL subbranch purchased books and a plaque. The Tottenham Welfare Council had a victory ball, and I was pleased to attend that. John Medcalf was the chairman of that ball, which went very well indeed. I take my hat off to both Secretary Jack Burley and President Ron Bywater of the Nyngan RSL sub-branch for the work they have done there. They held a march, a dinner dance and other activities. The Narromine Shire Council, with RSL President Ray Harper and Secretary Terry Murray, put its money towards the restoration of the cenotaph in the main street. The Menindee RSL sub-branch held commemorative services as well as a march, luncheon, memorabilia display and other activities. The Forbes 50th Anniversary Committee provided commemorative plaques to local schools and the council. The Eumungerie-Coboco RSL sub-branch had a family day, parade and victory ball. The Parkes RSL sub-branch held a commemorative service, dedicated new walks, presented medallions and held a luncheon, which I was able to attend. The Dubbo RSL sub-branch put together a magnificent photographic display suitable for touring the electorate. I was honoured to be asked to open that display. It also had a public speaking contest with prizes and a family barbecue in the park, which I also attended. As I have already said, the Bourke RSL sub-branch held its activities too. The Broken Hill RSL sub-branch had a photographic and historical display. It had school competitions and a picnic and parade. The Cobar Regional Museum erected a flagpole at the existing cenotaph and held school competitions and a 'Diggers Ball'. All in all, in my electorate of over 316,000 square kilometres and about 50 towns, there was a lot of activity throughout. Unfortunately, because a lot of it was packed into the one week in August, I could not attend every activity, but I have had contact with all the committees and what they did. In the short time remaining to me I just want to make some comment on the rewriting of history, if I could call it that, that was done at the time of VJ Day-or VP Day as it is more commonly known now. There has been a lot of debate in the community condemning the Americans for dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is claimed that it was not necessary to drop the bomb because Japan was on its last legs and would have capitulated soon anyhow. I can understand the sympathies behind that attitude because there was a tremendous loss of life and a tremendous amount of suffering that went with it, but I do disagree with that assessment. I believe that the dropping of those two bombs, as bad as it was, shortened the war remarkably. It saved lives overall. We must not forget that it also limited the Soviet Union, which invaded Manchuria on 8 August, between the time the two bombs were dropped, in their acquisition of territories in the area. We should never forget the horrendous suffering they inflicted on the territories they acquired in Eastern Europe, in countries such as Poland, et cetera. The first bomb dropped from the plane Enola Gay at 8.15 a.m. on 6 August 1945 over Hiroshima. It was dropped from 30,000 feet. In a minute it fell to 1,800 feet. A barometric pressure device activated a detonating mechanism. The first nuclear weapon in history used in warfare was a uranium youth bomb-'Little Boy'-of 13 kilotons. Hiroshima was destroyed in an instant through the heat, the blast and the fires that followed. Of the population of 343,000 people, 78,000 were killed at the time. Fifty-one thousand were injured or missing and 180,000 were made homeless. Of the 76,000 buildings in that city, 48,000 were destroyed and 22,000 were severely damaged. In Nagasaki three days later, a plutonium bomb, called 'Fat Man', of 22 kilotons was dropped. Because of a navigational error, it was dropped off target and part of the city shielded by hills was spared the worse effects of the blast. Nevertheless, 35,000 at the time were killed. So a total in those cities of 113,000 were killed. Of course, later on many more people suffered radiation sicknessthousands of people. Let us not forget that when the Americans were island hopping up to Japan to eventually invade Japan at Iwo Jima alone 26,000 people were killed. At Okinawa, 142,000 people were killed. One hundred and seventy thousand people were killed on those two islands alone-more than were killed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is estimated that if the Americans had invaded Kyushu, the southern island alone, there would have been casualties of half a million to a million people inflicted before the war would have been brought to an end. I think we have to keep those things in mind and remember that the decision that had to be taken at the time was probably the correct one. (Time expired)",73
39,Mr CHYNOWETH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is a great pleasure for me to speak on this Australia Remembers motion. It is the second time. I have spoken on it. I want to take this opportunity, while there are some young people in the galleries, to mention a plaque we dedicated on 11 November of this year. The plaque was put down by the Australia Remembers Committee. I would just like to read the words written on it.",75
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Order! The honourable member for Dunkley, having admitted that he has spoken to this motion on a prior occasion, will have to ask leave of the House for the opportunity to speak a second time.",75
41,Mr CHYNOWETH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I seek leave because I am only speaking for this short period of time before question time. Leave granted.,75
42,Mr CHYNOWETH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Thank you for the leave. That shows the great cooperation between us and the opposition. That is part of the spirit of the Australia Remembers year. It was a bipartisan thing and it worked very well. All members of this House made a point of working in a bipartisan way. It is good to see that the cooperation is continuing. The plaque reads: This plaque was placed by the Dunkley ""Australia Remembers"" Committee to pay tribute to the Australian men and women who served in the Theatres of War or on the Home Front during World War II, 1939-1945. It honours those who gave their lives for Australia in battle, or who died as a result of the War. On this day, 11 November 1995, children of this district assembled with War Veterans at this site as a gesture of gratitude from the whole community. Let not the children of Australia forget the courage and heroism of the young men and women of 1939-45 who so valiantly answered the call of their country. May the children of our Nation dedicate themselves with equal courage to the great task of building a world free from war and the threat of war. May they join in bonds of friendship with the peoples of all nations to ensure peace on earth, goodwill to all people. They are very moving words-words which I believe will stand the test of time. I would like to thank our committee for what it has done to make this plaque and for coming up with that set of words. Special thanks must go to Dorothy Murphy-who was involved right from the start on the Australia Remembers committee and who has put in a tremendous amount of work-and to all the other members who I have mentioned before. I would also like to bring to the attention of the House a couple of passages from a book that we produced entitled Heroes at home and abroad 1939-45. It had stories in it of local men and women who were abroad and those who worked on the home front, detailing what they did during the years 1939 to 1945. For example, there is the story of Perce Hosking, a well-known identity who died just recently. His story is quite relevant and points out to all what war was about and what happened during those years. It brought to the memory of those people exactly what they had gone through. Now we have a record of it. These are a couple of sentences from Perce Hosking's memory: I don't talk about it much, over the years I've been quiet. But I'm now 74 and unless I put this on paper or say something about it . . . I think it's time. I have thought about why I joined up. Was it patriotism, fear of the enemy? Was it expected of me? There was a whole group of feelings, emotions, reasons and expectations as to why any young serviceman joined up. It was probably my only way of going overseas. I was in New Guinea just over two years in all. I was there in the beginning in Port Moresby when the Japanese were coming over the Owen Stanleys and looking like they'd take it. We thought we wouldn't get home. I hate to admit it, but with our chances of getting home remote The thought of the young people there at the time was that they would take as many of them as they could. I believe a very important passage by Mr Hosking reads: The spirit to win is still there, in the young today. There is a small proportion of people today who are not self motivated and don't succeed, but there are many young people who are doing a useful job, are skilled and getting behind each to make a nation. And if the same circumstances arose again, they'd be there. I think it's important for every thinking adult of every nation to work hard for peace. I have been a member of Rotary since 1950 and one of its aims is international goodwill and understanding and through that, peace. I think it is a fine thing to aim for and if I can make a tiny contribution to that in my remaining years, then I will continue to try. Those years were 90 percent boredom, five percent frustration and five percent action. They taught me to work like hell for peace. I have a belief it can and will happen-not in my lifetime, but it will. If I've got a bit of wisdom to impart to young people today, it would be to make every phase of your life a winner and work for peace. Those words by Perce Hosking are important words-words I am sure that everyone in this House will take note of. I must also mention that our committee was probably the only one in Australia which had some money left over. That money, of course, will be spent on very deserving causes. Our Australia Remembers committee had a meeting last night, and we have decided what to do with our money. We have a war veterans' home in Frankston. We will give the war vets there a Christmas party. They have an old piano which we will replace with an updated one so that they can have many more years of enjoyment. We will give some money to buy medical equipment. We will repair a statue that is broken. We will also buy some special chairs and other equipment for the war veterans in the RSL war veterans home in Frankston. Without a doubt, the Dunkley Australia Remembers Committee was the best in Australia. As I said before, we are probably the only committee to have money left over. We are going to give the remainder of it to look after those people in the RSL war veterans home in Frankston. The home still has three or four First World War veterans. I spoke to one the other day who is 103. He gave me a bit of a burst on what happened back in those days, how the government should be run and people what we should be doing to fix up the country. These people fought for our country. They are the people we should thank. That is what this year has been about. I have been other very pleased to be able to play just a little part in this great year of Australia Remembers.",75
43,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Order! It being 3 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour, and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",76
44,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",76
45,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the Leader of the Opposition claim to have been misrepresented?,76
46,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do.,76
47,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,76
48,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Today's edition of the Australian Financial Review on the front page carries a story claiming that in remarks I had made yesterday I had in some way retreated from a commitment I made in my headland speech of a few months ago that a Howard government would achieve significant public savings. That claim, Mr Speaker, is wrong. There has been no retreat, and there will be no retreat, from that commitment. NA Commonwealth Bank Mr THOMSONMy question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to his comments yesterday about the Commonwealth Bank when he said: The objective, at this stage of the game, is at a sale in its entirety this financial year. In this year's budget it said: The government has decided to sell its remaining 50.4 per cent shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank in two tranches, with the proceeds to be received in 1995-96 and 1997-98. Wasn't this statement in the budget just another Labor untruth, and isn't the decision to sell off the rest of the bank just a desperate attempt to cover up and to fudge a budget surplus that has fallen apart?",76
49,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Your question is very silly. The proposition that we are looking about in the sale of the Commonwealth Bank is the same sort of proposition that we consider when we are going through any set of asset sales. Once you go into the scoping study process, what you may have thought initially was your intention may be modified. It may not, but it may be modified on the basis of the decent advice that you get as you bring more and more people into the process of helping you conclude the way in which a sale ought to proceed. And it may make more sense, in terms of getting the best possible return for the taxpayer, to put the totality of the remainder of the Commonwealth Bank out rather than leaving an element overhanging the market. That might be, when the scoping study is undertaken and looked at in the clear light of day, the best way of going. It may not. The two-tranche process that is suggested in the budget process may be a better way to go. The process of the studies that we have under way at the moment and the sort of advice that we are getting in will assist us in arriving at a conclusion on that. What will not be a factor in our consideration is any particular budget outcome this year. We now have a considerable amount of experience in handling privatisationMr Costello-Like the AIDC and ANL.",77
50,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We are prepared to take a common sense view based on the views that come through to us. Mr Crean-What about the Belconnen shopping mall?,77
51,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,-I know the Belconnen to look shopping mall is your only experience. Mr Crean-And you couldn't even get that off the ground.,77
52,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And that did not actually get off the ground.,77
53,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Minister for Employment, Education and Training is not helping. Those on my left should not respond to the minister.",77
54,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,But we have had very considerable success in the privatisations that have been gone through. So I can assure the honourable member that this year's particular budget outcome is not going to be a matter of concern to the government as it arrives at its conclusions on the Commonwealth Bank. Unemployment,77
55,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and it is about unemployment. Is the government committed to the target of five per cent unemployment by the tum of the century, and can the minister point to any evidence of the achievability of that target?",77
56,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The government is committed to achieving its target of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000. Dr Kemp-What are you going to do to reach it?,77
57,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will tell you what we are going to do to reach it and I will give you also some evidence that there are others that believe that we can reach it too. The commitment of the government has been significantly reinforced by a report that was released earlier this week called Australia's workforce: 2005. Dr Kemp-That's a lie.,77
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Goldstein will withdraw that comment, and he will also refrain from interjecting while the minister is on his feet.",78
59,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you've knocked that interjection out from him, Mr Speaker, he won't be able to comment at all for the rest of the day. The report itself is very significant because it demonstrates that between now and the year 2005 there will be 2.1 million jobs capable of being created in this economy and indicates where those jobs will be created. The report goes on to say that the five per cent objective by the year 2000 is achievable. It goes even further and says that we can get to four per cent unemployment by the year 2005. Importantly, it concludes that we have the labour market and skill formation policies in place to secure those targets and the objectives of getting unemployment down. It is the policy in this area that is also given regard to in a report published today by EPAC on investing in this economy. It says that policies in employment and training are essential to the nation's future growth. In fact, it is very interesting to note a report in the Courier-Mail today which, commenting on this report, says: The report vindicates the Federal Government's $11 billion four-year Working Nation policy which seeks to cut joblessness by subsidising jobs and stepping up training measures. Who said that Working Nation was a failure? That side of the House. Who said that they would cut the programs? That side of the House. The very policies that are now recognised as significantly adding to the capacity of this nation to get its unemployment down, the opposition not only oppose, they would cut. But it is not just the Working Nation programs that underpin this. It is the government's commitment to expanding the vocational education and training sector, where we have seen a ISO per cent increase in Commonwealth expenditure, some 200,000 additional places since 1990, as well as the massive expansion in the higher education sector. It is interesting that those on the other side of the House think it is a great win for the higher education sector to deny it extra resources, because that is what they have done in the Senate. They think it is a terrific contribution to the higher education sector to actually deny it money for extra places and extra infrastructure. But that is not the only part that the opposition falls down on in the commitment to employment and getting the unemployment rate down. In fact, the opposition has given up on being able to achieve the target of five per cent. It says it is unachievable-the same thing it said at the last election was unachievable in our jobs target of 500,000; yet we passed it six months ago. So they have given up on a target, they have given up on helping the unemployed. It is also interesting to note in the Australian Financial Review, the same edition that the Leader of the Opposition has got up to disclaim, that in all the policy areas where the Financial Review's reporters assess the opposition as having come out with something resembling a policy, there is not one mention in all of the areas of jobs, education or training-it is a blank. Mr Burton, in a commentary piece on the opposition's policies, says: While the Coalition has pledged not to cut hourly award rates, it has yet to detail how it would protect penalty and overtime earnings. It may be that they have said publicly that they are pledged not to cut hourly rates, but that is not what they are saying for the unemployed. I refer the House to the document that came into our hands, 'Confidential. Speaker's notes' prepared by the Liberal Party, and what it has to say about the unemployed under the heading, 'Coalition alternative'. It says this: The Coalition, if elected, will ensure that employers have incentives to provide employment for longer-term unemployed people through an effective training wage system. In other words, that is code for no subsidies.",78
60,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,78
61,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Hear me out and deny it. It is code for no subsidies as an incentive to employ people, no subsidies for employers to take on the long-term unemployed. That is consistent with the shadow Treasurer's objective of cutting the Working Nation programs. Their offer as an incentive to employers to take someone on is to cut the wages of that person. In other words, they want to blame the victim. They want to say it is the problem with the unemployed person that they are not being taken on. That cutting of wages is consistent with the 10bsback policy of last time which discounted wages based upon the length of time a person was out of work. I might remind the House that 10bsback is the document that the Leader of the Opposition has said is timeless, that the principles still remain and that they will embrace them. That is what they would do for the unemployed. As for education, and universities in particular, do you know what they have to say under 'key attack points' in this great document? It is blank. They haven't got an attack point on universities. This is a coalition that is bereft of creative policy or commitment in terms of jobs, training and education. They only fall back to spoiling tactics. They oppose things for the sake of it and they propose only vindictive solutions which penalise the victim. On this side of the House we will have none of that. Under Labor we have a target, we have a strategy and we have a track record. We are committed to reducing unemployment and we will. Youth Unemployment",78
62,Mr SMYTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Minister, is it a fact that the latest unpublished statistics for youth unemployment show rates of 31.3 per cent in Hobart and southern Tasmania; 38.5 per cent in the ACT; 45.7 per cent in southern Adelaide; 46.8 per cent in outer western Melbourne; 47.1 per cent in the Richmond-Tweed/mid-north coast region of New South Wales; and 51.8 per cent in the Wide Bay-Burnett region of Queensland? Why have you stopped the publication of these figures by your department? When will you realise that the Australian people will not be fooled by your deceitful attempts to hide the truth about the failure of your policies?",79
63,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not stopped the publication of the figures. If the member opposite wants to obtain the figures, he is perfectly at liberty to go and get them from the Bureau of Statistics which published them. The simple fact of the matter is that the bureau came to the conclusion that the figures that were continuously being published on youth unemployment were unreliable. Opposition members-Oh!",79
64,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Canberra is trying to hear the response.,79
65,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The reason they are unreliableMr MeG au ran-They are an embarrassment.,79
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Gippsland knows better.,79
67,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"is because they were based on such small samples and there were huge fluctuations from quarter to quarter. The member for Canberra has chosen to selectively refer to certain areas of unemployment. Go and have a look at some of the others. I haven't got the list of them in front of me, but there are some figures that show that the youth unemployment rate in certain areas has gone down from, I think, 15 per cent to zero over the quarter. Opposition members-Name them.",79
68,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Have a look at them. What we are saying is that we accept the view of the bureau that the statistics as previously published are unreliable. As I have said in the House before, the issue, quite frankly, is not whether or not we have a problem with youth unemployment, because I have always conceded that we do. What I have said to not only this House but the young people in this country is that we have developed strategies to date, and we will develop more, that get the youth unemployment rate down. One of the recent initiatives that we have taken in this regard that will help is the changes to the jobstart subsidy arrangements which now enable the full adult rate of subsidy to be available for someone taking on a person under 21. In other words, the subsidy is a much more significant incentive to take on the young unemployed. We have also introduced a youth training initiative, which is a commitment to ensure that people who have fallen out of the school system are picked up and more effectively developed through a vocational training approach. We have introduced case management to ensure that each person can be individually treated and that a particular return to work plan is developed. We have widened the range of traineeships to enable young people to get into programs and training that they want to pursue, such as in the area of the environment; arts, entertainment and the media; and health and education services. Until Working Nation came along, there was not a traineeship in any of these areas. If the simple reality is that training improves your employability-and that is what has been shown by the EPAC report; it is what has been shown by Work Force 2005we have to find more creative ways in which we use the training to get young people into the work force, including using schools as a pathway into the work force. have developed those policies-only us. All the opposition can do is run some bus around the country, and then a truck, and pretend it is doing something for the youth of the country. It is not, and the youth will not be bluffed by it. The reality is that we are listening to the young people of this country. We are prepared to develop more policies and initiatives for them. It is terribly important that we do commit ourselves to ensuring that young people do have an opportunity for a worthwhile career. Under the initiatives that we developing, they will get just that. Industrial Relations",79
69,Mr DODD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Can the minister outline to the House the importance of the no disadvantage test to the government's industrial relations policies?,80
70,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,With considerable pleasure. I am very pleased to outline to the honourable member and to the House the absolutely fundamental role of the no disadvantage test under the government's IR reform act. The test ensures that employees in the enterprise bargaining process cannot be worse off versus the totality of their award circumstance. Mr MCGauran interjecting,80
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the honourable member for Gippsland.,80
72,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It gives workers freedom to negotiate on conditions such as penalty rates and leave loadings, as long as they are compensated for trading them in. It ensures that, even if some workers cash out entitlements, they do not undermine those conditions for other employees. In other words, because an enterprise bargaining employee receives an overall package at least as generous as they receive under the award, they are not disadvantaged, and neither are comparable employees who remain under the award circumstance. All of this is vitally important because it clearly establishes that there is only one real no disadvantage test-and that is the governIt is only us that ment's version. It also means that the no disadvantage test being proposed by the opposition is simply not worth a cracker. That is because it is a test that will not be applied against the whole award but, as the member for Flinders has said, will be applied against an undefined set of minima. As a result, every employee facing a new employer-that is, some 1.8 million people a year--could potentially be offered conditions that undercut the conditions available for award based employees. You need to understand that in such a are situation award employees would very quickly become uncompetitive. They would be effectively undercut in the marketplace. With time, they would find themselves forced into contracts or agreements that also undercut the award entitlements. In short, the opposition's industrial relations policy amounts to death but certain death of the award system by stealth over a relatively short period of time. It is hard to imagine a more sneaky and disreputable attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian electorate than this present attempt by those sitting opposite. The fact that it has been knowingly attempted by this opposition leader is something that makes it all the more abhorrent. This is the very same opposition leader who earlier this week assured all and sundry that 'no worker would be worse off' under his policy. Well, that assurance is worth about as much as a personal guarantee from Christopher Skase. That is how much it is worth-about as much as a personal guarantee from Christopher Skase. The only way it could have any validity would be for the opposition leader to give an ironclad bipartisan commitment to maintain the government's no disadvantage test-I am glad I have regained his attention-that is, a bipartisan approach to adopt our no disadvantage test. That is the only true no disadvantage test. But, of course, the opposition leader cannot do that because to do so would see his business donors go troppo. They would be aghast at such a prospect. That is why he goes around the country playing the role of the industrial chameleon. That is what he is: the industrial chameleon, first grade, Australia style. In public he tells the electorate they have nothing to fear but in private he tells business that he is the one out there for radical change. Even in public it is fair to say that he gives business the nudge and the wink, as he did last night at the Bulletin awards. Last night, having praised CRA's approach to IR as the way of the future, the Leader of the Opposition went on to tell his audience: To be an effective refonner you have got to be a practical refonner. You have got to understand mood and the temper of the community and the temper of our people. We all know what that is code for. That is code for 'do not let people know what your true intentions are'. That is the approach that was taken by Jeff Kennett and the approach that was taken by Richard Court when they set out to sell their industrial policies. The only difference is that we will not let you get away with it. We are not going to let you get away with this sneaky and disreputable policy. We are going to make sure everyone in Australia knows what you are up to. When they are certain of that, they, as we know, will understand that you are not fit to be Prime Minister. Marks Royal Commission",80
73,Mr RICHARD EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister. Will you give a guarantee that you will not be seeking at any time in the future a backdoor method of slugging taxpayers for the legal bills incurred by Dr Lawrence in trying to stop the Marks royal commission? Can you confirm that taxpayers will not be footing these costs in any way, shape or form?",81
74,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Have you signed that letter yet to the Liberal Party on your endorsement? Right through the particular things to which you referred the position of the government has been quite clear. We consider the entirety of this exercise a complete waste of taxpayers' funds-a total, complete waste. All the resources that we have had to put on the table in relation to Carmen Lawrence's defence, all the things that have been put on the table by Richard Court in relation to setting up this log rolling royal commission of his-every cent of it a waste of taxpayers' funds. That has been our very firm position as far as that is concerned. When these matters were raised in the parliament last night, I made absolutely clear the government's intentions on that matter and what our views of it were. I made clear our view of your utter hypocrisy, when all of you stood and applauded the former Premier of New South Wales going to appeal against ICAC in a higher court, being fully publicly funded. Then there was Robin Gray, who I understand is shortly to join us as an Indethe pendent at your expense. When the current Liberal government in Tasmania came in and there were appeals to the Supreme Court against the royal commission which involved him, did you go around saying that taxpayers ought not to fund that? No, not for one minute. So your question is based on fundamental canting hypocrisy in terms of what you have done when you have been confronted with equivalent sorts of situations and canting hypocrisy in terms of your concern about the taxpayers' position. Every single bit of it is a piece of massive hypocrisy as far as you are concerned. As was said by Senator Gareth Evans earlier today, and as I said yesterday, it is not our intention to proceed to fund that element of Dr Lawrence's legal expenses by any method other than ultimately a recourse to parliament. That was a position that was put forward by Senator Evans today and it is consistent with what I had to say yesterday. Mr Ruddock-Are you going to ask for a mandate at the next election?",81
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Berowra: consider your position. Work Opportunities for Social Security Recipients,82
76,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Is the government encouraging social security recipients, particularly unemployed people, to take up part-time and casual work opportunities? What effects are these policies having increasing the private incomes of social security recipients?",82
77,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for her question. I note in passing that this question today means that she has now asked me more questions this year than the opposition spokesman on social security has asked in three years. It shows the level of interest that the opposition takes in these issues. Mr Ruddock-I have spoken in more debates than you have.,82
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Berowra: don't rise to the occasion.,82
79,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Since the last election we have seen very rapid growth in full-time employment across the board in this country. We have also seen very substantial growth in part-time and casual work. It is, of course, most important that unemployed peopleparticularly those who are disadvantaged in the labour market-are in a position to take advantage of this expansion in all work opportunities, including part-time and casual work. In answer to the honourable member's question, there has been a whole range of measures taken by this government to maximise the scope for that to occur. From July this year we have fundamentally restructured the social security income test that operates towards people receiving unemployment payments, so that it is possible to say that people invariably improve their circumstances by increasing their number of hours of work and overcoming some very severe disincentive traps which previously existed in the system. We have introduced innovations such as the earnings credit, which is particularly useful for people receiving irregular amounts of part-time work. We have provided programs for sole parents through the jobs education and training program which are designed to increase their opportunities and scope to take up part-time work. We have introduced the disability reform program for those on disability pensions and so forth. There has been a whole raft of measures taken in addition to on the mainstream efforts announced in Working Nation, the jobs compact and so forth, to maximise people's scope to take up work opportunities. I am pleased to inform the House that these efforts have had a high degree of demonstrable success over the past decade or so. I will quote a few figures to illustrate the point. If we take the proportion of unemployed people reporting earnings we see that it has increased from 3.7 per cent in 1983 to 21.7 per cent in August 1995. That is a huge increase. Sole parent pensioners reporting earnings increased from nine per cent in 1983 to 24.5 per cent in June 1995. The proportion receiving maintenance is up from 23.7 per cent in 1983 to 42 per cent in 1995. Take the disability support pensioners. We had 6.3 per cent of disability support pensioners reporting earnings in June 1995 which was up from only 3.8 per cent as recently as 1991. Over the last decade the proportion of age pensioners receiving a partpension has increased from 24.4 per cent to 32.7 per cent. Those statistics give the lie to the claim that we see reiterated around the talkback circuits and echoed in the opposition speaking notes that somehow our measures are creating a situation of welfare dependency. On the contrary, the whole thrust of government policy has been to maximise incentives and opportunities for people to take up all kinds of full-time and part-time work. That covers not just those on unemployment payments but other groups that were previously considered to be more or less outside the work force, particularly sole parent pensioners and those on disability support pensions. ANL Ltd",82
80,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport. Minister, after $20 million in PA YE subsidies, losses of $145 million by ANL since the government decided to sell it, and further losses of $15 million since the final P&O bid, not to mention the $816,000 in consultancies paid to your ANL board of mates headed by Neville Wran, which have produced no obvious benefits, will you assure the House that the government will not be throwing yet more funds down the ANL drain-as has been proposed by the Joint Secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia, Tony Papasconstantinos--or will the government continue to let union bosses veto government policies?",83
81,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To the earlier parts of the commentary that the member had such trouble reading, I can only refer him to my answer of last week. In relation to the question right at the end, the answer is: yes. Social Security System",83
82,Mr HOLLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Opposition members-Oh, no!",83
83,Mr HOLLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, yes! Can the minister advise the House of any recent international studies comparing Australia's social security system with those of other OECD countries? Opposition members-Hooray! Over here, Graeme.",83
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! It is not as if you could miss him with that yellow shirt on.,83
85,Mr HOLLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thought the cheering was for me, Mr Speaker. How does Australia's system compare in terms of reducing income inequality and how has government policy strengthened the system?",83
86,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER Mr MCGauran-Boring!,83
87,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why don't you pay attention and you might learn something about these issues. As honourable members would be aware, there has been quite a debate in recent times about the situation of so-called battlers and the impact of government policies on equality or inequality, and on living standards. We have seen from the opposition side such champions of the oppressed and the underprivileged as the member for Kooyong taking up the cudgels-I regret to see he is not in the chamber today. I thank the honourable member for Throsby for his question. It means that he has already exceeded the quota this year of the opposition spokesperson on social security. Honourable members will recall the Leader of the National Party claiming that the top 20 per cent-the top quintile--of income earners earn 10 times as much as the bottom 20 per cent. I said at the time that this was wrong and that there was an obvious methodological error. I have been proved correct in a recent report by the OECD on income distribution in OECD countries. The OECD report shows a ratio of four to one, which is less than half the level of inequality claimed by the Leader of the National Party. Moreover, the OECD report shows that Australia has the most progressive social security system and the most progressive taxation system of any of the countries studied. That is shown by the fact that the lowest income group in Australia receives a higher share of social transfers and pays less income tax than in any of the other countries under study. Even this understates the degree of progressivity of the Australian system. We rely less on regressive indirect taxes, which are not included in the study. Our social security system has greater redistributive impact over people's lifetimes than insurance based systems. This, too, is not taken into account in the study. Much of the redistributions shown in systems with social insurance schemes are really just redistributions for the same people over their lifetimes. Ours is more redistributive between individuals. Our system has improved significantly since the date of the OECD study, which was drawn in the 1980s, particularly in terms of family payments and the achievement of the 25 per cent of average weekly earnings goal for pensions. The study does not include the impact of our high and relatively equal level of home ownership or the social wage. So even with the raw information contained in this study, our system of taxes and social security is shown to be highly progressive; in fact, the most progressive of the group of countries studied. Even that understates the degree of progressivity. We see the sort of thing going on in countries like the United Kingdom with governments of a similar persuasion as the opposition. In that case they have done what the Leader of the Opposition said he would do in regard to pensions in his wasteland speech to ACOSS, that is, to just maintain the pension in real terms through indexation. We have had a range of contradictory statements from the opposition subsequently about the 25 per cent goal. So pensioners are entitled to be quite sceptical. In the case of the UK the pension was cut from around 20 per cent of average earnings in 1981 to 16 per cent in 1990. It is likely to be around 14 per cent by the year 2000. That is the best sort of result pensioners can expect from a coalition government of a similar persuasion and ideology to that of the conservative government in the UK. Civil Aviation Safety Authority",83
88,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the honourable member for Hume. Mr Crean-Are you going to ask the question yourself now of Laurie?,84
89,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was well answered, I can tell you! Good on you, Laurie-more money down the drain! My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Can the minister confirm that assistance was given by a senior federal Labor parliamentarian to a Labor member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, Mr Neil Bell, in order to have action against him by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority dropped? Is it a fact that the Northern Territory politician in question was flying an aircraft, VH SRG, without a valid licence when he crashed at Alice Springs airport on 2 July this year? Is it correct that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority dropped all charges against Mr Bell after his federal Labor mate prepared Mr Bell's report on the incident for him?",84
90,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thought I was going to get a repeat of the question written out by the member for Hume for the member for Hinkler. The member for Hume has raised a matter in respect of which I have absolutely no knowledge. I will make it my business to seek appropriate advice from the authority involved and inform the House. International Development Association,84
91,Mr LANGMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. It relates to the controversy over the negotiations for replenishment of the International Development Association, in part due to the savage cuts which the US Congress is attempting to impose on the US administration. I ask the minister: can he outline to the House Australia's approach to these important negotiations?",84
92,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member, who has had a great interest in these matters over the years, has drawn attention to perhaps the biggest question in the aid field there is at the moment, the biggest issue we need to address. As members will know, the IDA, the International Development Association, is the soft loan arm of the World Bank. It provides development credits on concessional or nearto-grant terms to the poorest amongst the developing countries. In order to do that it depends on regular replenishments of its resources by donor countries. It is the case that negotiations on the 11 th replenishment of IDA began about a year ago. They have now reached a critical stage. As the honourable member reflected in his question, the negotiation process has been very greatly complicated by the fact that the Republican controlled United States Congress has reneged on a sizeable proportion of its commitment to the last replenishment of IDA. As a result of that, the administration has made it clear that there is no prospect of a United States commitment to the IDA 11 replenishment at this time. IDA is the single largest source of concessional finance for developing countries. Any substantial reduction in funding for 11 could have disastrous flow-on effects for other multilateral and bilateral aid programs and for the countries which they assist. The effecti veness of IDA's operations in developa ment terms is widely acknowledged. There are still those in some quarters-and them are in this House-whose motto is 'World Bank bad, NGOs good'. The government, by contrast, believes that both are that both have a role to play and that IDA at the cutting edge in areas such as donor coordination, policy dialogue, economic and sectoral research and program design and evaluation. In recent years, the World Bank has recontribution. invigorated its loan portfolio and its processes in response to a couple of events, particularly the 1992 Wapenhans report into the adminisAustralian tration of the bank. The second event, someworth thing which Australians should feel great pride about, is the coming to office of Jim Wolfensohn, a very distinguished Australianproach American, with his recent appointment to the presidency of the World Bank. Other Australreally Ian ministers, NGOs and I had a long talk to Bank. Jim when he was in Australia recently. The prospect of this government working under the stewardship of an invigorated and enlightthrough ened leader in the World Bank is very excittheir ing. I believe that together we can achieve great deal, particularly in our region. From an Australian perspective, it is very difficult to overestimate the value to us having the World Bank engaged in countries of particular concern to us. Papua New Ian Guinea is an example, where the structural adjustment program has been extremely ly important in saving that country from past policies. It is also true in other countries where Australia has strong aid, or trade ties. I am very pleased to be able to take this opportunity to say that, when the government decides on the level of Australia's contribution to IDA 11, we will not be seeking to minimise our share of the financing burden; on the contrary. As the Treasurer intimated when he spoke in Washington recently, we will be giving posItive consideration to a supplementary contribution above Australia's IDA calculated burden share. Given the pivotal role of IDA in the international aid effort and the flow-on effects which the replenishment will have, what is needed from all donors is clear vote of confidence in the multilateral system, IDA and Jim Wolfensohn's objectives some of for the World Bank. As much as we can, we will be seeking in good, that replenishment to make sure that the is United States is brought to discharge its own obligations. That may mean that we have to put in a conditional replenishment so that the United Sta'es will not benefit from a procurement in the bank as a result of a reduced Those benefits are very substantial. In 1994-95, for example, Australia contributed $A113 million to the World Bank. companies received $327 million of contracts with the bank. So that is a very good investment, even from the point of view of self-interest. By contrast, the apof the US administration is simplistic, short-sighted and blinkered. A failure will inhibit the operations of the World The OppOSItIOn has carefully talked all this answer. I am pretty confident that approach is as short-sighted and blinka ered as the one of the US Congress. Why is that? Like other ministers, I have had an opportunity to look through these fine Liberal Party speakers notes. When one looks through of the section on Australia in the world, what does one find? There are sections on Australindependence, the Australian constitution, defence, the flag and trade. But it is absoluteinnocent of any reference to foreign policy and foreign aid. It is not just that it says nothing; there is not even a heading on it in foreign policy the whole document. The last thing the opposition has said on this subject is that it proposes to slash $200 million out of the aid budget. There has been no statement from the opposition since. It would be nice to have some answers. I do not imagine that we will get them from an opposition so bereft of ideas as this one. Youth Suicide",84
93,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer the minister to today's press reports of the speech made by the Prime Minister at the Metal Trades Industry Association on Monday, when he inferred that more teenagers would die of gunshot wounds than any other cause under a reformed industrial relations system. I remind the minister that levels of youth suicide have reached crisis proportions. More than 400 young Australians each year tragically take their own lives. Will the minister repudiate the baseless and insensitive remarks made by his Prime Minister and apologise to the Australian people, particularThe ly to parents of young Australians, who are justifiably worried about their children's future after 13 years of neglect?",86
94,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I intend to do no such thing. Occupational Health and Safety,86
95,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and it refers to the recent report of the Industry Commission on occupational health and safety. What action is the government taking on that report?,86
96,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Yesterday we took the unusual step of releasing immediately upon its presentation the Industry Commission's report into work health and safety. We did this because we have always operated on the basis here of cooperation between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories and the ACCI and ACTU. It is important and I wanted all of those stakeholders to read the document so that I might consult with them before the Commonwealth makes a response to this report on worker health and safety. It is a timely report inasmuch as it comes now 10 years after the establishment of the Commonwealth's arm here, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, which, I might say, has done a great deal of work in lifting the standards of care over workers in workplaces around Australia. The tenor of the recommendations to Australian governments of this commission is very important. It is a very intelligent report. This report recommends, for instance, that governments should streamline but strengthen regulation with fewer and simpler rules, allow greater flexibility for workplaces to manage injury and disease, beef up enforcement of the key legal responsibilities, strengthen financial incentives for safer workplaces, overhaul cooperation between Australian governments and provide greater contestability and transparency in research and funding. We might ask why it is so important. Let me relay to you some of the statistics as published in this Industry Commission report. number of Australians who are killed or injured as a result of their work is in a sense appalling. Each year around 500 Australians die as a result of traumatic injury at work; between 650 and 2,200 workers die as a result of occupational cancers which, in the majority of cases, are due to exposure to hazardous materials; and up to 650,000 workers, or one in every 12 working Australians, suffer injury and illness from work-and almost two-thirds of those will have to take time off work. In addition, the report indicates that at any time the accumulated effects of work related injury and ill health mean that up to 140,000 Australian workers cannot work at their full capacity, over 270,000 workers have had to reduce permanently their hours of work or change their jobs and about 200,000 persons are prevented from working at all. There are a small number of recommendations that I would like to indicate to members, ones that are particularly important for me as we review and the Commonwealth comes to a position on this. They are particularly creative, and I will indicate them to the House. For instance, recommendation 4 states: The Commission recommends that the principal OHS legislation in each jurisdiction require all employees, as far as reasonably practicable. to cooperate with their employer in the management of risks to health and safety at their workplace.",86
97,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,86
98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,86
99,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thanks, Mr Speaker. The member for Mitchell asked a question about youth suicide, as if he cared, but shows no interest whatsoever in workers' health and safety. Be fair. At least act as though you are interested in this matter.",86
100,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,87
101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. Mr Downer-To be fair to you.,87
102,Mr JOHNS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To be fair to me; that is right. Recommendation 4 indicates that it ought to be a joint responsibility of employers and employees on this important question. There are one or two other recommendations I would like to indicate. Recommendation 16 states: The Commission recommends that all jurisdictions consider an immediate increase in the maximum penalties in their OHS legislation to the levels in Commonwealth ... system ... Again, it is probably important that those responsible for injuring workers have a financial penalty imposed on them if, indeed, they have not taken the proper duty of care. Just one other one point which I think is particularly useful relates to recommendation No. 35. The report states: Disclosure of a company's health and safety record in its annual report would raise awareness and help encourage a more proactive approach to health and safety. The information reported might include information on the company's health and safety policy, risk management systems and performance. Despite considerable advances in this area over the last 10 years, I think we have a great deal to do. I will endeavour to make sure we analyse all of the Industry Commission's report and consult with the states and the various stakeholders in order that we can make Australian workplaces safer for Australian workers. Member for Kalgoorlie",87
103,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister in his capacity as Manager of Government Business and responsible in part for the rights and privileges of individual members. Does the Deputy Prime Minister support the New South Wales Labor MPs who say that the member for Kalgoorlie should not be expelled, and does he support the statement of the member for Eden-Monaro that: Any move to remove Mr Campbell's preselection would not be the sort of thing a party that wants to show leadership into the 21st century should be doing-we ought to allow a broad selection of opinions in a party like ours.",87
104,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We allow very broad opinions in our party, in answer to the honourable member's question. I would have thought it would have been a bit more interesting for the honourable member, since he asked questions about people who have been disendorsed, to have had a bit of a listen to Mr Filing's performance here yesterday and to have asked himself a few fundamental questions about why that might have occurred. Of course, it was not policy disagreement that was a cause of any great deal of difficulty at all there. He laid it all out for you. It was rock ribbed Liberal Party corruption going right to the very top of the Liberal Party in Western Australia. That is why his endorsement was removed. I would have thought there might be a bit of interest in that matter on the other side of the House and a bit of compulsion to feel themselves free to do something about it. The same group, of course, had something to do with the demise of the honourable member for Curtin. Perhaps you might like to outline to us the points of disagreement between Liberal Party policy and those two gentlemen concerned before they were disendorsed. Perhaps you might like to point out to us the extent to which they showed loyalty to their leader and whether or not that played some role in their disendorsement. They were disendorsed by a corrupt cabal. That was made absolutely clear by the honourable member for Moore yesterday. I would have thought the last day on which you would want to go into this parliament asking questions about this would be when something like that has happened. One thing you can be absolutely certain of as far as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is concerned: he will receive due process when these matters are considered by the national executive. National Accounts",87
105,Mr JENKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister in his capacity as the Minister for Finance. Can the minister inform the House of the national accounts data released today? Does that data indicate that the economy has grown for the longest period of consecutive growth on record?,87
106,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am so glad that the honourable member, an experienced and distinguished member of this place, has finally acknowledged Banquo's ghost at this question time. I wonder how long it is since a figure on the quarterly national accounts came out and there has been not one question from the opposition on the national accounts-not one question from the economic blow-hards on the other side of the House. Perish the thought that it might have had something to do with what has become the opposition's style on economic policy in this place over the last little while: statement in the morning, correction by press release in the afternoon. In this case, we had a statement in the afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition and then an attempt to correct it and imply that somehow or other the journalist who had quoted his backsliding from the principal point in his headland speech had got him wrong. The Leader of the Opposition walked back off his principal point. I am not surprised that the honourable member for Scullin had to stand up and ask an economic question in this House. What he said in his question is quite correct. The national accounts data released today revealed a record growth-that is, 17 quarters of growth. That 17 quarters of growth has produced a 17 per cent improvement in our gross domestic product-an improvement in line with what the government had anticipated would be produced from its sound fiscal policies, its sound micro-economic policies, its sound industry policies and its sound policies on encouraging export. That 17 per cent effectively works out to be an annual rate of four per cent growth over that period. Incorporated within that 17 quarters of growth is a massive improvement in labour productivity. There has been an annual average change of 2.9 per cent under our industrial relations policies. Contrast that with situation in New Zealand: under their industrial relations policies-which the opposition endorses-productivity growth in New Zealand has been slightly less that half of ours. It is a remarkable contrast. We can then go to the real household per capita income. The annual average improvement revealed in these statistics of 17 quarters of growth was 2.6 per cent, and the total change over that period was 11.6 per cent. For the real household disposable income, there was a 3.7 per cent improvement, and the overall rate of change over that time was 16.9 per cent. Mr Costello-How about household savings?",88
107,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I come to gross savings, as I am heckled by an interjection from the opposition Treasury spokesman. It is the only time. I get to hear from him on this subject. Mr Costello-You are not the Treasurer.",88
108,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He says that I am not the Treasurer-so that is why he does not feel like asking me questions. I seem to recollect that on the odd Wednesday in here I used to get the odd economic question from the opposition Treasury spokesman-indeed, the odd question on the various statistics which are from time to time dealt with. There has been a useful two per cent lift in gross savings during this quarter. In terms of gross savings across the board, there has never been a higher rate than in those 17 quarters of growth. Indeed, in relation to savings, there is only one proposition on the table in the private savings area that has any meaning at all and that will improve our private savings performance-that is, of course, the government's policy on superannuation. It is not surprising that these excellent figures have come through. They show that we have achieved the steady growth whichÂ· the government's policies have been directed towards. When you look at the inwardness of the figures, it is obvious what impact our policies are having on household incomesthere is good growth there. When you look at what the figures represent in terms of the the Australian work force, again, you see good performances there. Compared with the performances of the industrial systems that the opposition wants to pick up on, our system has performed much better. I think that makes a very nice note to conclude question time on. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.",88

111,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received letters from the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 107, I have selected the matter which in my opinion is the most urgent and important, that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Perth, namely: The importance of a government commitment to maintaining living standards through social and industrial safety nets. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number o/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",90
112,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This week we have learned that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) wants to do in a decent pension, as well as wanting to do in fair and decent wages for workers. The last time we had a run-up to a federal election the opposition wanted to whack working people and pensioners with a 15 per cent GST. This time they want to snip the pay packet and snip the pension before it arrives in working people's and pensioners' pockets. They want to do in the award safety net, slash CPI andwages and conditions, and they want to do in the link between the pension and 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. As the MPI reflects-'The importance of a government commitment to maintaining living standards through social and industrial safety nets'-the government is absolutely committed to protecting and preserving these social and industrial safety nets through the award system and through the pension and its linkage with 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. What we know is that the opposition and the Leader of the Opposition are absolutethe ly committed to doing these things in. Let us start with the pension. We saw the Leader of the Opposition on one of the TV programs on Sunday talking about the pension. And what are some of the things we know about the record of this government in its treatment of pensioners and the level of pension? Before this government came to office, pensions were not indexed and now they are indexed twice yearly. When the government came to office, pensions were around 22 per cent of average weekly earnings; they are now at nearly 26 per cent25.7 per cent-and they have been matching the government's 25 per cent of average weekly earnings commitment for three or four years. When the opposition was last in power, pensions fell by a real two per cent and, in the course of this government's term of office, they have gone up in real terms. But the most intriguing thing about the Leader of the Opposition's performance on Sunday is, I think, best reflected by the following exchange when he was asked about pensions. MicheIle Grattan asked him the foIlowing question: Pensions, would you retain them? Compere: Aged pensions. John Howard: Absolute ironclad retention. Michelle Grattan: Twenty-five per cent of average weekly earnings? John Howard: Well. Well. We're going to retain the present system. John Howard: Well, we retain the adjustment to Michelle Grattan: And the 25 per cent? John Howard: Well the 25 per cent is a goal of the Government's. That confirms what we discovered in the Leader of the Opposition's headland speech to ACOSS when he made absolutely no mention of the linkage between the pension and the 25 per cent commitment. As the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) pointed out in the course of question time, we subsequently saw an attempt by Leader of the Opposition, through press release later on Sunday afternoon, to somehow reclaim that position. But Australian pensioners should understand what John Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, really wants to achieve by breaking the link between 25 per cent average weekly earnings and the pension system-by looking at the record when he was in power. When John Howard was Treasurer, he cut pensions by two per cent in real terms. Under this government, pensions have gone up by 14 per cent. Some members may well recal! that in 1979, John Howard denied pensioners an indexation increase because inflation had 'fallen', as he put it, to eight per cent. Of course, he allowed pensions to fall substantially below the 25 per cent linkage to as low as 22-odd per cent. When you examine some of the other aspects that are important to pensioners and look at the comparison between the government's record and the record of the coalition with John Howard as Treasurer, you discover that, under the coalition from December 1975 to March 1983, for a single age pensioner not renting, the pension suffered a real drop in its value of 2.3 per cent and, for those renting privately, a 2.2 per cent drop. That compares with the record of this government: from March 1983 to June of this year, for those not renting, a real increase of 11.9 per cent and, for those renting privately, a real increase of 20.4 per cent. The respective figures so far as an age pensioner couple is concerned is: under the coalition, 2.1 per cent in both categories; under this government, 12 per cent for those not renting and 16.5 per cent for those who are renting privately. I noticed in the Sydney Morning Herald on 28 November earlier this week that Mike Seccombe wrote a piece which he described as, 'Howard shows he can do a Downer'. I am not sure that Mr Seccombe got it quite right, but there are a couple of comments here which are worth reading into the record. Mr Seccombe says: Cruel television in c1ose-up-capturing the pathetic look of indecision and the long pause which said more clearly than words, 'I haven't a clue what I'm talking about.' John Howard has better control of his facial expressions and a far more practiced cation, which is lucky for him because on Sunday he very nearly did a Downer. Mr Seccombe in his article then refers to the former Leader of the Opposition and his trek into the outback. Mr Seccombe finishes his comment by saying: Howard's release finished, 'Surely even the Keating government should have the decency not to attempt a fear campaign on something as sensitive as the basic level of the pension.' And Mr Seccombe says: Wrong. They would. And they would be credible in doing it. That is because it is not a fear campaign, it is a fact campaign-it is telling the truth. Mr Seccombe concludes by saying: It shows just how vulnerable Howard can be once he starts to actually enumerate policies rather than duck and weave. It shows that there is a very good chance he can still choke, like Downer before him, because he doesn't quite know what he believes. I think Mr Seccombe got that bit slightly wrong so far as pensions are concerned. We know absolutely what John Howard believes in so far as pensions are concerned. He wants to do in, as much as he can, a decent pension for Australia's pensioners. Another very important aspect of living standards is the need to ensure that working people in Australia have a fair and decent safety net and fair and decent conditions. We know the way in which the Leader of the Opposition has absolutely handcuffed himself to the policies that I have seen in my own state of Western Australia pursued by Premier Richard Court and the industrial relations minister, Graham Kierath. We find in the West Australian of Saturday 29 July the headline, 'Howard: WA is our model' - we see the handcuff clinched on. The article in the West Australian says: A Federal coalition government would mirror the industrial relations policies implemented by the Court Government in Western Australia, Federal Opposition Leader John Howard said yesterday. Mr Howard is quoted as saying: 1 would like to see throughout Australia an industrial relations system that is largely similar to what the coalition Government has implemented in line in obfus- Western Australia. In the article we find as well a quote from Premier Richard Court saying: We are pleased that the Federal (coalition's) industrial relations policy will be modelled on what we have successfully implemented here. That, of course, was a reference to what is known as the first wave of industrial relations legislation in Western Australia. Although it is quite clear from subsequent comments which I have read to the House on previous occasions that Mr Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, has also handcuffed himself to the first draft of the second wave of Mr Kierath' s legislation. What is the effect of this industrial relations legislation in Western Australia? The effect of the legislation in terms of industrial harmony is that strikes have increased and will increase. Industrial disputation will go up. The effect of that legislation on wages and conditions, which are fundamental to the living standards and the lifestyles of ordinary Australians, is that overtime rates of pay are optional, penalty rates for working nights and weekends disappear and holiday leave loading is a thing of the past. We have a mirage of suggested minimum standards. The real catch, the real purpose, of the industrial relations legislation in Western Australia, which Mr Howard wants to implement nationally, was exposed and expressed no better than by Minister Graham Kierath himself on the Lateline show on the ABC on 23 August 1995. When describing his system to the presenter on that occasion and referring to the implementation of the legislation, he said: And we did that quite deliberately, we thought that there would be some areas of the labour market that were over-priced and needed to be re-adjusted, what we would call low-skilled, low paid starter jobs. In other words, a deliberate policy of reducing wages for average and ordinary workers in Australia. This theme is repeated in the confidential Liberal Party's speakers notes of November 1995. If you go to the industrial relations section in that document, you will not find any incriminating detail. The editors have, however, done an imperfect job of keeping out what the Liberal Party really believes in. On page 43 in the regional development section it is stated: remove impediments-like inflexible labour conditions and awards-to growth in the regions So in regions like Western Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia, or even Victoria or New South Wales, the Liberal Party's solution to growth in those regions is to push down wages and to remove and reduce conditions. I referred in passing to the minimum entitlements in the Western Australian legislation. Those minimum entitlements are a minimum weekly wage, which the Court government set at $317, which was less than a recommendation made by the Industrial Relations Commission and less than a recommendation made by a consultant to the minister; four weeks annual leave; and 12 months unpaid parental leave. For young people in Western Australia, the minimum hourly rate has been set by the government at $3.77 an hour. As I have already indicated, there is no guarantee of overtime penalty rates or holiday loadings in the legislation. I was interested to see the Leader of the Opposition, at the Bulletin magazine's business awards last night, making some comments about industrial relations and working conditions. He is reported as saying on the AM program this morning, in respect of the recent Weipa dispute: ... and it has been a very, very important and in many respects a seminal industrial relations dispute ... because it has given all of us, a window into an area of public policyMr Crean-He said he saw the future.",90
113,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That's right, Minister. Be patient: I'm coming to that. He continues: Now for better or for worse, that includes a number of practices that over a period of time we've got to change. In his final reference to the Weipa dispute, as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training has very keenly hinted at, he says: I was listening to the future of industrial relations in Australia. This is what industrial relations would be for working people in Queensland, Western Australia and the rest of Australia-increased industrial disputation, confrontation and a massive reduction in wages and working standards. If we go back to the industrial disputation record of John Howard, we find that the number of working days lost per 1,000 employees when John Howard was Treasurer in 1981 was 797. In 1984, under this government, it was 76. The number of industrial disputes in 1981 when John Howard was Treasurer was 2,915. In 1994, under this government, it was 558. So that is John Howard's future. The Leader of the Opposition very much likes to handcuff himself to Western Australia's industrial relations legislation and to the Court government's system of industrial relations in Western Australia. I would like to digress slightly and pick up a point that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) made, which was that in very many respects the Liberal Party in Western Australia does not necessarily pay much heed or attention to the Leader of the Opposition. That is probably best reflected by the headline of a front-page story in the Australian of 6 April this year, 'Stay out, WA Libs warn Howard'. This is a reference to the way in which the Liberal Party in Western Australia treated John Howard's two strongest supporters from Western Australia in this parliament-the member for Moore, Mr Filing, and the member for Curtin, Mr Rocher, who both sit as Independents. So the Western Australian Liberal Party-the home of Liberal Party disunity in Australia-rewards the supporters of John Howard by taking away their preselection. I was pleased to see in a speech yesterday by the Independent member for Moore a reference to the Liberal Party in Western Australia. Mr Filing, in his speech to the House yesterday, said: I conclude by saying that this episode in the Liberal Party's history in Western Australia is one of the darkest and most unsavoury ones. I must say that the Liberal Party is a great institution. It great party. It has a great history. Unfortunately, the case of Western Australia, its affairs have been dominated and taken over by a bunch of people who should be nowhere near public office. They are a disgrace and the sooner a proper, open judicial inquiry identifies and sets in train the prosecution of those responsible ... the better. These are the standards that we can expect from the Liberal Party in Western Australia. In addition to John Howard's commitment to slashing wages and reducing the conditions of working men and women in this country, we have seen in living, breathing colour reaffirmation of the way he treated pensioners in Australia when he was Treasurer, wanting to break the 25 per cent of average weekly earnings link which this government has used to ensure that Australian pensioners get a fair and decent pension. (Time expired)",93
114,Mr CHARLES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If that was an example of the forerunner of Labor's campaign of fear and loathing against the Liberal and National parties with respect to social and industrial relations policy for this upcoming election campaign, then I think the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and I would agree that we do not really have much to fear. I remind members that this matter of public importance is supposed to be about maintaining living standards through social and industrial safety nets. What is the record of this government over the last 13 years? Since Labor came to office in 1983, the earnings of the least well paid 10 per cent of workers have declined by 0.93 per cent in real terms. That does not sound to me like much of a maintenance of the safety net. Over the same time, earnings of the highest paid 10 per cent of workers have increased by some 17 per cent. So there has been a dispersion of earnings-those on lower wages earning less, those on higher wages earning more-and the living standards of Australians have fallen over 13 years, the life of two Labor governments. The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) harped at the beginning of his speech about social security. He said that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) on Meet the Press last Sunday failed to make a commitment is a with respect to social security. I want to make in it clear, and I will quote the Leader of the Opposition. On 26 November 1995, he said: It is clear and absolute Coalition policy both to index pensions on a twice yearly basis in accordance with the Consumer Price Index and as well maintain their value at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Surely the member for Perth can understand English. That is a guarantee. It means that on those two points there is absolutely no difference between the coalition and the Labor government policy. So the member of Perth's campaign of fear and loathing sank, just like most of his arguments. The government had a promise about pensioners. Do you remember what that promise was? I remember that promise about pensioners. As I recall, Mr Howe, who was then Minister for Social Security, said that all age and service pensioners would be removed from the tax system by 1995. Mr Smyth-By when?",94
115,Mr CHARLES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That promise was given in 1989 by Mr Howe MP, Minister for Social Security, and was contained in the ALP 1993 policy document. We have not seen much of that, have we? Pensioners still pay tax-not every pensioner, but there are still lots of pensioners who pay tax. The point at issue in this matter of public importance, quite frankly, is something else. When we talk about safety nets, there is only one real safety net in the system for Australians who want jobs, and for all Australians, and that is jobs. It is jobs, it is jobs and it is jobs. If we want higher standards of living then we all need jobs. Any society that can employ all of those people who want to work in paid employment is a society which has a well functioning economy with high standards of living. But Australian standards of living over the last 13 years have fallen under this Labor government, which has the hypocri-y to come into this House and raise a matter of public importance about what a terrific job it has done in maintaining safety nets. Labor used to be the political party of the battlers. It used to be the political party that stood for employment, that stood for jobs. But not any more. What is unemployment today? It is 8.7 per cent, up from 8.3 per cent. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), who is at the table, knows what I am talking about. He knows that it is still going up, that it is still ratcheting up. Talk to any of the retailers and they will tell you that stocks are up in the manufacturing sector today because sales are down and because their projections for Christmas are rotten. Myer is not buying and Woolworths is not buying. They are not stocking their department stores because they are frightened to death that they are not going to have the trade. Retail trade is off; consumer confidence is down; and we are headed back to the ratcheted-up unemployment levels again. We never got down to anything like the unemployment levels even in the mid-1980s of 6.3 per cent. Nevertheless, the minister has avowed a level of five per cent. Labor used to be the political party which said it was for employment and for the battlers, but that time has long gone. This is the mob over here-and it says so in this matter of public importance-that stands for protection. They say, 'We have to protect everybody from everybody else.' It relates to industrial relations, it relates to social security and it relates to jobs-the whole lot. Ask the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and he will tell you. What did he do? He cut tariffs. The higher the level of protection, the lower the standard of living, the lower the equality, the lower the sales, the lower the number of jobs, the lower the economic activity, the lower the level of competition-the less well off will be Australians, Australian companies and our whole society. The best social security safety net is a job for everybody that wants one and transfer payments to those who cannot, for whatever reason, find a job or who cannot care for themselves because of some disadvantage or some disability. We offer all Australians that safety net. I have given you the Leader of the Opposition's absolute guarantee that we will retain the 25 per cent safety net for social security. The member for Perth should have gone outside the front of Parliament House at about two o'clock today-just before the heavens opened up and the rain came down-because he might have seen the youth jobs truck out the front of Parliament House. Do you know what that youth jobs truck is all about? I will tell you what it is all about. It is about an absolutely disgraceful youth unemployment rate of 29 per cent across this nation. Do you know what that youth unemployment rate of 29 per cent means? For 15to 19-year-olds, it means that 143,400 young people who want to work do not have jobs, and for 20to 24-year-olds, it is 132,100. That makes a total of 275,500 young people who do not have jobs. That figure is equivalent to four times the population of the city of Launceston in Tasmania; three times the population of the city of Ballarat in Victoria; ten times the population of Whyalla in South Australia; ten times the population of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia; and 1Y2 times the population of the entire Northern Territory. That is a lot of youth unemployment. The minister has the gall to come into the House and tell us that he took away giving us the regional unemployment figures for youth because they were inconsistent. The major inconsistency about those figures is the fact that they showed the high level of youth unemployment and the absolute failure of this government and its program, Working Nation, to deal with the devastation of unemployment of our young people. I cannot think of anything worse than to deny young people the opportunity of having a job and starting a career. How debilitating can it be! You imbue these young people with hopelessness from the start. Undoubtedly there are many who will become long-term unemployed and who may never work all their lives. Their children may never work in their lives. They will be truly hopeless people. I tell you what: we will fix it. We will fix it because we will beat this mob at the next election. We will see if we cannot tum it around very dramatically and very quickly. Labor hides its youth unemployment level by banning those regional youth figures. The truth is that the figures show an appalling failure over 13 years to address that serious problem. Unemployment is higher now than it was when Working Nation was introduced. The minister has no excuse for that. He has spent a fortune on training programs, subtraining programs and job subsidy programs but the situation is worse than when the minister took it over and said that he was going to fix it. Apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force in 1995 are at their lowest level for three decades. Restricting access to many schemes until people are long-term unemployed has meant that the government's Working Nation program actually forces some people out of the work force. They become long-term unemployed. We have a few solutions for the minister if he would only listen. It is getting a bit late in the day for him to pick it up now. Our solutions include more real jobs by encouraging small and medium size business. After all, it is small and medium size enterprises that will employ our youth and adults. Other solutions include: active assistance at an earlier stage unemployment so that people are not left waiting to be long-term unemployed; simplifying the training wage traineeships system to make it accessible and appealing; recognition of the regional character of youth in general unemployment through the establishment of community employment programs and structures; in areas where work is not available, allowing more voluntary community work which fosters self-esteem; flexible guidelines and more generic labour market programs including the removal of rigid guidelines and requirements for existing programs which has meant that help has been denied to young people who could benefit; placing much more weight on employment outcomes rather than the process; and abolishing the tendering process as a means of opposing centralised control over the whole system. Part of this matter of public importance today deals with industrial relations. We have heard talk about industrial relations safety nets. Among other things, the member for Perth was talking about the industrial dispute at Weipa between CRA-Comalco and 71 of its employees who are under an award. The member for Perth contends that the coalition has some draconian plan to slash wages and to lower the living standards of Australians. Nothing could be further from the truth. The coalition has consistently said that our industrial relations policy will be a high wage policy. We want Australians to be able to improve their working conditions. This MPI deals with protection. The more rules you make and the stronger you make the structure, the more rigid and difficult you make it. The more demarcation issues you throw up in the system, the more costly you make the system for employers. If it costs more to employ a person because you are wasting money, you cannot pay the person as much as you could if you could remove some of those inflexibilities, some of those draconian measures which are put into the system, and some which have grown up over a long period. I remember at Robe Iron back in 1986 there was a requirement for five flavours of ice cream at the canteen. If the five flavours were not there everybody went home and they did of not shift any ore. That made Robe Iron fairly unprofitable. The company could not afford to pay its people very well. Our policy is a high wage policy. We will offer a very substantial safety net. We will make sure that Australian employees will not be worse off under a more flexible industrial relations system that is offered by the coalition. What it really amounts to in the long run is taking the control of the unions out of the equation where the unions are not wanted. Where people are already happily employed and without union membership, we just want the unions to leave those people alone. Bill Kelty agrees with me that that is a reasonable thing to do. The Australian Financial Review of 17 May reported Bill Kelty as saying: The system already contains plenty of flexibility ... including the ability to reduce wages for the majority of employers who pay over-award rates. We do not want to reduce wages-Bill Kelty is talking about it. He is also reported to have said: . . . most non-unionists already have individual contracts. The majority are quite happy. They want to go to an industrial tribunal and have their wages and conditions regulated. You don't need legislation. You just can't contract to below the award rate. We agree with that. I agree with Bill Kelty. He is right. When you see the fine detail of the coalition industrial relations policy, you will see that it reflects that. You cannot contract below the award wage. Employees, as they change from a centralised systemfrom the award system-to workplace agreements, will do so with the assurance that they are not going to be disadvantaged. We have always said that. That is not always true of the government. Senator Baume reported recently in the Senate that three men were wrongly dismissed, after the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) left his piggery, because they had protested for the previous two years that they had been paid less than the award rate by the piggery halfowned by the Prime Minister. I ask the member for Perth: where is the safety net? (Time expired)",94
116,Mr SWAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is my great pleasure to support this matter of public importance. Listening to the Liberal Party in this House is a truly depressing experience. The Liberal Party stand for what they think people will fall for. But people will not fall for the pap that we have heard here today and the excuse for policy that has been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in recent days. If we look at what has been said about pension policy and the award system, we can see why the Leader of the Opposition is maintaining his impersonation of Ronald Biggs-someone who has no past, no background and no record. The problem that he has-and the Liberal Party has in this House-is that he has a record in the area of pensions and industrial relations. He goes around pretending that the Liberals did not cut the real level of pensions when they were in power, that he does not have a hostile attitude to the award system, and that he does not want to abolish the award safety net. The fact of the matter is that when we pull them up on these statements they say, 'Oh no. don't That is a scare campaign from the Labor Party; it is a campaign of lies.' When you ask them what their policy is, they will not say. They only give a commitment when they are sprung. The Liberal Party and those opposite refuse to answer any questions because that would eliminate them. The minute they have to be pulled down to the detail of their policy, when they are asked, 'What is in the no disadvantage test? Are you going support a real level of pensions greater than 25 per cent of average weekly earnings?' they will not say anything. The Liberal Party, under John Howard and his Jurassic Park front bench, are a bit like 18th century Sydney; they offer a variety of 18th century views. That is no more dramatically illustrated than in the area of industrial relations because their only method to create jobs is to reduce wages. They went through their speaking notes and they pulled out most of the things that could have caused them problems politically, until we get to page 43, which obviously was not correctly edited. We found on page 43 the following statement: to create jobs they will 'remove impedimentslike inflexible labour conditions and awardsto growth in the regions'. What does that mean? Cut the wages; get rid of the no disadvantage test; get rid of the umpire; make the employees sign contracts, suffer or get sack. That is their solution to unemployment. What do we find when we hear them talking about pensions? On this side of the House, happen to regard a pension as a right. It a handout or a food order from the Smith Family; it is a right. That is why we have been committed to improving the real level pensions over time. A pension is a return honest, hard working Australians for their commitment to the country throughout their lives. Your attitude to pension policy says someout thing about your underlying values. The problem is that pensions are of so little interest to the Leader of the Opposition those opposite that, on the weekend, the pensioners Leader of the Opposition did not know the difference between indexing pensions increasing pensions to in excess of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. This government has a proud record. We have increased pensions to in excess of 25 cent of average weekly earnings-nearly 26 per cent. We have partly done that by indexIf ing the pension. But the problem for the Leader of the Opposition is that, if we had merely indexed the pension, it would worth $20 less now for a single pension or $34 less for a double pension. That is how much interest those opposite and the Leader of the Opposition have in the pension system. I do not believe that any of those opposite could tell me now what is the level of the pension. Could the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) or the member for Moncrieff (Mrs will Sullivan) tell me what the level of the single or married pension is? Of course you couldn't because you don't mix, act or move in those circles. You have no interest at all in pension policy and, if you have no interest in pension policy, it says something about your fundavalue system. mental values because even if $34 a week for a pensioner couple is not important to the Liberal Party, it sure as hell is important to the Labor Party-and it is very important those people who survive on a pension and who are struggling to make ends meet. That is precisely what they would lose listening under a Liberal government, because that the the difference between merely indexing a pension and maintaining and increasing it to in excess of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings-a fact not mentioned by the Leader we of the Opposition when he gave his wasteland is not speech to ACOSS. He is supposed to be telling us where he stands and what the fundamental commitment is. He did not say of that he would continue to ensure that it was to over 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Some weeks after, he went on Meet the Press. It was only when he was pulled up on this question and made the gaffe that he went the next day in response to a press release by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) and said, 'We will move towards 25 and per cent of average weekly earnings.' No in this country are going to believe that because they know what your values are and and they know your record. This government spends something like $12 billion a year on age pensions. Those opposite come into the House year in, year out and tell per us that we should have a level of tax and spending equivalent to that in Asian nations. it were equivalent to that of our Asian trading partners, that would mean cutting expenditure in this country by between $10 be billion and $20 billion a year. That is the aim of you people opposite. That is the size of the spending cuts you are talking about. This was reaffirmed today in question time by the Leader of the Opposition. If you are going to have spending cuts of between $10 billion and $20 billion a year, I think that $12 billion a year on pensions be pretty high on your target list. That is something we will be explaining in great detail to the pensioners of Australia over the weeks ahead. The first target in your spending cut campaign will be pensions and pensioners. You have the record to prove that is your The problem with the Liberal Party, particularly when it comes to pensions and social security, is that they simply cannot be trusted. to I said at the beginning that those opposite stand for what they think people will fall for. Well, people are wising up and they are not to your glib rhetoric. You pretend to is care about battlers but the Leader of the Opposition fervently believes in cutting the wages of the lowest paid in the work force. That has been confirmed in the speakers' notes which you have distributed this week. Recently I was in a working class suburb in my electorate and I was approached by a gentleman who asked, 'What do you call John Howard driving through a working class suburb?' I said, 'I don't know.' He said, 'Lost.' That is absolutely right; dead lost, as you are on pensions. You travel around the country and say, 'Jeff Kennett's industrial relations policies in Victoria are terrific.' The Leader of the Opposition goes to Western Australia and says he admires what Richard Court is doing. But what Richard Court and Jeff Kennett are doing is what you would do. You would abolish penalty rates. You would abolish leave loadings. You would take the umpire out and you would move to a system of individual contracts. There would be no protection. The Western Australian or Victorian model could cost any worker throughout this country thousands of dollars a year. That is why you will not spell out your no disadvantage test, but when we point this out you say: 'It is a scare campaign.' Labor did not invent the 400,000 Victorian workers who have moved into the federal system. Labor did not invent what Richard Court and Graham Kierath did in Western Australia. They are facts. They are all members of the same party. You are all members of the same party. You are blood brothers. The Leader of the Opposition and Richard Court are blood brothers, particularly given what they have jointly achieved with Noel Crichton-Browne. So when we say that you stand for a system which means abolition of the umpire and dramatic cuts in wages, you cannot say that is a scare campaign. It is based on reality. What do we get every few weeks in the parliament and in the press? We get a cuddly new John Howard trying to say he is really a different person to Jeff Kennett and Richard Court. There is no difference. You have a record. The Ronald Biggs routine is not working any more, which is why the opinion poll ratings of the Leader of the Opposition are dropping dramatically. His record and his past are catching up with your political prospects. There is an old Australian saying: if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it is a duck. You all walk and quack like Liberals-Richard Court, Jeff Kennett, John Howard, Peter Reith, Peter Costello. You have all got records. The record that you have is ripping away the wages and working conditions of average Australians. If you want to talk about family living standards we will debate you, because Australians want the security of the award system. They want the security of a pension. All of that will be ripped away. What you offer the Australian people is insecurity in spades and you have a record to back it up. That will be debated the length and breadth of this country in the months ahead. (Time expired)",97
117,Mr MCARTHUR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Lilley (Mr Swan) talks about a campaign of distortion and lies. How about the ACTU's South Australian branch and their publication of 15 November which talks about the 'fear and loathing' campaign they will be running on individual contracts against ordinary Australians, against hard working Australians? That will be their attitude towards safety nets and towards looking after Australian voters. That is the point of view of the member for Lilley and the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). That is where they come from. This matter of public importance talks about the safety net. The ultimate safety net in Australia is having a job. No better safety net could there be for all Australians than finding long-term employment. Unemployment is rising to 8.7 per cent and still going up, as both of the government members. I have mentioned would have to concede. Under-employment-the other startling statistic-is around 21 per cent. People who would like to get some work, who would like to take a full time job, who at this stage may have work for only one hour per week are unable to get that job opportunity. That is the startling statistic under this government. The government has spent between $4 billion and $6 billion on Working Nation. There is hope that the make work schemes and training programs will readjust the unemployment statistics. Only last Friday I was in Bathurst. The mayor of that town indicated to the group I was with that there were more people doing training in the town than were unemployed, that people were doing sixmonth training courses all their lives without ever getting a job. That is the attitude in a Labor electorate in a fairly big regional centre, and that is the result of the Working Nation program. Members opposite talk about rising living standards. Let us look at the figures in the EPAC report. They talk about improvement in the annual growth rate. From 1975 to 1983, if you compare Australia and the OECD-that is during the Fraser years; the member for Lilley should have a look at these figuresthe annual growth rate was 1.4 per cent for Australia and 1.4 per cent for the OECD, about average. During the Hawke years in government, from 1983 to 1991, the average growth rate for Australia was 0.6 per cent. For the OECD it was 1.8 per cent. So we have three times the average growth rate under the OECD that we have here in Australia. Honourable members opposite are leaving the parliament. They cannot refute these damning statistics that come forward from the OECD. We tum to the Bureau of Industry Economics and its 1995 report, Overview 1995: International benchmarking, which says: ... we must continually be striving to improve our performance simply to maintain our relative position. Relaxing the pace of reform or letting the process falter would see Australia fall back into the trailing the also-rans. What a damning view-if we do not make the change we will be back with the also-rans. The report summary says: The key result emerging from the BIE's international benchmarking of Australian infrastructure is that while progress has been made in some areas of microeconomic reform, much remains to be done. The fact that we have actually slipped backwards in waterfront container handling and aviation, while the rest of the world has been moving ahead, must be a cause for concern. Some of the figures in this report are quite startling. In world best practice Australia was behind to the following extent: in the rail sector Australia was 250 per cent behind world best practice; in electricity supply we were 200 per cent behind the world best practice; in communications we were 150 per cent behind; and in aviation we were 100 per cent behind those nations which are doing these things well. In bulk coal handlingwhere we ought to do quite well; we export a lot of coal, as the shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran), would understand-we are 55 per cent behind. In container handling we are 25 per cent behind and in coastal shipping, where we have a fairly new fleet, we are still 17 per cent behind. These are the damning statistics that give us our relative productivity position now. I tum to the arguments with CRA and Alcoa. In New Zealand, Bell Bay and at Weipa CRA there have been great productivity improvements through the shift towards individual contracts and a new cultural emphasis. I would like to quote the words of a former union worker: eRA Ltd's chief executive, Mr Leon Davis, yesterday vigorously defended the resource group's industrial relations practices declaring that the company would continue to push for blue-collar workers to be on individual contracts. ... Mr Davis said he had been a union member himself when he worked as a labourer in Port Pirie for two years and he had also worked under staff employment contracts. 'I can understand why people see that staff conditions are better', Mr Davis said. 'People work better, at better productivity, than people who work under award conditions'. Here is an individual who has been in the union movement, who understands the award conditions, and he is clearly on the record as saying that individual contracts are better. Let me tum to the recently reincarnated industrial advocate Mr Bob Hawke, a great personal friend of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He pointed out that productivity improvements can result from industrial relations reform. He admits it. He understands that, if you make some changes, productivity can improve. At these very hearings he tabled some information about Alcoa down at Geelong. We have seen some remarkable changes in industrial activity at that plant with the price fluctuations in aluminium. The plant was old; it was constructed in the 1960s. The work force has been reduced from 1,100 to 700 by natural attrition. A trust has been developing between management and the work force. Salaries have been annualised. No overtime is now worked. So there is an emphasis on getting the job done. There are worker teams. People work together to achieve their objectives. More importantly, there is no trade union interference from outside the plant. The union heavies from Sydney or Melbourne do not come down to the plant to tell the work force what to do. Quality performance and results are the order of the day. Supervisors are gone. The bosses are not there to keep an eye on the workers because the teams are very keen to do the very best job. The teams organise their own work schedules. So now we have the Point Henry plant at Alcoa maintaining one of the best plants in the world for Alcoa. A document on industrial relations the Labor way has been put out under the name of the president of the Labor Party, Mr Barry Jones. In this document, he makes some very strange allegations against the Liberal Party. He says: Under John Howard, working conditions will be lost if your employer chooses. That is absolutely not true. In fact, workers will have the option of staying with their award conditions. He continues: ... strikes will increase. Inflation will go only higher interest rates will be available to it. What an amazing suggestion. This comes as a backdrop to the situation where Australia already loses more days per thousand employees through industrial action than Japan, France, Germany, the USA, the UK, Sweden and New Zealand. They are the figures and the background. A recent survey of international shippers found that Australia is the second worse country in the world for strikes in the shipping industry. Twenty-three per cent of the strikes affecting world shipping have taken place in Australia. That is their industrial relations record under the harmony of the eighth accord. What an amazing situation. Inflation is 5.1 per cent, and still rising, and the president of the Labor Party is suggesting all these changes. If we look at how the workers have fared under Accord Mark VIII, we see that, since 1983, real income per household has risen by four per cent over 13 years under a Labor government. Fancy that. Furthermore, modest increase has come about because of people working longer hours. They used to work 38.2 hours in 1983; they now have to work 43 hours per week to get the same sort of money. This is a classic. Jenny Mikakos, the former Batman candidate, said this of Martin Ferguson, the boss of the ACTU: During his leadership, real wages and conditions of employment have been lowered, especially for women, union coverage of the labour force has dropped . ., Is this the record of someone . . . who is fighting for the ""battlers""? That is what the Labor Party think about their own candidate. We have the situation where, since the Labor Party came to office in 1983, the earnings of the lowest paid 10 per cent of the population have decreased by one per cent. (Time expired)",99
118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The discussion is concluded. NA Public Works Committee Reports,101
119,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public up, and Works, I present the 26th, 27th and 28th stop reports of the committee for 1995 relating to the development of facilities for the artillery centre at Puckapunyal in Victoria; the construction of 20 apartments for Australian High Commission staff in Kuala Lumpur; and the construction of 10 apartments for ConsulateGeneral staff in Shanghai. Ordered that the reports be printed.",101
120,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Two of the reports I have tabled involve accommodation projects proposed by the Overseas Property Group. The committee's 27th report for 1995 relates to the construction of accommodation for Australian High Commission staff at Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. The estimated cost of the Kuala Lumpur proposal when referred to the committee was $11.345 million at May 1995 prices. Kuala Lumpur is fast becoming a city where most expatriates can no longer afford to live in free-standing houses as opposed to apartments and townhouses. The sustained demand for properties in Kuala Lumpur has made the cost of leasing residential accommodation very expensive. A significant proportion of the Australian owned residential estate in Kuala Lumpur is nearing the end of its economic life or has proved unsatisfactory for the post's property requirements. Commercial and residential rent escalation has reached eight per cent plus per annum and the Overseas Property Group expects that, at least for the life of this project, rents will continue to escalate, particularly within the immediate areas surrounding the central business district and areas in proximity to the High Commission. The economic and life cycle costing analysis of options provided to the committee by the Overseas Property Group clearly indicated that constructing a mix of apartments and townhouses on owned sites, selling unsuitable owned accommodation and relinquishing undesirable leases is the most advantageous and economic course of action in Kuala Lumpur. The Kuala Lumpur proposal referred to the committee involved the construction of a three-storey complex of 10 apartments at 9/11 J alan Taman U Thant and the construction of another IO-unit development on a site to be identified. A swimming pool, recreation room and multi-purpose room will be provided as part of each complex. At the public hearing, the Overseas Property Group advised that a decision had been made to develop 4 J alan Taman U Thant. Investigations have shown that it is only possible to fit eight townhouses on the site. However, the Overseas Property Group has advised that this will still provide a viable project. The committee notes an assurance from the Overseas Property Group that it will continue consultations with the post property committee during detailed design development. While there was general support for the Kuala Lumpur project from the staff at the High Commission, the Community Public Sector Union and the Foreign Service Family Association, there was some concern expressed regarding the extent of the development at 4 J alan Taman U Thant and some details of the design of both buildings. As the site at 4 Jalan Taman U Thant was not confirmed until shortly before the public hearing, it is inevitable that there is some confusion in relation to the details of the development on that site. The committee has recommended that the Overseas Property Group consult with the staff at the High Commission, the Community and Public Sector Union and the Foreign Service Family Association during the detailed design phase to resolve outstanding issues. The committee's 28th report for 1995 relates to the construction at Shanghai in the People's Republic of China of a five-storey building of 10 apartments. The estimated cost of the Shanghai proposal when referred to the committee was $10.529 million at May 1995 prices. The rapid growth of the Chinese economy in recent years has meant that the Shanghai property market has grown at a feverish pace. The financial pressures on the Shanghai economy are unlikely to abate within the next three to five years. Rents are expected to continue to increase at an estimated rate of 10 per cent per annum. Residential accommodation of a suitable standard and size will continue to be scarce and command premium prices in sought after areas. Rents are currently in the order of $AI9,OOO per month and have a fixed escalation clause of 10 per cent per annum for the two-year leases. There are currently 10 Australian based staff in Shanghai, with staff numbers likely to increase in the longer term. On the basis of short supply and rapidly rising costs, the Overseas Property Group in late 1993 examined its property strategy in Shanghai, including options of ownership. Early evaluations indicated a simple payback period for a development option in the designated consular district was less than six years. The Canadian government has indicated an interest in either renting or meeting the capital cost of two of the apartments. The Overseas Property Group advised that negotiations on this matter are continuing. The 10 apartments in Shanghai will be constructed as a single building of five storeys incorporating two apartments per floor. An indoor swimming pool and a combined recreational room will be provided in a separate recreation facility. Basement car parking and storage areas will be provided under an all-weather tennis court which is elevated one metre above natural ground level. The apartments have been designed in accordance with the design brief, taking account of local building regulations, climatic conditions, the surrounding built environment and the need for privacy, amenity and security for the occupants. Account has also been taken of the recommendations and requirements of the Consulate-General, which has been consulted in the development of the proposal. In agreeing to the project proceeding, the committee has recommended that the Overseas Property Group continue consultations with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, staff of the Consulate-General and the Community and Public Sector Union regarding possible changes to the design of the project which will allow for a better utilisation of the site. The committee accepts that many Australians at overseas posts would prefer not to live in compounds. But there is a basic dilemma if we wish to continue adequate Australian representation in many areas where we cannot afford the ever-increasing rental costs. So it is a case of building apartments such as those outlined in my reports or drastically reducing Australian based staff. The third report, which I have just tabled, concerns a proposal, sponsored by the Department of Defence, for the relocation of the Artillery Centre from North Head in Sydney to Puckapunyal, Victoria. The stated purpose of the proposal is to meet the training requirements of the School of Artillery and to make best use of existing facilities at Puckapunyal. This proposal will provide the school with ready access to a suitable field firing range. The proposal examined by the committee involves the provision of office accommodation, instructional and storage facilities and living accommodation. The estimated outturn cost of the project is $34.8 million. The committee has recommended that the proposal should proceed. The relocation of the School of Artillery from North Head has been the subject of a number of studies undertaken by Defence. Since 1990, public announcements by a number of defence ministers have alluded to this. Originally, the school was to go to Townsville, Queensland. With the relocation of the 1st Armoured Regiment to Darwin, facilities became available at Puckapunyal. This factor, and the large field firing range at Puckapunyal, prompted Defence to re-examine the Townsville option. A further study revealed that the school could be located at Puckapunyal at significantly less cost than Townsville, or other possible locations for that matter, by constructing a number of new facilities and refurbishing existing facilities. The proposal examined by the committee was somewhat different from other projects examined during the year. In this particular instance there was intense opposition to the move from North Head from local members of parliament, the Manly Council and a number of local community groups. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) left the committee in no doubt regarding his opposition to the move. Despite claims to the contrary, the committee believes opposition to the move is based more on local interests than national defence interests. North Head is a very pleasant location, but it lacks access to a field firing range. The range at Holsworthy is no longer suited for the type of training undertaken. It suffers from urban encroachment, is too small and is under the flight path to Sydney airport. It is also a two-hour drive away from North Head. Training facilities at the school are inadequate. Clearly, something needs to be done. The committee has concluded that for the School of Artillery to operate effectively and efficiently it needs to be located adjacent to a suitable field firing range and to have modem, purpose designed training facilities. There was some apprehension in the minds of representatives of the local community about the future use of the land at North Head to be vacated by the school. The committee considers that much of the apprehension is focused on the developed area, comprising 15 hectares, occupied by the School of Artillery. It consists of buildings, roads, married quarters and other support infrastructure. The future of the balance of the land, some 60 hectares, has been assured by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). This land is either natural bushland or on the Register of the National Estate. It will be incorporated into Sydney Harbour National Park. Whilst the future use of the larger area has been predetermined, a management regime will need to be developed under the direction of the Section 22 Committee. The Public Works Committee believes future uses of the 15 hectares should complement the objectives of the management plan for the larger site. The committee also believes this planning context should therefore preclude any development or adaptive reuse of land and buildings which are incompatible with, or detract from, a significant natural recreational asset on the shores of Sydney Harbour. I should point out that these matters will all be addressed by the Section 22 Committee comprising Commonwealth, state and local government officials, which will develop a management regime for the land at North Head. Both state and federal members of parliament for that area will be members of the Section 22 Committee. It was also pointed out that an artillery battery needs to be located with the school at Puckapunyal. It was suggested that decisions regarding the relocation of the school should await the outcome of the Army 21 study, which is examining the army's force structure for the next century. The study is due for completion in December. At present, there is no battery at Puckapunyal. The committee has therefore concluded that it will be necessary for an artillery battery to be located at Puckapunyal to support the school. Whilst this must await the outcome of the Army 21 study, based on the evidence from Defence there is every confidence to believe that a battery will be relocated to Puckapunyal. Honourable members may be aware that in recent years Puckapunyal has been upgraded to a modem and very pleasant army base-in fact, one of the largest army bases. The Public Works Committee has taken a keen interest in developments there. Some of the works examined in recent years include construction of a Royal Australian Army Service Corps Centre with an estimated cost of $8.4 million in 1972, redevelopment of the Armoured Centre with an estimated cost of $12 million in 1981 and, more recently, in 1990 the Stage 1 redevelopment at an estimated cost of $44 million. The committee was pleased with the positive response from the local shire to the proposal. In terms of the scope of the proposed work, which comprises new construction and refurbishment, the committee has concluded that the scope of proposed refurbishment makes good use of existing facilities. New construction has been restricted to the provision of specialised training facilities and three new accommodation blocks to be shared between officers and senior non-commissioned officers, depending on demand. The siting of elements of new construction is in accordance with the master plan. I should mention that the scope and the cost of the proposed work include the facilities required by an artillery battery. The estimated outturn cost of the project is $34.8 million. The committee questioned Defence about the basis of costings for the Seymour area when compared with capital city costs. Defence advised the committee that prices will be competitive and this and variations between capital city and local costings were factored into the cost estimate. Some concern was raised about the availability of housing for families associated with the Artillery Centre and the artillery battery. The committee was assured by the Defence Housing Authority that there is a stock of good quality houses available. Upgrading and refurbishment of poorer quality houses is programmed to occur before the arrival of the School of Artillery. I commend the reports to the House.",101
121,Mr ABBOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-It goes without saying that I am very disappointed with the result of this Public Works Committee inquiry relating to the development of facilities for the Artillery Centre, Puckapunyal. This report may well be a great result for the people of the marginal seat of MCEwen but this report's tabling is a black day for the people of Sydney and for the people of Warringah. It means that a priceless natural asset, one of the last unspoilt headlands on Sydney Harbour, is about to be taken out of the protective custody of the army and put, potentially at least, into the hands of developers. I do not blame the Defence bureaucrats because they were given a brief by the government. I do not blame the committee chairman, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who is a conscientious man doing a conscientious job. I do not blame committee members who were either obeying orders or trying to save the bureaucrats from the embarrassment of having their findings rejected. But I do blame the government, which is obviously prepared to sacrifice North Head on the altar of budgetary expediency. I do blame the government for being prepared to sell off one of the last and best unspoilt headlands in Sydney Harbour to protect its budget deficit. Page 11 of the report states in black and white for the whole world to see: ... over the next few years there will be considerable rationalisation of Defence property holdings the Sydney area. Rationalisation is code for privatisation. It means selling, and the people of Sydney must know that this government is prepared to sell out their heritage. The Department of Defence, conscious of the weakness of its position, changed its story several times in the course of these public hearings. First of all, Defence said that the move to Puckapunyal was necessary because the School of Artillery had to be next door to a firing range. Then, when it was pointed out that a firing range without guns is like an ocean without fish or, as Defence itself admitted, an infantryman without legs, they moved to the second position. The second position was that the move to Puckapunyal was justified because a depot support battery was eventually going to be put there. They then went on to say that the stationing of a depot support battery at Puckapunyal, which involved an effective 50 per cent increase in the size of the School of Artillery, could actually be done without adding any more than half a million dollars to the $35 million cost of this project. They then went on to admit that, in any event, even though this move was supposed to be justified because the School of Artillery had to be next to a firing range, wherever the School of Artillery was, its members would have to fly all around the countryside to different sorts of firing ranges to get the relevant practical experience. The third. big shift in the story, when they realised how weak the argument sounded, was to say that staying at North Head would cost a lot more money than the $20 million put into the original submission. We have had the immediate past chief of the defence forces telling us over the last few days that Australia cannot afford to defend itself on the current defence budget. We are now being asked by this government to believe that it can spend $35 million wilIynilly to move a perfectly effective school of artillery, a school of artillery which has done a perfectly good job for 50 years, to Puckapunyal. There is only one rational explanation for in this. The explanation is that this government wants to sell that land for the best possible price. The real reason this government wants to shift the School of Artillery is to sell off the land so that it can protect its precious budget surplus, if that is what it still is. Another reason, a reason which I think is operative in the minds of Defence bureaucrats, is the need to preserve Puckapunyal. But let us be very clear. This move to Puckapunyal is not about preserving the operational efficiency of the School of Artillery. It is about preserving the continued existence of the Puckapunyal military area. It is not about the defence of Australia; it is about the defence of Puckapunyal. It is not about a build-up of our defence capability; it is about a sell-off of Defence's land bank in Sydney. It is about privatising Defence land-putting Defence land into the same basket as this government has already put the ANL, Qantas, the airports and the Commonwealth Bank. I hope that Australia is never again faced with armed aggression. I hope that the people of Australia are never again subject to military attack. Last time that happened, North Head had guns and soldiers in place. Let us hope that, if it ever happens again, no enemy ever decides to attack Sydney. Let us hope that if an enemy ever decides to attack Australia it attacks Puckapunyal, because in the next few years this government will sell off all the sites in and around Sydney where our defence forces could stand and fight. One of the curious features of the decision the federal government has made is that, while the sell-off of land on Middle Head is being conducted under the auspices of the federal government itself, while that particular plan of management study is being run by the federal government, the plan of management study that the government has proposed for North Head is being run by the state government. This is not being run by the federal government; it is being run by the state government. It is a section 22 committee set up by the state planning minister under the state planning act. Why has the federal government washed its hands of this land on North Head? What deals have been done? What price has been agreed between the state government and the federal government to transfer what is currently Commonwealth land into state government hands? Have state Labor and federal Labor cooked up another deal along showground lines? In the course of public hearings, the chief defence bureaucrat gave us a definition of the meaning of the term 'no commercial development on North Head'. This was the commitment that the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, had gi ven to the mayors of Mosman and Manly earlier in the year. Brigadier MCCann defined the term. He said: ... this was seen to mean no new construction for commercial purposes . . . He went on to say that what could happen in the area was 'low scale, medium density redevelopment'. In other words, old construction can be used for commercial purposes and there can be new construction for what the government obviously defines as non-commercial purposes, including medium density housing. In fact, about the only thing the government has ruled out on North Head is a brand spanking new shopping complex. The shopping complex could be put in the existing School of Artillery building and a housing estate could be built all around it to use the shopping complex. That would be possible under the federal government's definition of 'no commercial development'. I know that the member for Throsby has expressed the hope that the section 22 committee would not permit any development that was incompatible with the existing nature of the area. That is no more than a pious hope because the result of the government's decision, given voice by the member for Throsby, is that the federal government has completely washed its hands of North Head. I say to this parliament that if we lose something like North Head now we will never get it back. Once it is gone, it is gone forever. The risk is that future generations of Sydneysiders will look up at housing where now there are trees, they will look up at people where now there are animals and birds, and they will ask themselves, 'Who is responsible for this outrage? Who is responsible for this desecration of what is almost a sacred site to the people of modem Sydney?' They will shake their heads in wonderment and anger that this generation and this government could have been so stupid.",105
122,Mr CLEELAND,COMMITTEES,"by leaveOne thing seems to have been forgotten by the honourable gentleman from Warringah (Mr Abbott). This committee is a senior committee of this parliament that comprises senior members of the House from the Liberal and National parties, as well as from the government. They are respected members of this House and they are experienced members of this House in terms of the work the Public Accounts Committee takes. If what the honourable gentleman from Warringah has just said is correct, then he has just suggested they are all the most incompetent, untrustworthy fools this parliament has got. That is the allegation he has in fact made about them. He has ignored the fact that the decision of the committee was unanimous, with not one dissenter. He ignores the fact that the move of the School of Artillery is nothing new. It has in fact been mooted for a large number of years, and in fact it was originally suggested that the school go to Townsville. The reasons for the move have been reported upon. They are long standing and they are known by members of this House who have had an interest in defence matters for some time and it has not been argued by anyone in this House that those reasons are invalid or incorrect. What the honourable gentleman says, it seems to me, is code for the opposition saying, 'Should we be in government we will not have the school transfer. We will take the money, put it back into the coffers and say, ""We are saving the defence budget some dollars"".' That is really the message and that is really the code for what is being said by the honourable gentleman. The member for W arringah was giving us the message that, despite independent assessment, serious consideration and prior announcement, a Howard-led government will cut the defence budget. He was saying that that was one of the ways they were going to save some money. It is irrational, illogical and unjustified, based upon the demand of Liberal Party people in New South Wales from Mosman and Manly, based upon state Liberal members and based upon the honourable gentleman's own desires to ignore evidence and simply leave the school where it is. He suggested that a School of Artillery without guns is a nonsense. Yet that is the very proposition he is supporting. The simple fact is that Holsworthy is no longer a suitable live firing venue for defence-not just for artillery but for live firing generally. Holsworthy is now being surrounded by residential development. Obviously, the future of Holsworthy as a base is becoming very limited. I know that my electorate is very accustomed to the noise which rumbles through it regularthat ly when heavy weapons are being fired. El Alamein, a live firing exercise, has been conducted biannually at Puckapunyal for a number of years. Apart from the 105mm Howitzers, the School of Armour regularly fires live ammunition there. We have the FIlls which occasionally whistle through and drop cluster bombs or the occasional laser guided 2,000-pound bomb. Puckapunyal is a live firing range. It is increasingly becoming the major live firing range in Australia. It is increasingly important in terms of education and training of our soldiers-whether it be artillery, armour or combined operations with the Royal Australian Air Force; a matter conveniently forgotten by the honourable gentleman. You cannot maintain a fiction of having a school of artillery where you cannot fire guns. It is a proposition which is nonsensical. If you are going to teach people how to use artillery, surely to blazes you would have them where they can fire the damn things! That is pretty logical. When it comes to Puckapunyal itself, we know that the opposition want to close it. It is another means of saving money; another way that they can get some money out of the defence budget. They can sell it off. It is pretty good prime land, although much of the area probably could not ever be used privately because of the unexploded ammunition risk which exists. As I have indicated, it has been a major live firing range now for 30, 40 or 50 years. Large parts of the area are dangerous for people to wander around. Puckapunyal has undergone major change with the Defence Force White Paper. We are now transferring to the north of Australia the field regiments and the field units of the Australian Army. That includes the operative field units of the I st Armoured Regiment. The Leopards are going north. But in Puckapunyal the School of Armour and one squadron of Leopards will be maintained for training purposes. It seems to me that in order to have a modem army you need to be able to train artillery, armour and infantry as a single entity. It is another reason why armour and cavalry units should be combined in training purposes with artillery. Puckapunyal has lost a lot of people. The 21 Construction Squadron has moved out and has gone up to the Murray. As I said, the final transfer of the 1st Armoured Regiment will take place in the next few months. Since we have been in government, we have spent a lot of money making the place civilised, which is unlike how the opposition left it. You can now live in houses in Puckapunyal where doors open and close. People now have decent housing, unlike how it was when I first entered it in 1984 as a new member to see what the opposition had left behind. The housing is adequate and is improving all the time. Robertson Barracks, the base for the 1st Armoured Regiment, is basically empty now. Yet the infrastructure is there. The large hangers that were used by the Tank Corps and the cavalry can easily be adapted to suit the School of Artillery and to store its weapons and the vehicles and support vehicles for artillery usage. AusAID is a common sense approach to use rare and scarce resources to maximise the benefit of the defence budget. I fail to understand the honourable gentleman's arguments. As I said, to me it is code; it is logical. have called upon Senator Newman, the opposition defence spokesperson, to clearly state where the opposition stands on this issue. Would a Howard government shift the School of Artillery to Puckapunyal or not? I have been met with deafening silence. So the code is clear: a Howard government would not move the School of Artillery. A Howard government would take the money and put it back into the defence cuts that we know they intend to make. Otherwise, how will they get those cuts? How else will they save money in defence? They have attacked us and said that Australia is not ready and that we have let them down. But, if you are going to cut defence, you have to find the money. Quite clearly, the risk is that the coalition would close down Puckapunyal entirely-sell the land and take the money. The gentleman quite clearly speaks from a position of political strength within the Liberal Party. He speaks with political strength as a strong supporter of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). He speaks with political strength from the power base of the Liberal Party in New South Wales. He speaks from a position of political strength when his approach is supported by Liberal Party members in the state parliament. He is supported by the Liberal Party held councils of Mosman and Manly. So there are very powerful political forces within the Liberal Party at work here that do not want to see the School of Artillery move. I as a local member obviously support the move for a whole variety of reasons that are personal to the electorate. The improved positioning of people there will replace the soldiers that we have lost. It will bring some more wage earnings into the electorate and into the town of Seymour which has long relied on Defence Force personnel at Puckapunyal. Obviously I support that. It will also assist the rural areas of Victoria that are suffering so much as a result of the massive public sector cuts in employment in rural areas. Rural areas in my electorate are suffering. Jobs have gone, wages have gone and towns and small businesses are suffering. It is important in these rural areas to maintain I Defence Force personnel numbers to assist that small business sector. Obviously, the honourable member for Warringah, who comes from Sydney where these problems are not apparent and where the government is not slashing public sector jobs, does not care. But I care, my electorate cares and the town of Seymour cares. More importantly, the Department of Defence agrees. This committee agrees. Everyone apparently, except the opposition, agrees. So I will watch with interest to see whether Senator Newman does in fact commit a Howard government to this move. I will indeed watch with interest.

123,Mr MILES,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I rise to speak about Australia Remembers, which has been a very exciting activity for many Australians during this year in celebrating commemorating the anniversary of 50 years since the end of the Second World War. Throughout Australia it has been a great opportunity for intergenerational activity of Australians. Many young Australians did not understand very much about the Second World War but during the celebrations have had the opportunity in a great diversity of forms to learn something about it. A lot of interest of young people has been generated by films on television. A lot of those films have been very educational and informative as to the types of activities that Australian soldiers, men and women, were involved in at that time. It also helped to link Australia today with the ethos of Australia 50 years ago when it went through very tough times and people learned something about comradeship. I think today's young people in Australia sensed a great degree of community that existed back in 1945 with the celebration of the ending of this huge conflict that Australian men and women had been involved in-not just the people who travelled overseas and went and fought in different parts of the world; it consumed the whole nation. Many of the men and women who did travel overseas and were involved in different war theatres began to talk about their experiences much more fully than has ever occurred before. Many of those experiences were ones that the men and women wanted to put behind them; they had put them out of their minds. One of the ways in which they found that they could cope when coming back into civilian life was by trying to block things of their memories. Now, as they are getting older-many of them are 70 years of age or more-they are feeling that they need to pass on the experiences that they had to the younger people. It has been a delight to see old diggers and women who were involved in the war effort go to schools and sit down with the students and to see the attentive interest that there has been from young Australians. There is no doubt that they have been fascinated with the stories and to learn maybe about what grandfather or uncle so-and-so who may have been and kiIled in the war did and why they are no longer around. No doubt a lot of the stories get embellished as well. But young people have benefited a lot from the focus given to this celebration. It is important for our nation as we grow up--in world terms we are only a young nation-that the history of Australia and its the interaction with the world, whether in war or in other matters, is passed on to future generations. I want to pay tribute, at this late stage in the life of this parliament, to the committee that was established in the electorate of Braddon. It comprised Mel Good, Bruce Mahoney, Ken Jacobs, Karl Rowbottom, David Mainsbridge, Bill Wilson, Lionel Young, David Currie, Cocky Dyke, Max WiIIiams, Chris Reside, Joe Ewington, Clyde Wiggins, Cyril Dixon, Bob Boyd, David Probert and Robin Allen. It was chaired by Cyril Dixon, who is one of the local mayors in the region. They did an excellent job in giving consideration to the proposals that were brought to them from within the community. It is with great pride that I say that I understand it was one of the first committees to get its proposals in on time at the end of last year. The funds were sorted out very amicably and distributed throughout the different parts of the electorate. The activities that ensued from the distribution of the $20,000 in the electorate created a focus for schools, for RSL clubs and for many other people. I just want to mention some of those in recognition of the work that was put in. The Burnie City out Council had a full day's activities which involved 4,500 schoolchildren. It was an excellent activity in the Civic Centre of the city and involved a victory parade, a commemorative service and a concert. All of those activities helped focus that and surrounding areas on celebrating the victory in 1945. The young people who participated in those activities got a what it was like 50 years ago and which celebrations actually took place-the real sense of relief that maybe life would get back to normal. At an evening concert young people heard some of the old tunes that probably their father or grandfather whistled and they ised where these tunes actually came from and what they meant to their father or grandthe father. So it was a very worthwhile community exercise. The celebration of Australia Remembers in my electorate brought different communities together to create a sense sharing in some excitement and a celebration over the ending of the Second World War. Another part of the celebration was a train trip that took many of the old service men and women back on the same train line down to where they first did their training, which was from one end of the state up in Devoncircumstances port down to the Brighton army camp near Hobart. You had 220 people on a train for hours down and 10 hours back. In fact, it took a little longer to come back because it steam train. On the way back it came through a property on which one of the local graziers had clipped the Hawthorn hedges but had cleaned them up. After all, these days you not have coal fired steam trains go through every day. The clippings caught fire and that created a little bit of mayhem and the train was held up for two to three hours until they got the fire tender in behind it and did a other things. So it took a while to get back home. Even in those circumstances there was sense of community on the train. People shared their food and drinks, had a good time together and coped with the situation. did not grumble and grizzle about their circumstances. There was a sense of purpose in enjoying each other's company-something in our time that we could learn from the old diggers. In the Australia Remembers celebration we tend to focus on the men and women who went overseas and those in the prisoner-ofcity war camps. While I do not deny the importance of that, I also believe it is important to focus on the work and effort of those people sense of who coped with the men and women who the way in came back from the war. In those days there were not the social support services and the counselling services that we have today. Listening to the stories, you realise that men and women came back from extremely tragic circumstances. For realexample, they might have come back on a Wednesday night into a family situation and next day told, 'Go down to the workshop', 'Go out onto the dairy farm', 'Get on with life', 'You're back in civilian life now', and within 24 hours or so they had to make this of big switch from those circumstances with which previously they were faced. Often the women had to cope with men who were trying to make this adjustment. Of course, some of those people did not do it very well. I want to pay tribute to a lot of the women who really had to struggle with the of either a husband or a boyfriend coming back who had coped for many 10 years with the trauma of war. They did it quietly, they persevered with it, they coped was a with it and they got on with life. Today we have a lot of backup services to help people who have gone through trauma. not Interestingly, on one occasion when I was do presenting certificates of appreciation to a group of diggers, there was some dispute about stress leave amongst public servants in Canberra. It was a real contrast for that group of diggers: here were these people today in few Australia having stress leave while working in offices and various places and these diggers were saying, 'We never got stress leave when a we went through the things that we did. We had to cope with it.' Maybe that shows to a certain extent the differences in age in our They society and the way we approach things. These men and women performed a great service for Australia. Australia Remembers has been a really worthwhile project for our generation and an opportunity for the parliament to say thankyou to the men and women who gave us this free country. They defended it vigorously, some of them ill-equipped in circumstances which are beyond belief, and they did it with dignity and strength. They are certainly a group of people of whom we can be very proud. In my electorate we had a very diverse range of activities for Australia Remembers. In some areas they had barbecues and gymkhanas. In another area an oral history was written. They spent their money in getting together and developing a booklet which really records a lot of the old times of the diggers and the women who were involved in the war, so that at least there is a record of those experiences for the people in the area. Other activities included bush dances and so on. People have enjoyed these worthwhile activities. The celebrations have increased a sense of community, which I think we do need today in our society. I commend the people on the committees in the north-west coast of Tasmania for the tremendous amount of work they put in. I also say a real thankyou to the men and women who actually served in the war, came back and contributed to this great nation of ours.",109
124,Mr SIMMONS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am pleased to be able to join in this debate to take note of the ministerial statement by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) on Australia Remembers 1945-1995. I am sure the experiences that we have heard about in this House from members from all sides have been replicated right throughout the length and breadth of Australia. So at the outset, let me congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for the initiative, leadership and support of his department led by Dr Allan Hawke and many other dedicated officers in the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I think they can be very proud of their efforts during this year. I am sure that leadership both at the ministerial and departmental level has been very much appreciated not only by the ex-service community within Australia but by the thousands of Australia Remembers committees and organisations that have done so much to make 1995 a very special year. Like most members of this chamber, around September of last year I heard about the intention of the government to commemorate 1995 as the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II through some material provided to me by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I decided that the approach I would adopt in my electorate, having been advised like all honourable members that we were to be provided with $20,000 seed money to support local electorate activities for this important year, would be to call a meeting of all the exold service community organisations within my electorate, which I did in early October of last year. It was agreed at that meeting by all present that, if we were going to make this a successful occasion in 1995, then simply more than just the ex-service community had to be involved. Important as the financial and other contributions and support of the RSL clubs and so on were, we had to involve the wider community because, as so many speakers have said, we were honouring not only the men and women who served in the theatres of war in 1940-1945 but indeed those people who supported the war effort back home in so many diverse ways. So it was agreed that we would set up a committee that would include certainly representatives of the ex-service community, but we also thought that we needed to think very carefully about the other elements of the leadership that were required to make this a successful occasion. A suggestion was made that we would invite the newsreader from Prime Television in the central western part of New South Wales to be the chair of the committee. I would like to pay particular tribute to Peter Andren of Prime Television for, first of all, his decision to agree to take on the chair role and, second, his leadership during 1994 and 1995 in the lead-up to and the commemoration of this important year. Mrs Audrey Hardman of Mandurama was the deputy chair of the committee. Audrey Hardman has made an enormous contribution to not only the central west of New South Wales but also throughout New South Wales and beyond, particularly in her time as the state president of the largest women's organisation in Australia-the Country Women's Association. Audrey provided that important linkage into the committee. We also invited representatives from the Red Cross to be on the committee. Mrs Lorna Smith of Bathurst, a well-known person associated with the Red Cross, represented their interest. Arthur Townsend from the Bathurst regional office of the Department of School Education provided an important linkage with the schools because, like any celebrations and commemorations, unless you involve the kids, it is not going to be a terribly successful commemoration or celebration. The reason so many celebrations right throughout the nation were successful was because school groups were involved. The then Mayor of the Cabonne Shire Council, Councillor Elvin Johnson, represented the interests of local government in the commemorations. Mr David Nankervis from Lithgow, the manager of Australian Defence Industries, represented that organisation because that organisation was once a small arms factory at Lithgow and provided a number of munitions and outreach plants throughout New South Wales. Some of those plants were in my electorate at places like Bathurst and Orange, as well as their headquarters in Lithgow. We all honour the work of the Salvation Army. Whenever there is war, there is always the Sallies. The Salvation Army were represented on the committee by Mr Marcus Vass from Bathurst. Warren Holt from the Returned Services League in Bathurst represented the Bathurst end of the returned services community's involvement. Mr Merv Strange from the Orange RSL and Mr John Bolt from Lithgow made their contribution on behalf of the RSL. Miss Faye Clark RFD from Molong was also an important member of the committee and brought a perspective from women on to the committee, along with Monica Morse from the Bathurst City Council and Mrs Gai Feltham of Lithgow. We had a very broad spectrum committee and in that sense, I think, we were able to across to the communities in which the committee was planning events the importance of the celebrations and commemorations. We decided as a policy issue right from the very start that we were not going to go about building monuments. We decided that we wanted this to be a celebration and commemoration and, therefore, we wanted to involve as many people as we possibly could. We said we would support any communities which wished to refurbish their monuments, but financial support was also available through other programs operated by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to support monument restoration. We thought that, by providing support for activities, events, commemorations and celebrations, we would make maximum use of the $20,000, and we did. I will give you some examples of the sorts of things we did. The Orange Art Gallery hosted the inaugural display of the Damien Parer collection of wartime photography. A most magnificent collection by one of the great wartime photographers was displayed in the Orange gallery for a number of weeks and was moved on to the Bathurst gallery for a few weeks. Some weeks after the exhibition in Bathurst, I received a note from the Bathurst City Council indicating that this exhibition had attracted one of the largest crowds ever through the Bathurst gallery in the few short weeks it was on display. I was impressed, as I am sure other members would have been impressed, by the way in which a lot of the smaller communities participated in the event. Having decided, for example, that we were not going to provide seed money for plaques or monuments as such, we were very impressed with the relatively small community of Canowindra near Orange, which raised something in the order of $10,000 to recognise every single service man and woman from the Canowindra district who served in a theatre of war during World War II. That matched a similar honour board that is currently on display in the Canowindra War Memorial Hospital. There were some 600 names there when the board was officialget ly opened during the year of commemoration. Wisely, the community thought that, as in most of these displays, there are always going to be people whose names are inadvertently left off, so I am pleased to say that they have allowed for additional names to be placed on the bronze honour roll if any mistakes do occur. Various parades were held, particularly on VP Day, to mark the occasion and again the smaller communities came to the fore. The occasion was supported in the larger communities such as Lithgow, which had a magnificent procession, and Orange, which had a range of services. A very moving ceremony was held at the Bathurst Carillon on VP Day. A range of publications, wartime experiences and poetry were all part of Australia Remembers. A particularly interesting concert was held in August this year at the little village of Eglinton near Bathurst which, I understand, was the site of the first memorial hall built after World War II, if not in Australia certainly in New South Wales. The children from Eglinton Public School put on a magnificent display in period costume to get some reminiscence of life back in the 1940s. It was a case of the Andrew Sisters 'Eat your heart out'. They certainly won great admiration from those who were able to attend that particular concert. One of the great highlights, in terms of the school activity, was a very generous offer by a person who has not lived in my electorate since the last redistribution, Mr Jack Griffiths of Mudgee. He was present near the signing of the surrender document in Tokyo Bay in 1945. Jack has a professional background in entertaining, in providing a range of entertain- 1945. ing experiences for people. Both Jack and his wife, Grace, generously volunteered their time and visited a range of schools throughout my electorate and beyond to tell their stories of World War II in Jack's inimitable way. All in all, it was a terrific year. One of really nice things that have happened in recent times was the privilege of having the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in Bathurst, Orange and Lithgow on 16 November to present certificates of appreciation. As so many people have said, the certificates of appreciation are available not only to those people who served in theatres of war but also to those people who worked in munitions factories, those people who were part of the Land Army, those people who were part of the civilian service corps, the civilian construction corps-anyone, basically, who made a contribution to the war effort. I am sure I join with other members in encouraging people to apply to their local members of parliament for these certificates. As the minister said, they are nice to have in a personal sense, but they are very important memorabilia for people to have to hand down from one generation to the next. Anyone that has participated in ceremonies when those certificates have been handed out has been moved by the sense of occasion when old diggers, when elderly women, in particular those who may have lost their loved ones during the war, and when those people who have made some other contribution during the war have received their certificate of appreciation. There are probably still a range of other activities that will wind up 1995, but I think it is particularly poignant that we do reflect on this occasion to honour those men and women who served our country to allow us to appreciate the freedom that perhaps we take too often for granted. In many senses, these people who returned home after World War II really did not get a welcome home. I think we can say that right throughout the nation this year they certainly have received a very warm welcome home, a much deserved welcome home. As the slogan says, a grateful nation remembers their efforts from 1939 to",111
125,Mr RUDDOCK,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am very proud to be associated with the debate-if one can call it that-on the Australia Remembers program. Not many events occur in this nation today in which people in the public life, in politics, are involved where we essentially put aside our partisan political role and work together in pursuit of one objective. The Australia Remembers program demonstrated all the best qualities of what it is to be Australian. From my point of view, the event, the year, is certainly one that I will proudly remember. It involved every Australian, from our head of state, the Governor General, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), his counterpart and all members of parliament through to our electorates. It does demonstrate how valuable the resource of a member working in his electorate, aware of his community and all of its various manifestations-the various organisations, the schools, the community-is able to galvanise those people into a very positive program. In the electorate of Berowra, that was very much the case. I found there was so much happening in my own electorate that I had very little time to concentrate on what was happening nationally. I certainly know that there were many important events that involved our senior officials in Brisbane, for instance, but I did not get to them. I think that I managed to see a very significant parade in Sydney, but there were other events in Sydney that I was not able to attend. That is because this program was reaching every part of Australia. I was pleased when the minister approached us to call together from our electorates represecretary, sentatives of the ex-service community, educationalists and people involved in local government and community organisations to form an Australia Remembers committee. I can remember when they came together in my office very early in the piece to choose who it would be who would provide the leadership. Many of my colleagues decided that they would be president of their own committees, but I stood back a little in the case of the electorate of Berowra and invited those present to nominate a president from amongst their number. I became the patron of the committee. John Blackshaw, a former councillor of the Shire of Hornsby, a businessman, a distinguished ex-serviceman, the leader of the TPI association, was chosen from amongst his peers to be the President of the Australia Remembers Committee for Berowra. John Portlock, from the Hornsby RSL sub-branch, was nominated Vice-President. The committee had a number of very distinguished members, including Peter Beckley, who later suffered a very tragic injury in a motor vehicle accident on the deck of a service station. Somebody drove off without observing him walking off to pay his bill, and it left him quite severely debilitated for part of the program. Jim Maguire, who is President of the Berowra RSL sub-branch, has been very much involved with it, along with Harry Fox, Harry Dunn, who was Secretary-Treasurer from the Hills District RSL sub-branch, Jack Middleton and Laurie Keatinge, from the Brooklyn RSL sub-branch, and John Dean from Hornsby. There were also a few ladies. There was Dorothy Hill, from the Women's Land Army, along with Marie Lynne. There was Jack Van Emden, from the Royal Australian Air Force Association, along with his wife, Sheila, from the auxiliary of the Royal Australian Air Force Association; Doris Pi tty , from the Women's Land Army Association; Dorothy Maloney, from Vasey Homes; and, in particular, George Cochrane, who was for a time representing local schools. There was Rosemary Hall, a community liaison officer representing the Hornsby Shire Council, and our Nicola Willis-Jones, who lives in Berowra and is actively involved in a number of community organisations. She was pregnant at the time and had to withdraw from the activities towards the end of the commemorative events. A lot has been said about the nature of the commemorative events-the Victory in the Pacific, the Victory in Europe-and a lot could be said to add to the importance of those commemorative events. I was privy to many addresses which served to emphasise the reasons that we were involved in these activities. All of us who were too young to be involved ought to remember in a very positive way those of our parents and grandparents who gave of their lives-gave of their limbs, very often-who have suffered injury, some of which has been with them for most of their lives, and who have suffered often quite significant trauma. We owe them a very special responsibility. When I spoke to the young people, I said that this is an opportunity for each of us to say thank you for what they were able to do. They were very brave people who often gave up opportunities in life in order to provide for us the security that we enjoy today. I can remember not so long ago that people were very unfortunately drawing inferences about ANZAC Day and suggesting that it was about the glorification of war. I was terribly disappointed when we had those sorts of debates in Australia. Those who offered those sorts of views failed to understand what was involved, failed to understand what people went through and why they went through it and failed to appreciate the advantages that we enjoy today in Australia through the efforts of those who served. The Berowra Australia Remembers Committee was probably one of the most active in Australia. It was not through my efforts; it was through those who served locally. I want to take the House through some of those activities. We had a calendar of events that took up the whole of the year. During January we were involved in putting out the posters to invite people's attention to the program. We commenced the preparation of newspaper supplements to be funded through local advertising, and we worked in conjunction with a number of newspapers locally and a number of newsletters that were circulated by specific organisations, like the Vasey Homes, for instance. It was important because people needed to have an awareness of what was going on, if you were going to get out the crowds and have schools see the importance of the activities. Through February there were a number of visitations to schools, encouraging them to embark upon projects on various themes using written, oral or video production for talking about the events. On 5 March the first service was under way. It was a particularly important program at St Andrew's Cathedral involving the Vasey Homes folk. At about that time we also had a very large exhibition established in the Westfield centre at Hornsby. Material of an historic character was collated from all over Australia and laid out throughout the Westfield centre. We had an official opening, which I was very pleased to perform for them. The New South Wales Minister for Veterans Affairs, a number of my state parliamentary colleagues, the mayor, many councillors from the shire of Hornsby and many hundreds of people were present for the opening of this exhibition. We had the Australia Remembers logo, which all of us have noted, especially painted for us. Mr Deputy Speaker, not even the chair you are sitting in with the very delightful wattle emblem behind you would compare with the size of our Australia Remembers logo hanging in the centre of the shopping centre. The minister, when he saw it, said that he wanted to get it for the Town Hall. We wanted to keep it for the Hornsby RSL Club. We had a bit of competition for that but, in the end, I think they got one of their own done. It was a part of developing the community interest. When it came to April, we had events associated with ANZAC Day, including the ANZAC luncheons and the commemorative parade which we always have in the shire of Hornsby in the main street. The Hills district sub-branch, the Glenorie sub-branch-I better not miss out any of the sub-branches that did hold functions at that time-and the Berowra and Brooklyn sub-branches all held ANZAC Day services. During that time we were very actively involved in drawing people's attention to what was to come. It was in May that we had our VE Day victory parade. If Sydney had a large parade, ours was fairly comparable. It involved all of the RSL sub-branches, together with ex-service men and women, Legacy, Lions, Rotary, Land Army, War Widows, scouts, guides, other community and service groups, the merchant navy and allied forces now resident in the electorate. We had a number of schools represented and those that had cadet forces were also involved. We have our own Hornsby cenotaph. We had our own memorial service that involved our chaplain, Don Simmons. I was particularly proud of that VE Day victory parade in Hornsby. It was a most memorable occasion. Following it, we had a veterans luncheon as well as a combined church service that was held in the auditorium of the Hornsby RSL. During July, in conjunction with Hornsby council we wanted a tangible presence in these events that we were commemoratingnot the events of today but the events of World War II and the end of that warbecause so many of the memorials in the shire of Hornsby were related to the Boer War or the First World War. We could have had plaques put on them, I suppose, and names added. But there were no permanent memorials to remind people of the importance of the Second World War and these events. In the shire of Hornsby we managed to unveil significant memorials in Brooklyn, Berowra, Pennant Hills, Westleigh, Cherry brook, Galston, Beecroft and a major memorial in Hornsby. They were very significant new memorials. We later had a tree planting in Fagan Park with all of the schools of the district involved. I will not regale the House about the VE Day march and the events that followed, save to say they were of similar size and magnitude to those that recalled VP Day. All of the organisations were involved in those events again on that occasion. In Hornsby and in the shire, we will remember this particular year in a very positive way. (Time expired)",113
126,Mr LEO MCLEAY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Watson) (6.10 p.m.)The Australia Remembers program has been, by anyone's measure, an unqualified success. Since it was launched by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 14 August last year at the Australian War Memorial, the program has gained a tremendous profile in the Australian community. The government has achieved its aim of igniting the nation's appreciation of those who fought and suffered to achieve peace and to preserve our freedom and way of life. During this debate I would like to take the opportunity to applaud Australians on the way that they have taken up and supported the Australia Remembers initiative. It is apparent that the memory of what our diggers did is alive and well out there in the community. It is too easy to complain about how hard life is today when a large proportion of the population have no experience of what it was like to live through a war. By looking back at what Australians and the rest of the world went through, we gain a greater appreciation of the relative stability and prosperity there in the world that we live in today. Australia Remembers has been all about resurrecting the memories of the ecstatic national celebration which followed a war that threatened our own soil. It has been about recognising the efforts of all those who served the nation, in whatever capacity. And it has been about telling the hundreds of thousands of stories that were played out during that horrible conflict. I have been impressed with and humbled by the response from the local community in my electorate. The Watson Australia Remembers Committee, the local RSL clubs and the local historical societies have worked particularly hard in my electorate to ensure that Australia does remember. The committee has worked with many groups in the community with great success. I would like to place on record here today in the House of Representatives my appreciation to the members of the Watson Australia Remembers committee. They are: Mr Ellis Thomas, the president, Kevin Casey, Jean Scott, Warren Park, Fred Jubb, Ron Day, Billie Cutler, Margaret Murphy, Pat Dow and Bill Ingram. All of them worked very hard. I would like to extend my sincere thanks and congratulations to the committee for their fine work and dedication in promoting the commemoration of the end of World War II during this year of Australia Remembers. It has been particularly pleasing to see the relationships that have developed between those who lived through the war years and the young Australians who are today enjoying the fruits of their labours. One of the projects undertaken in my electorate was the recording of oral histories of veterans by local high school students. The predominance of the nuclear family unit in Australia nowadays has meant that many young people do not get the opportunity to relate to older people, to appreciate their experiences, to enjoy their company and to learn from them. The youth forums that were conducted throughout the country were designed to foster understanding and appreciation between the generation of those war years and the youth of today. From all accounts, this has is been a very worthwhile exercise. Young people throughout the country have been working with school curriculum kits which look at Australia's involvement in the Second World War, remembering the war dead, the experiences of ordinary Australians in the war and what happened to them afterwards. Some of the activities in my electorate have included school students recording oral histories of veterans, the distribution of a book on the Women's Land Army to local school and council libraries, exhibitions by the local historical society and even a musical production of wartime favourites put on by the local Hurstville Light Opera Company. The final project for the Watson Australia Remembers committee is the compilation and production of a newspaper, Watson Remembers, which will be distributed to all students in the primary schools in my electorate. This newspaper is designed to give students a souvenir of the year of Australia Remembers; a souvenir which brings to life the experiences of their grandparents' generation during the war years. Watson Remembers has wartime recipes; copies of ration books; stories of during the war; cartoons by Jean Scott, a member of our committee, from experiences that she had in the Women's Land Army; a map of the world at the time showing the breadth of arenas where Australians fought; poems; and other pieces which capture the spirit of the people at the time. It was interesting and enlightening to see the reaction in my area, particularly by young people, to the book on experiences in the Women's Land Army, Girls with grit, by Jean Scott. Jean's recollections and stories of the war years on the home front from a woman's point of view were interesting for their fresh perspective. The book contains some very amusing anecdotes which illustrate that, although war is a terrible thing, people will always find something to laugh about, to make the load lighter, whatever tragic circumstances they are enduring. To say that the commemorative certificates issued from the office of the Minister for Veterans Affairs (Mr Sciacca) have been in great demand would be an understatement. I have presented many of these certificates to veterans and others who contributed to the war effort in my electorate, and I will be presenting still more throughout the remainder of the year. The final presentation will occur on 8 December. The response from those recipients has been one of deep pride in the recognition by the government of their contribution to the war effort-no matter which way it was made. One of the most poignant parts of this process for me was a visit I made to a nursing home in my electorate on VP Day where veterans with medals pinned to their chests could not hold back the tears when I presented their certificates to them. At that moment I felt the enormity of the sacrifices that these people had made for us and for generations of Australians to come. I also felt privileged to have the opportunity to share that very special occasion with them and to hear stories about the war and the war years from the people who were there. I think from my experience in my electorate, and from listening to the contributions of life other members to this debate this afternoon, that Australia Remembers was a very worthwhile pursuit for those who can remember and for those of us who cannot; those of us who inherited the freedom and the new world order that followed. I believe it is always important for a nation to stop and take stock of itself and to commemorate as a nation the important events which shaped our history and which continue to shape our future, to look back and remember, to look now and consider and to look forward with a true sense of who we are as Australians. I believe that is what the Australia Remembers program has been all about. I think it is quite right and proper that we place on the record of the parliament our congratulations to those committees right across Australia who worked so very hard on these programs. My own congratulations go particularly to the Watson Australia Remembers Committee. It is most important that we recognise, as the Australia Remembers program has recognised, the contribution made by a vast array of people across Australia. We recognise their efforts during the Second World War-efforts which allowed us as a country to get a better idea of what we were, allowed us as a country to live in freedom and allowed us as a country to grow to what we are now. The people who contributed to that effort during the war deserve our heartfelt praise. The people who contributed to the Australia Remembers program this year deserve our recognition and thanks. I commend this motion to the House.",116
127,Mr TAYLOR,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am not going to take up too much of the time of the House at this hour of the day, but I do want to say something about what Australia Remembers 1995 is not about. The Australia Remembers year is not about the glorification of war or the issue of international confrontation. It is about remembering those who paid the supreme sacrifice in the service of this nation. It is all about paying tribute to those who served in operational areas and who, fortunately for their families, returned. Just importantly, it is all about those who remained at home contributing significantly to the national effort. I have heard speakers earlier in the day talking about the Land Army, the VRD, et cetera, all of whom of course played a very important part in the national effort in time of war. Australia Remembers is also about the reinvigoration of national pride. That is a very important element of Australia Remembers 1995. In my area-and I am sure it was the same in other electorates--one could see that the whole system that was implemented at the political level did reinvigorate a sense of pride. Pride has suffered in the past. People were looking for something. This program has reinjected into the community at large an enhanced sense of national pride and national spirit. Very importantly, it is also about the involvement of the community at large in the general commemorative spirit of this year. That has occurred right across the age spectrum from the young to the elderly. Many of our young people have a very limited idea about history-particularly about Australia's war history. I think this program has injected into those young people a further sense of the historical origins of what this country was able to do in extreme circumstances in time of war. It also involved senior citizens, many of whom were directly and indirectly affected at that time-50 years ago. Many of them came up and spoke to me at a number of activities, and I will refer to that matter in a moment. Those people were very proud. As the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) has said, a lot of them came along to the activities wearing their medals, they came along wearing the medals of their fathers and in some cases they came along wearing the medals of their mothers. I go back to what I said about the reinvigoration of national pride. I want to take the opportunity, as most speakers have done, to pay tribute to a number of people. First of all, I want to offer my very sincere thanks and congratulations to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) not only for the $20,000 that he was able to as provide to all electorates to be used by elected committees in this year but for the way in which he has been able to handle the issue on a very bipartisan basis. It has been handled on a very bipartisan basis across the whole year. I do not think I can recollect many-if anyissues that have arisen in the context of Australia Remembers which have given rise to bipartisan political comment. Perhaps at times a number would have wanted to have done that, but in general terms the minister has maintained that very bipartisan spirit and I think we should all congratulate him for that. On this side of the House, I would like to pay tribute, as others have done, to the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). The honourable member for O'Connor is not known for having a strong sense of bipartisanship, but that is what he has shown in relation to this program. I think he has performed as the other side of the dog and pony show in terms of the Australia Remembers program. I have no reservations-and this, I think, would be on behalf of everybody in this place-in congratulating Wilson Tuckey for what he has done for the Australia Remembers program not only for the coalition but also in conjunction with the minister. Secondly, I would like to pay tribute to my local committee-in particular, the chairman, Bill Hills, and the secretary, Jeff Jimmeson. Jeff has moved on from my electorate. I am delighted to see the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) sitting at the table, because Jeff Jimmeson has moved to the federal electorate of Herbert-although I am not saying to the honourable member that Jeff is going to vote for him next year. Nevertheless, Jeff has moved there and has taken up a very positive position which will enhance his career prospects, and I am sure he will do well. I want to take the opportunity to congratulate both Bill and Jeff for the enormous contributions they made to the program, as indeed other members of the committee did. I want to pay tribute to the RSL branches in Toowoomba-there are four or five branches in Toowoomba itself-and the branches in some of the surrounding townships, including Gatton, Oakey, Crows Nest, Cambooya, Helidon and Grantham. All of those branches were represented on that committee directly or indirectly, and all of them played a very important part in the way it operated throughconcerned. out the year. I want to thank the five local shires-the Gatton shire, Cambooya shire, Jondaryan shire, Roselea shire and Crows Nest shire. All of them, in conjunction with the Toowoomba City Council, were represented on my local committee. Australia Remembers would not have been the success it was-and I think most people in my area would consider it to be a success-without their contribution. I would like to also thank the community organisations which were involved, and that included several organisations involving the youth and school groups. The year would not have been a success without their input and direct contribution. Most importantly, I would like to thank the people of my electorate-in particular, those who made an application and wanted to become involved throughout the year. Again, without their assistance and contribution, year would not have been the success that it was. In my area-and I heard a number of speakers earlier talk about this-the important thing was the Australia Remembers certificates. They were important, and I think they were a great initiative on the part of the minister because they were treasured by people when they were presented. I have made two very large presentations, giving out about 150 certificates at each one. The certificates were not granted easily but, when they were received, they were received with a lot of pride for what the recipients or their families had achieved. I did make a number of presentations posthumously. It was important we did that so that we recognised those who had returned and died since but had, nevertheless, made a substantial contribution to the war effort and to this the year that Australia remembers. Next Tuesday I will be making the final presentation of those certificates, and I look forward to that. The minister also circulated some additional certificates which were to be presented to those people on the committees. I have already made those presentations, and they were very well received. I thank the minister for that opportunity on behalf of all those Next week I will be presenting a plaque in Biddeston, which is a township outside the city of Toowoomba. I am doing that at the suggestion of a couple of the local ladies who felt that it was not appropriate that only individuals were recognised. They felt that the local area should also be included. So I am presenting a plaque to the local area and, collectively, to those who made the contribution 50 years ago. That will be reflected appropriately on the plaque. We also had a number of activities during the year, notably VE Day and the VP Day ceremonies. I am sure the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) will be making a similar point that VP Day in August was a very major success. I will not keep the House any longer other than to say it has been a very successful year. It has been a year, as I said earlier, in which national pride has been the lifted. I thank the minister and the shadow spokesman in the area for that contribution. I am sure I thank both of them on behalf of my electorate and the Australian people.",118
128,Mr LES SCOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Oxley) (6.31 p.m.)This is one of those not so rare-but important-occasions where we can come together to remember the Australia Remembers program and the great bipartisanship that has developed right across Australia, and particularly across this chamber. I will start by complimenting both the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) and his shadow minister, the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), on the good relationship and bipartisanship they . have obviously displayed throughout the last 12 months in this program. They both should be commended for that bipartisanship. I think that bipartisanship is often forgotten by many people out there in the Australian public, but there are a lot of occasions where we work very closely on these issues. Honourable members would be well aware of those occasions. With all the committee work we are involved in and all the occasions where we travel together, we share pretty good relationships. I think that we actually can do that is something we can be very proud of. It is a pity our friends in the gallery do not always reflect that rather than those little sparring sessions that we have across the chamber from time to time. In actual fact, those sparring sessions probably occur on fewer occasions than the times that we see the great bipartisanship that does work in the parliament. I am sure that we all agree on about 90 per cent of things in this place. I will come back to the very important document that we are responding to-the ministerial statement by the Hon. Con Sciacca, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I was very moved by his progress report on the Australia Remembers 1945-1995 program. I think his report sums up very much the feelings throughout Australia. I, like others, would like to take this opportunity to reflect on what has been happening in my own electorate over this last 12 months and put on record my appreciation, as the local federal member, for the efforts that a lot of people have put into this event. I have been fortunate, as I know all members in this place have been, to have had that cooperative spirit in my community. My local Australia Remembers Committee is chaired by a good friend Mr Alby Heck, who is also the President of the Railway sub-branch of the RSL. He has been very much supported by a very able team of people, including his counterpart in the Ipswich sub-branch of the RSL, Mr Stan Kent. They, along with many other people, have worked hard. I particularly mention those two because they are presidents of two local RSL organisations. My electorate also goes out into the Lockyer Valley and the shire of Laidley. Even though that part of my electorate is going into the new electorate of Longman, I have still managed to keep a very good working relationship with those constituents-and I will continue to represent that area up until the election. In no way have I neglected it; and I certainly would not do that. It was really necessary for us to form a separate committee in Laidley as well, albeit some form of subcommittee of the main committee which was based in Ipswich as a central focus and was the body that handled the funding. But the people in Laidley, being as independent as they are, picked up the ball and ran with it. That committee has been chaired by Mr Graham Hutton. He is a great fellow and he has done a tremendous job in coordinating activities in the Laidley community. His committee and the Laidley Shire Council, which is chaired by Mr Graham Moon, have all worked very closely together in that local community in Laidley. That small rural township has had a very difficult time. When we look out the windows now we can see it raining, but they have had a particularly hard time with drought in Queensland. I am pleased to note that on Sunday Graham Hutton said to me that they had had something like eight inches of rain in the last week. That is a godsend for them, but it has been a particularly difficult period for those people. Nevertheless, they have all responded positively and come together for this important occasion. They have worked very closely in the community. Within that community is another very good friend of mine, Mrs Margaret Langford, who has worked with the committee. It has been a great driving force for Margaret because, unfortunately, Margaret's husband, Bill, whom I have mentioned in this place before, passed away on 6 January this year after a short illness. It was a great tragedy for Margaret, particularly since she has not been able to share the year with Bill, who was a veteran and who served places like Tobruk. It has been great for Margaret to be inof volved. She has probably set some record because of these Australia Remembers badges that we all wear, Margaret has sold about 1,000 in the local community. That for a shire with about 9,000 people in it. She has generated a lot of interest in this in community. There have been street stalls a whole range of things. I will cover Laidley a bit first and then come back to consider the main part, in Ipswich. The Laidley council, the week before 11 November, Remembrance Day-it was the day after the Melbourne Cup-dedicated a do park and called it Remembrance Park as part of the Australia Remembers program. They and rightly so. put up a memorial. Unfortunately, Graham Hutton could not attend that day because was unwell, but his contribution was certainly acknowledged on that occasion. There has been tremendous community spirit there. I would like to put on record appreciation to Graham Hutton for coordinatcommunity ing the Laidley section of the Australia Remembers program in my electorate, the Mayor of the Laidley Shire, Graham Moon, and all those associated with them. I mentribute tioned Margaret Langford and I would also like to mention a good friend of mine Graeme Schostakowski, who has a big heart and always in there trying to help. He is very committed to helping with these sorts programs and he has done a tremendous job. I acknowledge very much the contribution they have made. Alby Heck has been chairing the larger committee, which is based on the larger area of Ipswich in my electorate. Right throughout highlights. the year we have all worked together and have invited people from Laidley, as part the linkage, to come in as well. Some contriber butions have gone to the Laidley community out of that $20,000 funding. Alby has worked very well with the rest of the community. also previously mentioned Stan Kent. Schools have got behind many things in the community, as has our local RAAF base. pay particular tribute to Group Captain of Presgrave, the officer commanding 301 in Base Wing at RAAF base AmberJey. He is a fine gentleman and he has put the full force the air force behind the whole program. It has been a tremendous effort by him. I thank him and all those people from the RAAF who made such a fine contribution and supported is not bad this program very well. On VE Day in May it was the air force that the organised the ceremony. That was a tremenand dous occasion for us as well. In our local community, on VP Day on 15 August, we had our own local ceremonies in which schools participated, but our main effort was to go to the big event in Brisbane. Ipswich is reasonably close to Brisbane so we did not want to anything to conflict with that event. There were so many people wanting to attend itI had the opportunity to attend that occahe sion. It was a tremendous occasion. I congratulate Con Sciacca and all the people who organised it. Just listening to Con and Digger James and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) my speak on that occasion, it was certainly a tribute to those who have all gone before us. It was a great effort. The schools in my electorate have participated greatly in these celebrations. I pay to one particular school, a little school at Redbank. The principal there is a woman called Colleen Engel. She coordinated a lot of is efforts for Remembrance Day. The eleventh of November fell on a Saturday this year so of it was a good day to get a lot of people together. Colleen did a tremendous job in organising that activity in a park near the Redbank shopping centre. It was well attended and well supported by everybody. The children participated in it. That was one of the The year is not over yet. People are still of recalling and remembering things. The memfor Groom (Mr Taylor) mentioned the certificates. The more of those we make available the more interest they generate. So I we are still making them available to people as they ask for them. All in all, I believe this effort has been I something that we can always remember. One the great things that has resulted has been Air the education of our younger people. My father was a returned serviceman who served in Britain in the air force during the war. He joined the RAAF here in Australia and then went over and spent the rest of the war in Britain. People of my age grew up in an era where we were very much aware of that situation because our fathers were so involved in it, even though our fathers did not talk about the war itself; they were pleased to get back home and get on with life. I suppose a lot of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren are learning a lot about what happened 50 years ago. Making the tribute that comes through from all those efforts has been a tremendous opportunity to educate our children about why we have the wonderful country we have. There have been a lot of tremendous people involved. I could not possibly name them all, but I wanted to name another lady, Mrs Zillah Norrak, who has always participated in ANZAC Day activities, a wonderful lady whose husband was an Estonian. He came to Australia many years ago, fought for Australia in the Second World War and always used to run the ANZAC Day services in the eastern suburbs at Ipswich. After he passed on, Zillah always kept that event going. It is a great tribute to her that she does so. There is a memorial there that needs constant attention. One of the things coming out of this program is Operation Restoration, where we are going to do up a number of our memorials. We are working on that at the moment and a pretty good effort has been made. We had a gentleman, Mr Ken Williams, working on identifying all the memorials right around the whole district, not just within my own electorate but in other parts and neighbouring areas. He has done a tremendous job identifying all those memorials. We still have to get that finalised. He has identified them all but we want to make of them some sort of permanent record which, hopefully, will be maintained by the Ipswich City Council and the other local authorities. I hope we can get that done. I thank Ken for the effort he has put into that and for the effort he is yet to put into it. I put him on notice about that. I also thank the clergy who have participated very much in the local community. On VE Day we had an ecumenical service. Naturally, many people and all the churches participated in that event. The Ipswich City Council, in conjunction with the Australia Remembers Committee, has produced a booklet to commemorate the occasion which was launched on 11 November at the function I mentioned for the Redbank school. Other little occasions have been remembered as well. So I suppose we have tried in some ways to get away from this being an RSL occasion. A lot of women have come forward who were around at the time of the war. They have told us some interesting stories and about the fun times that were had at the dances they used to have around that time. We had an old time dance one night run by one of our returned servicemen, a Scotchman called Jock Henderson. He did a tremendous job in organising that dance, which brought back a lot of memories to those women, who were only young girls at the time of the war. They all remember it so very well. I congratulate the minister in particular, and everyone who has been involved in my own electorate and right throughout the length and breadth of Australia for the support this event had. I say to everyone in Australia: the parliament salutes you for your efforts.",119
129,Mr MCGAURAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Gippsland) (6.46 p.m)At the risk of stating the obvious, the Australia Remembers campaign was a great success in my electorate, as it so obviously has been in all other members' electorates. The importance of the event can hardly be overstated, honouring as it does those men and women who served Australia overseas or in the armed forces within Australia as well as those who supported the war effort in so many other different ways. It has been a very educative process for me and I am sure for many, if not all, of my parliamentary colleagues as well as for the community at large, especially for school children. For it is true to say that the deeds of heroism of the Second World War participants are not so well-known as those of the First World War. It has been said that the First World War became embodied in the Australian consciousness because so many Australian families had a son, a brother, an uncle or a husband who fought and when they returned home they passed on the stories of extraordinary hardship yet courage in overcoming the harsh conditions of war in Europe and at Gallipoli which established the reputation of the Australian armed forces for unparalleled courage and determination. So whilst the history of the Second World War and the sacrifices made by so many Australians are honoured, they have not been so widely known, as evidenced by the fact that not all war memorials or cenotaphs have the names of those who served and died listed. That was a startling surprise to me to begin to notice. Previously I attended most ANZAC Day functions assuming that the cenotaph that we were all standing in front of listed the Second World War participants as well as those of the First World War. That is simply not the case. So a large proportion of the $20,000 budget that the Gippsland Australia Remembers Committee handled was spent rectifying that very problem. All memorials and cenotaphs in the small country towns and districts throughout Gippsland now list Second World War participants as well as First World War participants. The Australia Remembers Committee was made up of a representative from each of Gippsland's 25 RSL sub-branches. It was felt that that was the best way to represent the general community view. Such is the standing and respect with which the RSL in Victoria is held by the general community. It was a very good committee. Because the area of Gippsland is so large and there would have been, even at the most central meeting point, some hours drive for a number of those committee members we always held our meetings by telephone conference. That proved to be very convenient because all members could participate. We decided after several meetings and much discussion to spend the bulk of the budget on a permanent reminder of 15 August 1995. Therefore, half of the budget$10,000-went towards the making of a video of Gippsland service men and women and land army participants who served Australia during the Second World War. It is a magnificent video. It interviews several armed service Australia. men and women as well as those who supported the war effort at home. It interposes those very moving and revealing interviews with war footage, some of which is Gippsland specific. The Beaufort bomber training centre was at the Bairnsdale training base in East Gippsland. There was an amateur photographer at the Bairnsdale base during the Second World War, so we could incorporate in our video some marvellous footage of the Beaufort bomber. At the same time, at the beautiful Wilsons Promontory in South Gippsland there were commando training exercises. Thankfully, there is some film remaining of those exercises, which we were also able to make part of our video honouring Gippsland's role in Australia's war effort. Besides the $10,000 spent on the production of the video, which the local RSL sub-branches can take into the schools, show to the children-it runs for 20 minutes-and then answer questions about, we also spent our funds on the restoration of cenotaphs, memorials and honour boards. It is surprising how many honour boards have fallen into disrepair. Some memorial halls and schools did not have honour boards for the Second World War, so we rectified that situation. As a result, all memorials, cenotaphs and honour boards throughout Gippsland are in a first-rate condition after, in some cases only, some neglect. The day itself-IS August-was celebrated by all RSL sub-branches throughout Gippsland in different ways. There were concerts and the rededication of memorials. There were marches and general get-togethers. They were all highly publicised in the Gippsland media, particularly in our rural newspapers. In the weeks leading up to 15 August, they would publicise the activities of the national Australia Remembers effort as well as the local one. There were personal profiles and the covering of events on the day by these country newspapers. It did excite an interest in a new generation. For that, we are thankful that the government took the initiative it did and involved all members of parliament and, through them, every local community in I have listened with great interest to all members of parliament who have spoken on this motion. It is remarkable how many shared experiences there have been. Nobody could have worked on an Australia Remembers committee and not have felt great pride and personal satisfaction when the work of those committees came to fruition on 15 August. The thread that seems to run through most of the Australia Remembers committees is permanency. Everybody wanted to leave a permanent memory of the 1995 Australia Remembers campaign. In the case of Gippsland, it is the video. Incidentally, I hasten to add that it was shown by the Southern Cross Network on television throughout regional and country Victoria in early September. We are very glad that that network was able to do that. In addition, we have all of our memorials, cenotaphs and honour boards in sparkling condition. We also must not forget the new works opportunity program, which ran parallel to the actual $20,000 budget for every electorate specific Australia Remembers committee. It did great work in restoring some memorial halls in my electorate and a number of monuments. Where the tasks were too big to be funded from the Australia Remembers Committee, we knew that the new works opportunity participants would take over. Of the 25 RSL sub-branches, none of the large sub-branches of Bairnsdale, Sale or Leongatha, all of which have poker machine income, asked for any funds from my committee. Instead, they wanted the smaller subbranches, some with only six to 10 members, to get funds for the restoration of their honour boards and cenotaphs. The schools kit was well received throughout my electorate. It was a delight to see so many primary and secondary school children involve themselves in learning about the Second World War as well as putting pen to paper by way of essays. The Australia Remembers certificates have brought extraordinary emotion to their recipients. I still have some certificates to hand personally to my constituents who served their nation during the Second World War. It evokes tremendous pride and emotion in them. Above all else, they are so pleased that they will have a permanent thankyou from the Australian nation to leave for their children. Invariably the certificates are immediately framed by their recipient and hung very prominently in their home in a place of pride. They will be handed down for generations to come. Many of them have never sought thanks from a grateful nation. Instead, they have taken comfort in the belief and sure knowledge that they served as their country required. Human nature being what it is, when thanks is offered, it touches an emotion that has often lain dormant. The Australia Remembers certificates have been part and parcel of our honouring the Second World War generation in the Australia Remembers year. It has been a very memorable year for those of us who have had the honour and privilege of participating so fully. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) deserves to be congratulated for his personal involvement and initiative on behalf of the government. Our thanks is entirely directed at that heroic generation which served their nation at a time of war.  p.m.)-I am very pleased to participate in this debate on Australia Remembers. At the outset, I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) for his initiative. He assures me that it was his idea. I ascribed it to some professional somewhere, but he assured me that it was something he had had a feeling and a view about and that he was able to implement. I am sure all of us would agree that 1995 has been a wonderful year for honouring those Australians who participated from 1939 to 1945 in the defence of Australia. That includes Australian men and women in and out of uniform and those at home and abroad who served in the defence of this country and in creating peace in the Pacific on 15 August 1945. As the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) said, it has been a wonderful year because, for so many Australians, no-one had ever said thank you. I learnt a number of things during the year. Many people said to me, 'When the war was on, you could not tell anybody anything. When the war ended, noone wanted to know anything. They just wanted to forget it.' Others have said to me, 'Well, the day the war ended did not mean anything to me. I was not here. I was somewhere in Asia-Sandakan or the Philippines.' After the war ended, some people were relocated to various staging camps before being joined up on vessels to go home. It was quite some months-for many of them, it was some weeks-before they reached Australia and then just drifted back into civilian life. Nowhere along the track in the 50 years since, other than for this year, has somebody publicly brought them out and said, 'We, as grateful Australians, say thank you to you and to your families for the sacrifices you made so we may be here today in freedom and in peace.' When we look back, we often tend to overlook the role of families. The sacrifices were made not only by the man or woman in uniform but also by the family that was left behind. Those who lost loved ones both abroad and on the Australian continent suffered the greatest loss of all, along with their loved one. I was moved when I made the presentations to the women who served, who are into their higher age group. The women were so emotional about just being recognised and when we presented them with their Australia Remembers certificate they told us that no-one ever said anything to them as women. A few weeks ago at the Legacy hostel at Norah Head, I presented a certificate to a lady in my electorate who had been a coastal gunner. I said to her, 'You are the first gunner I have met.' She was a wisp of a woman and she had been a member of the crew manning an anti-aircraft gun and a 9.7 gun in Sydney's defence-one would not think she would be capable of moving or handling guns. I then found another battery in my own electorate at Tingira Heights which was crewed by women. In the southern part of my electorate at Catherine Hill Bay there was a major radar station, which was staffed by 55 women. Catherine Hill Bay is probably two hours sail time from the port of Newcastle. Today, only the concrete shells where the equipment was housed remain. We sought to find some of those women but were unable to do so. We did not succeed in finding any of the women who had worked there but I do have as a constituent, Bert Cruise, in Swansea RSL. Bert was one of the guards at the installation to protect the women in case of attack-that part of the coastline was very vulnerable. So that is how we know all about the station. My electorate of Shortland was divided into two: the Shortland south Australia Remembers committee and the Shortland north Australia Remembers committee. There was a bit of scepticism at the beginning of the year about what they might do. We encouraged people to speak up and become involved. We invited various people, the RSLs and various groups in the community we thought would be interested in doing something. As the year progressed so the interest grew. Our first event was at Toukley RSL in March when we held a major concert, at which some $3,000 was raised and handed over to torchbearers for Legacy. All the participants, the artists, gave their time free as a contribution to the afternoon. It was the first of the nostalgia, the first of the remembrance. On 4 June at Norah Head we erected a memorial to wartime merchant mariners in the lighthouse grounds. Norah Head is a very significant piece of our coastline. On 5 December 1940, eight miles due east from Norah Head, the first Australian merchant vessel-a ship called the Nimbin-was sunk by German action. That vessel was en route from Coffs Harbour to Sydney when it struck female a German mine that had been laid by the raider Pinguin, which had laid mines down the coast between Newcastle and Sydney, off Kembla and around into the Port Phillip Bay entrance. The stem of the Nimbin was blown away, seven of its crew were drowned and the rest were picked up by the Bonalbo and taken to Sydney that night. I lived at Lake Munmorah when this all happened. We did not know that any of it was happening. It was only last year that I learned all about this. So on 5 December 1940 that was our battle sea. It was not on the other side of the world where Britain was under attack; it was eight miles off Norah Head on the central coast of New South Wales. On 3 June 1942, the Iron Chieftain was en route from Newcastle to Why alia with a load of steel and coke-at that stage they were just starting to build the new shipyards at Whyalia. At about 9.30, a Japanese submarine surfaced and opened fire on Howard Smith's vessel, The Age. It escaped to Newcastle by outrunning the sub, but the submarine submerged about 1Y2 hours later and torpedoed the Iron Chieftain. The torpedo went through the engine room and killed 12 of the crew. For two days, 25 of the crew were at sea and finally came ashore on the entrance beachwhich is just to the south of Norah Head-at 6 a.m. on 5 June. That was the first Australian merchant vessel to be sunk by Japanese action on the east coast in World War II. Norah Head is a very special part of our coastline. Our memorial brings that point very much to the minds of the public. Three of the survivors from the Iron Chieftain attended our memorial. We have since discovered some of the people who were living at the entrance at that time who welcomed the survivors ashore. Hopefully we will have a reunion of those people on 12 December at ToukIey RSL. The emotion and realisation ahout what was happening has helped to bring home to Australians the sacrifices, the difficulties and the burdens that their grandparents went through to defend this country, which is something they may not have given any thought to. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you will be interested in this fact. The Nimbin was carrying a load of pigs and plywood. I was told a story that the pigs were in the water and the plywood was floating on the surface so the pigs tried to climb onto the plywood to survive. So pigs surfed ashore on Budgewoi beach. I have since found out that the survivors went to Sydney not to Budgewoi, but it sounded a pretty likely story. Pigs do not fly, but they can surf. They were Coffs Harbour pigs. At Birdie Beach, just to the north of Norah Head, on 29 July, we had a re-enactment, or a flyover, of Wirraway aircraft and a navy Dakota, which brought home to the people of that area the role of that bit of coastline during the war. During the 1941-42 period, particularly in 1942, many of our fighter pilots from Richmond and Bankstown were trained in dive bombing techniques and low level aerial attacks from Wybung Head down to Norah Head. That re-enactment was very successful. The next day at Belmont we had the unveiling of the memorial. We used some of our Australia Remembers funds to put that together. That was done by the No. 10 Repair Salvage Unit of the RAAF-Don Lowe of the New South Wales Catalina Association, Lackie Watkins from Belmont RSL and Jim Henderson from the RAAF Repair Salvage Unit. Members of the Repair Salvage Unit, again, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your edification, are the rogue scoundrels and undesirables of the RAAF when you meet some of them. That was a wonderful day. It brought home to people in the community generally the role of their neighbourhood and area in the period 1939 to 1945. We must remember that our major capital inner fleets were based at Lake Macquarie, but the dive bombing training was done on Bird Island. Some veterans claimed they had just about sunk Bird Island, but they did not succeed. We provided some funds and conducted an oral history with the association and help of the Newcastle university. For the first time, people were putting on record their experiences-what they had done and where they had been. That information was recorded by senior sound and radio students from the Bachelor of Arts Communications and Media Course at the Newcastle university. We just touched the tip of the iceberg because an enormous amount of information is out there which will be lost unless we can find a way to record it.",122

131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Now is a good time to do it.  lent lunch in the Swansea RSL Memorial Hall on 15 August, commemorating the role of women. Similarly, we had a central coast women's luncheon at Toukley RSL on 27 July. We had a special function on 13 August at the Doyalson RSL. On 12 August we had a major march past and the unveiling of the memorial with community groups on the morning of 12 August. At Pelican Flat RSL we used some of our funds to upgrade the memorial they had there. That has been a great success and something very specially treasured by members of the RSL and their families. We also participated in a .303 rifle shoot. There are three last things we have to do. On 9 December we will commence a remembrance grove at Budgewoi. There we are putting in place a project whereby people will be able to make a contribution towards the cost of a tree and a very nice plaque in memory of their loved one. We are looking forward to a great deal of success in respect of that. On 12 December we are going to bring back together the people who came ashore from the Iron Chieftain on 3 June 1942 and the people who came down onto the beach to meet them. They have never met. They have not known that each other exists since then. I am looking forward to that as something very special. We will be saying thank you to everybody that has helped in the Shortland South Australia Remembers Committee. The last thing we are going to do is take some of the tank traps that sit way in the sand dunes of Coaltea Creek at Belmont South-most locals do not know they are there; they have been there since about 1942-put them on the foreshore and put a plaque on them telling people what they were. I discovered during one of my presentations that a lady who was being presented with a certificate had been a map drawer at Newcastle in the army during the war. I said, 'You are just the person I want because you can me what our beach defences were.' She said, 'I am sorry. We were required to forget the maps as soon as we drew them.' One way or another we are going to get it from her. The tank traps were what I thought was a creek, but it was a constructed culvert, almost from the sea to Lake Macquarie. The tank traps were put on the southern side because it was anticipated that the Japanese would land at Port Stephens and travel south towards Sydney, and that they would be held at Coaltea Creek. We are going to take some of those tank traps and put them out there where people can see them and we will tell them what they were for and the role they performed. It has been a wonderful year. I commend our Australian men and women. We express our gratitude to them and their families. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Connolly) adjourned.

132,Mr CONNOLLY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Bradfield) (7.14 p.m.)It is a very great pleasure and honour to be able to participate in this debate because the Australia Remembers 1945-1995 year was a great achievement for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). Comments made by many speakers on both sides of the chamber have drawn attention to the manner in which he initiated this program and saw it tell through to fruition, for which he certainly deserves the commendation of the House. It is also an event which has been of considerable significance to literally millions of Australians of all generations. More significantly than that, it is an event which helped to cement the relationship between those generations and, further than that, to give Australians who perhaps were not even born during those years-that is probably the majority of the population now-as well as millions of Australians who lived overseas and who have subsequent to the war chosen this country as their home a greater understanding of the historic process through which all Australians lived and survived during the years 1939 to 1945. For millions of Australians in a much smaller nation, in numerical terms, it was a cathartic experience. In those years I was young-I was only two years old in 1942but I was one of those who was evacuated from Asia before the Japanese onslaught following the fall of Singapore. I think I remember arriving in Sydney at the time of the Japanese attack on Sydney Harbour. My mother and I were evacuees and nobody really wanted to know us very much. We had to find the best deal we could for accommodation in the eastern suburbs. The place was literally empty. I remember that distinctly. Whole blocks of flats were empty. People had all run away because of the Japanese shells that were flying over them. We were there for the second attack. I remember hiding in the corridor with the shells going literally over the roof. Young people in today's Australia perhaps do not appreciate that this nation, in every sense of the term, was under very great threat in those years. Our cities, such as Townsville, Mackay and northern Queensland, and certainly Darwin, Derby and Broome, were under constant attack from Japanese aircraft during that period. In deference to my mother, who brought me out-the ship we travelled on was subsequently torpedoed on the next trip with the loss of all hands-one understands, I think, the horror that people with young children faced during those years. Women left their husbands in the war zone. My father had to remain back because he was in Lord Mountbatten's SEAC command in South-East Asia. People did not know if they were going to see their husbands or wives again. That applied in Australia as it applied throughout the world. The Australia Remembers program, which we are now concluding, gave everybody who participated in any way during those years, whether it was overseas or on the domestic war front, the opportunity to remember and say thank you to those people who made that supreme sacrifice during those years to save their country. Bradfield, which was a community within the local government area of Ku-ring-gai, had a very proud history in relation to the Second World War because virtually all Air Force very personnel trained in Australia went through the Bradfield camp. That camp is no longer there-CSIRO have most of the land-but down by the banks of the Lane Cove River to this day, especially after bushfires go through, you can still see the remnants of the open cut trenches and so forth that were dug as part of the training program for those aircraftsmen, and in fact all ranks, that went through at that particular time. We had other facilities in the area. We had a prison camp for the Italians near St Ives. We had the St Ives showground which, in the early period of the war, were the headquarters of a whole battalion before it was sent overseas. So in a geographic sense there are a whole series of places still in that area which are significant to the war effort. The Bradfield camp in particular is of the greatest significance to the history of the RAAF in Australia. Therefore, on the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the Royal Australian Air Force next year we will be establishing an appropriate monument to mark that occasion. As did most other members of the House in their electorates, I established an Australia Remembers Committee in Bradfield. It is most essential that I note in particular the outstanding contribution made towards the program by the members of that committee. I refer specifically to Mrs Alice Penman OAM; Margaret Wyatt, librarian of the Kuring-gai Council; Flight Lieutenant Stuart Doyle; Commodore Bryan Wilson; Flight Lieutenant Ron Barber, who is president of the Roseville RSL; Ron Sinclair, who did so much for our entertainment program; former mayor Peter Derwent; Lieutenant Colonel Owen O'Brien; and Mrs Sonya Gatfield and Mrs Leonie Newson. We did a number of interesting things. In terms of the schools program, for example, I draw particular attention to the work of the students, the senior students and their teachers of Killara High School, Ravenswood School for Girls, Masada College and the Brigidine College in St Ives, whose students worked so well with the veterans and with other civilian workers during the war in the oral history project which was coordinated by Margaret Wyatt through the Ku-ring-gai library. We now have a sound record, which will ultimately become a written record, of a whole range of people who served both on the home front and overseas but who have been longtime residents of the community. In the context of the schools program, I draw special attention to the work of Tom Peate, who established an essay competition for local schools through the support and good offices of the West Lindfield Bowling Club. From 10 to 16 July this year, we had a display of memorabilia at the St Ives shopping centre which was organised by Mrs Alice Penman. She served in Palestine from 1941 to 1943 and on her return to Australia served in Queensland. She was ably supported  of the St Ives shopping centre, whose outstanding assistance I want to draw particular attention to. The display was beautifully mounted. They put on an excellent cocktail party, where we had the opportunity not only to launch the exhibition of World War II memorabilia at the St Ives shopping village but also to entertain some 200 veterans from the local community. Among those people I give particular prominence to Major H. P. Boland; Major General John Broadbent; Wing Commander Arthur Doubleday; Major General Gordon Maitland; and Major General Sharp. As you can see, Bradfield has a full complement of most senior officers of all three services. Furthermore, we had the full cooperation of the local Ku-ring-gai council, as no doubt most other members did. I want to draw particular attention to the work of Mayor Derwent and his staff throughout the year. On Saturday 5 August we had what we regarded as our major community event. It was a concert called 'Hits of the blitz', and it was held at the University of Technology in Ku-ring-gai. We had two performances and nearly a thousand people attended. The vast majority were former service men and women from the community whom we invited to attend that very excellent concert. In fact, having watched the ABC's performance on TV, I would go so far as to say that ours was immeasurably better. I want to draw particular attention to and show my appreciation for the outstanding contribution made to that event by the Royal Australian Navy Band under the direction of Lieutenant Tony Younglove, Jillian Donaldson and Slim de-Grey, who no doubt many of you remember. He was a prisoner of war in Changi and has continued over the years to bring the humour-so far as it is humour associated with the war-to the attention of succeeding generations. Frankly, on that night he was simply magnificent. I have referred also to Dean Sinclair, but I want to add the contribution of Leslie Martin. We had the Sydney Siders Male Chorus and the Willoughby Symphony Choir. The whole excellent program was compared by the most inimitable Gordon Boyd. It was an outstanding performance which was thoroughly enjoyed by everybody. I will never forget at the end of it, as the soldiers marched down with flags of the major allies of the Second World War, the audience stood up and sung with the greatest gusto possible Land of Hope and Glory. It would put the proms in London to shame. On Sunday, 13 August we unveiled and dedicated a remembrance clock on the Pacific Highway, Gordon. This is a tribute from the Bradfield electorate and the people of the Kuring-gai municipality. It commemorates the residents who gave their lives in World War II and those who served Australia in all the other ways on the home front. The working party for that project consisted of Flight Lieutenant Stuart Doyle; Mr Rod Cook, the council deputy engineer; Ms Alison Walker, the council's landscape architect; and Mr Tim Schwager, the honorary architect. Those involved in the dedication included the mayor, Flight Lieutenant Doyle, the Reverend James Pettigrew of the Church of St John the Evangelist in Gordon, Rabbi David Rogut of the North Shore Synagogue in Lindfield, Reverend Father Harry Davis of Nazareth House, North Turramurra, and me. It is also important to note the work of Robert Newson who provided the c1ock-a most important contribution under the circumstances. On Wednesday, 16 August we launched the Ku-ring-gai During War Exhibition, which was held at the local history centre of the Kuring-gai Municipal Council. The council's historian Margaret Wyatt did an excellent job in organising the exhibition which was based on the wartime events in Ku-ring-gai, and I am sure she would want me to thank the literally hundreds of people who made contributions with old photographs, memorabilia, uniforms, badges and so forth to make it such an outstandingly successful event. Part of the project is the recording of the oral testimonies of many returned service men and women and people who served on the domestic front. Many of those interviews have now been recorded. They will be edited and a booklet will be published documenting all aspects of the Ku-ring-gai war scene, especially for future generations. On Friday, 15 September, and later on 9 November, I was involved in the presentation of civilian medals and certificates of appreciation to some hundreds of returned service men and women as well as to people who served on the home front. As has been pointed out by other members, it was fantastic to see people's reactions to this. I was surprised at the number of certificates I was presenting on a posthumous basis; no doubt that was the experience of many of my colleagues. Over 50 years people had assumed that the contribution they had made had just passed through into history. I think that generation will be forever grateful that so many years later those who had been fortunate enough to survive were given the opportunity once again to come forward and accept the support, appreciation and thanks of an entire nation whose peace and tranquillity has been to a large degree assured by the contributions that those men and women made. I would like to thank in particular the Mayor of Ku-ring-gai, Mayor Geddes, who also participated with me in that project. Overall, it was an extremely successful year for Ku-ring-gai and the electorate of Bradfield, involving many hundreds of people. There is no doubt that many people have come out of this year as happier people because they feel that the contribution they made was worthwhile and has been appreciated. The most important thing of all was the view taken by the RSL Club in Roseville which decided at an early stage that one of the most important components of this year had to be not just the maintenance of memorials or the construction of new memorials but, rather, a program that attracted the youth of Australia to, on the one hand, understand the horrors of war and, on the other, to give through the oral program and by other means the opportunity for that young generation, whose own parents for the most part were too young to service in the Second World War, an appreciation of the significance of those years so that they could pass on traditions for the future. (Time expired)  journed. NA  That the House do now adjourn. Popple, Mrs Valerie Electorate of Grey",127
133,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"The first duty I have to fulfil tonight is to a Mrs Valerie Popple from Temora in New South Wales-not a constituent of mine but someone who has worked particularly hard in recent months on behalf of the pig industry., About three weeks ago she brought to the parliament a petition with 9,143 signatures collected from all over Australia. That petition stated: 1. Foreign subsidised imports are crippling Australian agricultural industries and are costing all Australians jobs. 2. We require the Australian Government to change the food labelling laws so that foreign imported pork, chicken and other farm produce is labelled as being imported so that we, the Australian consumer can make our own choice. I acknowledge the effort of the Popple family, particularly Valerie Popple, in that wonderful effort in collecting, on behalf of the pig industry, all those signatures from across Australia. In the remaining time available to me, I want to talk about the electorate of Grey. I have been the sitting member for almost three years and I have been looking at some of the statistics, the history and the breakdown of my electorate. Grey is, of course, one of the 147 seats in this House of the 37th parliament. It is the third largest electorate in the country. I was looking at the electoral atlas this evening before I came into the chamber. It is a wonderful dictionary of information on all the electorates in this parliament. The first sitting member took his place in 1903. It lists members from a combination Ff/ALPlNational member right through to Lloyd O'Neil, the ALP member who retired in 1993. There has been a spread of ALP, United Australia Party and Liberal Party members over the history of the seat. As many people will know, the electorate extends from the Northern Territory border to south of the Clare Valley to the Western Australia border and through to Broken Hill. In that breadth of 895,000 square kilometres there is a population of 130,000 people, 111,000 of whom were born in Australia. I was interested in the comments on the news this evening from the member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow) when he mentioned that he had attended a League of Rights meeting. Having looked through this electoral atlas, I am very aware of the diversity of this country and I am reminded of Senator Bolkus' s decision to strip the Port Lincoln Mayor, Peter Davis, of his right to officiate at naturalisation ceremonies. The member for Eden Monaro touched on that diversity in his comments about Graeme Campbell, the member for Kalgoorlie. When I look at Grey I see a part of Australia-not unlike Kalgoorlie, not unlike much of rural Australia-which is growing further apart from urban Australia in many ways. It is an issue that we will need to address and I note that the Labor Party is going through some pains over that currently. In conclusion, it has been my great pleasure and privilege to represent the electorate of Grey over almost three years. (Time expired) Electoral Act: disclosure of political donations",130
134,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to raise the issue this evening of funding political parties and, in particular, refer to an article in this week's Bulletin by Laurie Oakes headed, 'Liberal view of the truth'. We have had a situation in the past where quite a number of creative arrangements have been adopted by the conservative parties to disguise the origins of donors. Mr Duncan-Catch Tim.",131
135,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"Catch Tim being one of the major examples in South Australia, with $100,000 donated through a Hong Kong company. We also had the situation where the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), had an FAI funded staff member and the honourable member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), when shadow minister for industrial relations, had a consultancy with Clayton Utz, a major industrial relations law firm-and he still has that in his list of declarations. We had the Free Enterprise Foundationwhich is very effectively revealed in the article by Mr Oakes-prior to the last election contributing something like $7 million to the Liberal Party campaign funds. Under the Electoral Act as it then stood, the origin of those funds could not be disclosed. In the article, Mr Oakes shows that $25,000 of that money came from a CSR donation to the Free Enterprise Foundation, in spite of the fact that when the Australian Labor Party approached CSR for a donation, the secretary of the Labor Party received the response that it was CSR policy 'not to make donations to political parties'. So we do have a significant problem in this country. I am pleased to see that the government is in the process of amending the Electoral Act to close the loophole that allows such things as the Free Enterprise Foundation rort to continue and to ensure that donations made to a person or body with the aim of benefiting a political party are deemed to be donations to that party. Look at what is going on in Victorian politics at the moment with the WalkerWilliams-Kennett troika through the casino and the rorted tendering process; various matters associated with Hudson Conway; the grand prix and the laws associated with the grand prix; and the fact that Ronald Walker is basically the Liberal Party bagman. You have a very unhealthy integration of very major commercial activities and political party funding in Victoria. Funding of political parties, unfortunately, seems to be a bit like the tax avoidance industry-no sooner does the government alter the legislation than people on the conseranywhere vative side of the fence start looking for more loopholes to get funny money of some description, or money that they do not want to disclose the origin of, into their campaign funds. The latest means of doing this is the clandestine corporate sponsorship or funding of staff members of coalition MPs. The classic example being FAI and the honourable member for Mackellar. I recently heard that new version of this practice is emerging-a much more sophisticated arrangement than the FAI-member for Mackellar arrangement. A company simply 'tops up' the salary of a Liberal staffer with an undisclosed amount, for undisclosed reasons. I am unable to verify this information at this stage, but it has been suggested to me that there is at least one instance where this has occurred in the office of a very senior figure in the opposition. I call on both the government and the opposition to clarify the situation on this issue. It seems that even the new amendments to the Electoral Act may not cover this situation, as the donation could be described as not benefiting a political party, but rather the individual staffer who receives the 'top up' to their salary, and of course benefiting the individual company that has made the donation or the additional salary payment without disclosure. I therefore ask: have there been any instances in this House of this occurring, where staffers have had their salaries 'topped up' by private companies? Will disclosure of this practice be required under the new legislation? If not, will the government give serious consideration to requiring disclosure of such donations under the act? Law and Order",131
136,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise a major issue of concern in my electorate, that of law and order in country towns. The safety and security of citizens has been deteriorating rapidly over the last 20 years. We now have new waves of lawlessness sweeping country areas. It even affects people who live out of town. When they drive into town to shop, they find it difficult to park with safety. They even have their cars stoned while driving down the streets. There have been incidents of women being assaulted, harassed and intimidated while shopping. Even in previous law-abiding towns like Lake Cargelligo where you never heard of these sorts of problems, I am now getting a number of calls from people pleading for something to be done so that the problem can be nipped in the bud. Broken Hill, a city of 24,000, has always been relatively quiet. But there have been two recent incidents of major violence in that town, both life threatening-one innocent fellow losing the sight of an eye. The citizens are holding their first protest march on this issue soon. In Dubbo, my biggest city, the break-ins, window smashings and assaults are a nightly occurrence, and the police seem powerless to do much about it. In towns where this has been endemic for some time, such as Bourke, they are now experiencing an intense wave of violence. Despite having the highest police numbers per capita in Australia, they seem powerless to do anything. I hold up the latest copy of the Western Herald, the Bourke paper, with the headline, 'Law and Order in Bourke in disarray' and the sub-heading, 'Juveniles hold the town to ransom!' I will quote a couple of paragraphs from that front page written by the editor: Despite years of frustration and calls from local people and businesses for Police and government bodies to resolve Bourke's law and order problems ... the situation is no better, in fact it seems worse! Never has the lack of law and order been so evident as at the present time. Gangs of juveniles roam the streets day and night harassing shopkeepers and customers and are seen to be above the law, showing no fear of retribution for their actions. Rightly so it seems, as nothing appears to be done. Police say there is little they can do and the situation has reached the stage where Bourke people will not accept this. This is the state of law and order under the Carr Labor Government which took such pride in campaigning for better law and order earlier this year. Bourke has found that Labor's promises are empty, hollow words and nothing more. Turning inside the paper, there is another page full of incidents that have happened since the last edition under headlines such as, 'Teenager breaks into house and attacks woman'. A story headed, 'Police attacked in hotel altercation' states: Two Bourke Police Officers are recovering after being injured whilst breaking up a fight at a Bourke Hotel on Saturday night. It is alleged that a man assaulted the Publican the hotel when he was refused service. Police attended the scene and when the alleged offender ran from the hotel, two officers chased him, catching up with him behind Festival Supermarket. While the officers attempted to take the man into custody, a female police officer was knocked flat on her face and a male officer suffered a bite to the armpit. He is in hospital at the moment having AIDS tests. There are further headlines such as, 'Local woman pays for return of purse'which was stolen from her. When she got a phone call requesting money for the return of the purse, she contacted the police who advised her to pay the money. Another article here quotes Robyn Hams, who has become sick and tired of the constant problems. She says: One month, we will have constant problems with theft and break-ins. A little while ago, it was so bad that we were being broken into, or having something stolen, every day. It was like a horror movie, you knew it was going to happen, you just did not know when. Then, we will go for a month or so and it will be quiet. I'm quickly becoming a nervous wreck and it seems to be a small group of re-offenders who are causing the problems. Something needs to be done. That is just a small sample of what is happening. Another incident concerned Terry Mackay, a businessman who has had to shut his business down in Bourke because his premises have been stoned for up to five hours at a time. I have a police report here of 40 to 60 offenders throwing missiles at his house constantly, police attending and having their vehicles smashed up and still not being able to arrest anyone, they say, because it was dark. But his premises were stoned the other day for five hours-in the middle of the day! Police attended again and still nobody was arrested. The situation is totally out of control and something has to be done because good citizens are leaving these towns. It is a tragedy to see these towns being put through this. I urge the federal parliament as well as the state government to do something about it to restore law and order to country towns in New South Wales. (Time expired) Age Pensions",132
137,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"An age of pension is a right, not a handout. The pension is a return to honest, hard working Australians for a lifetime of building our country. That is the way we say thank you to our senior citizens for a lifetime of hard work. We respect them for what they have done and we take the responsibility of providing a decent pension. It is easy to say these words but, if we really mean them, we must back them up with concrete policies. That is why the government has a commitment to not only index pensions regularly for inflation but also increase their real value over time. This Labor government has rigidly adhered to its commitment to regularly index pensions and, in addition, has delivered on its promise to ensure that pensions are at least 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. It is important to understand that this is a principle which is not accepted by those on the other side. If the policy that applied when the other side were in government were applied now, single age pensioners would at least be $20 a week worse off and couples would be at least $34 a week worse off. The problem we have is that the record of the opposition in government is dreadful. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), when he was Treasurer in the Fraser government, stopped the regular indexation of pensions. If Mr Howard had the opportunity to repeat this trick it would cost the average pensioner one whole week's pension per year. That would be the equivalent of a pensioner being robbed after they went to the bank and withdrew their pension on a weekly basis. During the FraserHoward government, pensions fell by 2 per cent in real terms because they did not make increases in line with changes to the CPI. Under this government, pensions have increased 14 per cent in real terms and have increased at a rate greater than the CPI. I know that it is hard to live on a pension. That is why I believe it is vital that the existing commitments are maintained and the advances of the past are not lost. This will be possible under a Liberal government. The Leader of the Opposition made it very clear on Meet the Press earlier this week that they do not have a commitment to maintaining and increasing the real value of pensions over time. In my electorate of Lilley, the Liberal candidate has blamed our national debt on the money being paid to pensioners and the unemployed. Quite clearly, she believes that to solve national debt pensions should be cut. This is an approach which is totally rejected by those on this side of the House. We have a policy of maintaining and increasing the real value of pensions. We have a record of doing that. That is not the case with the Leader of the Opposition or the Liberal Party. Telstra Satellite System",133
138,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"Today I received on my fax machine at Parliament House a letter entitled 'Telstra, Iterra Main Earth Station, Bendigo: Proposed Closure'. The letter states: The national domestic satellite telephone system is called Iterra, operated by Telstra and has its main earth station located at 38 Short St. Bendigo. This earth station is the only one of its kind in Australia and provides control for the national system and connection to the national terrestrial network through Bendigo. The system has been in existence for approximately 10 years and has been Bendigo based for the whole of that time. The system uses analogue technology and the time has come to upgrade to digital technology. Telstra has set the wheels in motion to achieve this but the new system, called DAMAnet, will not be based in Bendigo but instead be based in Perth. There may be a secondary part of DAMAnet in Bendigo or no satellite system at all. The current Bendigo installation is supported by 12 staffand possibly otherssome of whom will be expected to relocate to Perth whilst others will face redundancy. Organisational arrangements are about to be put in place which eliminates local management and places Bendigo under the control of management in Perth. Some of the current Bendigo jobs will also be stripped of some of their functions as a step towards elimination. This is a disgraceful action by Telstra and I bring it to the attention of staff. I will be not writing to Mr Blount, the head of Telstra, and I will also be writing to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee). Pacific Highway",134
139,Mr HORNE,ADJOURNMENT,"There must be an election in the air or something. Tonight we are insulted by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) coming in here and talking about a state issue, saying that the federal government should do something about law and order in New South Wales. I will lay London to a brick that in the past seven years the member for Parkes has not said a single word about the Fahey government slashing police numbers in New South Wales. He knows too well that the Carr government already has embarked on building up police numbers. That is the sort of hypocrisy that we are getting and we are going to get it continually until the election. Yesterday when this House considered private members business we heard about the Pacific Highway in New South Wales. The Pacific Highway bisects my electorate, the electorate of Paterson. Today that discussion has continued. Senator Tierney has set new parameters for the role of a senator. He is not a senator representing New South Wales; he is a senator representing the Hunter-a completely new classification of a senator. What is Senator Tierney saying about the Pacific Highway? He is saying that the black spot funding has been cut. He alludes to the fact that the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) says they are going to bring it back. I am not sure what speech he was reading of the Leader of the National Party when he claims they are going to bring it back, because I can tell the House that when the Leader of the National Party addressed the annual conference of the National Farmers Federation earlier this year he said that the coalition will not be increasing funding on rural and regional roads because they don't want to compete for the dollar; they don't want to risk increasing interest rates. You quote verbatim virtually anything the opposition have said because they have said it. But when you cross-reference it you find out that what they said at a certain meeting in Yass conflicts with what they said at a meeting in Canberra, Sydney or Melbourne. They have said everything. The true facts surrounding the Pacific Highway are that for five years the GreinerFahey regime in New South Wales spent an average of $70 million per annum. In its first year in office the Carr government will spend $108 million-an increase of some 30-odd per cent. Those are the facts. If we want to know what the Fahey government did in the first year of having road funding come to them in an untied form--everyone knows that last year was the first year of that system following an agreement between the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and Nick Greiner, when he was the Premier-we have to ask: where did the first $50 million of road funding go? Not a cent of it was spent on a road. It was all spent on City Rail in Sydney. If the opposition want to have a debate about the Pacific Highway and road funding, let us identify what the federal responsibility is and what the state responsibility is. I can tell you that we will back our record every time because we put the money into roads where the need is. We do not play the games, the chicanery, the hypocrisy of the coalition. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Sri Lanka",134
140,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I want to speak very briefly about two tragedies-one a domestic tragedy and one an overseas tragedy. As patron of the Toowoomba Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME) Support Group, I am disappointed at the reluctance of many at the medical and political levels to accept the plight of Australians afflicted with this debilitating condition. At this point in time, it seems to me that deeply traditional medical attitudes prevail that this is a condition of the mind rather than of the body. Having met with many in the local support group this year, and having talked to can overseas medical experts from the United Kingdom and New Zealand recently, it is clear that Australia is lagging behind overseas medical and governmental acceptance and remedial health and budgetary measures to correct this debilitating condition. Once again, on behalf of local support group president, Joan Sheath, and all CFS sufferers nationwide, I make a special plea to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and to health research authorities to do something about this as a matter of urgency in the national interest. Turning overseas, there is no doubt that the civil war in Sri Lanka is a tragedy of the highest order. Indeed, there is no humanitarian crisis within our Commonwealth of Nations of comparable magnitude. There is, therefore, a desperate need to resolve it for all Sri Lankans-Tamil and Sinhalese alikeirrespective of religion, of ethnic identity or political allegiance. It is a tragedy that the overwhelming number of victims are civilians of all views who have been brought into the military conflict by the indiscriminate use of violence. In particular, there is a need to address the displacement of about half a million persons in the country's north who are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. To this end, UN Secretary-General Boutros Ghali has declared an urgent need for international humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of these people-regrettably, to little tangible effect at this point. In that context, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) called on our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) several weeks ago to raise the problem of Sri Lanka during the recent CHOGM in New Zealand and to discuss with other Commonwealth members ways in which the Commonwealth could play a useful role in resolving this tragedy. Unfortunately, not only was the matter of Sri Lanka not included in the CHOGM communique but the issue was not discussed in any formal way at that meeting. The coalition, therefore, has criticised and will continue to criticise the government's failure until we see a substantive response. To date, our Prime Minister has refused to explain why he failed to raise it. We should all be appalled also at Senator Evans's reference in the Senate earlier this year to the concerns of the Australian Tamil community as being concerns of 'a few romantically minded' Tamils in this country. Clearly, that is not so, and I feel sure that Sinhala Cultural Foundation would have strong views also. His failure to recognise the issue and the failure of the Prime Minister to raise the issue at CHOGM represent extraordinary oversights. Given the moral rhetoric which flowed in other directions from CHOGM, it is incomprehensible that the Sri Lankan tragedy was overlooked. The coalition supports the need for a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Sri Lanka as a matter of urgency. We believe that there should be some international involvement in the situation, despite persistent Sri Lankan government rejection of this. Australia might play a useful role both diplomatically and politically and in coordinating efforts by non-government organisations in sending relief supplies, particularly basic medicines. However, time is running out and thousands of people are dying each day unnecessarily in this tragedy. We all should abhor atrocities and violence both by the Tamil Tigers and by Sri Lankan government forces alike. Once again, I call on the Keating government to take genuine steps to help alleviate that crisis and to return all Sri Lankans to a state of normality, of tolerance, of self-respect and peace, free of suggestions of ethnic cleansing and with all the freedoms of responsible democracy. Clearly, Sri Lanka has a long way to go to reach these goals. We need the Prime Minister and Senator Evans to light the Commonwealth's way towards a new Sri Lanka, where the gun is no longer needed and where peoples of all ethnic and religious groupings can live in peace and mutual prosperity. Senator Evans can no longer sit on his hands in this tragedy. Tamils and Sinhalese alike demand nothing less. Euthanasia",135
141,Mrs EASSON,ADJOURNMENT,"The House will be aware that the Northern Territory euthanasia bill is to be resubmitted to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly due to legal anomalies. The problem that brings me to speak today is that the parties in the assembly are denying a conscience vote for members on this issue. This is disgraceful and contrary to the established Australian norm of the allowing conscience votes on matters of personal status. We have had conscience votes on divorce, abortion and matters dealing with homosexuality, and this is right and proper. People's views on these matters go to the very heart of their entire world outlook, and the right to freedom of conscience is fundamental to our culture and the life of our nation. The conscience vote is a national rule of the Australian Labor Party that I have always defended and fought for. Ideological extremists who insist on forcing support for their agendas are actually saying that they cannot rely on their arguments to win their case. Personally, I have grave reservations with euthanasia. To deliberately take a person's life is a very serious matter. I believe life to be a God-given gift. The serious medical traumas that affect many people today are essentially a matter for the patient and the doctor. Politicians are usually unnecessary in these situations. But when legislation is before a parliament we must certainly resist any attempt to reduce our role in the life of Australia by having the exercise of our considered consciences nullified by party factions.

142,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"Deakin) (7.58 p.m.}-On 22 November I raised an issue relating to dubious foreign currency loans involving unprecedented misconduct and arrogance by Westpac and its authorised officers. I also proposed a further banking inquiry into the specific nature of illegitimate Westpac banking actions and their consequences, which the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) has since extended in a speech into a call for a royal commission or judicial inquiry. In October 1994 Mr Robert Joss issued a code of conduct entitled 'Message from the managing-director' to all staff members of Westpac. I am not sure whether this is Mr Joss's or Westpac's code of conduct, as the document is not reinforced by any other director of Westpac. The fundamental principle of this code says: We in Westpac conduct ourselves with absolute honesty and integrity. We do not tolerate dishonest behaviour in other employees or customers. If we suspect dishonest behaviour, we bring it to the attention of someone who will take action. Dishonesty and lack of integrity harm our business and may be an offence under the Crimes Act. We recognise that it is in our interest to make a report if we believe a breach of our code has occurred. We will ensure that the information provided remains confidential as far as possible and that the rights of all parties are protected. Further to that code of conduct, I have certain documents which show quite clearly that Westpac has not operated in a way which accords with its code of conduct.

Competency is the key part in that, people who are competent to perform their manage the wheel and who can ensure that it many ships come into Australia with clean tanks reach the next port the tanks are clean. That it happens. Trying to detect it is much more difficult. What is causing a great deal more worry-and extent-is the greater use of single-voyage permit between two Australian ports. The use of single-voyage last few years. In 1994-95, 434 foreign ships permits. In other words, they picked up cargo place in Australia.

When one recognises that the whole process process, it is fairly clear that we need to professional officer education-as opposed to distinct differences between the two. I do to look at, but it is a separate area It is important that we have a look at what and what the importance of those areas is, we can improve this training process. It also process and the traditions that particularly difficult to come up with ways and changes the traditions and the ways that things have a great deal of emphasis is placed on tradition We are in a changing world and, as a result, changes that are put into place. Having spent of the officer training establishments, I found processes and the resultant officers who came an army perspective-and I really had to do difference was in the result that we were producing. I had to ask: is there a significant enough put in, to justify maybe stopping and having If one looks around at some of the senior officers a Portsea graduate and, on the basis of that, the process of getting to there. But, on that if Duntroon was set up as the key establishment-and Portsea graduates flow into senior positions, period for some of these people to get through difference in the process of education. I have come to the conclusion-and I think recommendations that we have agreed on, even education stages are needed, but that maybe a different way. The important part of that looking at the undergraduate sponsorship places provided and the opportunity for people in order to enable them to be assessed for made. That process is a bit of a two-way street. Firstly, the opportunity to have a look at the way the the ADF an opportunity to see whether that MAIN COMMITTEE MC 4133 chairman of the committee, the member for likes to put it in those terms-and focus that he concentrate on what has actually come out as an the contribution of the chairman, the member Gillian Gould, who was secretary until and the inquiry staff, Peter MCLay and the of change in the defence forces is a costly look at specific areas, not the least of which is officer training, and there are very clear and not exclude training from the cost areas we need and not part of this particular report. it is that we do in officer training at all levels and try to come up with innovative ways in which has to be recognised, in view of the established apply in the military forces, that it is somewhat rapidly that will not have some implications for been done in the past. In the services, of course, and the ways that things are done. we really do need to look at a number of these some time in the services and gone through one it interesting to sit and look at the training out of Skyville, Portsea and Duntroon-from some soul-searching and ask myself what the difference in result, based on the dollars that we a look at things being done in a different way? that we have, a commander of the ADF was he has obviously shown a lot of military skill in basis, the question I asked myself was whether, we are now starting to see a lot of simply because the process has required that to those positions-there is any major the committee has, too, when one looks at the if for different reasons-that a series of what we need to do is refocus and look at it in came out in recommendation 16 when we were and saying that we would like to see 1,DOO-odd to go through the training systems to start with the military before the final commitments were it gives the potential officer training cadet military system works, and secondly, it gives person is suitable. I think if that sponsorship NA MC 4134 system is implemented it will work quite encourage because it is not just the academic people; we also need a sense of being able that until you have put these people through of doing that. The other important part of that is that of the defence academy based on having the interaction between the three services. recommendations say with respect to the academy, think the important part in all of that is that, interaction with the general community. The interaction of people going through the just into other services, will be just as significant. because the interaction that will be able to another defence service who is having just as what they need as you are in your service, business outside who may be at the leading edge an opportunity to interact and communicate. To me, that in itself will be significant services. Realistically, at the rate technologies that our defence funding can keep up with important to know what technologies work, has been fairly important, certainly in the way sponsorship working. I think that I refer to recommendation 11, the request a triservice college with single service precommissioning colleges. In effect, that also had by bringing all of the people from the individual the experience of the interaction which will also, as they get further up the ranks, help services. That will have considerable I do not think anybody could have done training a cadet at the academy. The recommendation in fact, a realistic one. I know that there concerns about that but I think that, when one the defence academy, as opposed to training hard to justify the difference in costs. My view is that the interaction in the university on that comes in part from my having got out found that the outside world was substantially to 12 months to adjust and fit into the civilian at a very young age.

However, I have to say that I fundamentally bit strange, because I put my signature to this that the reason I did that was that I was the honourable member for Chifley as chairman, with some of these issues without going to the measure--of including a dissenting view in Margetts in terms of her dissenting report. I do disagree with some of what she has about more emphasis being needed in the comments that regional engagement, and regional from overseas, is counterproductive to our I accept her right to make those comments. report.

If we are we have to allow them to fluctuate between have to allow them to opt out for periods without need to move with the times. This is the have no difficulty about pleading guilty to that. some rather dramatic changes. The honourable member for Groom also said considerations. I am on the public record in ADFA is a third order priority as far as I ordinary people outside will not understand that produces an officer to go to his first unit, huge amount of money.

The MAIN COMMITTEE MC 4141 to the report that the committee as a the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) on defence. He is the sort of bloke who does He has been a bit of a bell wether for me says he is worried about something, I know someone whom I hold in high esteem. As the pointed out, all members of the committee take the way it operates. We take pride in the fact portfolio ministers, and that we have people who has a proud record of having served performed under national service-for instance, The current chairman of the subcommittee views, and a concern for the ADF. In some ways, that we are not critical enough: we are very good report. It reflects the best traditions of work performed by the defence subcommittee. Firstly, I mention the idea that the report is wants a public service in uniform. I do not think at some very important reports. The Glenn review currently considering this. Army 21 is another reports are very significant and really point out there in civilian employment. Whilst cannot lag too far behind. Therefore, we have employment in the ADF; we must not penalise or vice versa, which we currently do. congratulated for having female officers coming to recoup some of that investment, not only do full-time and part-time employment but also we suffering gross penalties. In that sense, we theme of the honourable member for Groom and I Over the next five years, I think we will see that this report was being driven by budgetary a number of places as saying that the cost of am concerned. It is also a baseball bat because over $400,000 has to be spent before the army and the ADFA component of that is $308,000-a a very senior officer, and he said, 'Do not be too that you have the baseball bat close by.' Even next couple of years, I just do not believe this pressure on the defence dollar is going to be great NA MC 4142 even if, under the five-year budget, the Minister increase coming in years 3, 4 and 5. All of us in the defence subcommittee want no matter who is in government. We want to ADF that interfere with its capability. It is standard defence concepts, value for money the future, if you are looking into the The presentation of the report provides a of the themes in this report is jointery. I am around. For what it is worth, I want to put down it is about three things. Firstly, it provides a cohort go through there are inevitable informal services that stand them in good stead in their is not just an aspect of sitting down together understand, appreciate and are knowledgeable different services perform. This is important for a jointery ought to facilitate joint operations-in knowledge to make it far smoother and more effective is what I think jointery is all about. This report pioneered this at the earliest stages of an officer's On the scholarship side, one of the things awarded a scholarship would still be eligible conditions. They would have their scholarship nicely, if I might say so. The other argument that has been put to because we have mentioned that the labour since the 1970s and the 1980s and mentioned somehow the committee is proposing that we if they would like a military career. Nothing doing with the scholarship scheme is identifying course, offering them a scholarship, making sure making a final selection. The other point is that the scholarship scheme the important contributions of the member with the suggestion that is adopted in the training-not great but basic training-before is a loose connection throughout the scholarship ride: there is some quid pro quo in it. It has been suggested to me that maybe scholarship. That is fair enough, and I have spades whilst ADFA continues; but, at the end ADFA must go. The honourable member for Groom was picking and that is fair enough. I want to make the MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 29 November 1995 for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) sees a slight The pressures are going to be enormous. to ensure that the ADF preserves its capability ensure that there are no cuts or changes to the for that reason that you have to apply what are the and acceptable premiums. If you are looking into military after next, you cannot sustain it. good opportunity to clear up some confusion. One surprised at the diffident definitions and concepts what I thought jointery was all about. Basically informal networks. In other words, as a class or links that people make across the three future careers. The second thing is that jointery and forming a class; it is ensuring that people about the different functions and roles that the the officers in their careers. Last, but not least, other words, with the contacts and with the when they are in a joint operation. That is stating that it is really good, that ADFA career and we want to continue on with it. that has not been understood is that people to collect Austudy if they met all the other money plus Austudy, which is doing very me that really drives me nuts is the idea that, market for graduates has changed dramatically that there is an oversupply of graduates, troll through unemployed graduates asking them could be further from the truth. What we are people who are starting their undergraduate that they progress, and at the end of the day is a sort of free ride. I must say that one of for New England (Mr Sinclair) was to come up report that there needs to be a period of basic people start the scholarship. In that way there of military training so that it is not just a free I believe the scholarship scheme will work. we need to start by having a trial scheme on the no difficulty with that. I think it will work in of the day, my position fundamentally is that me up on some of the language I have used, point that, in keeping with the way the committee NA Wednesday, 29 November 1995 operates, I avoided the temptation to be controversy that surrounded its establishment. ADFA-for example, the history of bastardisation put that to one side, as the committee has and there are plenty of positives about ADFA. By adopting such an approach in debate, arguments. If you are presenting a simple much more easily understood out there in voter do. That approach is dishonest and it is been good. It was a bold step to set it up; it and it introduced jointery. Today, I am still looking forward very much to going to People who have been hurt by what has the committee is saying that, in the context of it feels that these changes are absolutely necessary. million budget is spent on ADFA. For 1,000 the other 11,000 officers in professional It is interesting that other important changes slipped by almost without comment in the public and very important. For my own part, I believe the notion that regular officers, full-time officers the same courses together in the same institutions. army reserve. There are difficulties with it, very solvable.

A remark has stuck in my mind that was commandant of Duntroon. I am sure it applied services. He said that after six months those who really could not be distinguished one from cadets at Duntroon, some had come from the NA Wednesday, 29 November 1995 ranks-in other words, were experienced as ordinary some in peacekeeping commitments-while others of a university type of education. They had yet the commandant said that after six months concerns me therefore to look The Committee recommends that the ADF conduct a Service pre-commissioning college with appropriate Service pre-commissioning colleges. Because the service is becoming more specialised, little doubt that in each of the services an opportunity you like, of that particular service. I have some doubts about the capacity to have than to the degree to which we look at where regarding ADFA, I will pick up-and I am not think there is a reason to have triservice training separately now in each of the single service that can easily be replaced. ADFA has always worried me because I grew War II when so many from the services were very senior officers in the Australian Defence I have felt that there is a real advantage in into the Defence Force to mingle in the wider are available at universities. There are several reasons for that. One is state. In other words, people who come from Queensland or wherever are able to do part of own state and then come together to get produced some outstanding young men and the fact that those young men and women other undergraduates and that the commandant he cannot distinguish between them, I do not present form is justified. For that reason I am one of those who believe adopt a scholarship scheme, and recommendations that is the right way to go, I believe, is more in recommendation 16 that if there is a sponsorship a pre-entry introduction to the services to to university. Throughout their university education establishment, both triservice and single service, university education they have achieved After they have graduated they would need training. Time for that has been recommended needs to be assessed, and that is, as I say, in the wider world they are going to gain access MAIN COMMITTEE MC 4145 soldiers before they came in as cadets, had served at ADFA and had the benefits come from considerably diverse backgrounds and he could not distinguish between them.

Whether a matter for the professionals. We have suggested scheme the students should go through learn how to be service personnel before they go they would remain attached to a training so that by the time they have finished their approximately 12 months of military training. to go back for triservice and single service to be set aside but the length of that training a matter for the professionals.

Whether it means they are going to be any of judgment. I was minister at the time that in the cabinet discussions when John Gorton first Gorton as minister for defence, Malcolm Fraser minister for defence raised; it was not just about where we should go in officer education. I am one of those who feels that the ADFA concept in its present form, and therefore Because we have made recommendations, I looked at very carefully.

Main Committee adjourned at 2.33 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Development Cooperation: Government Commitment (Question No. 2639) Mr Downer asked the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, upon notice, on 25 September 1995: (1) What development cooperation commitments has the Australian Government entered into with other countries for each financial year from 199697 to and including 2000-2001. (2) With respect to each commitment referred to in part (1), (a) which country will receive assistance, (b) what sum is involved, (c) what project will be undertaken and (d) what is the nature of the agreement through which assistance was committed. (3) What contractual arrangements has the Australian Government entered into under the Development Import Finance Facility for each financial year from 1996-97 to and including 20002001. (4) What total sum has been contracted for each year referred to in part (3). (5) With respect to each contract referred to in part (3), (a) who is the contracting party, (b) what project is involved and (c) what is the value of the project. (6) What percentage of projected total (a) development cooperation funds and (b) expenditure on the Development Import Finance Facility has been committed to date for each financial year from 1996-97 to and including 2000-2001. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The aggregated total forward development cooperation commitments, determined as at 30 September 1995, for each of the financial years 1996/97 to 2000/01 are listed in Attachment I. These are recorded against AusAID's appropriation structure; country programs, global programs and corporate services. It is important to note that Australia's commitment to food aid is a special case. A liability has been incurred through our commitment to the Food Aid Convention of 300,000 tonnes of wheat or wheat equivalent per annum for the period 1995/96 to 1997/98. There is no specific allocation for food NA aid as such. Rather, our Food Aid Commitment is met through country appropriations, emergency and refugee appropriations, as well as through the World Food Program. The commitments have been recorded in accordance with the accounting definitions specified by the Department of Finance in its guidelines to Commonwealth agencies for the preparation of annual Financial Statements tabled in Parliament. Obligations are recorded as liabilities, commitments and agreements equally proportionately unperformed (AEPUs). These definitions are explained at Attachment II. Using these definitions, the levels of forward commitment as at 30 September 1995 are as follows: 1996/97-$1,055 million; 1997/98-$908 million; 1998/99-$678 million; 199912000--$595 million; 2000/01-$481 million. There are other programs/activities which are not covered by these definitions and therefore not recorded for the purpose of the Financial Statements, but which also place a high degree of obligation on Australia for moral or other reasons. While there are strong expectations that such funding will continue, these activities have not been included as development cooperation commitments for these Questions on Notice. These other obligations include core contributions to United Nations development organisations (eg. UNICEF, United Nations Development Fund, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees). The contributions are voluntary and not covered by legislation as in the case of multilateral development banks, nor are they covered by the 'assessed' formulae used for other UN bodies. There is, however, a strong expectation internationally and domestically that Australia's contributions to these organisations will continue, reflecting Australia's role as a good international citizen and the principle of burden-sharing with other donors. The category also covers: allocations to meet commitments where the Government has pledged support for specific programs (eg. Prime Ministerial multiyear pledges for development cooperation programs in Vietnam and Cambodia); provision for refugee and emergency relief; funding for Development Import Finance Facility projects where activities have been agreed between Australia and recipient governments; funding for the AusAIDlNongovernment Organisation Cooperation Program; funding for volunteer programs; and support for regional organisations such as the South Pacific Forum Secretariat. There is also an expectation of maintenance of support for country programs in key regions such as the South Pacific. For 1996/97, the total value of these 'strong expectations' is estimated to be $363 million. (2) A detailed supplementary paper of 127 pages, which outlines all forward commitments, disaggregated by country program, global program and corporate services; and further, by activity, value and nature of commitment has been provided to the Honourable Member. Each commitment type is reported on separate schedules. (3) Under the Development Import Finance Facility a contractual commitment occurs when the implementing contractor receives a formal offer to undertake the project. At 30 September 1995 no contractual arrangements were in place under the Development Import Finance Facility for project funding in 1996/97 and beyond. There is, however, a high degree of obligation on the Australian Government because (i) a pipeline of projects has been agreed bilaterally at officials level with China, Indonesia, Nepal, India, the Philippines and Vietnam; and (ii) on this basis commercial contract negotiations between contractors and recipient governments have commenced. Details of individual contractors, prior to the award of contracts, are commercial-in-confidence. (4) There were no contractual arrangements in place under the Development Import Finance Facility for the period 1996/97 to 2000101 as at 30 September 1995. There are, however, expectations based on requests on hand to a total value of $267.9 million, of which it is anticipated that some $60 million Approp Item AusAID Divi28-Nov-95 sion 317 03.17 PM NA NA 317-2-01 Budget Support (Special Pro- 142,200,000 grams) 317-2-02 Retirement Benefits (Special Programs)-(2) 317-3-01 Programmed Activities 317-3-01 SOUTH PACIFIC Country Allocations Fiji Vanuatu will be funded during the remainder of the 1995/96 financial year and the balance funded in out years. Funding is provided as contracts are signed in any year up to the total annual allocation for the Development Import Finance Facility program. There are expectations of funding from the countries concerned and Australian contractors for these projects and, on that basis, contract negotiations have commenced. It should be noted that not all the identified projects will necessarily proceed to formal offer by AusAID. The latter is contingent upon satisfactory appraisal by AusAID on developmental grounds, including an assessment against OECD criteria for mixed credits and the satisfactory conclusion to negotiations between the Australian supplier and the buyer in the recipient country. Attachment III provides the list of Development Import Finance Facility projects agreed with recipient governments. (5)(a) Individual details of applicants for Development Import Finance Facility projects are commercial-in-confidence up until the date when contracts are awarded; (b) and (c) no contractual arrangements were in place for the period 1996/97 to 2000101 as at 30 September 1995. (6)(a) The percentage of projected overall development cooperation funds that are committed, in accordance with categories defined for the Financial Statements, during financial years 1996/97 to 2000101 are listed against the overall program totals in Attachment I. The total commitment as at 30 September 1995, in percentage terms, assuming 1995/96 aid levels are maintained in real terms, are: 1996/97--65 per cent; 1997/98-54 per cent; 1998/99-39 per cent; 1999/2000-33 per cent; 2000101-26 per cent.

The listed categories; Commitments, Agreements Equally Proportionately Unperformed (AEPUs) and liabilities are mutually exclusive and are recorded separately. These categories of commitments are reported separately in a Supplementary Paper, of 127 pages in length, which has been provided to the Office of the Honourable Senator. These provide a detailed outline of all forward commitments, disaggregated by country programs, global programs and corporate services as per AusAID's program structure; and further, by activity, value and nature of commitment. (2) Commitments There are two types of commitment recorded.

In Schedule A of the Supplementary Paper commitments are recorded where: there is a firm intention to incur a future liability for goods or services which are yet to be provided. The commitment actually arises when a definite decision is made to incur the liability (eg. when FR 44A approval is given to a spending proposal); or action has been taken to determine the actual amount of the commitment or a reliable estimate, and where the conditions to be satisfied under the obligation are clearly defined in a written agreement (eg written record of a High Level Consultation that specifies agreed individual activities including a firm estimate of cost). If the above requirements are not satisfied, then the intention to incur a future liability is considered too vague for there to be a commitment. Schedule B records commitments covered by Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which are firm agreements evidenced by a signed document that commits a firm dollar amount. Where there are contracts arising from an MOU, these are recorded as an AEPU in Schedule C (see Section 3 below). (3) Agreements Equally Proportionately Unperformed (AEPUs) Once a signed contract exists, and before any work has been performed or payments have been made, a commitment becomes contracted expenditure unperformed. In accounting terms, contracted expenditure unperformed is known as an ""agreement equally proportionately unperformed"" or an ""AEPU"". An AEPU arises at any point in an agreement and applies where contracted work remains to be performed and no payments have been made for the work yet to be done. (For example, where 60 per cent of a contracted activity has been completed and paid for, the remaining 40 per cent of work still constitutes an AEPU.) The same applies where goods are involved rather than services. These agreements usually involve a legal commitment by AusAlD. For example, where AusAID Description of Commitment Type Aactivity NA Tianjin Railway Identified Projects 30,000,00045,000,000 Jilin Land InformaIdentified Projects tion Rainfall Data Man- Identified Projects agement Forage Seed De- Identified Projects velopment Mobile Telecom- Identified Projects munications Xinjiang Rural Identified Projects Telecomm.

(Note: AEPUs are not restricted to contracted expenditure/receipts. However, most amounts included here are those that form part of an existing contract.) AEPUs are recorded in Schedule C and show amounts which will be payable in each financial year until 2000/01. (4) Liabilities A liability arises where an intention to incur a future obligation becomes a present obligation. There are few items that are reported as liabilities. These are the non-reciprocal treaty for budget support to Papua New Guinea, Nauru Settlement, payments under the Food Aid Convention, payments made to multilateral development banks from Special Appropriations and a range of AusAID employee entitlement provisions. Liabilities are recorded on Page 1 of the Supplementary Paper.

(2) What sum has been spent on acquiring land for regional open space or environmental protection 615 438 since January 1990. (3) What sum is available at the ing this question for the acquisition of land for regional open space or environmental protection. (4) Do any programs exist under which State and local governments may borrow Commonwealth funds for land acquisition for regional open space or environmental protection. (5) Will the Government provide funds to other tiers of government to acquire land for environmental purposes; if so, what are the details.",194
173,Mr BRERETON,VIETNAM,"The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Environment, Sport and Territories Portfolio provides funds for land acquisition for environmental protection under the following programs: National Reserves System Co-operative Program Daintree Rescue Program World Heritage Property Management Queensland Wet Tropics World Heritage Area Management Sugar Coast Environment Rescue Package With respect to the acquisition of land for regional open spaces, the honourable member may care to seek further information from the Minister for Housing and Regional Development. (2) The following amounts have been expended under the above programs: National Reserves System (since 1993)-$3 389 500 Save the Bush (since 1990)-$450000 Daintree Rescue Program (since 1994)-$1 884 695 Wet Tropics Management Authority (since 1990)-$3 185 292 World Heritage Property Management (since Funding 1990)-$695 000 Sugar Coast Environment Rescue Package-nil (3) The following amounts are currently available for land acquisition, for the periods as indicated, in accordance with the criteria for each program: National Reserves System Co-operative Program (1995/6)-$1 530000 Wet Tropics Management Authority (1995/6)$1 904 893 Daintree Rescue Program (1995/6-1997/8)-$11 Sugar Coast Environment Rescue Package date of answer- (1995/6-1997/8)-$8 000000 No specific sum is set aside under the World Heritage Property Management Program for land acquisition. (4) There are no such programs within my portfolio. (5) The provision of funds for this purpose is a matter that will be dependent on a range of factors prevailing at the particular time. Such factors would include the environmental significance of the land in question, the availability of funds and competing priorities. Kamppi Constructions Pty Ltd (Question No. 2688) Mr Moore asked the Minister for Finance, upon notice, on 18 October 1995: Did the Minister's Department or its agencies make payments to Kamppi Constructions Pty Ltd (ACN 008 600 628) in any year between 1984-85 and 1994-95; if so (a) what sum was paid in each year and (b) for what purposes was it paid.",204
