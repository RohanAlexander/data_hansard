We all and rubbery fiscal predictions, but on its carbon tax, which was effectively the EU the set carbon price next year of $29 a tonne, carbon price of $12.10 from 1 July 2015, That is in the budget figures and is another in my electorate-that the carbon tax is a in the south-west and a place where a fair is produced.

The reality of linking the Australian and hole-at least, and counting- in Labor's budget. budget black hole would have left the Treasurer duplicitous approach to aged care, there government's changes to aged-care funding which the misnomer Living Longer Living Better, issues facing small regional aged-care service understand the additional costs of providing areas. When the Labor government unveiled their plan Australian people that this program is in fact aged-care sector over the next 2½ years-another opposed to the misrepresentations of the government, will get less funding for new patients than they alone will see $500 million of ACFI funding tough.

Of course, unfortunately, that unmerciful think by necessity, to enter into the spin wondering what in the hell is going on in terms of fiscal management. Never these days do we hear the opposition sense; a debate about where we want our economic terms and in terms of our social fabric-what economic wealth and how we can best evenly community.

That plan is a slow and steady plan, without taking a sledgehammer to the Australian economy, not acting on a way which which would impact negatively on the economy I have said in this place many, many times I coined the famous Neville Wran-the former only three issues in politics. They are jobs, that since I have been representing the unemployment rate of about 13 per cent to something that, because it is pretty hard to believe: from rising, and these are challenges for us. It is mining boom, so we are going from 3½ probably natural rate of unemployment-I would like to are going back to a higher rate of unemployment. This is what makes it so important that at that sledgehammer to the Australian economy. have us return to surplus more quickly, yet he from the carbon price. He is going to abolish the mining tax is not raising what Treasury had raising a significant amount of money. Some returned to my electorate in the form of infrastructure here. You cannot say you are going to spend going to go back to surplus more quickly. If put a big brake on the Australian economy. time when unemployment is creeping I should be very happy that the election believe it is a fait accompli. I believe that, look at what this Labor government has achieved about the Hunter electorate. The $1.7 billion been fighting for since the early 1990s, government in 1996 and which stagnated for and his government. Having had a Labor government fund it and build it, which it did, thankfully, in 2008. By Christmas this year, Hunter residents and Hunter expressway.

This is a government with a deep-seated in this country. These are projects that people projects John Howard could have funded in gold in that first phase of the mining boom but had a deep impact on productivity in this explain how his magic pudding is going to explains how he is going to lift it-but we do doubt about that. He goes to the cutting of government. We have heard that before. John Public Service, only to have Public Service later. There is no magic solution in this budget, right. This is a message for both sides of the Beginning with John Howard, when we were people more and more of what they wanted. infrastructure we have done, but there was money increase in infrastructure spending, particularly awash with middle-class welfare. Since his wage rises and significant increases in public course, has been welfare. On the other side of the equation, there is smaller taxes. So everyone wants more money education, but they want the government to them less. I am talking about individuals and companies. At the same time, in response to community economy in terms of the carbon price-an initiative Deputy Speaker, John Howard had a policy Malcolm Turnbull had one, Brendan Nelson the same commitment to a greenhouse gas reduction got this commitment to a carbon constraint. pretty clear that a carbon constraint is compensate everyone for any consumer impacts compensating industry as well and, in fact, these community expectations. These are not initiatives give us a net outflow. of the state governments but would never have package put forward by this government.

In not doing so, he country. Whenever you hear Tony Abbott try to work, he goes to productivity, but he never get a hint of Work Choices in there. There is no Public Service jobs and more efficient running of Howard did that in 1996. He took a knife to the employment restored to a higher level three years and I believe this budget got it absolutely parliament and for the broader community. in that first mining boom, we started to give He did not do anything like the investment in spent on infrastructure. I think there was an on the national highway network. We were days, we have had pension increases, healthy expenditure. Most of that expenditure, of a growing expectation of smaller government and spent on everything, including health and take less money, they want the government to tax expectations, we have put a constraint on the begun by John Howard. If you recall, Mr to put in place an emissions trading scheme, had one. In fact. Tony Abbott has one now with target as the government. So we have all Why? Because the community has been making it what it wants. But at the same time we want to of the carbon constraint; indeed, we are we are subsidising the renewable industry to meet that give us a net income stream; they I do not see anything ahead which suggests ageing population, like most Western countries, terms of population or demographics. We do Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, might always be working for greater productivity, for us and so the community, while it calls going to have to decide what it wants. Does taxes? There is no magic pudding. It is no income is coming in and only so much expenditure continue to rack up debt, and that is unsustainable government has a plan to retire debt. The community has to come with the political an expectation that we can have our cake and eat in particular, is that there are no easy solutions. dramatically any time soon, particularly given Europeans to come out of recession, given the relative sluggishness of many of the Asian This is all part of the reason we have to we take maximum benefit from the opportunities can to allow the mining companies to stay afloat new opportunities like the coal seam gas industry an industry which has the potential to bring footprint.

Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (15:35): I rise on the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment law amendment bill has eight schedules. Some Some of those schedules we will not be opposing. the coalition will not be opposing the passage shadow Treasurer, I will run through the relevant of which relate to superannuation. Schedule 1 deals with the definition of schedule amends the Income Tax Assessment with the Australian Communications and Media intended meaning. 'Documentary' in tax law, treatment of actuality that is not an infotainment As the explanatory memorandum and the detail clarifies that the exclusion of light entertainment does extend to game shows. This is done entertainment programs explicitly excluded The offset is designed to encourage Australian amendments are a response to litigation-the taxpayer successfully argued that their infotainment-like television series, qualified as a documentary judicial interpretation was wider than the intention proposed to make the legislative boundaries restore the original intent and the integrity budget of 8 May 2012. The amended definition considers these amendments-primarily a mentioned-to be sensible integrity measures that the key film industry tax concession. Schedule 2 of the bill deals with ex gratia Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to exempt recovery subsidy that was received by individuals small business person or farmer, as a direct from 21 January this year. It also exempts eligible New Zealand special category visa Disaster Recovery Payment, made in relation Australia in the financial years of 2011-12 relating to disasters occurring in those financial amendments in schedule 2. Schedule 3 deals with the GST instalment law to enable entities that are paying their (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013 Second Reading to speak, on behalf of the shadow Treasurer, (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. This tax of those schedules the coalition supports. As a consequence, I say at the outset that of this tax law amendment bill. On behalf of the schedules, six of which relate to tax and two 'documentary' for film tax offset purposes. The Act 1997 to define 'documentary' in accordance Authority guidelines and to restore its for film tax offset purposes, becomes 'a creative or lifestyle program or a magazine program'. of the bill make clear, the schedule also programs from film tax offset eligibility by adding game shows to the list of light from film tax offset eligibility. investment in film production. These decision in the Lush House case-where the production Lush House, a six-part for film tax offset eligibility purposes. As this of the original policy, amendments were clearer around documentary and game shows and of the offset. This proposal was announced in the applies from 1 July last year. The coalition response to the decision in that case that I better target eligibility for, and access to, payments for natural disasters and amends the from income tax any ex gratia disaster income who lost income, whether as an employee, result of the floods that occurred in Queensland from income tax the ex gratia payment for the holders, equivalent to the Australian Government to the natural disasters occurring across and 2012-13. These exemptions apply to payments years, and the coalition supports these system and amends the goods and services tax GST by instalments and subsequently moving to a net refund position to continue to pay their amount if they choose to. The purpose of this leads to otherwise eligible entities being they move to a net refund position, and therefore submitting their BAS, their business activity submitted quarterly. This amendment will allow move into a net refund position to choose therefore retain the compliance-cost Somewhat ironically, the choice to remain entity with compliance-cost advantages with amendments result in those entities that decide after they have submitted their annual return. where it suits them, for a lower BAS compliance assent. It gives those businesses It will benefit only a small proportion of reduce compliance costs for electing entities, transitional costs by those that elect but presumably outweigh those costs. The coalition supports narrowly applicable ones, but they have our budgets ago, on 10 May 2011, and we do wonder to deal with this. Schedule 4 is a regular schedule that appears the Income Tax Act of 1997 to again update the entities: the Conversation Trust, the National the National Boer War Memorial Association Fund, the Australian Peacekeeping Memorial Australia. We are told from the explanatory listings will be just under $10 million over the is the figure. Schedule 5 is one of the schedules I highlighted and it amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) SIS Act, to expand the duties of trustees of implement procedures to consolidate accounts accounts within a fund and consolidation is facilitate a reduction in the number of unnecessary by ensuring members avoid paying unnecessary accounts and, at the same time, This proposal was announced in September the coalition's support. It will lead to greater sense. I should point out that the industry raised Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, year and its likely interaction with the consolidation comments that the requirements of the unclaimed double-handling and complexity in this GST by instalments, albeit a zero-instalment is to address an issue in the current law which excluded from the GST instalment system, when lose the compliance-cost advantages of statement, annually. It otherwise has to be entities that use the instalment option and to continue to pay their GST instalments and advantages they see in annual reporting. in the GST instalment system provides the not having to complete a quarterly BAS.

It will in an ongoing sense. There will be some they will choose the overall benefits to these amendments, albeit quite technically and support.

It amends list of deductible gift recipients by adding six Congress of Australia's First Peoples Limited, Incorporated, the ANZAC Centenary Public Project Incorporated and Philanthropy memorandum that the financial impact of these forward estimates-in fact, $8.6 million I think at the start that deals with superannuation Act 1993, known colloquially as the particular superannuation funds to establish and where a member of a fund has multiple in the member's best interests.

It is a measure that has efficiencies and less red tape, in an ongoing several concerns in the hearing of the Joint inquiring into unclaimed money late last process.

Those are some coordination, consultation and policy processes, accounts can be designed once and holistically, minimum. I turn to the last three schedules. superannuation, and with it the Gillard government Howard government superannuation co-contribution have the government's maximum co-contribution down to $500. Under the Howard government, income earners was up to $1,500. It also, matching rate by half, from the current dollar-for-dollar in by the low-income earner.

This is yet to their word to not change superannuation, illustration of the tendency of those opposite then cut benefits for lowand middle-income black holes.

To provide a bit of history and context, offsets did have some merit, but I cannot help feed its massive spending addiction.

In fact, would find something in this bill that relates to the schedules but I am going to concentrate on a a little bit of time on. It amends the film tax and clarifies that game shows are not tax offsets to encourage expenditure on films The producer offset, for example, requires a for different genres, but the level required is specifically about documentaries. Screen the producer offset, which involves assessing set out in division 376.65 of the Income Tax the name of that act.

Again, it is very issues that can arise and the unintended consequences I want to look to some of the guidance Counsel, specifically the issue of causes of There are some very useful documents that I is tuning in and is interested in the development very useful documents published by the Office able to be accessed.

So I think it is very appropriate that to account for things such as these. have in the bill itself some notes to state why that goes to an issue that I will talk about in It is a real tribute to the drafting quality very useful notes. I would also like to point out or redundant amendments or errors appropriate that we look at the wide range of that can often arise from such errors. that is given by the Office of Parliamentary legal complexity and strategies to address them. think all members of this place and anyone who of statute law would be interested in some of Parliamentary Counsel that are very readily of the causes of legal complexity because I some of the drivers of complexity in legislation which I think are useful to quote.  a tendency to respond to events with legislative address the issues  pressure to prepare legislation in constrained legislation drafted rather than making it clear  an aversion to principles-based legislation leading small variations in circumstances Principles based legislation is the underlying  an aversion to judicial discretion, so that the courts law fashion, and  an aversion to official discretion, so that officials I think it is also very useful to look at a couple Counsel outlines to address the causes of complexity. rules. They mention things such as consulting process; making sure legislation is comprehensible-enabling sure instructing officers have access to the where it is necessary, review entire legislation. I think it is very important to note, particularly have been caused by amending acts, that amendments to existing legislation, and department may be working on several items legislation, and a lack of coordination I also think it is useful to examine some today in terms of a strategy for statue law revision. by Jonathan Teasdale in the European Journal I know people are very eager to read it. It some really good points. He talks about how United Kingdom in the 1860s, and it had enactments that had ceased to be enforced or revised edition of what they called live statutes, consolidated version of a particular statute. I agree with the conclusion that is set out His conclusion is: … statute law 'revision' delivers I think that is a very apt description of what take the time to quote, because I think it is place are lawmakers and we should look Teasdale says that statute law is enacted that it must be physically accessible, reliable says that the user needs to be able to access date, and which makes sense. These are governed through representative and binding democracy. to remember, and to remind ourselves, that changes even when legislation is not necessary to timeframes, so that the focus becomes getting the to a tendency to have rules that accommodate very mantra of the Westminster system. They go on: are not left to evolve detailed rules in a commonare not left to evolve administrative practice. of the strategies the Office of Parliamentary Again, I think these are useful universal drafters early in the policy development people to read bills-making necessary training and guidance materials; and, since we are looking at some problems that amending legislation often makes patchwork in some cases more than one area of the same of legislation that amend the principal would have detrimental outcomes. of the techniques that have led to where we are I took the time to have a look at an article of Law Reform. I will give the citation because is in volume 11, No. 2, page 157. Teasdale makes statue law revision started systematically in the two aims: to remove from the statute books that had become unnecessary, and to produce a which I think today would equate to a very succinctly in Jonathan Teasdale's abstract. more than the sum of its parts … this particular bill before us does.

This budget has finally got there, and should the state government for agreeing infrastructure. But the budget went further in F3 pretty much from Tuggerah right up to Doyalson. the significant part of the F3 that goes through causing the very difficult commute that 45,000 be that much more difficult.

We have just celebrated our dam time in 30 years. This would not have occurred delivered on the Central Coast for the first water in my contribution. In looking at the budget over a period of years in my electorate and the six years that in a number of ways. We have gone from flagpoles health budgets to super GP clinics and our something we have been after for years. We have gone from the infamous rort of money for in terms of an environmental program to help going from copper wire to fibre with the when clearly the program that this government through a range of social measures. They should these are the things that we want to do and it is But, compared to the rest of the world, look taken that approach they would have taken the major criticism of the government in terms of issues. Yes, there has been spin from the as we saw from the previous speaker in his what the issues are. There were two alternative them both-and this government tried. that were in this budget and in previous scene of putting this budget, quite rightly, in for the people of the Central Coast, where I to fixing the missing road link between lights create a logjam as more than 45,000 to Sydney and back every day.

We were able to secure over $80 million from the catchment area and take it up to the having more than 50 per cent water for the first without vital infrastructure being paid for and time, and I will come back to the importance of time. I did a comparison between the previous six will be up later this year. You can characterise it to libraries. We have gone from cutting own area health service for the Central Coast, have gone from drought to drought-proofing. We Tumby Creek to significant millions of dollars fix up Tuggerah Lakes. We are in the process of NBN. These are stark differences between what happened when there was a coalition member able to achieve in the last six years. These are and that is what budgets are primarily about-they going to the right places. I want to briefly go back to the issue of the moment by mining interests. We have which this pipeline goes and we have a proposal federal elections, the major parties have come going to stop the mine,' and then, as soon as the table. The reason that we have a real issue estimating that there will be more water lost rainfall for the area. The experts have said that for the aquifers to be refilled to supply the water Significantly, in relation to government investment, proofed the Central Coast that could drop meaning all that important drought-proofing that investment in the Central Coast would be for nought.

As the of that record over the last six years. (Time budget is the one that broke a nation's faith. the background of the Treasurer's opening was to the effect of 'Tonight I deliver a budget A year later, there are no four surpluses in of those years had a $19 billion deficit. The and then an over-$10 billion deficit. Then, in surplus-which is an entirely fictional figure. two reasons, because somebody has to pay back the debt. Every family knows this. Every smallknows this. And every responsible government the debt. Since the election of the ALP in 2007 what they promised; not what they pledgeda $47 billion deficit, a $43 billion deficit of an $18 billion deficit, for the sixth about returning the budget to surplus on average it comes after a similar period of deficit under here are 12 major successive deficits on either 12 budgets, delivered 10 surpluses. there is a fundamental difference between two are just terribly lucky and the ALP are terribly govern in good times and we always govern more than $20 billion surplus. They inherited a and they have sent our deficit to the bottom. They have created a national debt which will alone. Gross debt is inevitably likely These figures have consequences, because opportunity foregone. And who can say that which have delivered long-term permanent reductions just gone. I lived through the pink batts program for clunkers announced and abolished. I saw I saw nine consecutive changes in the carbon year. All of this money that has gone has not produced had been spent with a purpose-if it had irresponsible to have done this to the national something. Sadly, we have an absence of infrastructure massive process of consecutive budget deficits never seen in Australia. These dollar deficits are the five highest background we have this fiction of a surplus and then roughly $6 billion in 2016-17. Both any analysis. On the first grounds we have soar one thousand per cent. Those figures cannot benchmarked against the Howard era rather gone from barely a couple of boats Those are two fundamental flaws, where particular area we have seen a $6 billion black against projections in 2015-16, which would 2016-17 which, on its own, would What is the basis of this? The basis is cannot be believed. The government knows it. defence, they have actually made it clear that what they were required, as policy statements, knows that the government's carbon tax How can this be? Already in this year's budget for the year down. That is because the budget had relied turns out that the European price for that period projected. The EUAs, European Union forward June 2016, are currently trading at a figure we have already seen a write-down in revenue written it down to a projected price of $12.10 ask how could they have a figure which is more the basis for the revenue they have calculated which is more than triple what the market is 17? The answer is very simple. It is helpfully now head towards $190 billion in net terms to exceed the $300 billion figure. there is interest and repayment, and there is there have been fabulous infrastructure programs in national bottlenecks? The money has and the green loans program. I saw the cash the citizens' assembly announced and abolished. tax in its structural performance in just under a anything of great national significant. If it achieved an outcome-it would have been balance sheet but at least we would have had and an absence of outcomes for this on a grand scale, the likes of which we have deficits in Australian history. So, against that in 2015-16 at $0.8 billion-or $800 millionof those figures are also deeply susceptible to seen that the mining tax revenue is projected to be trusted. Secondly, the arrival of boats are than against the Rudd and Gillard era. We have a year to 40,000 arrivals in four years. the figures cannot be believed. But in my hole on the basis of a $2 billion revenue gap wipe away the surplus, and a $4 billion gap in almost wipe away the surplus. very simple. The carbon tax revenue projections The bureaucracy knows it. In the bureaucracy's these are not their real projections; these are to put into budget paper no. 1. And the public revenue projections cannot be believed. just passing, 2012-13, we have a $5 billion writeon a $29 price for carbon in 2015-16. It now is just under $6 rather than the $29 that was allowances for 2015-16 for tendering on 30 well under A$6, in the mid-$5.50. That means that of $5 million. But the government has only in 2015-16 and $18.60 in 2016-17. Then you than double what the market is projecting as in the budget? How can you have a figure projecting for the second of those years, 2016set out at page 2-48 of Budget Paper No. 1. In terms of the explanation under box 9 of updated the bureaucracy has made it absolutely clear that projections; these are what they These advance auctions in the Budget forecast prices for 2013-14 and 2014-15. However, carbon forecasts of carbon prices. It goes on to say: Projections for carbon prices for emissions liabilities straightforward approach of a linear transition from $38 in 2019-20 … It goes on: The longer-term modelled carbon prices from SGLP global environmental goals as well as the In other words, these are not market projections working back from what the government requires the carbon tax. My point and our point is very clear: the year and we were right. The revenue forecasts was not a collapse in revenue. Revenue expected. The only failing was that the government, TattsLotto. They spent as if they would win they suddenly claimed that revenue had collapsed. government receipts last year. They are projecting receipts this year. Any business which had gross revenue would see itself in a very good position. That then leads me to the final conclusion but this year the government has failed to learn a carbon price estimate in revenue, which is and triple what the market projects in 2016-17, That means a $2-billion black hole in 2015-16 figures cannot be believed. They were wrong meantime, we have the highest electricity taxes driving up electricity prices with enormous livestock council today. These taxes are driving driving up the cost to manufacturers and to and manufacturing in this country. There is electricity price rises-14½ per cent on average, After 1 July 2015, if you believe this government, electricity prices will continue to skyrocket all comes about from the folly of tying our national to decisions taken in Brussels. I have no issue with abandoning our sovereignty over our those reasons, whilst we will not stand in country to suffer from instability, we think carbon price estimates, what we see is that these are not their figures; these are not their were required to put in place. years are based upon average EU-ETS market futures prices in the Budget projection years are not for 2015-16 and 2016-17 incorporate the market prices in 2014-15 to the modelled price of reflect the price levels required to meet long-term international commitment pledges for 2020 … of what the market price will be. These are in order to meet its emissions targets using budget is fundamentally broken. We said this last were wildly over inflated for the budget. There came in at what people would reasonably have the ALP, predicted that they would win TattsLotto and when they did not win TattsLotto It did not. They had six per cent growth in seven per cent growth in government six and seven per cent growth year-on-year in that not only have they failed in past projections from their past failures. So the fact that we see twice what the market had projects in 20 2015-16 shows that there is no connection to reality. and $4-billion black hole in 2016-17. The last year. They are wrong this year. In the in the world. The Australian government is damage to abattoirs. I met with the meat and up the cost to aluminium smelters. They are car makers-to everybody involved in fabrication a massively high impact on them because of the according to the Australian Industry Group. one of two things will happen: either or there will be a massive budget black hole. This revenue and our national electricity prices issue with the European Union, but I do have an electricity prices and our national budget. For the way of supply because we do not wish the this budget should be condemned on the basis that it is established and founded on forecasts which tax beginning on day one because, above all our competitiveness but it fails utterly to achieve do the job economically; it does not do the our emissions, achieve our outcomes, without actually clean up the environment on a lowest tax in the world today and a collapse",220
29,Mr SECKER,BILLS," of this chamber, we have experienced three government, then under the Hawke-Keating They tried to come up with all sorts of excuses my homework'. There is the excuse that the revenue in 2013-14 is over $80 billion higher government, just six years ago; but spending higher but spending is $120 billion higher. not a revenue problem, and so it cannot The Australian people deserve better than hard for their money and deserve a credible keep running up record debts and deficits, people and experience to get this country already accumulated under this government, to pay the interest charges on that debt. In love to have $1 million to spend in their community, well, it does not actually pay off the debt; When we look at this budget, we see that the rise in the cost of living. The budget will over the next four years, and 99 per cent of The coalition does have a plan to take the pressure the carbon tax. Abolishing the carbon tax will that will provide much needed relief to household benefit by fully retaining the income tax cuts associated with that carbon tax. This is a commitment by equivalent reductions in government spending-something seem to understand. The Productivity Commission will also be more flexible for people like shift workers, system. The coalition do get it when it comes important it is to take the pressure off family done with the right economic plan. Only this Labor government could invent destroys confidence. The forecast revenues billion to $3.3 billion over the first four years. any meaningful revenue so far, Wayne Swan's cannot be believed. We will repeal the carbon else, not only is it poor economics and poor for the task of reducing emissions. It does not job environmentally. Ultimately, we can reduce a carbon tax by doing direct things which cost basis rather than having the highest carbon in budget revenue in 2015-16. As I was saying in the previous sitting large areas of debt-firstly under the Whitlam government and now under this government. that really resembled things like 'the dog ate government has a revenue problem. In fact, than it was in the last year of the coalition is $120 billion higher. So revenue is $80 billion The government really has a spending problem, use that lame excuse with any credibility. the empty 'surplus' promise and spin. They work economic strategy. Australia cannot afford to and only a coalition government has the right back on track.

This budget also assumes that boat arrivals the next four years, despite arrivals now at boats. The coalition has the experience and the done it before. We can do it again. Remember, a solution. The current government inherited boats, we need rigorous offshore processing temporary protection visas and we need to give where it is safe to do so. Labor, unfortunately, has no interest in communities dependent on agriculture. Labor strained resources and has cut millions from CRCs are funded each year and, as most of the less funding for agriculture. Labor has also hundreds of millions of dollars and has refused of the floods in many states. Labor has cut cargo-screening resources at cargo consignments being inspected each arrival. That puts our security at risk. Labor within the CSIRO and closed CSIRO agricultural Western Australia. We all know that Labor's Indonesian abattoirs severely damaged our $1 and threatened jobs. The coalition will stop farmers, regional more for electricity and gas, by abolishing the industry, as it has in the past.

Overall, it has cost taxpayers more than years of the Howard government it was costing will phase down-that is the term used-over a record and increasing level. We need to stop the right plan to stop the boats-after all, we have John Howard inherited a problem and crafted a solution and created a problem. To stop the for illegal arrivals.

It is going through the roof that is sack people and take away wages and the Opposition talk about a tax review and about they will do. They will increase the GST. It is the first speech. Look at Tony Abbott, the Leader of words. He talked about how people's personal means over here is that they will be pushing cent. They have never been able to come out absolutely categorically it will not happen-and because they know they cannot. They have already had discussions with their GST.

There will always be a Royal placed within that Palmerston area to service the the scoping study will be available for public scrutiny and inspection. We think that really the plans that demographic forecast for the area satisfactorily. Does that sound like a government that is not think so. But as we know, Labor never fully that the health needs of Darwin, Palmerston and future. That is why it is really important that study, which the health minister said they are going to do. There is a lot of scaremongering that is saying that we are not committed to the Palmerston Territory government is committed to the hospital. always been committed to the hospital. What that was promised by the Gillard Labor government money. You cannot build a hospital for $70 absolutely important. As I said, I have always because I live in Palmerston. I was at the very hospital was first conceived. So I want to hospital is not at risk despite the scaremongering people's letterboxes. Please, do not be deceived hospital is not at risk. I would like to move now to something that asked me to raise the road funding that the Labor government's budget because the 2013 Program 2, was terrible for the Northern Territory allocation was down by almost 50 per cent. almost 50 per cent from the Nation Building $474 million for the period 2008-09 to 2012-13. equates to a cut of $230 million. This, as Northern Territory's road infrastructure budget industry. This could also potentially lead to cannot afford to carry the burden. The Australian commitments. The second point I would like to make is years of the program. The government are making now, but $183.6 million, which is about 75 per 2016-17 financial year. This makes some of the my electorate-the duplication of the Tiger The regional roads productivity program is minister for infrastructure flew into Darwin 'We're spending all this money', as if it was smarter than that. They know that this government this money is not going to be available until have to stump up their part of this expenditure Territory Labor government left them with $5.5 quite difficult for the Territory government Labor put forward really don't take into account the committed to the Palmerston hospital? I do not explored the range of options available to ensure the rural area were properly serviced into the the Giles government undertakes this scoping going on in Palmerston from the Labor candidate hospital. Well I put on the record that the I am a member of the coalition and I have we have got to remember is that the $70 million for a hospital is actually not enough million and that is why the scoping study is been committed to the Palmerston hospital first community meeting when the idea of the assure people of Darwin and Palmerston that the that the Labor candidate is putting out into by Labor's scaremongering. The Palmerston is at risk. My colleagues and the chief minister Northern Territory received from this Gillard federal budget, particularly the Nation Building in a number of ways. Firstly, the overall This was evidenced by the NBP 2 being cut by Program 1. Nation Building Program 1 totalled The NBP 2 totalled $244 million, which anyone would expect, is a massive blow to the for civil construction and for the transport job losses because the Northern Territory simply government should carry its share of that the NBP2 spend is pushed out into the later out that they are spending all this money cent of the spend, is not available until the key projects difficult, and one of them is in Brennan Drive from Woolner to Berrimah Road. potentially impacted. But, despite that, the with the Labor candidates-and it was like: going to happen tomorrow. But Territorians are is leading them up the garden path and that 2016-17. Unfortunately, the Giles government now. They are suffering because the former billion worth of debt. So, financially, it is to stump up the money straight away. I am surprised that Minister Snowdon was of these projects, because some of the projects Lingiari. There is no new capital expenditure and this is despite the Northern Territory worth around $522 million. These projects are is $40 million for flood immunity for the Saddle, Highway; $70 million for safety and fatigue intersections and safety treatment to the Highway from Dixon to the MVR in Alice Springs, electorate; $125 million for strengthening and Barkly and Victoria highways; and $180 million national network.
