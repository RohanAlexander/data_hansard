127,Ms LIVERMORE,CONDOLENCES," I was going to start my contribution by saying Paul Schembri has been elected unopposed He would be very well known to the member House. He has been the vice chairman of chair of the organisation in Mackay. He has effective advocate for the industry in all its and he will welcome the opportunity to steer faces the usual challenges of an export oriented future. It has been great to sit in on the debate so for the parliament to spend time considering the an important industry for my electorate and for Dawson. I believe all members should know the Queensland economy and, indeed, the Australian largest of all Australia's agricultural exports understand why the member for Dawson wants to defend it from perceived threats, but we industry in some kind of crisis or without a acknowledge, as I am sure others in this debate some highs in recent years. There was a five to the retailers, from the food manufacturers to healthy, balanced diet, and about encouraging has already spoken on this topic is the Dietitians that the dietitians did not come to a federal, of last year.

I wish Paul all the best in his new role the organisation at a time when the industry product and plenty of opportunities for the far. The motion tells us why it is very important status and outlook for the sugar industry. It is of course an absolutely vital one for the member that the sugar industry is a significant part of economy because it ranks as the seventh with a value of around $2 billion per year. I can to use this motion to promote the industry and should not let the debate paint a picture of an strong future. That would be misleading.

I would like to take a quick look at the action the government is called on to take. The its contribution to obesity is very hotly debated, There are calls for the government to act in question of food, nutrition and its contribution that through a very science based and evidence labelling and the Australian Dietary Guidelines, The Australian Dietary Guidelines are all about research to make these decisions. They have research, to recommend that people limit the sugars. But, beyond that, the government Dialogue-which the member for Bowman was knowing the detail of it. The Food and Health medical fraternity and industry looking at how like salt and sugar to get those health outcomes industry that the member for Dawson is concerned about. Debate adjourned.

I do training and, in some instances and in some we must put sufficient weight on maintaining the marine industry. I was pointing out the minister, but what I was about to say when time expired is that the Australian Institute of have some very legitimate concerns. I urge and I urge the Australian Maritime Safety Authority suggest that they put aside any preconceived aside plans to make the changes-changes including marine engineer from three years to one year, seem rather extraordinary. We need to get everyone back to the table, we cannot find a way forward. We do not government digging in, we do not want AMSA digging in either. We want people back at the minister is certainly a sensible person. I have advise him; I have great respect for those who respect for those who represent engineers and others. There seems to be an impasse here.
