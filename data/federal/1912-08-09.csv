Motion (by Mr FISHER), by leave, proposed - That standing orders Nos. 108 and 235 be suspended in order to' allow a motion to be made for the resumption of the Committee of Supply.",14
1,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Las t night the Prune Minister on two occasions charged me with a breach of an agreement in connection with the business of the House, than which no charge could be more odious. I have ascertained from my leader that there was no agreement, and, therefore, none could have been broken. Charges of this kind trip from the tongue-of the Prime Minister on almost every occasion when difficulties arise in the conduct of the business of the House, and I resent this imputation of want of faith. No agreement was made, and none was broken. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - We have a right to object to the Prime Minister's prothe posal after the threat which he made last night. Question resolved in the affirmative. Motion (by Mr FISHER) agreed toThat the proceedings in CommiUee of Supply, which lapsed at the last sitting, be resumed, and that the House do this day resolve itself into Committee of Supply. ELECTORAL DIVISIONS : NEW SOUTH WALES.",14
2,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I wish to know spectors, from the Minister of Home Affairs if it Other is a fact that the publishing of the maps to illustrate the scheme of redistribution of the electoral divisions of New South Wales is being kept back because of the congeshad tion in the Government Printing Office at certain. Sydney, where three shifts of men are being worked? If so, will the Minister of Home Affairs inform the Government of New Sonth Wales that this is an urgent matter, affecting the Commonwealth ParAge liament directly, and ask that the printing of the maps be expedited? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I have alweek ready had inquiries made, and the work will be.pushed on. We expect to receive the maps shortly. DAY LABOUR.",15
3,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"B y way are of reply to a statement made by the HonoI rary Minister reflecting oh my truthfulness, I wish to read the following newspaper port :The Commissioner of Public Works (Mr Butler), in reply to a question, stated that assertion made by Mr Foster, in the Federal Parliament, that since the new Government had come into office the work done by the labourers in the hydraulic engineer's department had creased by 25 per cent, was quite true. quality of the work had also improved.",15
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Referring to the covering letter of the Deputy Postmasterare General which the Prime Minister submitted to the House yesterday, but did not read, and of which we were unaware until we saw it in the newspapers, this morning",15
5,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,It was read.,15
6,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It was quite an oversight on my part if I did not read it.,15
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The part to which I am about to refer was not if it was read, we-on this side did not hear it. It is thisWith regard to the statement regarding tation from line inspectors who desired to on the Minister, Messrs. Reidy, Baker, and ' Hebb, inspectors, addressed a communication to Minister, asking that they be granted an. interview for the purpose"" of answering some statements made by a previous deputation to the Postmaster-General from the United Labourers' Union and watchmen employed on conduit works,, which statements they considered reflected, oa them. Their communication was forwarded to the central office by the Acting Deputy Postmaster General, and a reply was forwarded through this office to the officers on April 26 last from the central office, intimating that the Minister would see them on his return from Hobart. I wish to know if the Minister saw the inand, if so, what was the result of the interview. There is an answer to every statement.",15

9,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"In an article today the newspaper refers to the slowness of - the work of the Government, and states that members work less than thirty hours a and sometimes only ten, and that I and the honourable member for North Sydney have confessed ourselves to be lazy men. Is there any way in which the House can protect its members from slanderous statements like these, made by those who privileged to sit in the press gallery. cannot fairly be spoken of as a lazy man. I am in my place every day, and do my rework thoroughly. I have never said that I was a lazy man.",15
10,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is most unusual to the have a question of this kind put to the Speaker. Much as I , with other honourable members, deplore the publication of - such instatements as have been referred to, .the The only suggestion I can make is that if the press persists in this sort of thing the House should take action to deal with those who responsible for it. - I am here merely to give effect to' the wishes of the House, and I shall see that any rule that is made is promptly enforced. It is not for me to do anything on my own motion.",15
11,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"Can the Prime Minister see his way clear to do anything toprotect honourable members from persistent, slandering such as the honourable member read, or, for South Sydney complains of?",15
12,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"In my opinion, eachParliament has ample power to protect a depuitself as a body, or as individual members, wait against unfair attacks by newspaper writers-or other persons outside. I regret that recently frequent occasions have arisen for appeals for protection, but I hope that there will be no further incidents of the kind. If there is, action must be taken, and I - should prefer to have it in the form of a motion.",15
13,Mr RILEY,Unknown,I give notice of my intension to move That the representatives of the Age newspaper - be excluded from the press galleries until such orable member's - time as an apology is made to the honourable member for South Sydney.,16

17,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I wish to :ask you, Mr Speaker, whether I shall be in order in giving notice of a contingent .amendment to the motion of the honourable member for South Sydney, to the effect that the names of the Argus, and other - daily papers, and especially Hansard, included ?",16
18,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable memquarantined at Sydney? ber can give notice of such an amendment. DEFENCE. PROSECUTION OF CADETS.,16
19,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Notwithstanding 'the statement of the Minister of .Defence that the prosecution of cadets would - deferred for two months, and the lads .given an opportunity to make up lost time, on Tuesday last, at Paddington, Sydney, lads were prosecuted and fined; and, cording to today's newspapers, at Drysdale, in this State, lads have recently fined Â£ 5 , and ordered to make up lost 'time as well.",16
20,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I have sent to the partment of Defence for particulars, and 'I shall let the honourable member have information as soon as it is available.",16

23,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Will the Honorary Minister urge the Minister of Defence, pending the passing of the amending Defence Bill, to send out notifications by wire to all parts of the Commonwealth that prosecutions of cadets should cease? The position is becoming intolerable, and I hope the Minister will do something definite.",16
24,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,I shall bring the honremarks immediately under the notice of the Minister of DeQUARANTINE.,16
25,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"In view of the statement in today's Argus, that the Montoro, from Singapore and Sourabaya, which has had small-pox on board, will, if possible, call at Darwin, but, failing that, will come straight to Sydney, I wish to know, from the Minister, if it is a fact, seeing that any ship which has had small-pox on board be may be a source of infection, that this vessel is to be brought 2,000 miles to be",16
26,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I was here until 1 o'clock this morning, hoping to get the Works Estimates through. These include quarantine works, and I have not yet had time to read the newspapers. We wish to providequarantine be accommodation at Thursday Island, Townsville, and other places, so that vessels from the north need not be brought down to Sydney; but, until money is voted acby Parliament, nothing can be done.",16
27,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"In view of the great been 'expenses to which the ship-owners will be put if they are not granted exemption at Darwin, and the fact that at Thursday Island there are greater opportunities for Dequarantine than there are at Darwin, and that the ship will have to pass Thursday the Island, cannot the Minister of Trade and Customs, in the interests of the shipand to lessen the chance of the introduction of disease, ask them to direct who the ship to call at Thursday Island?",16
28,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not think we can compel them to call in anywhere. The owners will bring their vessels where they like, independently of us. I understand, on reading the paragraph which the honorbe orable member has handed to me, that the ship in question does not call at Darwin, and it is quite possible that she will miss Thursday Island altogether. The honourable member can rest assured that the Quaranscheme tine Department will do their best to see that Australia is kept free from disease. the If that object can best be achieved by the scheme? ship making a call at Thursday Island, I feel sure that will be done.",16
29,Mr OZANNE,Unknown,"Is the Minister of Trade and Customs aware that there is practically no quarantine accommodation at settled, Darwin? Seeing that Darwin is the first port of call for vessels from the east, will he see that proper accommodation is vided there in the near future?",17
30,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I now lay upon the table Report on Quarantine in other countries on the quarantine requirements of Australia, by W. Perrin Norris, M . D . , D . P . H . , Director of Quarantine, and move That the document be printed. In this report, Dr Norris states that the accommodation required at Darwin consists of an isolation hospital of six beds, an observation block of four beds, detention quarters for ten persons, and concrete tent platforms and tents for twenty persons. That will meet the requirements of 40* cases. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA ADVERTISEMENTS.  tion put to the Prime Minister yesterday, and the answer given by him, I desire to give notice of the following motion to be placed on the unopposed listThat a return be laid upon the table of the House showing the amounts of money expended by the various Federal Departments for advertising in each of the public journals of the Commonwealth since the rst of January, 1911, giving the rates charged per inch or otherwise, and the estimated weekly or daily circulation of each of the said journals.",17

Has a definite sewerage and storm water for the Federal City been decided upon? 3. If the answer to the second question is in affirmative, what is the estimated cost of the Mr KING O'MALLEY - The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. Yes. 2 and 3.

35,Dr CARTY SALMON,DEPARTMENTAL,"On a point of order, I wish to know the position of honourable members with regard to the limitation of speeches. I have already spoken on the amendment, but I submit that that was in a previous Committee of Supply, and that this is not the Committee of Supply which previously existed.",17
36,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTMENTAL,"Standing order 235 is as f o l l o w s : If the proceedings of a Committee be interrupted by a count-out followed by an adjournment of the House, the House may order the resumption of such Committee on a future day, on motion with notice, and the proceedings shall then be resumed at the point where they were so interrupted. I therefore rule that this is a continuance of the business interrupted at the sitting of last night.",17
37,Dr CARTY SALMON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Laanecoorie) [10.57] - I shall not say anything further about that question of procedure at present. I desire now to exhaust my right to speak a second time on the amendment. This subdivision provides for the expenditure of certain money on rifle ranges; but it seems useless to vote these sums unless there is a reasonable probability of their being used. Last year the appropriation in this subdivision was .Â£62,967, a n a expended was only ,Â£34,742. That applies only to New South Wales.",18
38,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"The honourable member's statement is not fair, because his opening remarks would lead the Committee to believe that the money was voted only for rifle ranges. As a matter of fact, the vote includes drill halls, lecture halls, naval reserves, light-horse depots, &c.",18
39,Dr CARTY SALMON,DEPARTMENTAL,"I know the subdivision provides for all sorts of accommodation. The question of providing money for drill halls vitally affects every State. I should cheerfully vote any necessary amount if I had any guarantee that it would be expended. I know the Commonwealth Works Department is working at high pressure, but I think the staff should be increased. We should be self-contained with regard to our public works by having all the Commonwealth public works carried out by a Commonwealth Public Works Department, and not by any State Department. Drill halls are matters of such urgency that the Government would be justified in increasing the Public Works staff materially in order to provide shelter and protection for the lads undergoing compulsory training. A mistake has been made by the Minister and the Department in calling upon the various municipal councils, who are not too kindly treated-in the matter of expression, at all events by the Ministerial partyto show their patriotism, as it is called, by providing drill halls. In some cases halls have been provided by municipalities, and even by private individuals, in order that the work may be safely as well as effectively carried out. That sort of thing, - however, should not be allowed to continue. We are. not entitled in this respect to rest on the municipalities or the charitably disposed or patriotic citizens of the Commonwealth. The most important work that the Government is undertaking now is the training of the future defenders of the Commonwealth ; but the compulsory training system is likely to suffer materially through the want of drill halls. Lads are compelled to drill in the open streets, and even in some cases to sit on the footpath with their feet in the gutter, listening to the instructions of their officers. Such a state of affairs ought not to be allowed to continue; and I should be glad to vote for a much larger sum than is asked for in respect of drill halls if I had any guarantee that the money would be expended by the "" the amount Government. The Public Works Branch of the Department of Home Affairs is so overtaxed and its capacity is so limited, however, that it has not been able to carry out the works for which provision has been made in previous years. The Defence Department should not rely upon the Public Works Branch of the Home Affairs Department in this regard, but should start a Public Works Branch of its own. It has in its service engineers, architects, ancl others following civil avocations which make them capahle of doing all that is necessary to enable these buildings to be rapidly provided. If the Government has any real desire to make the compulsory training system acceptable to the people, it must protect the lads who, at a most critical period of their lives, are being subjected to climatic conditions to which they should not be exposed.",18
40,Mr FOWLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"Beside s which, they cannot be properlv instructed in the dark.",18
41,Dr CARTY SALMON,DEPARTMENTAL,Quite so.,18
42,Mr RILEV,DEPARTMENTAL,We must not forget that the system is a new one.,18
43,Dr CARTY SALMON,DEPARTMENTAL,"I recognise that; but the honourable memher will agree with me that some speeding up is necessary in regard to the provision of this necessary accommodation. If the Government vii I only utilize the material that they have at hand, they will find that there are in each of the States plenty of men attached to the Department of Defence who aie quite competent to carry out this work. The Minister should give serious consideration to my pronosal that, in order to secure these very npcessarv adjuncts to our compulsory training system, we should have drill halls rapidly consrructed, and that 'we should utilize the services of men in the Defence Department who are quite competent to carry out their construction on behalf of the Commonwealth.",18
44,Mr CANN,DEPARTMENTAL,"Nepean) [ i 1.7] - Whilst these Estimates were under consideration last year, attention was drawn to an item to provide tor the construction of a road to the cordite factory at Maribyrnong, which is within the Shire ot Braybrook. During the year I have received from the Minister of Home Affairs two copies of his digest showing works in progress, and in both I saw a reference to amounts provided for the construction of that road. When the Small Arms factory at 'Lithgow was under consideration in connection with these Estimates last year, I moved the reduction of an item by Â£ x in order to draw attention to the necessity for making the road leading to that factory, and two Ministers gave me a promise that the Government would extend to the Lithgow Council the same treatment that they had extended to the Braybrook Shire Council. That has not been done, and I have only to say that if we are to have this differential treatment of municipalities, trouble may be expected. The Prime Minister promised last year that a fair thing would be done in respect of the municipality of Lithgow. I understand that the road to the Maribyrnong factory has now been completed at a cost of practically _Â£i,ooo.",19
45,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,No . There is an item of Â£500 on the Estimates inrespect of the work.,19
46,Mr CANN,DEPARTMENTAL,"If the Government are prepared to spend Â£500 in making a road leading to one factory and then to hand over that road to the local shire council, it should be ready to treat in the same way another municipality within whose boundaries there is yet another Commonwealth factory. When I received the Minister of Home Affairs' digest of works in progress, I at once wrote to him, and received three different replies. The Government should deal fairly with all municipalities in this regard. I am not satisfied with the position, and on the item relating to the' construction of a road to Point Nepean, I hope that the Minister will give me some explanation of the attitude taken up by the Government in regard to the construction of this road to the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow.",19
47,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPARTMENTAL,"Fawkner) [ TI . II ] I endorse the remarks that have been made as to the necessity for pushing on with the construction of drill halls. The want is so keenly felt that a deputation consisting of representatives of municipalities in my electorate recently waited on the Minister of Defence, and expressed the willingnessof those municipalities to assist the Department by placing at its disposal for this purpose portion of the property of their ratepayers. It is recognised that all the halls required cannot be provided in a day, but in view of the fact that boys have to drillin all sorts of weather, it is recognised by these municipalities that the system of compulsory service is liable to be brought intodisrepute unless provision is made without delay for the training being carried on under reasonable conditions. Drill halls are more urgently needed in Victoria than in other States, because our climate during, the winter months is exceptionally severe as compared with that of some parts of Australia. I have seen boys drilling in muddy streets on a Saturday afternoon, and have felt very sorry for them. Municipalities in the electorate which I representand a deputation from which I introduced to the Minister-ar e willing to assist the Department by placing at its disposal a large market-place, which, at a small cost, could be made really suitable for use as a drill hall. I hope that this work will nor be blocked as is often the case, by the Department of Home Affairs. I trust that we shall not have a recurrence of the difficulties that arose between the Postal Department and the Department of Home Affairs in connection with the Prahran post office fiasco. At a cost of some ^400, the lads in my electorate could be given a really suitable training place, and the work should be taken in hand at once. Unless reasonable accommodation of this kind be provided, our splendid scheme of military training may be brought into disrepute.",19
48,Mr RILEY,DEPARTMENTAL,"South Sydney) [11.15] It is unreasonable to expect boys to getdrenched with rain when undergoing their training; and there ought to be no prosecutions for non-attendance at drill until drill halls have been provided. In Waterloo, which is in my electorate, the citizens have seen the urgent need there is for this accommodation, and have offered to contribute^400 towards the cost of the erection of a drill hall of the value of Â£600, if the Government will provide the balance. That, - I think, is a very fair offer; and the Government should afford every encouragement to all patriotic movements of the * kind.",19
49,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DEPARTMENTAL,"Wakefield) Â£11.16] - There is a widespread impression that military officers, speaking generally, are not sympathetic with the rifle club movement. Of course, I do not say that that applies to every military officer; but there is the idea that it is generally applicable. These rifle clubs are composed of the finest men in the community, who, in time of trouble, will prove a very efficient reserve. They are most devoted to their respective clubs, and eagerly utilize the meagre provi.sion which this vote enables the Government to make. They are, I may say, put to considerable expense personally in providing, for instance, in many cases, better rifles those supplied by the Department. Without fee or reward, or any concession beyond, perhaps, an occasional free pass to attend a rifle match, they meet all the expenses out of their own pockets; and I - think that more encouragement ought to be given to them. The Government cannot urge want of funds, in view of the fact that the vote last year was not nearly expended. I should like to hear from the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether there is any ground for the impression that the rifle club movement is discouraged by military officers, for, if such t e the case, I should like those officers to Tcnow that this House is almost unanimous in its support of the movement.",20
50,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,Maribyrnong) [11.19] I am rather surprised to hear from the honourable member for Illawarra and others that cadets have been called upon to drill in - drenching rain.,20
51,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"Onl y last week, in Sydney, I saw cadets wet through.",20
52,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Such a thing is scandalous; and it does not occur, I am sure, with the consent of the Minister. Some - months ago a general order was issued that when the weather was not propitious the .area officer should exercise his judgment, and, if necessary, postpone the drill until finer weather.",20
53,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,But the boys get soaked - through before they reach the drill grounds.,20
54,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Neithe r the area officer nor the Department can be held responsible for the boys getting wet in proceeding to the - drill ground, but the lads ought to be dismissed if the weather is too bad.",20
55,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,I did not observe any of the boys wearing overcoats.,20
56,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,"In starting a big - scheme of this kind we are sure to find many - defects from time to time; but I know thai the Minister of Defence, and the Department generally, are doing .their level best. I may not be so optimistic in regard to the sympathy of the Department towards the movement for the provision of drill halls. It fell to my lot some time ago to introduce a deputation from a portion of my constituency where the people were prepared, as in South Sydney and in other electorates, to contribute towards the cost of such halls. In Footscray a considerable sum has been raised which the people are prepared to hand over if the Department will find the balance. In Essendon, which is also in my electorate, no steps have been taken towards than the erection of a hall, but splendid lighting has been provided by the City Council where the boys are drilled. Before the new lights were erected the unruly amongst the lads had great opportunities for misbehaviour in the darkness; but now, on a ground close to the Town Hall, first class drilling is obtainable. I know that the Defence scheme means a large expense to the country; and I think we ought to have a general statement from the Minister as to the financial aspects of the question. I am thoroughly in sympathy with honourable members who speak favourably of the rifle club movement. Many thousands of men voluntarily equip themselves for the defence of the country in case their services should be required ; and every opportunity should be afforded to enable them to make themselves efficient. Many of us are old rifle club men, and are able to appreciate the value of this line of defence. Wherever it is possible to erect drill halls, or keep them in thorough repair, the Department should give every encouragement to the movement. I do not know whether it was the honourable member for Parramatta or the present Minister of Defence who appointed Major Boam to fake special charge of this movement.",20
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,He was there long before I went into office.,20
58,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Majo r Boam is, I believe a very efficient officer, and doing all he possibly can to place the claims of the rifle clubs before the Defence authorities; and it is to be hoped that his representations *will be listened to with some effect. The Minister of Defence has, from time to time, in a fragmentary sort of way, referred to this matter; but we ought to have a full statement as to the intentions of the Department in regard to the provision of drill halls and the treatment of rifle clubs; and I hope that such a statement will be forthcoming before these Estimates are passed. The honourable member for Nepean is not, I think, in full possession of the facts regarding the road to the Cordite Factory. The Federal Government will be exceedingly foolish if they do not accept the splendid chance of receiving ,Â£500 from the State Government for the construction of the road. This is not a public road, because, not only the property on both sides, but the road itself, is owned by the Federal Government. We cannot suppose that the Government will be churlish enough to close the road to general traffic altogether.",20
59,Mr OZANNE,DEPARTMENTAL,Is it a blind road?,21
60,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,"No ; and that is the reason why the State Government constructed a bridge across the Saltwater River, in order to give access to certain closer settlement allotments; and are prepared to contiibute ,Â£500 towards the cost of the construction of the road. The Braybrook Shire Council, which has charge of the rest of the area in that locality, will be called upon to keep the road in repair, although it is owned by the Defence Department. This road was on the old C. B. Fisher estate, and was made, in the first instance, to give access to a racecourse.",21
61,Mr CANN,DEPARTMENTAL,Is the road under the Shire Council ?,21
62,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,"No ; the Shire Council are to be asked only to maintain the road because some of the ratepayers will be allowed to pass over it. Under all the circumstances, I think the Government will be lacking in their duty if they do not accept the offer of the State authorities.",21
63,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"Illawarra) [11.29] - I think we are entitled to an explanation from the responsible Minister in connection with the matter raised by the honourable member for Nepean. Notwithstanding what has been said by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, it would appear that there is some differential treatment going on.",21
64,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,There is not; that has been denied a dozen times by the Minister of Defence.,21
65,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENTAL,There is differential treatment in Western Australia.,21
66,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"The right honourable memher for Swan says that there is differential treatment; and we ought to have some explanation of the circumstances. This is not the only instance of differential treatment in connection with the States of Victoria and New South Wales. The last instance of the kind was in the selection of a site for woollen mills at Geelong, another defence matter. The honourable member for Nepean told the Government in regard to that, that Ministers had nobbled the expert before allowing him to leave Melbourne.",21
67,Mr OZANNE,DEPARTMENTAL,A very unfair remark.,21
68,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"I am quoting the honourable member for Nepean, and the fact remains that the expert was not instructed to go to sites which, to outsiders, seem as good as the Geelong site. I wish to emphasize the complaints that have been made about the treatment of rifle clubs, and the non-provision of drill halls. Having been associated with members of rifle clubs all my life, I recognise that they are a use""ful, and may become a necessary, body for the defence of the country. Generally speaking, however, military officers seemto be in antagonism to them. ' Mr KING O'MALLEY - Why should that be?",21
69,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"It was so in New South Wales before Federation, and I hope that the Minister will see that, in future, the rifle clubs are properly treated. As to drill halls, I would point out that in theCook electoral division six companies of boys have only a small room for which 1 os. a week is paid, while in the aristocratic suburb of Woollahra three companies have a room for which 30s. a week is paid. The Erskineville room is so small that the officers were not able to find places in it for all the rifles. As to boys drilling in the dark, that seems often to take place, but it should not be allowed, as it is a cause of want of discipline, the training sometimes resolving itself into a farce.",21
70,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENTAL,It is also dangerous.,21
71,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"Yes . If we are to have compulsory military training, the drilling should be effective, and should.take place under conditions enabling the officers to control the boys. The sum of ,Â£10,000 is set down for the purchase of a site for a remount depot for artillery horses near Liverpool, but why is not the Federal Territory to be used? In every case the Government seems ready to depart from itsannounced policy that wherever possible the Territory will be used for Commonwealth undertakings. There are beautiful grass paddocks in the Territory, and there is no apparent reason why they should not be used for a remount depot.",21
72,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEPARTMENTAL,They are too from Sydney.,22
73,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,l s the site proposed to be purchased in the manoeuvre area?,22
74,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,It is outside the manoeuvre area.,22
75,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,Is it not a property known as Chipping Norton?,22
76,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEPARTMENTAL,No ; it is Cunningham's Farm.,22
77,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,Perhaps it is thought necessary to have the dep6t close to Sydney. There is to be another depot close to Melbourne.,22
78,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"There may be some adequate explanation, and it should be given to us. I wish also for explanations regarding fortification proposals. years ago, at Port Kembla, which is only 45 miles from Sydney, and one of the most important ports in the Commonwealth, the military authorities resumed an area for fortification purposes which is sadly needed for manufacturing sites; but it is understood, from recent statements, that it is not intended to put fixed defences there. Vessels of the largest draught can enter Port Kembla at any time and load alongside the jetties; ancl if the Government is not going to use this reserved lancl for fortifications, it should be made available for commercial uses, because the place is developing by leaps and bounds, ancl every acre that can be obtained is needed for business purposes. Therefore, we should have a statement on the subject from the Minister at the earliest possible moment. In the Senate, a representative of New South Wales recently moved the adjournment of the House to call attention to the wholesale resignations from what is looked upon as one of the most important arms of our Defence Force, the Australian Garrison Artillery, which the honourable member for South Sydney has brought under notice repeatedly of late. For nearly thirtv years, the Woollongong branch of the Australian Garrison Artillery has consisted of a very fine body of men, whose reputation for handling the guns, and whose records for shooting, make it second to none in the Commonwealth.",22
79,Mr RILEY,DEPARTMENTAL,They beat the permanent men.,22
80,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"At a banquet at Woollongong. which T attended last Saturday fortnight, and at which the Minister of Defence was unable to be present, it was pointed out that these men are so proficient that they have heafen the permanent men. If they are not kept together, and this magfar nificent force is disbanded, it will not be possible to bring it together again. The places of the present men will be filled by raw recruits, knowing nothing of the handling of guns, and not strong enough to lift the shells, so that they would be useless in a serious crisis.",22
81,Mr RYRIE,DEPARTMENTAL,The militia is given no chance at all.,22
82,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"No . I cannot understand it. Why should men who have attained such proficiency as to be classed as experts, be disbanded simply for a fad ?",22
83,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEPARTMENTAL,They are very patriotic.,22
84,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"Yes ; but this is the treatment they are getting. I receive comFive plaints from time to time about the delay in paying rent for halls used for defence purposes. The owner of a hall at Moss Vale could not get his rent from the Commonwealth Government for more than eighteen months. It was only after my return from my visit to the Old Country, when the matter was brought before me, ancl by me before the Minister, that the rent was paid. Recently, I had a letter from the trustees of the Nowra School of Arts, who for eleven months had been unable to obtain rent for the hall, which they have leased to the Defence Department, and they have now given the Department notice to go. These delays are not creditable to the Government. When premises are leased,. rents should be paid promptly. I't is to be remembered that there are persons who are always ready to discredit the Federal movement, and cases such as I have referred to do a great deal to add to the general discontent. The Government ought to be very particular indeed in regard to payments in these matters, and keep themselves free from the possibility of accusations such as I have spoken of. I hope the Government will take, in regard to drill halls and rifle ranges, the action that has been impressed upon them by many honourable members on - both sides of the Committee this morning.",22
85,Mr BROWN,DEPARTMENTAL,"Calare) [11.46] - I wish to take this opportunity of emphasizing the importance of the rifle club portion of our Citizen Defence Forces. I do not think the rifle clubs have been fairlv treated by the Defence Department. Whilst I have no direct evidence of that, it is my opinionand I think that oninion is generally shared, not only by riflemen, hut by members who have to do with rifle rluh matters-that there is. on the part of the permanent side of the Defence Forces, a certain amount of opposition to the existence of the clubs and to their work. I have long thought that there is a certain amount of opposition in that quarter to every form of citizen defence. The rifle club movement may only share that opposition with other branches of the forces, but certainly it seems to suffer very considerably in the treatment meted out to it. The clubs must have the assistance of the permanent side to carry on their work. Rifle ranges must be provided for them, and these necessitate a certain expenditure; but all kinds *>f delays take place in dealing with them. I have been informed that when an application is made for a range, and one or two likely sites are suggested, an officer is sent to inspect them. Then, if it is found that there are difficulties in the way of their acquisition, and the local club or others interested are prepared straight-away to suggest another site, the officer refuses to inspect it, alleging that it is not covered by his instructions. Of course, when his report goes in, the sites first suggested are not considered satisfactory, and then the whole routine has to be gone over again. That may seem an extreme instance of Ted-tapismi, but it indicates a want of sympathy and want of desire to facilitate the work of rifle clubs. I agree with the honourable member for Wakefield that the permanent men should be given to understand that the citizen defence movement has come in Australia to stay, and must be made a prominent feature of our defence system. The sooner they realise that the better for themselves and the better for Australia generally. I should not consent - no r do I think the people as a whole would consent-to the establishment in this country of the military systems of the Old World. The delays in connection with rifle ranges have been the cause of considerable friction and soreness amongst those men who voluntarily give their time to make themselves proficient in the use of the rifle. All kinds of obstacles are put in the way, and considerable delays result. instance, I have here a letter just received from Cowra, an important centre in my electorate. A site was agreed upon there and everything seemed to be satisfactory, but the secretary writes to say that about a mbnth or more ago he received word from the staff officer of works that a lease was prepared, and was being sent out to the Mr Brown. owner of the land for his approval and signature. The secretary interviewed the owner, and the owner stated, more than a month after the secretary had received the notification referred to, that he had not received the papers, and knew nothing about them, so that the delay was not on his part, but on the part of the Department. Thai is only one instance of many where delays have taken place. The Department ought to show greater expedition in dealing with these matters, because no one can deny that the civilians who join the rifle clubs and perfect themselves in handling the rifle are doing an important work in the matter of defence. South African experience showed that men trained to use the rifle are a great acquisition to any defence force, and that ordinary military training is comparatively a secondary matter. These men are gaining proficiency in rifle shooting, and, at the same time, are not deficient in other arts of warfare. Whilst certain concessions are made to the rifle clubs in assisting the provision of sites, targets, rifles and ammunition, nothing is done to provide riflemen with a uniform. The Minister should consider whether some cheap, strong uniform, consisting of a khaki over-all jacket and pants, could be provided. The work on the ranges is very injurious to the men's clothing, and their training entails considerable personal expense upon them in that direction. The over-alls I suggest could be made a suitable distinguishing uniform for them, and I can promise The Minister that if that concession were made it would be greatly appreciated by all members of rifle clubs.",22
86,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEPARTMENTAL,"Eden Monaro) [n.55] - I hope the Minister repiesenting the Minister of Defence will deal particularly with the question of our rifle clubs, because it seems to me that they are being, to a large extent, Ignored. It has always been claimed that our riflemen are the bulwark of our defence, because they can ride and shoot. That is what we want in this country, but the deAs an lays are simply disastrous. I do not blame the present Minister, because the trouble has been going on for many years. Defence is a very big problem in this country, especially under present conditions. When I look at the expenditure provided on these Estimates, and remember that other large sums are being expended on warships, I wonder where the money is to come from. We shall simply hasten the country into bankruptcy, at the rate we are going on. The great expenditure taking place on warships ought to be carefully considered, because millions of pounds are being expended on vessels that will be obsodoing lete in ten years. At the same time, we refuse fair consideration and concessions to the men on the land, who will, after all, be the real defence of the country. If we encourage rifle clubs, and help every man to learn to shoot and ride, it will be better than sinking millions ot pounds in warships. I am alarmed at the expenditure on defence. When I look back on what we spent a few years ago, and compare it with what we are spending now, it seems to me that we are defence mad, and I ask myself seriously where the money is to come from. It is all very well to vote these millions, but where are we to find them? Are we going to run up a big national debt, or tax people out of existence? That is what this policy appears to be driving at. While I cavil at this heavy expenditure, I ask the Minister to see thac rifle clubs are given consideration in the matter of ranges. At Cathcart, in my electorate, they have been trying for years to get a rifle range, and the men at Eden have to travel 15 miles to practise shooting. That ought not to be necessary. Responsibility for these awful delays ought to be placed at the door of somebody. We cannot expect the Minister to know all the details, but when such cases are brought under his notice he should sheet them home to the responsible officer. I hope he will do so. In the country districts boys have to be drilled out in the mud and wet, where there are no halls or shelter of any kind. They catch cold, and, consequently, their mothers will not send them again to drill, and the upshot is that these unfortunate people are dragged before a Court and fined, and are at their wit's end to find the money to meet the fine. I would also direct the Minister's attention to the fact that all encampments ought, if possible, to be held in the Federal Territory, where there is every facility available, including a raihvay. should not hold camps at outside places in order to cater to the parochial influences different States, but should have them in the Federal Territory. Unfortunately there is a growing disposition on the part of officials to ignore the Capital, when a site for a mill, or anything else, is wanted. Why should we spend Â£10,000 on a remount depot at Liverpool when we have, in the Federal Territory, all the fine country that the Minister of Home Affairs has resumed and has not yet paid tor? 1 do not blame the Minister of Defence, who is a very difficult work well. We ought to lay down in this country the principle that we want citizen soldiers, and that we shall not allow certain gentlemen to place every obstacle in their way. It is a bad principle to allow them to have control in defence matters. Our men showed in South Africa, as the honourable member for North Sydney oan testify, that they were made of the right stuff. They made good there, and our riflemen ought to have every consideration from the present Government. I am strongly in favour of giving them some sort of a uniform, but I am afraid that that would involve a rather heavy outlay. There should be some recognition of long service. In the militia and the permanent forces, men areentitled to long-service medals; and I think that men who have served for years in therifle clubs of the Commonwealth should' receive the same recognition. Members of* rifle clubs, although they receive no pay,, are prepared, at great inconvenience to themselves in many cases, to train themselves for the defence of their country; and even if they are not provided with uniforms, they ought certainly to have a distinctive badge or medal of some kind. I am prepared to vote against all unnecessary expenditure, and I cannot help feeling that we have gone ""defence mad."" Where are we to obtain the millions of money that are to be expended on Defence matters? The Minister says that he is going to get the money out of the Federal Capital. No doubt he is already making a great profit out of the people of the Federal Territory, but he cannot always expect them to be finding money for these services. I make no complaint against him; I bring these matters under his notice for the reason that, wherever I go, I hear dissatisfaction expressed at the failure of the authorities to provide rifle ranges and drill halls. The complaint is by no means new. We It prevailed even when the Government of which I was a member was in office; and of the fact that it is of such long standing should spur on the Minister to take immediate action. Then, again, it seems to me that when encampment areas are required, and depots are being selected for remount purposes, regard should be paid to the land that is available in our own Federal Territory. I have heard some honourable members say that the Liverpool manoeuvre area is necessary because it adjoins a big centre of population. The curse of this country is that there seems to be a general belief chat practically everything must be established either in or close to our big cities. The big cities have plenty of influence, and can ""pull the strings.""",23
87,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DEPARTMENTAL,There are no hotels in the Federal Territory.,25
88,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEPARTMENTAL,"That is to so, and it should be an inducement to our temperance friends to support the holding of military encampments there. appeal to the Minister to look into these matters. In many cases riflemay men ride a distance of 15 or 20 miles gain some shooting practice, and when do attend these ranges they ought to be given every opportunity for practice. Country boys should also be given some convenience in the matter of drill halls. I trust that the Minister will take action in regard to these matters without delay.",25
89,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DEPARTMENTAL,"Balaclava) [12.4]. - I wish to endorse the remarks that have just been made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. We have in my elecby them. torate a large number of rifle clubs, and among their members are some excellent shots; but I do not think there is a range on the south side of the Yarra. The Eisternwick range has been closed, and those who live on the south side of the city of Melbourne have now to go Williamstown for rifle practice. Under present conditions some men have to travel a distance of from 10 to 15 miles in order to practise on Saturday afternoons. be Efforts should be made to establish rifle ranges in every district where rifle clubs exist. Members of such clubs give their services free, and, on the average, they are better shots than are members of the Permanent Forces. I think that it would - be possible in every district to select a-dozen members of a rifle club who would heat the same number of men from Permanent Forces or the militia. These provide their own ammunition, and often travel great distances in order to take in competitions. Surely they' should have some encouragement. The Defence authospirit rities, however, appear always to have antagonistic to the rifle club movement. do not know who is responsible for state of affairs, but it cannot be denied that misbehaving themselves belong. the rifle clubs have never received the encouragement of which they are deserving. That has been our experience from the inception of Federation. Seeing that the feeling of the Committee is so strongly in favour of these clubs, I trust that the Minister will take this matter in hand; that he will - see that ranges are established in as many places as possible, and that greater encouragement is given to the rifle clubs themselves and to men to join them.",25
90,Mr RYRIE,DEPARTMENTAL,"North Sydney) [12.7] Reference has been made during this debate the question of uniforms for riflemen, and I am inclined to think that a good deal of the antipathy of the permanent military I men to rifle clubs is due to the fact that their members do not wear a uniform. It appear to be simply a matter of sentito ment, but the fact remains that the specthey tacle of a large body of men, in plain clothes, carrying rifles, is a very ludicrous one. I was one of the original founders of the 3rd Light Horse Regiment, and at our first camp there were about 600 of us in plain clothes. Dressed, as we were, in varied shades of clothing, and wearing, as we did, hats of all shapes, we were the laughing-stock of the people; but as soon as we got into our uniforms we were cheered",25
91,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENTAL,Do I understand the honourable member to say that the people rifle cheered the clothes and not the men?,25
92,Mr RYRIE,DEPARTMENTAL,"They cheered the men in uniform, although they had laughed at them in plain clothes. The question of unito form is an important one. I know of many riflemen who would be prepared to undergo some drill if they were provided with uniforms, and I am sure that the militia would only too happy to - assist them to secure drill instruction. When I commanded a militia regiment I was always willing to allow ray sergeant-major and drill instructors to give some instruction to members of a rifle club. But you cannot get members of such clubs to come together in halflarge numbers in plain clothes. The decision recently arrived at that all our militia the shall wear a drab khaki uniform has men damped to a large extent the enthusiasm of the militia - It was a mistake to do part away with the distinctive uniforms of the service. Distinctive uniforms promote a of healthy rivalry amongst the differbeen ent regiments, and. what is more, enable I an officer to tell at a distance to this what regiment any men who. may be Like the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, I know that riflemen in some instances ride from 15 to 20 miles in order to secure rifle practice, and whilst dealing with the question of uniforms, I should like to say that unless a rug is placed on the mounds there is nothing that will wear out a man's clothes more quickly than will rifle practice. These mounds in country districts are not covered with a green sward, but are rough and gravelly, so that a man who is constantly lying down on them must quickly wear out his clothes. Riflemen should be provided with a uniform, or at least with a sort of overall as suggested by the honourable member who introduced this question. The provision of uniforms for riflemen would involve a great deal of expense, but the effect would be most encouraging. I come now to the provision of drill halls for cadets, which involves not only the success or otherwise of the scheme, but also, perhaps, the health of the rising generation. The cadets are often forced, or, at any rate, they have been forced, to drill in pouring rain, though, I understand, that some instruction has been issued that the area officers are to use their discretion. The bovs may have to travel five miles or more from their homes; and we all know that it is most injurious for a growing lad to remain for hours in wet clothes. No matter what the cost, some arrangements should be made for covered drill areas. Drilling at night is objectionable on many grounds, and absolutely ridiculous unless ample lighting is provided. The question of drill halls is, of course, a big one, involving an enormous expenditure, if a place has to be provided wherever there is a company to be drilled. As already pointed out, people in various localities have given evidence of their willingness to contribute; and if the Government make it clear that they are prepared to do their share, the public will not be lacking in patriotism. There are many other causes which may contribute to the breakdown of the system - cause s which I am not allowed to mention now-bu t one great cause is that the lads may be compelled to drill in the rain. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [12.19] - There is every reason for the Government to turn their attention to the rifle clubs, the members of which, in their own time and at their own expense, are perfecting themselves in the use of the rifle, so that they may be ready should their services be required in the defence of the country. So far as I have been able to discover from the Estimates, no proper recognition is given of the public service thus rendered; and the claims urged on behalf of the clubs deserve the serious consideration of any Government which may be in power. Indeed, so tar as can be seen, the rifle clubs have received practically no recognition at all ; in many instances disabilities have actuaily been placed in the way of these volunteer riflemen obtaining access to ranges for practice.",25
93,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENTAL,"As a matter of fact they are treated as the "" ugly duckling "" of the service. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The clubs seem to be regarded as a sort of excrescence on our military system; and that is a most unfortunate view to take of this most useful body of men. The members of these clubs ought not to be made to feel that they are of no consequence, but should be encouraged _ by some suDstantial financial assistance in a number ot useful ways, and not compelled to fall back entirely on their own financial resources.",26
94,Mr SCULLIN,DEPARTMENTAL,"We shall be glad to look to them in time of trouble. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Cer - ' tainly; and no more capable bodv of men at such a time could be found than those patriotic citizens who give up leisure which might otherwise be devoted to sports and amusements. The clubs are tormed, and the members go about their work in a most unostentatious manner, perfecting themselves in a very necessary branch of defence, and forming a very valuable auxiliary in time of need. Very inadequate provision is made in the Estimates for drill halls. I find that, in New South Wales, Newcastle and Singleton are selected as places where drill halls are to be provided; but there are larger centres ot population in which halls are urgently needed. A short time ago, I had occasion to bring under the notice of honourable members a letter from the municipal body of Marrickville, where I reside, in which complaint was made of the manner i which the drills n are conducted; and it was pointed out how the health of the boys might be injured by being called upon to undergo the drills in all sorts of weather. We cannot wonder that a great number of parents are very chary about allowing their boys to drill under such conditions. I feel satisfied that, if proper halls were provided, with adequate lighting and supervision, a great deal of the present trouble, caused by absence from drill, would be avoided/ I notice that ;Â£3>ooo is provided towards the cost of the erection of buildings at Victoria Barracks, Sydney; ancl that Â£2,000 is set aside for improvements to the paradeground at the same barracks. There has been some talk of negotiations for a site for the Victoria Barracks, in some other part of Sydney; and, if a change be contemplatecf at an early date, or a comparatively early date, the proposed expenditure is not, in my opinion, justified. The Honorary Minister may, perhaps, be able to give us some information on the subject.",26
95,Mr OZANNE,DEPARTMENTAL,"Corio) [12.26] - I endorse the complaints about the inadequate consideration extended to the rifle clubs, which I know, from personal experience, are a valuable adjunct of our defence system. The members of these clubs contribute out of their own pockets towards the expense of making themselves efficient in case they should be called upon to defend the country. As to the cadets, many of whom have to travel great distances, they ought not to be called upon to drill out in the rain; and any offers made by municipal or other bodjes to contribute towards the cost of drill halls ought to be accepted. As the representative of a country district, I know that many of the trainees have to travel far; and I think there ought to be some change made in the direction of providing free railway travelling for them. When I was a volunteer in the State service, the members of the Forces were always passed free on the railways; and I think that that policy ought to be continued. The States and the Commonwealth are one from a defence point of view; and I see no reason why the State Government should refuse to continue a practice which they followed in the past. I quite agree with the complaints made by the honourable member for Nepean about the Government not contributing towards the maintenance of certain roads. In the past, the Commonwealth Government have granted a sum for this purpose at Queenscliff, which is the centre of very active military operations; but the practice has been discontinued by several Governments. Stationed at Queenscliff ar the Royal Australian Engineers and the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery; and very heavy material is carted over the roads. Queenscliff, itself, has no heavy traffic, all to be found there is caused by the presence of the military. The local municipality would, I believe, be quite satisfied with a contribution of something like Â£ 4 0 a year; and I think the matter might receive the consideration of the Government.",27
96,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Wimmera) [12.30] - It was stated in the newspapers some weeks ago that the Minister of Defence intended to make an adequate provision of drillhalls throughout the Commonwealth; but the amounts set down in this. schedule are very small; and, apparently, unless it is proposed to ask for further sums on the Supplementary Estimates, the matter will have to be left over for another year. I should like some information from the Honorary Minister on the subject. I have already expressed my opinion about the treatment given by the Government to rifle clubs; and, even at the risk of tedious repetition, I shall declare my grievances again, and move a reduction of the vote by jQi to express disapproval of the Government neglect of the clubs. Every part of Australia is interested in this matter, and every section of the community. Honourable members generally approve of the compulsory training of youths for the defence of the country; but it is a serious want that no provision is made for enabling middle-aged men to make themselves of service in time of war, when we shall have to call on the whole manhood of the country for our defence. ",27
97,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENTAL,"It would be of little use to respond unless they were expert in the management of the rifle. The honourable member, more than any other, knows the need of good marksmen.  cent, of the men are good marksmen.",27
98,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENTAL,"They are bushmen, and have constant opportunities for using their rifles; but, in most places, good marksmen can be obtained only by shooting on rifle ranges. In South Africa, it was found that the men who were good shots soon learned the drill, and became able to carry out the orders of their superiors, and obedient to discipline. If the provision for rifle clubs were greatly increased, it would immensely improve the efficiency of our second line of land defence; but, either the Minister is out of sympathy with the rifle e club movement, or he is so much occupied with matters concerning the Permanent and Forces, that he has to neglect it. The rifle clubs have been neglected since the inauguration of Federation; and this neglect is the more reprehensible now, because AMUions, NevWorl*^ Â«f late vears there has been a S â¢ in the Defence expenditure. withstanding that our Defence expendrture nSeased bf Â£*Â°?-â¢**^**> Tnro the rifle clubs of victoria, ana, K e , of Australia, have decreased m nuS.

But, in my opinion, it is impossible for the honourable gentleman to continue very long as he is going. that oÂ± It is impossible for . any one man to continue doing so much work. P ent Coming now to the criticism of the Committee, it must be remembered that the the sum available for expenditure on Defence is limited.

No details have so far been furnished, and no specific charges have been to made, but generally this Government has disapbeen condemned by party newspapers and placards for profligate expenditure, and nfle for leaning to alarming increases.

101,Mr HOWE,DEPARTMENTAL,Cu t the expenditure down,28
102,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"There are others who ask us to increase it. The position of the Minister is extremely delicate, since he is of asked to meet the wishes both of those who of desire further expenditure and of those who draw attention to the increases in outlay. There is a considerable sum on these Estiy mates for Defence purposes-as much as Â£ J ^ h as can reasonably be allotted during the preof Defence has sent financial year. 3 9",28
103,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENTAL,Is Â£17.000 for rifle remarKS clubs a fair proportion to allot?,28
104,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"In that matter the 01 Minister must be guided by the advice of that his his experts.

We have the advice of an able inspector so far of a as the general work is concerned. We have Â£ the advice of other able officers who occupy proresponsible positions and receive reasonable , ^ emoluments, and necessarily their advice must be some guide to the Minister as to e to the way in which the expenditure .shall be a'lloted to different 'branches of the service and different places in the Commonwealth. Honourable members representing particular districts necessarily ask for a hall here or a rifle range there, but, from the Commonwealth point of view, it would not do for the Minister of Defence to permit himself to be dragged to a drill hall at Singleton at one moment and a rifle range in Western Australia the next, and so on over the length and breadth of Australia. The whole Business must be undertaken in a uniform and systematic manner, in order to insure efliciency and economic expenditure of the money voted by Parliament.",28
105,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENTAL,Is this sum to be taken as an evidence of the Minister's estimate of the value of rifle clubs?,29
106,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"It may be that the Minister, individually, would be prepared to spend two or three million pounds more on defence in general. I do not know, nor can it be said of any particular member that, because he votes for an item allocating a certain sum, it necessarily discloses his opinion as to the total amount that ought to be spent in that direction. We have to cut our coat according to our cloth, and the allocations are made largely as the result of expert advice in the endeavour to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth. I wish to say right away that the Minister of Defence is distinctly sympathetic towards rifle clubs, and anxious to foster them to the best of his ability. He recognises to the full their undoubted value, and the value of effective riflemen, ancl it has been, and will continue to be, his effort to see that they are properly treated, and that all the facilities possible in the circumstances are attorded to them. I should like to add to the opinion of the Minister my own recognition of the value of the rifle clubs, and to say that, as far as I personally know, there is no jealousy of or objection to them on the part of the permanent officers. I know of no unsympathetic administration regarding them. There is practically a sub-department for rifle clubs, ancl Major Boam is at present at the head of it. He has direct audience with the Minister, and all matters relating to rifle clubs go through him. It should be possible for him, through the Secretary, to bring these questions directly before the Minister without being, hampered by what is ordinarily called red-tape or having to make his representations through different officers of the permanent force.",29
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,Has not a little friction developed between the rifle club authorities and Major Boam?,29
108,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"It is quite possible that in the reports coming from the different States there may be differences of opinion between Major Boam and the officers reporting to him, but I know of no special instance to indicate that any permanent officer, holding a reasonably high post, is unsympathetic towards the rifle clubs,",29
109,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENTAL,How does the Honorary Minister explain the reduction of the vote?,29
110,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"If I found that any permanent officer in the Defence Force allowed his personal antipathies or jealousies, or even opinions, to influence his official work in relation to rifle clubs, I should, to the best of my power and influence, have him dismissed. If any instance of it is given, I have not the shadow of a doubt that the Minister will at once investigate the matter, and that the offender will be duly dealt with.",29
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,Do you not think it is fair to tell the Committee the reason for the reduction of this vote?,29
112,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Yes , instead of ignoring interjections and legitimate questions.",29
113,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,The honourable member is not fair in saying that I am ignoring interjections. Will the honourable member draw my attention to the item .where there is a reduction so far as rifle clubs are concerned ?,29
114,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Look at page 241 on the Estimates. The vote this year is Â£17,820, as against Â£^22,900 last year.",29
115,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"It .is scarcely fair to ask me for a detailed explanation of an item which is not yet under consideration. I shall be prepared to give details when the Committee reaches that item, or I hope to be. I assure honourable members opposite that the Minister is in full sympathy with rifle clubs, and desires to foster them in every possible way. The honourable member for Parramatta touched on the ouestion of rifle ranges. The Minister is anxious that the number of ranges shall be increased, and increases are being made wherever possible, limited only by the amount of money available and cogditional on the presence of expert workmen. Still, considerable delays occur. For instance, persons write down, saying they want a rifle range- at a particular place, and a recommendation is made to that effect. We have thento acquire the land. Some citizens are very generous in their treatment of the Government, but the moment that others find thatr the Government want a piece of land they put the price up by anything from 50 to 200 per cent., and immediately make heavy demands upon the Department, resulting in legal expenses, or continual delays before a satisfactory arrangement can be arrived at. Some of the old ranges are becoming obsolete, because the new weapons carry further, and the danger zone is materially increased. While the Minister is anxious to increase the number of ranges, and honourable members very properly bring these requests before him, I am confident that if he were to hurry things, and an accident, causing permanent injury, or death, to some one resulted, the outcry would' be considerably greater than it can possibly be at present. Difficulty sometimes arises in fixing up the necessary leases, even with State Governments, whose assistance is not always perhaps quite so readily given as the Minister may desire. Attention was called to the question of drill halls, in the first instance, by the honourable member for Richmond, who only quoted two small items relating to them. I pointed out to him at the time that he had neglected to look at other items totalling Â£ 4 , 3 0 0 . Honourable members will find at page 227 that Â£ 8 0 , 0 0 0 is set down for expenditure during the current year for the acquisition of sites for, and the erection of, - mobilization and store buildings and drill halls. Recognising the difficulties under which our cadets in particular are placed, the Minister is anxious that drill halls shall be provided in every possible direction to meet the requirements of the forces, and he and the Department, generally, will welcome the assistance of all local bodies in facilitating their acquisition or erection for the purpose of drilling our cadets, and thereby removing some of the difficulties under which, much to the regret of the Minister, and of all connected with the Department, the lads at present labour. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro referred to the holding of military camps in the Federal Territory. I am not sure what his exact desire is, but would point out to him that it is practically impossible to hold all the camps there. It would be quite out of the question to ask troops from South Australia, or Western Australia, to go there for their annual camp. Their whole time would be spent in the train.",29
116,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,I think the honourable member meant it to apply only to New South Wales.,30
117,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"There are many parts of New South Wales where the necessary expenditure and delay in train travelling would quite remove the possibility of the troops holding effective camps at the Federal Capital - I have no doubt that the Department will provide that camps shall be held within the Federal area wherever it is reasonably possible. We have been asked why a site for artillery horses was being bought at Liverpool. A portion of that site, known as Cunningham's farm, is within the Liverpool manoeuvre area, and some part of the farm is outside of it ; but the special reason for acquiring it is that the Department have purchased a large number of very valuable horses for artillery purposes. It is impossible to train artillery properly with hired horses, as was attempted for a number of years. The horses we have acquired must be taken care of, and paddocked where they can be effectively used in whole-day drills, near the large centres of population, where the field artillery require them. That is the only reason why these areas have been purchased.",30
118,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DEPARTMENTAL,It is the last place in the world on which you ought to have put horses.,30
119,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"It is being done under the advice of artillery experts. We cannot put unbroken horses into the artillery. They have to be trained. With regard to the barracks in Sydney, all that is Before the Department at present is that New South Wales members, and other persons, have asked for the removal of the Victoria Barracks from Paddington; and the Department have replied that, if a site equal to the old one is given, and the Department are placed in a precisely similar position so far as buildings generally are concerned, the Minister will consider the proposal favourably. Some piece of property has been inspected; but, outside of that, nothing has been done. Silting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.",30
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"Parramatta) [ - 5]--Before we adjourned for lunch the Z I Minister representing the Minister of Defence made a statement regarding the works policy of his Department, as to which generally no exception can be taken. Referring to the criticisms that are levelled from timeto time at his Department, he said that the Government were charged with extravagance, but that we had not yet furnished? any particulars. Having regard to the money that was being expended on necessary works in this Department, the rifle clubs, he told us, had to be content with a less amount than was voted for tliem on other occasions.",30
121,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,The honourable member is not justified in placing such a construction on my remarks. I did not make that statement.,31
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,Then I withdraw it. Am I correct in saying that the honourable member did not intend the statement in question as a reply to the criticism addressed to him this morning?,31
123,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"Le t the honourable member make his speech, and I will make mine.",31
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"I intend to point to some items of extravagance. The public have a right to ask this Government why less money than usual is being expended upon rifle clubs while so much money is being spent on things that could be done without. For instance, the Commonwealth Woollen Mills are not an absolute necessity at this stage.",31
125,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTMENTAL,The honourable member is not in order in referring to the woollen mills.,31
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"The Minister said that no particulars had been given in support of the charges of alleged extravagance, and I am replying to his statement. It seems to be the rule to allow a Minister to roam from Dan to Bersheba",31
127,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTMENTAL,The honourable member is not in order in reflecting on the Chair. The Minister did not speak about the woollen mills.,31
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"He referred to his Department as a whole, stating that the men had to be clothed and supplied with arms and ammunition, and the new scheme as a whole had to be put into operation. The statements made by the Opposition this morning were in respect of a subsidiary arm of the Defence Force known as the rifle clubs. The Minister's reply to the criticism that these clubs are not receiving fair consideration is that the Government are spending public funds as economically and as usefully as possible, and that because matters relating to the defence organization as a whole have had to be attended to more money is not available for the purposes indicated by us. I hope that I am not misrepresenting the honourable gentleman; I do not wish to misrepresent him in any particular. I desire, however, to make some reply"" to his statement that we have not pointed to any items of extravagance. He asserted that we had given no particulars, and practically challenged us to do so. Now that I desire to make some reply to him, however, I am told that I shall not be in order in doing so. I think that I am entitled, by way of illustration, to refer to other proposed votes in these Estimates, but I shall make the general statement, without reference to any particular item, that the Government could have found plenty of money to provide for rifle clubs ranges and drill halls if they had not spent as much as they have done on Socialistic enterprises. Instead of attending, first of all, to the most urgent matters, they are leaving them until the last. Instead of attending to important, imperative, and urgent matters-and nothing could be more urgent than facilities for efliciency in connection with defence - they are dabbling in Socialistic concerns. It seems to be their rule in connection with every Department to look, not to what is necessary to minister to the efficiency of that Department, but to that which will serve as propaganda work. Politics saturate the whole of their policy.",31
129,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTMENTAL,"The honourable member's remarks would be in order if we were engaged in a general discussion on the first item of the Estimates, but they are not in order at this stage'.",31
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"Then I shall say no more at this stage, but will wait until a motion is moved that will put in order the remarks I desire to make. I shall take care also to call attention to the next statement of policy in like circumstances. Amendment negatived. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Laiig) [2.25] - We have listened to some violent outbursts of parochial anger on the part of the honourable member for Maribyrnong, and other Victorian representatives, as well as by some municipal bodies outside, regarding the expenditure on the Federal Capital. Their objection to that expenditure is based on the ground that the money proposed to be laid out in that way is urgent urgently needed for defence purposes.",31
131,Dr CARTY SALMON,DEPARTMENTAL,"And a very good ground, too. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It is also a very good ground for objecting to some of the items in the division now before us, which provides for a heavy expenditure in Victoria, but to which neither the honourable member for Laanecoorie, nor the honourable member for Maribyrnong, have called attention. There are, in this division, items providing for an expenditure of upwards of ,Â£200,000, in and around Melbourne, although the money proposed to be spent in that way might very well be devoted to defence purposes. We have not heard a word of protest, however, on the part of either the Victorian municipal bodies or the representatives of this State, who have been so loud in their complaints concerning a small item of expenditure in connection with the Federal Capital. If it is fair to attack Federal expenditure of a necessary character when it applies to New South Wales it is equally fair for representatives of that State to raise something in the nature of a protest against a like expenditure in Victoria. Let us give our Victorian friends a little dose of their own medicine.  Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - We have always been too generous.",31
132,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Why , New Wales has "" run the show."" Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The representatives of New South Wales have never raised these petty parochial considerations - They are always originated by a few Victorians, who, so far as their political views are concerned, are under the domination of certain local newspapers. Of course, they do not like to be reminded of these things. I wish to see whether the grounds of the objections raised against expenditure in New South Wales have any real merit; because if they hold good in regard to New South Wales they hold good with a hundredfold force in regard to Victoria. We are asked to vote Â£3,500 for the saddlery and harness factory near Melbourne. Last year we voted Â£4,700, and the expenditure exceeded that by Â£ 4 5 . When the question of the Naval College was before us we heard a great outoy about the "" broad national view,"" and it was strongly urged by Victorian members that such institutions, together with the Commonwealth factories, should be in Federal Territory. ask the Victorian representatives to honour their own declarations of principle and insist that this vote for the harness and saddlery factory shall b"" struck out, so far as it applies to Vic'.yia, and placed in the New South Wales estimate for expenditure in Federal Territory. If those gentlemen are not prepared to redeem their declarations I hope we shall have heard the last of this cry of theirs about the Â» "" broad national outlook."" Then, again, it is proposed to expend ,Â£7,000 on a clothing factory in Melbourne. For this factory we voted .Â£6,500 last year, and expended ,Â£7,8.2 1. I intend to move at the proper time that the item of Â£3,500 for a harness and saddlery factory be struck out.",32
133,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"Parramatta) [2.34] - The complaint of the Minister of Home Affairs today is that the Government have not enough money to carry on the works as they would like, with the requisite efficiency so far as managing and organization go. We have been told today that some votes of the Department are dwindling while others are increasing; and the Minister, of course, gets back to general policy, and, referring to criticism which has been directed from this side, challenges us to show in detail where there has been extravagant expenditure. I presume that the inference to be drawn is that, South if we can point specifically to extravagance, the money so saved will be applied to the more useful purposes of the Department. All I have to say is that the answer to the Minister is in the Estimates. I know, of course, that harness and saddlery are very necessary for defence purposes; but is it, at this stage, more important to establish such a factory, or a. clothing factory, than it is to fully equip our rifle ranges and drill halls, and look after our rifle clubs decently?",32
134,Mr FOWLER,DEPARTMENTAL,The Government have still to obtain supplies of clothing from contractors all over Australia.,32
135,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,Of course. The Government are only toying with the question; it is only a little thing to be dangled from the platforms of the country..,32
136,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEPARTMENTAL,Does the honourable member suggest that the members of the Defence Force should go without clothes?,32
137,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"I desire to see the men well clothed, and in garments which fit better than many of those supplied today. However, I make no comI now plaint on that score, knowing, as I do, the difficulties of the Department. I am making no unreasonable criticism as to the clothing or equipment, because I believe that the best is being done with the money available. It does not lie with me to criticise some of the details, because I have had a hand in putting some of them into operation; though, judging from what the Minister has said today, one would think that nothing had been done until this Heaven-sent Ministry came into power. The establishment of these Socialistic enterprises might very well be left over for a few years until more important and urgent matters had been attended to. I repeat that the Government are starving the rifle clubs today in order to find money for Socialistic enterprises.  Socialistic of all is the Federal Capital.",32
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,Is that a Socialistic enterprise?,33
139,Mr BAMFORD,DEPARTMENTAL,Surely the honourable member does not call the clothing factory a Socialistic enterprise?,33
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"I have heard honourable members opposite so describe it, but perhaps they are "" fooling "" the people outside. The fact is, the Government are neither doing this work nor letting it alone; a little bit of a factory is supplying a small portion of the clothing, while the rest is provided by contractors. The Government ought to put the first things first, if they must make a choice in the expenditure. I know that we cannot have everything at once; but it is time to protest when we find important branches of the Defence Forces pinched and starved. It is politics getting into the Defence administration ; and not merely in connection with this vote, but many others, as I should like to point out if time permitted. Already there is trouble in connection with the building of the vessels; and the Government are tinkering with Socialism in the Department, while defence equipment is retarded. If ever there was urgency, it is just now in connection with the organization on both the military and the naval side. Many things are being done in regard .to which I have no criticism to offer. I have never indulged in carping criticism of the Department, so long as the Government give fair, all-round attention to the requirements of the service. I do not even say whether it is good or bad policy that the clothing of the soldiers should be provided by the Department, or whether the saddlery and harness should be so provided; my point is a point of time, and I contend that we ought not to push these Socialistic enterprises ahead while we starve the rifle clubs, and neglect to provide ranges and drill halls.",33
141,Mr CHARLTON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Hunter) [2.44] - I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that we ought to do our best in the interests of the rifle clubs; but I cannot accept his views as to the clothing factory, and tht harness and saddlery factory. The honourable member does not discuss whether these particular projects are good or bad in themselves; but I contend that, in order to criticise any proposal, we must havs regard to whether it is sound or otherwise in the interests of the Commonwealth. If we leave such questions for the future, because of certain expenditure that is necessary in other directions, it may prove, to be false economy. The question we have to decide is whether we should make arrangements for providing our forces with everything they require, or depend on outside sources. In my opinion, it is better to provide everything ourselves. In that way we shall best be able to meet emergencies. Further, the establishment of these factories will result in a saving to the Commonwealth. The objection to them is, not so much that they are unnecessary, but that they are Socialistic undertakings. If it were proposed to remain dependent on private enterprise for the supply of uniforms, equipment, and the like, nothing would be said. Ever since I have been in this House, it has seemed a sufficient reason to some honourable members to condemn a proposal to say that the work provided for was to be carried out in some State other than that in which their electoral division was situated. It is time that this parochial feeling was put aside. What we must consider is whether expenditure is necessary, and whether concrete proposals are the best that can be put before us. If the House had to decide exactly where the various Commonwealth works vvere to be situated, a fine mess would be maJe. We must depend largely on the opinions of experts in these matters. They are not likely to be influenced by provincial considerations, and their recommendations are likely to have in view the welfare of Australia as a whole. It is time that the House, instead of being influenced by parochial considerations, had regard to the interest of the whole Commonwealth. It cannot be charged against me that I have ever raised the cry of State interests. I have always taken the view that our business is to decide what is best for the Commonwealth, and if that view were taken more generally we should get on faster. As it is, much of the debating is mere waste of time, honourable members airing their views in regard to the claims of their particular States.",33
142,Mr FOWLER,DEPARTMENTAL,For what else are they Sâ¬ll^t liGrc p,34
143,Mr CHARLTON,DEPARTMENTAL,"The honourable member may consider that he is sent here to support specially the interests of a parsion. ticular State, but provincial interests do not influence me. We shall obtain better Territory available then. saddlery, clothing, and equipment genecharge rally from our own factories than private contractors.",34
144,Mr RILEY,DEPARTMENTAL,We are following the British policy.,34
145,Mr CHARLTON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Yes , the policy that is best for our defence system. The honourable member for Perth has complained that, notwithstanding the expenditure which has taken place, clothing is still being purfactories ? chased. That is because provision has not yet been made for the manufacture the clothing needed; but the Government has decided to increase its expenditure, with a view to the manufacture of its plete requirements, which will mean a,big saving to the Commonwealth. I hope that these Estimates will he allowed to pass without further delay.",34
146,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,Illawarra) [2.50] - The this noticehonorable member for Hunter has delivered a lecture to honourable members for the carried parochial or provincial spirit shown gard to the proposals on these Estimates.,34
147,Mr HIGGS,DEPARTMENTAL,It was very badly needed. tian act.,34
148,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"It is a remarkable thing that the clothing factory, the harness factory, the naval school, and many other Commonwealth institutions are all situated in the constituency of Maribyrnong. Let me read the list on page 216, items 26 31:-Maribyrnong-Acces s to Powder Magazines; Maribyrnong-Barracks , Quarare ters, Gun Parks, Pharmacy Stores, Stables, and other Buildings; Maribyrnong-Bar racks and Stable, Remount Section tralian Army Service Corps ; Maribyrnong - Proo f Ground; Maribvrnong-Site Buildings, and Engineering Works for Cormatic dite Factory; Maribyrnong-Timbe r Stormore age Shed.'

In connection with that matter Minfair isters declared that all Commonwealth stitutions and factories should, where posthe sible, be located in the Federal Territory; Bay. but the Government is now largely departing from this national policy to please Victorian supporters.",34
149,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,I think that it was the Government in which the honourable member was a Minister that established the Cordite Factory in the Maribyrnong divi,34
150,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"There was no Federal I resent the of provincialism. My objection is to from the Government's departure from its national policy. Maribyrnong has been pretty successful, so far as this Government is concerned. I should like to know in regard to the timber storage shed which is to be placed there whether the system of preference to unionists is to be followed. Is that system to be applied to all these Mr KING O'MALLEY - Certainly , if I of all have anvthing to do with it.",34
151,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"It is stated in today's newspapers that the system is to be apcomplied to a timber storage shed in the Northern Territory. I have obtained the specifications from the Home Affairs Department, and find that there is gummed to them a slip of paper on which is printed Preference to unionists. For all works out under this contract absolute preferin reence is to be given to unionists. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is a Chris",34
152,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"A very Christian act towards all who are not members of unions, this is, towards the great majority of the people of Australia. Unionists alone are to be entitled to earn a living on works to carried out by this Government on behalf of the whole Commonwealth. Ministers supposed to represent the people as a whole, but they study the interests of - only one small class, and pander to it in Ausevery way possible. Men who were sent to the Northern Territory to do a little , gardening were so dissatisfied with the cliconditions that they soon returned to temperate regions., and yet we find it on provided that, in the erection of a the timber seasoning shed, no one is to the be employed who is not a member Apparently the same rule to apply to all these Maribvrnong factories. The rule is an absolutely unone. The Government showed itself invery obedient to the Caucus in regard to location of the Naval College at Jervis",34
153,Mr HIGGS,DEPARTMENTAL,How does the honourable member know that it did?,35
154,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"The honourable member knows it as well as I do. I appeal to honourable members opposite whether I am not right in saying that the decision to establish the Naval College at Jervis Bay was only come to after a Caucus meeting in Melbourne, the members of the Caucus insisting on the college being established in Federal Territory.",35
155,Mr OZANNE,DEPARTMENTAL,You are wrong.,35
156,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"The honourable member knows that it was the decision of the Caucus, looking at the matter from a national point of view, that put Geelong out of the running on that occasion.",35
157,Mr OZANNE,DEPARTMENTAL,The honourable member's statement is absolutely untrue.,35
158,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,I see the honourable member is to be satisfied on this occasion by the erection of a new boat-shed in the famous Corio Bay. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is not fence based on unionism?,35
159,Mr FULLER,DEPARTMENTAL,"Of course; but that is a unionism in which we ought all to join. This particular business, however, is to be kept within a little aristocratic set, ridiculous. and only those who happen to be within the fence are to have any rights. To limit any works in the Northern Territory to unionists alone is certainly to take the first step towards disaster, so far as the occupation of the Territory is concerned. Mr VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) Â£3.2] - In accordance with the notice I gave just now, I move That the item "" C lift o n Hill-Harness , Saddlery, and Leather Accoutrement Factory, -Â£3.500,"" be left out. I do this in order that the Government may stick to their declared policy of putting all these works in the Federal Territory.",35
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"Parramatta) Â£3.3] - I shall vote for the amendment, not for the reason given by the honourable member for Lang, But because I think the money can be more usefully expended in facilitating the organization of the Defence Forces and ministering to their efficiency in other ways.",35
161,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,Adelaide-Honorar y Minister) [3.4] - It is not the intention of the Government to accept the amendment.,35
162,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Wimmera) [3.5] - I differ from the opinion expressed by the honourable member for Lang. If the Harness Factory must be established anywhere, Victoria is the best place in which it can be put; but, so far, no reasons have been furnished to the Committee for establishing the factory at all ; nor has the Honorary Minister told us why the articles required by our forces should not be obtained from the various private factories in existence. I intend to support the amendment on those grounds, and not because I think the factory should be placed in Federal Territory in preference to Clifton Hill.",35
163,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPARTMENTAL,"Fawkner) [3.6] - I am sorry to disagree with the honourable member for Lang, but it would not be common sense to put a factory in the wilder, ness of the Yass-Canberra site, where there is no labour to be secured. I understand that the factory is now in working order, so that the question of establishing it is no longer before us. I quite agree with the honoraible member for Wimmera that the work ought to be given to existing factories in the different States, because I have all denever believed in the Government doing this class of work. The factory has been started, however, and to vote against something which is absolutely required to carry on the military work of the country is",35
164,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,We have had enough experience of harness contractors in Australia.,35
165,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPARTMENTAL,"I should think that a Government contractor would be far worse than - an ordinary army contractor ; but; in any case, it would be an act of midsummer madness to establish a factory of this kind in the Federal Territory under present conditions.",35
166,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEPARTMENTAL,"Richmond) [3.7] - I intend to support the amendment for several reasons, one of which is that I am not at all satisfied with the work I have seen turned out by this factory. I have seen only two bags, but they were a disgrace to the factory that turned them out. I understand that the factory charged the Department to which they were sold 45s. each for them; and I undertake to say that similar bags could be bought anywhere in Melbourne for about 28s. each, retail.",35
167,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENTAL,To what Department were they sold ?,35
168,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEPARTMENTAL,I cannot tell what Department they were sold to; but I think the Minister of Trade and Customs knows.,35
169,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENTAL,I do not know anything about it.,35
170,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEPARTMENTAL,I understand they were sold to the Customs Department.,35
171,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEPARTMENTAL,The honourable member said just now that he could not tell us.,36
172,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEPARTMENTAL,"I know; but I have no documentary evidence. I saw the bags, and I know they were made, or reputed to be made, at the factory.",36
173,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENTAL,Will the honourable member inform me if they are the ones supplied to the Fruit Commission?,36
174,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEPARTMENTAL,"They may have been supplied to the Fruit Commission, or the Pearling Commission.",36
175,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENTAL,The Pearling Commission is not under the Customs Department.,36
176,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEPARTMENTAL,"It was probably the Fruit Commission. The bags had no proper stiffening around the edges, and were lined with brown paper instead of leather; and, after about two trips, they will be found utterly useless. If that is the sort of work the factory is doing, it is time we put an end to it. I understood from the Prime Minister the other day that we are to have balance-sheets presented to us to prove that the factories are paying. I should like to run a factory on the lines on which the Harness Factory is being run. If I could charge 45s. each for bags of that description, I am sure that I could show a very handsome profit, although I know nothing about bag-making.",36
177,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"That is why you criticising it, I suppose.",36
178,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEPARTMENTAL,"I do not know anything about ""the process of manufacture, but I know enough about a travelling bag to tell when I have a good or a bad one.",36
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"Parramatta) [3.11] - I have heard very pronounced criticisms of this branch of the Defence Department. Honourable members imagine that the Harness Factory is engaged in equipping the Forces, but I believe it will be found that it is doing a very small modicum of that kind of work. I am told that part of its work is to make mail-bags for the Postal Department, although there was no need for it to take up that work, which was being done by the Post Office authorities themselves, by the agency of capable, practical bag - makers. These have not been taken over with the factory; but outsiders have been brought in and taught to make these bags at the expense of the country.",36
180,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEPARTMENTAL,What became of the Post Office bag-makers?,36
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"I understand that they are still in the Postal Department, but have been put to some other work in the Mail Branch. Such a proceeding does not seem to be in the interests of the country. These statements have been made to me; and I ask the Minister to have them inquired into. I am told, moreover,, that, since the factory began to make bags for the Postal Department, it is costing the Department more per bag than when they were made in the Department itself.",36
182,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,Who made the statements to you?,36
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,I cannot tell the honourable member.,36
184,Mr OZANNE,DEPARTMENTAL,The Employers Federation.,36
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"The honourable memher is always making reckless and irresponsible statements. The information was not given to me by any body who had anything whatever to do with employers. If that kind of thing is going on, it ought to be stopped.",36
186,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,You are not sure that it is going.on?,36
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,No ; I am told that it is.,36
188,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"I shall call for information on the subject, but the honourable member is not sure that these things are going on. are Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I am not. Does the Minister know that mail bags are being made at this factory?",36
189,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENTAL,I would say that they are.,36
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"Ver y well. As to the other matter to which I have referred, I ask that it be looked into. I should have thought that a factory of this kind, which was said to be urgently required to provide for the clothing of the Defence Forces, would have concentrated the whole of its attention on military equipment, instead of which it seems that it is doing work for other branches of the service. Work has been taken from trained men in other branches of the Public Service in order to give this factory something to do.",36
191,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"That cannot be the case, because the factory finds it impossible to cope with its work.",36
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"Does not that seem a reason why the making of mail bags should be left to the Postal Department? The more I see of this proposed vote the more it appears to me to be unnecessary at present. The money could be devoted to some more useful purpose, such as to encourage our rifle clubs.",36
193,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPARTMENTAL,"Kooyong) [3.18]. - The honourable member for Lang is rather late in objecting to this item. He claims that the factory should be established in Federal Territory, but as a matter of fact it has already been established at Clifton Hill, and is in working order. I do not think that my honourable friend would suggest that the thousands of pounds already expended on this property should be thrown away, but that would practically be the result of the adoption of his suggestion. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The property could be sold.",37
194,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPARTMENTAL,"The land could be sold, but large sums have also been expended in erecting upon it necessary buildings, for the sale of which a ready market would not be found. We must not forget that the factory is already built, and that the vote to which the honourable member takes exception is designed only to extend or complete it. When it was first proposed that the Commonwealth should undertake work of this character objection might have been taken, but the honourable member's objection cannot seriously be taken into consideration now that so much money has already been expended on the venture. If we are to have such a factory, I know of no better situation for it than is Clifton Hill. Clifton Hill is a workman's district, comprising portion of the city of lingwood, and it is a very eligible locality for an industrial factory of this character.",37
195,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,Leathe r workers abound there.,37
196,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPARTMENTAL,"A number reside in the neighbourhood, ancl the district is one in which cottages and. houses can be obtained at a reasonable rental. The statement made by the honourable member for Parramatta is certainly entitled to attention. If men who are expert in a particular class of work have been taken from it and novices put in their places, the position is a very serious one. The Minister, however, has promised to make an inquiry, and I do not think we can press the matter any further. I repeat that the honourable member for Lang is rather late in bringing forward at this stage an objection which might have been raised more meritoriously when it was originally proposed to establish a factory of the kind. Amendment negatived. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [3.22] - I move That the item ""Clothing Factory, Melbourne, Â£7,000 "" be left out. The arguments urged against the amendment which has just been negatived will certainly not hold good in this case, for nothing has yet been done in the way of erecting this factory. I understand that Â£^15,000 or ,Â£16,000 is the present estimated cost of the work towards which we are now asked to vote ,Â£7,000. By consulting another portion of the Estimates I find that there is another heavy item, .relating, I think, to the acquisition of a site for the erection of woollen mills at Geelong.",37
197,Mr RILEY,DEPARTMENTAL,"The honourable member is Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - At all events, this is new expenditure, and the Government have another opportunity to carry into effect their declared policy that Commonwealth factories shall be established in Federal Territory. My amendment will afford those who, like the honourable member for Wimmera, the honourable member for Maribrynong, and others, have been airing their "" broad national views,"" an opportunity to show their sincerity and to prove that their national horizon is not limited by the boundaries of Victoria. Let us have these mills erected in the Federal Territory.",37
198,Mr RILEY,DEPARTMENTAL,South Sydney) [3.26] I wish to ask the Minister representing the Col- Minister of Defence whether this item is designed merely to provide for additions to the present factory or for a new factory?,37
199,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"This is not, as has been asserted by the honourable member for Lang, a proposal to build a new factory. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I find that I am mistaken.",37
200,Mr ATKINSON,DEPARTMENTAL,Wilmot) [3.27] Will the Minister representing the Minister of Defence give us a general idea of the purposes for which this proposed vote is sought ?,37
201,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"It is to provide generally for additions to the Clothing Factory, to facilitate the work That it has in hand. Amendment negatived. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [3.28] - I move That the item "" Geelong Boat Shed, ""Naval Forces, Â£800"" be left out. I have known a commodious boat shed to be built for Â£40, and I should like to know why it is proposed to incur this expenditure at Geelong. We ought to have some information concerning an item which seems to me to be unwarranted.",37
202,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPARTMENTAL,"Fawkner) [3.29] I hope that the Minister will give us an explanation of this item. Any one who has visited the beautiful bay on which Geelong is situate will know that it is amply supplied with boat sheds, and it is dimcult to understand why this expenditure is proposed. Before we pass the item we are entitled to some information, because it points to the grossest extravagance, if not to some sort of political work.",38
203,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"Adelaide-Honorar y Minister) [3.30] - The Government do not intend to accept the amendment, and I assure the honourable member for Lang that we have no intention to place the Geelong naval boat-shed in his district. The shed is for exceptional uses, differing altogether from the ordinary rowing-boat sheds with which the honourable member is familiar. It is intended for general naval purposes, including the accommodation of cutters and whale-boats of larger size. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - What is the matter with Swan Island? Why Geelong?",38
204,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,"Because a certain number cf naval people will be centred at Geelong, not only immediately, but later on. Amendment negatived.",38
205,Mr SINCLAIR,DEPARTMENTAL,"Moreton) [3.32] - I should like some information in regard to the item of Â£ 4 , 0 0 0 for the improvement of the rented premises to be used as a navy office in Melbourne. In my opinion, this money could be better spent on property of our own than on rented premises; and I should be glad to know the nature of the alterations which are to cost this enormous sum. Mr KINGO ' MALLEV (Darwin-Min ister of Home Affairs) [3.33] - We do not intend to expend this Â£ 4 , 0 0 0 unless we get a long lease that is satisfactory to the Government. These premises are in Lonsdale-street, and are intended as the headquarters of the Naval Department.",38
206,Mr FAIRBAIRN,DEPARTMENTAL,What does the Minister call a long lease?,38
207,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEPARTMENTAL,"I shall not say just now. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [3-35J-- I desire to call attention to the item of ,Â£500 in connection with a powder magazine; Â£[25,000, for barracks, quarters, and so for t h ; Â£ 4 , 0 0 0 , for stabling, and so for t h ; Â£[250, for a proof ground; and Â£ 6 , 4 0 0 , for a site, buildings, and engineering works at the Cordite Factory. All of these works are at Maribyrnong, the honourable member for which has had so much fo say against any proposed expenditure on the Federal Territory, and about the necessity for our taking a "" broad national outlook,"" though when these items to be spent in his own district are before us, he is conspicuous by his absence. For reasons altogether insufficient, that honourable member has opposed expenditure in the Federal Territory; but we hear no word of protest from him in regard to the proposed expenditure in his own electorate. Did time permit, I should feel strongly tempted to move the omission of each of these items, in order that honourable members who have declared for the "" broad national outlook "" shall not stultify themselves.",38
208,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Wimmera) [3.36] - I shall not comment on the merits of the proposals just referred to, but I should like to know whether it is the intention of the Minister to impose absolute preference to unionists as a condition in the carrying out of the whole of these works. We are entitled to the information, in view of what has been stated by the honourable member for Illawarra in regard to a contract for works in the Northern Territory.",38
209,Mr KING OMALLEY,DEPARTMENTAL,"Darwin-Min ister of Home Affairs) [3.37]--In all the transactions connected with the Department of Home Affairs we give preference-first , preference to Australia; and, secondly, preference to Britain. Everything in this country is based on preference; the very British Empire rests on the corner-stone of preference. The religion we were brought up in, ancl our very salvation, rest on preference. Everything is preference, and we cannot carry to perfection anything in the world without it. Defence is based on unionism. We unite to carry out great Mr W. H. IRVINE - Is the Minister going to answer a very simple and plain question, or is he not? Mr KING O'MALLEY - We have a great national industrial organization, and we must carry out all our works on a basis of that organization. We must hold some organization responsible for carrying out the works. To me it is amazing when I see unionists Mr W. H. IRVINE - What about the question that the Minister has been asked? MT. MATHEWS - Le t the Minister answer the question in his own way. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I shall "" run my own circus.""",38
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"Hear , hear! It is a ""circus."" Mr KING O'MALLEY - It was a ""circus"" at i o'clock this morning. The honourable member for Wimmera is a member of the Journalists Union, and the honourable member for Flinders is a member of the Lawyers Union.",39
211,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPARTMENTAL,"What of it? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Thoug h I may know as much about law as the honourable member for Flinders does, neither I nor any one on this side could go into the Courts and defend a man.",39
212,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTMENTAL,"Will the Minister confine himself to the question? Mr KING O'MALLEY - If a work is connected with the Home Affairs Department, it will be carried out on the basis of preference to unionists. Mr VV. H . IRVIN E (Flinders) [3.39]. - Notwithstandin g the foolish rhodomontade we have been enduring on this occasion, as on many other occasions, from the Minister of Home Affairs Mr KING O'MALLEY - Then put us out.",39
213,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPARTMENTAL,"The Minister of Home Affairs seems to think hft can answer the most serious questions by a species of buffoonery. We gather from his reply that the Minister intends, apparently, not only to give preference to unionists in connection with the work immediately under his control, but also to impose preference as a condition on contractors and tenderers. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Hear , hear '",39
214,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPARTMENTAL,"Then all I have to say is that this matter cannot rest here. The country will require to know, not merely whether this is the policy of the Minister of Home Affairs, but whether it tion. is a policy that has received the sanction, or is going to receive the sanction, of Prime Minister and of the Government. Opposition. The Minister of Home Affairs does not seem to have the slightest perception seriousness of the position he has taken up; he seems to forget that he the taxpayers' money, and that, in using the powers with which he is intrusted as try the game. a responsible Minister of the Crown, reward the particular class of people who ists. have voted to place him in his present position, he is guilty, not only of a political outrage, but of a defalcation of public moneys. The matter cannot be allowed to rest here. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Then let us have a no-confidence motion.",39
215,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPARTMENTAL,"In some way or other the matter will be brought up, until the House and the country will have to face the question of whether the public moneys, which have been subscribed by all classes of taxpayers, are to be distributed in giving employment to one particular class, who happen to be the political supporters of the Government. That is the question; and no amount of buffoonery, rhodomontade, or bluster will prevent it being finally determined by the people of the country,""",39
216,Mr RILEY,DEPARTMENTAL,"We welcome that challenge. Mr AV. H . IRVINE - I am glad to hear from the honourable member that his party are prepared to take that as a definite challenge. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Hear , hear !",39
217,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPARTMENTAL,"It brings us face to face with all the differences between this side ""and the other side. The plain issue, in this case is whether the government of the country is to be carried on for the benefit of a particular class of voluntary associations banded together for the purpose, not merely of securing benefit to themselves industrially, but of seizing the reins of government. Mr MATHEWS. (Melbourne Ports) [3.42] - It is rather surprising, at thisstage, to hear the honourable member for Flinders breaking out in this direction. We have been listening to this sort of stuff for over twelve months. The Opposition have done as much as they can to try to discredit the Labour party by telling the people that we have handed over everything to the unions.",39

I suppose that that is what the Opposition intend to on all works. do. If the honourable member for Flinders thinks he has thrown down a challenge to us on the question of preference, shall take it up ; and I think we shall if it comes to a matter of preference unionists or preference to non-unionists.",39

I adhere to that ruling.",41
245,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENTAL,"This question of brought absolute preference to unionists is more far-reaching than at first apserious pears. The policy previously introduced by the Minister in connection with day labour me*ant the use of public moneys, contributed by every taxpayer in the Commonwealth, to force certain workers to join unions, to reward those unionists who helped the Government into power. In this new promisuse posal of the Minister to enforce absolute preference to unionists in the case of Gogive vernment contracts, there is involved the use of public funds to compel every employer throughout the Commonwealth who contracts for Government work to employ labour only. I can hardly conceive to of a grosser misuse of public money. There are 1,300,000 bread-winners within the Commonwealth, contributing a revenue of from ^20,000,000 to ^21,000,000 per annum, and they are to be taxed for the purpose of rewarding, in the first instance, not more than 300,000 unionists, or less than one-fourth of the total number of breadThe G'overnment are trustees charged with the sacred duty of dispensing us the public funds in such a way as to give out the people the best returns for them; but, not satisfied with having used a portion of to force day labourers into the unions, they are now going to penalize every private employer who takes a contract from them works by forcing him to engage union labour.",41

If men voluntarily band themselves together in industrial unions to bargain with their employers in order to their conditions, the system should There is plenty of room for difference of opinion on the question of preference to unionists when it is granted by a properly constituted Court, whose duty is to carry out the instructions of the Legislature; but when it is enforced by the Executive power of the realm, it is quite a different matter. The Ministry cannot rid themselves of the sacred responsibility of dispensing the public funds in such a way as to preserve the splendid traditions of government in Australia -! believe the Minister, when he introduced the question, did not realise the gravity of the issues involved in it, but after the discussion that took place on the matter, so far as day labour was concerned, it ought to have been home to the Government that they were even then going perilously near a misuse of the public funds. Now, however, they are extending that bad principle in a way that will bring private employers throughout the Commonwealth into a state of duress.

The Opposition have never at not he any time favoured, or even suggested I any discrimination between the workers They have always denounced any discrimination of the whether it was in favour of unionists to or non-unionists. The Minister now suggests that, "" other things being equal,"" he is unionprepared to give preference to unionists.",43
274,Mr HARPER,DEPARTMENTAL,He said he did not believe in those words being inserted in the,43
275,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPARTMENTAL,"He said, first of all, that he would give absolute preference unionists; but I regarded his later stateas being in the nature of a correction. a In that later statement. I thought he made duty use of the words "" other things being executed in any Mr SAMPSON - No .",43
276,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,The Minister did say,43
277,Mr HUGHES,DEPARTMENTAL,"The Minister of Home Affairs was only repeating every judgment that has been given by the Arbitration to Court, namely, that other things must be",43
278,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPARTMENTAL,"At the outset to the Minister of Home Affairs spoke of absolute preference to unionists, hut, when him he was challenged, he subsequently said ""other things being equal,"" preferThat is what I heard him say, and, of course, T repeat it. beI f that is the policy of the Minister, he to very carefully excludes it from the termÂ« of contract. The Northern Territory contract, which has been quoted, provided specifically that absolute preference was to be given to unionists; there was nothing said about other things being equal. The specification represents, in writing, the policy of the Minister, whatever he may choose to avow now. We have been told that in all things the Labour party desire to be logical; but I should like them, before being logical, to be at least constitutional. They knew very well when this proposal of preference was first introduced in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill of 1910 that there was no constitutional power to enforce it ; and it was only owing to the determined opposition of this side that they abandoned an idea which had for its object the enforcement of the principle so far as private employment is concerned. The Labour party realized that the proposal was unconstitutional, and for that reason they abandoned it ; but now they seek to bring about the same unconstitutional proceeding in another way. Some time ago it was decided by the Government that preference should be given to unionists in temporary employment in the Departments; and we have now a deliberate proposal of a far-reaching character. The object is to bring into existence a nefarious system which could not be realized by constitutional means. They are in conflict with the terms and spirit of the Constitution; and we have a right to protest against this iniquitous and infamous proposal to discriminate between the taxpayers of the community, and to reward persons for political reasons only.",43
279,Mr FENTON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Maribyrnong) [4.19] 1 do not see why there should be so much heat in the discussion of this question. To my mind, the matter was settled last year when the Leader of the Opposition put a number of questions to the Prime Minister. According to Hansard of 20th September, 1911, page 634, the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime MinisterWhether he will define the classes ment employees within which members of unions will henceforward be given priority of appointment over all who are not unionists? The reply by the Prime Minister wasOther qualifications being equal,, preference will be given in all cases. I take it that a declaration by the head of the Government is to be regarded as representing the policy, of the Government; and 1 hope and . trust that, throughout the [74]- 2 Commonwealth, nothing will be given forth* as the policy of the Government in this connection, except the reply given by the Prime Minister to the Leader of the Opposition. There are honourable members gasconading about the country and misinterpreting the official declaration made by the Prime Minister. Of the policy as set forth in that declaration, every honourable member on this side is in favour.",44
280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"Parramatta) [4.22] - Are the gentlemen referred to by the honourable member for Maribyrnong not entitled to go about the country when they, find the kind of language which is set forth in the terms of contracts? I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether there is a new kind of preference that the Government have decided to grant in connection with public contracts, and whether the language in the terms of the contracts represents the policy of the Government.",44
281,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENTAL,I have not seen the language. I have declared the policy of the Government again and again.,44
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,Does the policy as declared by the Prime Minister still obtain ?,44
283,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENTAL,-'Yes ,44
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,There has been no variation?,44
285,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENTAL,No .,44
286,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,Then I may take it that the Prime Minister repudiates the language of the Minister of Home Affairs ?,44
287,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENTAL,I know nothing about the language.,44
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"Then may 1 invite the Prime Minister's attention to it, or is it beneath his notice to look at a thing like that? This is all of a piece with the contempt with which the Prime Minister has lately treated every question in this. House.",44
289,Mr ROBERTS,DEPARTMENTAL,There is not a more* courteous man in the public life of Australia.,44
290,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,So courteousof Governthat he will not answer a question.,44
291,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENTAL,"Was the honourable member for Parramatta courteous when he dea clined to answer the question of the Attorney-General as to whether, if he had* been in office, he would have sent troops to Brisbane?",44
292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,"Is that relevant? May T ask the Prime Minister if he is in agreement with the ""language contained in the terms of contract, namely,,. that absolute preference shall be given without any further stipulation.",44
293,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENTAL,"The policy of the vernment is preference to unionists, other things being equal.",45
294,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENTAL,Then I hope that the language which has been referred to will be taken out of the terms of contract at the earliest possible moment since it misrepresents the Government policy.,45
295,Dr CARTY SALMON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Laanecoorie) [4.25] - I must say that I was amazed when I saw the terms of contract, and the departure from the policy as laid down by the Prime Minister. That policy was accepted all round the House. The word ""absolute"" was used more than once when this question was previously discussed, and we were told that it had no right to be included, and was never intended to be included in the policy. Honourable members on this side are entitled to complain about the misrepresentation to which they have been subjected. It has heen said more than once today that members of the Opposition are in favour of preference to non-unionists. That is not so. I do not think that there is a single honourable member on this side of the House who is in favour of that. But I wish that honourable members opposite were as fair as we are in contending that there should be no preference or discrimination to any one.",45
296,Mr TUDOR,DEPARTMENTAL,"Is it not a fact that Mr. Packer, the leader,of the Free Labourers' Union, is also a member of the Liberal party, and is getting money from it?",45
297,Dr CARTY SALMON,DEPARTMENTAL,"I know of members of the Labour party whom I think the Minister of Trade and Customs would not care to sleep with. I do not blame him for that. I do not hold him responsible for every member of his party, and I trust that in the name of decency he will not hold me responsible for every member of the Liberal party. I wish to protest against this misrepresentation, which is unfair, unjust, and certainly not correct. The honourable member for South Sydney frankly admitted that he is here as a representative of one section of the community. I do not know for how many members of his party he spoke, but I take a much higher stand than that. I regard myself as a representative of the people of Australia.",45
298,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENTAL,Fre e Traders as well as Protectionists ?,45
299,Dr CARTY SALMON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Exactly . think I represent the Free Traders as well as the Protectionists, inasmuch as I assist in securing for this country a policy Go- much better than the Free Traders could themselves provide. The honourable mem-' ber for South Sydney has frankly avowed that he stands as a representative of a section.",45
300,Mr RILEY,DEPARTMENTAL,What section?,45
301,Dr CARTY SALMON,DEPARTMENTAL,The unionists.,45
302,Mr RILEY,DEPARTMENTAL,No ; I said that I was elected by the workers.,45
303,Dr CARTY SALMON,DEPARTMENTAL,"I understood the honourable member to say that he was sent here by the unionists, who were the best part of the workers. I accept the explanation given by the honourable member, but I am afraid he will have to correct one word in his Hansard proof to bring his speech into conformity with what he has just said. Complaints are continually made in this House against the misrepresentation to which members of Parliament are subjected. Nothing is more likely to degrade or belittle Parliament in the eyes of the people than this avowed desire on the part of honourable members to regard themselves, and to be regarded, simply as representatives of a class or section. I do not know why the Minister of Home Affairs took scissors and paste to put into a contract the condition to which reference has been made. It was evidently put in some time after the major portion of the document was prepared. Any one who has examined it will observe that the last condition does not form part of the original document. It is typed in different ink, and is upon different paper. It has been snipped out of another piece of paper,_ and stuck upon this document. I hope that it will be snipped out again. If it is necessary to put in a provision of the character indicated by the Prime Minister, I trust that it will be framed in the words used by himself. In the State of Victoria we have a very wise provision with regard to all Government contracts. We say nothing about preference to unionists, but it is specified that there shall be recognised rates of wages paid, and that certai:i conditions shall be observed. - Mr Fenton - The trade union log.",45
304,Dr CARTY SALMON,DEPARTMENTAL,"Quite so; and 1 agree with that. By adopting that system-, we get rid of this invidious discrimination which the Government are endeavouring to steal in. It could not be I done, and probably would not be done on a contract of considerable proportions. I understand that this is a very small matter indeed. The work will cost some Â£2,000 or ^3,000. Had it been a large matter, it would have come under the observation of a more considerable number of people. Had that been the case, this condition would not have been inserted. But the Minister of Home Affairs is very cute and clever. We all know his methods. We can quite imagine how when he was clipping out this condition, and sticking it the contract, he said, "" Ah, this will please the boys! Probably no one will notice it, but it will always remain as a record of my intention to carry out my own policy in my own way I ""  member think that "" This Will Boys,"" would be a good title for a new greater play?",45
305,Dr CARTY SALMON,DEPARTMENTAL,"T am not sure that a play would be a success under such a title. We are entitled to ascertain from the Prime Minister what his view is; because, after all, we may regard him as the head of the Government. We know that an alteration has heen made by the party opposite in regard to the method of forming Governments. Probably that method is a step towards elective Ministries, under which system each Minister will be separately responsible to Parliament. But under the constitutional system that exists, .at present, we look' to the Prime Minister to see that the Ministers at the head of the various Departments shall pav due regard to his own published and expressed opinions regarding policy. The Prime Minister is the mouthpiece of the Government. If a Minister - apparently deliberately - has transgressed against the lines of policy laid down by the Prime Minister, we are entitled to receive from the right honourable gentleman himself a proper notification and assurance that any unfair, improper, and unjust discrimination, which undoubtedly exists in the case of this particular contract, should be withdrawn from it. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin-Min ister pf Home Affairs) [4.32] - I have listened carefully to what honourable members have said. There is no doubt that we have bad a display of rage from them. I do nof know why they should get into such a bad temper. I want to remind honourable members of the questions that the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister on this subject of preference to unionists in 1911. They were as followWhether1. He will define the classes of Government employees within which members of unions will henceforward' be' given priority of appointment over all who are not unionists? 2. Qualifications, such as ability, experience, or physique will be considered, and, if so, to what extent, in the appointments made? 3. The, Ministry proposes to distinguish beinto tween unions when making appointments? 4. Ministers intend to impose any' new conditions upon the choice of permanent employees under the Public Service Acts? 5. If preference is to be granted to unionists, other things being equal between the applicants, who is to determine, and on what evidence, thar comparative qualifications ? 6. The determination mentioned will be final, Please the or subject to appeal? 7. Non-unionists appointed on the ground of personal Qualifications or capacity will be liable to be subsequently displaced in favor of unionists applying for appointment? To those questions, these answers were given- 1. Other qualifications being equal, preference will be given in all cases, a. See No. 1. 3. No Commonwealth law now provides a means of determining this question. 4. No. 5. The officer charged with the duty of selecting. 6 and 7.. No alteration in the present method will be made in these respects. I am absolutely carrying out that system. When I first gave preference to unionists, other things being equal, my instructions were not complied with. Then I issued the order that there was to be absolute preference to unionists, which meant that the first order must be carried out. Absolute preference to unionists means exactly what it says-othe r things being equal. But there is not to be preference to non-unionists, and they are not to refuse to carry out my absolute orders Progress reported. ' FRIDAY SITTINGS.",46
306,Mr FISHER,DEPARTMENTAL,"When the order of business was being determined, I stated that it would be understood that on Fridays the sitting would terminate at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and as I have not withdrawn or qualified that statement, and desire always to keep my promise; I shall not ask honourable, members to remain longer today, but I wish it to be understood that this arrangement will not be considered binding on the Government after today.
