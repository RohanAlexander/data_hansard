Mr Fenton,-Has the Prime Minister noticed the statement in the preBs that the Prime Minister ofCanada is likely to pay a visit to Great Britain to consult with the British Cabinet on.problems of Empire; and can the! right honourable gentleman inform the Blouse whether there has been concerted action by the overseas Dominions to bring about a consultation of that kind ?",4
1,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I have not seen the statement in the press, but I have private information, though not from the Prime Minister of Canada. Beyond the public statements that I have made, there have been no negotiations with other Dominions on this subject, and I do not think that it would be wise to do what the honourable member speaks of. It has been left entirely with the British Government to say what is necessary and best for the protection of the Empire and . the success of the war. SUPPLY OF MUNITIONS. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I ask the Minister for .the Navy, in view of the fact that the British Government have invited able business men to co-operate in the organization for the supplying of munitions, if the same thing can be done here. Cannot leading business men, who are not bound up with red-tape technicalities, take charge of this work f",4
2,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The Defence Department has not yet lost control of this part, of its administration, and is, I think, capable of doing all that is necessary. HOBART LIGHT DUES.",4
3,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"The Hobart Daily Post, in its issue of Monday, 7th June, contained .an interview with the Treasurer of Tasmania, headed-: "" Treasurer's Successful Intervention."" In the course of the interview, the Treasurer is reported to have said:He felt, however, that if his visit resulted in any reduction^ he would have accomplished what the deputation had failed to do, and that made him more determined, knowing the justice of the claim, to not let it rest until a reduction was definitely conceded. He felt that his trip to Melbourne had been folly justified, as he was convinced that but for that interview with Mr Tudor there would have been no reduction, but that the charge of Sd. per ton would have come into operation on 1st April. I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs .whether, in view of the valuable information furnished him by the deputation, which consisted of Tasmanian Federal members, and the Master Warden and Wardens of the Hobart Marine Board, he will, in justice to all concerned, kindly acquaint the House of the actual facts in connection with this important matter, so that the people of the Commonwealth may be able to judge whether Mr Lyons was justified in making the statement he is reported to have made?",4
4,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"No one individual is justified in asserting that the reduction m the light dues was brought about through his efforts alone. The statement of Mr Lyons that the charge of 8d. per ton would have come into operation on the 1st April last, had it not been for his interview with me, is not correct. The light dues did not come into operation on the 1st April, because the States had not at that date agreed to hand over to the Commonwealth the lighthouses which we propose to take over; and, indeed, one or two of the States: have not yet done so. Unless all the States have agreed to do this by next week, I shall proceed with the Bill now before the House, with a view to empowering the Commonwealth to take over the collection of light dues. Every Tasmanian representative, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, has been very active in this matter; and the statement that Mr Lyons alone is responsible for the reduction is incorrect. If any person is entitled to special mention, it is the honourable member for Denison, who has been exceedingly active in his efforts to get the reduction made. PAPER.

PEACE NEGOTIATIONS.",5
5,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"In view of the widesDread misery and loss occasioned by the present disastrous war, will the Prime Minister, as the leader of an enlightened Democracy favourable to. the settlement of international disputes by conciliation and arbitration, consider the advisability of taking appropriate steps, through the Imperial Government or otherwise, to ascertain what ends the belligerent nations are seeking to attain, and on what terms they are prepared to conclude peace, so that united action of the Commonwealth towards that object may be taken ?",5
6,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I believe that every member of this House and of the Parliament, and every person in the country, desires an honourable peace at an early date,, but I do not think that the time has come to intervene with a statement of the kind proposed to His Majesty's British Government, which is responsible for carrying on the war. Such a course might, and I think would"", be misrepresented' by the enemies of our country into an admission that we are weakening in our determination to see the war out to the bitter end, and to either succeed or go under. PASSPORTS.",5
7,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The other day the honourable member for Richmond asked for information regarding the issue of passnorts, and I .am now furnished with a full reply to his question. As soon as the Commonwealth took over the issue of passports full particulars were furnished to the Collectors of Customs at Brisbane, Sydney, Hobart, and Adelaide, and to the Commonwealth Public Service Inspector at Perth, who were instructed to insert paragraphs in the press advising applicants that the necessary forms and information could be obtained from their respective offices. The new regulations with regard to the supply' of two unmounted photographs by applicants, and the necessity for persons travelling to France and Belgium to have their passports visaed by a French or Belgium consular officer respectively, were passed on the 18th February last. Copies of these regulations were sent to the Collectors of Customs mentioned above, and to the Commonwealth Public Service In spector, Perth. Copies were also sent to Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son and to the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Steam Navigation Companies at Melbourne, who were requested to brine; the new requirements under the notice of their branches in the various States. At the instance of the Imperial Government a new form of passport is being prepared, and the existing regulations amended and consolidated. It is anticipated that the new regulations will be passed this week. As soon as they have received the aooroval of the Governor General in Council a fresh circular giving full instructions and information will be sent to the shipping companies. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES.

10,Mr JENSEN,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"I understand that such an offer has been made, and is under consideration.",6
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister if the answer given yesterday by the Assistant Minister of Defence to a question asked by the honourable member for Grampians, that "" w e have a sufficient number of recruits so far,"" indicates the mind of the Government on the subject? Does the right honourable gentleman think that such a statement will tend to stimulate recruiting ? Do the Government not want any more recruits than they are now getting?",6
12,Mr EISHER,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,My honourable colleague could answer the question as effectively as I can. The interpretation put on his answer of yesterday is not what he had in his mind.,6
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"I have given the answer, without placing any interpretation on it .",6
14,Mr FISHER,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,A strained- I hope unconsciously strained-meanin g has been placed on the answer; I trust not for political purposes.,6

17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,I rose to a point of order.,6
18,Mr SPEAKER,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"The honourable memRECRUITS: ber did not say that he rose to order, and : if he objects to a statement made by the Prime Minister, or by any one else, he must do so in the proper way. I am sure that the Prime Minister will not persist in any statement that the right honourable member considers objectionable.",6
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,I rise to order. T did so before.,6
20,Mr SPEAKER,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"I do not wish to get to cross-purposes with the right honourable member, but I appeal to his own side to say if , on the first occasion, he said that he rose to a point of order.",6
21,Mr KING OMALLEY,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,He meant to do so.,6
22,Mr SPEAKER,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,The right honourable member must not repeat his statement. ',6
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,I rise to a point of order. I wish to know if the Prime M in ister is in order in imputing unworthy motives to me on almost every occasion upon which I ask a question. I resent it keenly.,6
24,Mr SPEAKER,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"Neithe r the Prime Minister nor any other member may impute unworthy motives, and I again, for about the third time, draw the attention, of Ministers to the difficulties that the House will encounter if the answering of questions without notice is continued to. the extent that it has been practised for some time past.",6
25,Mr EISHER,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"I had no intention to reflect on the Leader of the Opposition. The Ministry have declared their policy on this subject time and again. They want every able-bodied man in Australia to join the ranks, and to be trained so that he may go to the front if necessary. We intend to carry out that policy, and merely shall be glad to accept help from any one. I did not impute motives to the right honourable member, but I say that he did not correctly interpret the answer of my honourable colleague.",6
26,Mr MASSYGREENE,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"Can the Assistant Minister of Defence say whether all the troops now in training have been supplied with warm clothing, and whether, if they are training in dungarees, he considers that they are clothed in good winter material ?",6
27,Mr JENSEN,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"Some of the recruits in camp may be clothed in dungarees, but. they are all supplied with warm woollen singlets and underpants. The medical authorities say that in this way they are sufficiently warmly clothed.",6
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"Can the Assistant Minister of Defence explain the unconscionable delay that occurs in telegraphing casualties to Australia ? I cite my own case. My son was wounded on the first day of the Dardanelles operations, but sixteen days elapsed before he was reported wounded here.",7
29,Mr MCGRATH,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"I know of a case of a man who was killed on the first day, but yet the fact was not known here until yesterday.",7
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"There is something wrong in a system which permits this delay, and I ask the Minister whether he will look into the question seriously and see if the trouble cannot be remedied ?",7
31,Mr JENSEN,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"Severa l days may intervene before the wounded in the fighting line can be placed on board a hospital ship, and then when they are taken to Alexandria, Cairo, or Great Britain, and placed in hospitals, it may take some time before the officials can go round and ascerare tain their identity.",7
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,It should not take so long.,7
33,Mr JENSEN,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,The honourable member - cannot expect to receive a cable message from the seat of war as soon as a man is wounded.,7
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"When a man is in the hospital, the fact should be reported instantly.",7
35,Mr FISHER,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,We can only give the facts as we have been advised regarding them.,7
36,Mr JENSEN,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"All these postal and cable matters, and the question of the supply of information to the relatives of the wounded, have been discussed by the Minister and Colonel Legge; and the latter, who is on his way to the front, has been instructed to see into-them. We cannot do more. We are doing all that we can. We are not responsible at this end for any delay in the cabling of information from the other end.",7
37,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"Are there any regulations guiding the conduct of doctors at Liverpool in the matter of communicating with the friends or relatives of men who die or who are ill in camp ? A case has come under my notice of a man who wrote to his wife on a Saturday to say that he was quite well, bub was put in hospital on the Monday following, and the first intimation of it that his wife received was a message, "" Your husband is dead; come at once."" The absence of any intermediate communication is unpardonable.",7
38,Mr JENSEN,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"I shall have a conversation with the Minister of Defence in reference to the matter referred to; but I can assure honourable members that everything that the Minister can do in this direction is being done, and will be done.",7
39,Mr FLEMING,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,Will the Assistant Minister of Defence ask the Minister to issue more definite instructions to country doctors so that men will not be passed as recruits in the country and come to the cities to be afterwards rejected ? There are numerous cases of this sort occurring every week.,7
40,Mr JENSEN,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,I shall bring the matter under the notice of the Minister.,7
41,Mr MATHEWS,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"Will the Department make some provision for the supervision of the clothes of men while they submitting themselves for medical inspection, in order to see that the men are not robbed? Many persons have complained that they have been robbed after they have stripped and passed into another room for inspection by the doctors-on e man, named Morris, complaining of having lost £5 in this way.",7
42,Mr JENSEN,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"I shall communicate with the Minister of Defence in order to see that provision is made whereby a person who has left .his clothes in a certain place will not be robbed. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Yester day, the Attorney-General, in reply to a question by the honourable member for Ballarat, promised to make some statement this morning regarding a matter connected with insurance. Does he propose to make that statement today ?",7
43,Mr HUGHES,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"All that I have been able to do so far has been to look into the matter, and ascertain so far as possible what the Government and this Parliament can do in regard to it. On looking up the papers in the Department, I ascertained that the point had been raised in various letters; and, as I have made an appointment to receive a deputation from the insurance companies on Wednesday next, I thought it well to leave the matter in. abeyance until I could put it before the deputation, and see exactly what the insurance companies propose to do.

44,Mr KELLY,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,Does the Minister propose this morning to carry out the promise made last night to lay the Griffin papers on the table of the House?,8
45,Mr ARCHIBALD,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"As soon as the work, which is now in hand, of having the papers copied is completed, they will be laid on the table. I was asked by the honourable member for South Sydney when the Department of Home Affairs would hand over the woollen mills at Geelong to the Defence Department. I have made inquiries, and have to inform the honourable member that the work is completed, with the exception of the steam connexions to the various machines, which are expected to be completed about the end of this month. The work is being expedited, and we are resorting to overtime in order to do so. ETJROA POST OFFICE .  the Postmaster-General, upon notice I.

48,Mr FISHER,DELA Y IN NOTIFYING CASUALTIES,"In answer to the honourable member's question, I desire to say, on behalf of the Ministry, that, in all matters relating to the conduct of this war, no party interests are involved. So far as the Government is concerned it will accept advice and assistance from any one outside or inside Parliament, in order effectively to carry out the determination of the people of Australia to give all the assistance in their power to help bring the war to an early and successful issue. However, viewing the position in the most patriotic spirit, the Government feels it would not be in the best interests of the country for it to share its responsibility for the administrative acts necessary to the effective carrying out of that policy.

52,Mr GROOM,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"the Attorney General, upon notice I. Is the following extract from the Daily Herald, of Adelaide, of 3rd June, a correct report of his remarks at the recent Labour | j , ,,- Conference on the subject of preference to unionists in temporary employment in the Commonwealth:-""The mode of procedure was for the Departments to notify the secretary the unions of vacancies.

In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed from 10th June, vide page 3942) DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS. Division 98 (Administrative S t a f f ) , £31,209. Mr FINLAYSOJ r (Brisbane) [10.59]. - Las t ""Wednesday the Minister of Home Affairs favoured me with the following reply to a question that I had put to h i in regard, to the designs for the Federal Parliamentary buildings at Canberra:1. The proposed amended scheme of petition is based on that already issued, is now receiving consideration by the Fedethe rated Council of Architects, and. the Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction preparatory to its final adoption. 2. It is considered that since the war, ditions have so altered that the most practicin able and advisable course 'will be to restrict the competition to British countries. In previous competition for the lay-out of the the conditions were not acceptable to British designers, and practically no designs from were forthcoming, 3. There are no objections to receiving ther suggestions, but the matter has been fully - considered by the Government, and the opinion is that the course proposed to be adopted in all the circumstances, be satisfactory. I rose principally to say that the condition tions sought to be imposed by the M i ister and the Government are not satisof factory; indeed, they are decidedly unsatisfactory, because of their partial and the labour. parochial aspect.",9
54,Mr JH CATTS,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Is this a criticism unions should be of the Government?,9
55,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Yes , and particularly of the Minister of Home Affairs.",9
56,Mr JH CATTS,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,I did not think followed that this would be allowed.,9
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,It is most certainly what procedure out of order.,9
58,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"This is about the time when steps should be taken towards parcommencing the architectural work in the given? Capital city. The honourable member for of the Darwin, when Minister of Home Affairs, of instituted a competition for designs of the emparliamentary buildings, but was not allowed to carry that competition to finality. The conditions he attached to the original best competition were sadly interfered with by his successor, the honourable member deals for Wentworth, who imposed conditions on which were only less objectionable than those introduced by the present Minister.' His proposal, which evidently has been approved of by the Government, to restrict the competition to British architects, shows an inadequate conception of the class of building which we propose to erect at Can: berra, and the conditions that ought to attend the erection of what will be the dominant feature in the Capital city. In his replies to me the Minister suggested that, owing to the conditions of the competition for the lay-out of the city not having been acceptable to British architects, we should alter our conditions for m the buildings competition so as to confine the competition to British architects. That is about the most feeble and puerile argucomment that any one could advance. Some and little time ago designs were invited for Commonwealth offices in London, and the British architects denounced some of the conditions that were imposed, particoncularly that of preference to unionists, and their high and haughty style declined the to compete. That did not deter the then city Minister from proceeding with the work. The Government of the day refused to be them influenced by the decision of the British architects. It is now suggested that, befurcause British designers did not like the conditions in regard to the lay-out comwill, petition, we must try to meet their offended dignity by limiting the competifor the buildings design to British narchitects. That proposal is wrong from various points of view. British architects do not possess a monopoly of the architectural skill of the world; indeed, one wonders where the Minister expects British architects to have gained knowledge and experience sufficient to justify them in even submitting a design for parliamentary buildings that is not to be open to criticism and competition from architects in other parts of the world. There is only one Parliament House in the British Empire that can be in any way compared with the building we propose to erect at Canberra, and that is the Parliament House at Westminster. There are several parliamentary buildings in Canada, and there is a most convenient legislative structure in Cape Town, but excepting that in London, there is not one parliamentary building in the British Empire which could be accepted as an illustration or guide to what we wish to create at Canberra. We are acquainted through the medium of photographs with various parliamentary buildings in the capital cities of Europe, but the action of the Minister will deny Australia the advantage of the experience, knowledge, and training possessed by the architects in Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Rome, Brussels, Stockholm, Moscow, Petrograd, and other big cities. It will also deny us the experience of the architects"" of America. The United States has at least thirty parliamentary buildings, because, in addition to the Congressional chambers at Washington, most of the States have their own legislative buildings. And there is no doubt that in certain features of building construction America is leading the world. There are some features of American buildings that do not appeal to us, but from an engineering point of view American architects are showing inventive genius and resource that are not being approached in any other part of the world. When we think of the parliamentary structures in the cities of Europe and America, and remember that the men who created those designs are to be excluded from advising and assisting Australia in the designing of its parliamentary .buildings, we must realise that the Minister has made a mistake. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The inside arrangement of the Washington Parliavarious ment House is perfection itself.",9
59,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I have not seen petitions the Congressional chambers, but I have visited a large number of the parliamentary buildings of the States; I have a little acquaintance with the Parliament House in Cape Town; and I have some knowledge of the parliamentary buildings in Canada, and of Westminster itself.",10
60,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,The Minister's action may lead to yet another unfortunate result-action s for damages by those who entered the original competition.,10
61,Mr RILEY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,If we continue choppingaud changing we shall never get to Canberra.,10
62,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"The worse feature of the competition which the Minister has arranged is that it represents a breach of faith with those who entered the original competition. The only fault I find with the conditions imposed by the honourable member for Wentworth"" was that the adjudication was to take place in London by men who had not an intimate knowledge of and personal acquaintance with the conditions in Australia. By the mere inclusion of a condition that the designs should be adjudicated upon in Australia after a visit to the site to obtain first-hand knowledgeof the local conditions, the competition formulated by the honourable member for Wentworth would have given us good results. We must not overlook the fact that the parliamentary buildings in Canberra will be the dominating feature. The selected site on Camp Hill is a very attractive one; it has a beautiful outlook and is in the centre of the best landscape features of the city. If we make a mistake in regard to this central building that mistake will filter through the city, and I am afraid that the same mess-up and unsatisfactory squabble that we have had over the design of the layout will be repeated and perpetuated in regard to the buildings. If the Parliament .Houses were not to be the main and central buildings of the city there might be some justification for the Minister's action in limiting the competition in some ways to certain architects; but there are to be scores of buildings, and I will gladly assist the Minister in restricting the competition for some of the designs even more closely than he proposes torestrict the competition for the Parliament House. The administrative buildings, the town hall, the theatres, and the public institutions will provideabundant opportunities for special comrestricted to British architects. and in some cases, I hope, to Australian architects exclusively, because I believe that in the Commonwealth we have architects second to none in the British Empire. As a matter of fact, when the designs for the Commonwealth offices in London were received they were so unsatisfactory that the Minister of Home Affairs sent Mr Murdoch to London, and he, by a small and inexpensive alteration of the accepted design, gave us a very much increased floor space. Mr KING O'MALLEY - And £ 3 , 0 0 0 a year in rent. - Mr FINLAYSON - Y e t I suppose Mr Murdoch would be excluded from the competition for the parliamentary buildings. I have not found that the competitive principle is a good thing in ordinary life. My own experience is that it is better to select your architect, and, after consultation, give him the job. The principle of competition in connection with the buildings at Canberra seems to be accepted, although it has not proved a success in the past. I hold some rough notes given to me two years ago by a gentleman who has exhibited more professional ability and more courageous thought in regard to building than any other architect in the Commonwealth. I refer to Mr Kirkpatrick, the Chairman of the Board which adjudicated on the plans for the lay-out of the Federal - Capital city. In regard to competitions for buildings, Mr Kirkpatrick saidIs the Minister aware that the London - County Council held an important competition for their new offices, and that the result - was a failure? Is he aware that the Winnipeg Parliament House's plans were subjected to a competition, :and docs he know the result? Again, the last competition in America for the new Law Courts, New York, costing about .£3,000,000, when the judges were specially --selected by the various architectural institutes, - eventuated in yet another instance of failure. Carnegie's Peace Palace, Hague, Holland, was built a few years ago under an architectural competition throughout the world. Practically all countries sent in plans, and judges were appointed, nominated by different institutes of architects, appointing such men as Calcott (England), Professor Ware (America), and judges from Germany and France, all - good and first-class experts, and again a - gigantic failure resulted.",10
63,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"What mean by "" fail u r e "" ? Greater choice is - given.",11
64,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"We get a sort of scratch, hotch-potch design, the result of a number of different men, with different ideas, endeavouring to arrive at a common plan. Instead of representing the dominant idea and creation of one man's individual thought",11
65,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,The plans are not mixed together.,11
66,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"The difficulty is that we get too many ideas in the one plan. St. Paul's Cathedral, in London, is definitely associated in history, and in our minds, with the dominant ideas of an extra Christopher Wren, and a similar remark may be made as to the design for the parliamentary buildings in the metropolis.",11
67,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"If there are twelve competitors, does not each one put his best thought and work into his particular plan, and thus give a choice of twelve designs? How are they mixed up?",11
68,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I shall give an opposite illustration. We invited designs from all over the world for the layout of the Federal city, and we got some splendid work from many countries. The Adjudicating Board decided on a special design which was accepted as the basis of all the designs.",11
69,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"What does the honourable member mean by "" the basis of all the designs?"" Was not each design made independently?",11
70,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"But this design was accepted as the basis of the final design-it was not accepted in its entirety, but with the object of incoporating the best features of the other designs.",11
71,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,That is the weak spot-tryin g to improve on a complete design.,11
72,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,E x a c t l y ; that is the difficulty we have today.,11
73,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,But that is not due to the competitive system.,11
74,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I am merely using this as an illustration of what happened in regard to the first design, and what will happen in regard to the designs for the buildings if we follow the same course.",11
75,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"The f a u l t lies in meddling with the complete design, and not with the competitive system. do you Mr KELLY - I do not think that what the honourable member for Brisbane suggests would be possible under the terms of the competition as drawn up when I was at the Department.",11
76,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"What I have indicated is due to the fact that no single competitive design will completely satisfy the adjudicators. We must not forget that there is such a thing as professional jealousy-that the adjudicators have their own ideas. Some points in any one design will appeal to them, along with some points in another design; and, having their own ideas, they conclude that by their incorporation in one design a better result is obtained.",12
77,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"The adjudicators had not to make the design, but to award a prize for the best; and the successful designer was to be employed as architect.",12
78,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Did not the adjudicators, in regard to the laying out of the site, recommend that a new design should be prepared, incorporating the best features of the accepted design?",12
79,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I do not think so. If that were so, it is news to me.",12
80,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"The honourable member must not forget that a number of competitive designs give the Minister a wider choice of something approaching to his ideal; and if he mixes them up afterwards that is his fault, and not the fault of the competitive system.",12
81,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"The Minister of Home Affairs, in the case to which I have referred, did not pretend to decide the matter, but referred it to experts.",12
82,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,The same trouble would arise if there were only one design.,12
83,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Exactly .,12
84,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Then the does not lie with the competitive system.,12
85,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I am merely saying that I am not at all impressed favourably with the idea of competition in regard to the designing of the buildings. My experience may not be worth much, but, personally, I have found, as I think most other people have found, that it is much better to select a man, and allow him to work out his own ideas, under, of course, some reasonable restrictions and oversight. Where there is competition, particularly in an untried matter like that now under consideration, we get such a heterogeneous collection of ideas, that it is impossible to select one design, and decide absolutely that it is the one to be adopted. We are compelled to try to gather the best features of all the designs, and then, as I say, we have as a result a hotch-potch arrangement which gives satisfaction to no one ",12
86,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Does not that argument apply to competitions of the kind all over the world?,12
87,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Exactly .,12
88,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Then what is the value of the argument?,12
89,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,The best buildings in the world today-thos e poems in stone-were not submitted to competition.,12
90,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I think that that statement requires to be modified. Most of those "" poems in stone "" are the products of very many architectural minds, as wit-, ness Westminster Abbey, which, I think, is regarded by experts as a much finer building than St. Paul's. Westminster Abbey represents no one man's idea, and the same remark may be made of almost any notable cathedral.",12
91,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"The Law Courts in London, St. Mary's in Edinburgh, the Town Hall in Manchester, and many other great buildings were erected without competitive designs. True, such buildings as these are not usually wholly erected at one time, but are gradually added to, care being taken that the dominant feature of the original design is preserved; and an illustration of this is afforded by Westminster Abbey. The trouble is that in many cases the dominant idea is not preserved; and the result is an incongruous building- a building without homogeneity.",12
92,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,There was an attempt fault made in the programme drawn up by myself to arrive at the end the honourable member desires.,12
93,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"The fact that Sir Christopher Wren carried out the whole of the work of St. Paul's does not prove that there were not designs from eleven other competitors, which may have been rejected in favour of his.",12
94,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Exactly .,12
95,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Then it is not the competitive feature to which the honourable member objects, but to interference with the complete design after it has been adopted.",12
96,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I accept the honourable member's suggestion, but I go further. I say that once the design is accepted, the originator should be given charge of the work, and allowed to select from the other designs what he thinks will improve his own and give the best results.",12
97,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,That may be-a n architect may improve his own design.,13
98,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,But it is because of interference by so many different authorities that we have the present muddle at the Federal Capital today. Mr Bruce .SMITH - No doubt ficials of the British Works Department had been allowed to interfere with topher Wren's design the cathedral would not be the perfect thing it is.,13
99,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"At Washington, for instance, L'Enfant made the design for the city area, and some interfering people, as here in Australia, interfered with it.",13
100,Mr FOWLER,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Christophe r Wren's original design for St. Paul's was interParliament fered with by the authorities.,13
101,Mr BHUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Then it may have been spoiled to that extent;,13
102,Mr FOWLER,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"It was, to a certain tent.",13
103,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Unles s a man is Federal permitted to carry out his own ideas, expressed in his design, the result must be patchy work, more or less of a failure. At Washington it costs the country lions to bring the building back to the original design, and there are examples such interference to be found all over world today. There are very few notable structures in regard to which the original designer has been allowed a free hand; but in all cases where he has been, the results have been successful. There is no reason that I can see why this comfor our central building. petition should be limited to British architects, and on this point I cannot derstand the attitude of the Minister.",13
104,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,I am glad to see this cosmopolitan spirit coming into the honourable member's views!,13
105,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Howeve r that may be, on what ground does the Minister limit to British architects the architecrequire. tural ability necessary for the main buildings at the Federal Capital? What knowledge have they of Australian cona ditions? South Africa is the only part of the British Empire in which condiand tions approximating to those of Australia can he found. What do London archiconsiderable tects know of our requirements? do Canadian architects know of them?",13
106,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Why object to Canaman dian architects?,13
107,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Canadia n conditions are the very antipodes of those in Australia, and buildings suitable for the Dominion would be an absolute monstrosity in the Commonwealth. I repeat that South Africa represents the only part of the Empire where architects might be expected to have an approximate knowif ofledge of what we require.",13
108,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Is that why a Chicago Chrisarchitect has been so successful?,13
109,Mr FINLAYSON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"At any rate, I repeat that we are more likely to get a satisfactory design for a parliamentary building from America than from any other country, seeing that every State of. the Union has its Parliament House. But in the British Empire there is only one House that would be likely to comply with Australian conditions, and that is in South Africa. Why should we deprive ourselves of the services of exFrench, Swedish, and American archi-. tects? In regard to the lay-out of the city, there was a world-wide comas petition, and the most successful design came from America, the second best from Finland, and the third best from France. milAlthough we have accepted these de^ signs, and are trying to incorporate them of in a very faulty and unfair way, their the originators are excluded from the com-, petition for the main building, which, of course, will be the dominating feature of the city. I appeal to the Minister, to open his mind, so that we may have the widest possible. choice of design I venture to suggest that for the work of adjudication unon the designs to be called for, there are two men specially qualified. My time limit has expired, but I may be allowed to say that those two men are Mr Griffin) the designer of the lay-out of the city, and Mr Murdoch, the architect of the Department, who knows exactly what we Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [11.28] - I desire once more to refer to matter which has been the subject of some questions by myself in the House) of interviews and correspondence with the Department, extending over a period. I refer to a case What in regard to which I asked questions recently in the House. A workingsome years ago, in order to make provision for hi3 old age, bought a piece of land on the Liverpool area,, on which he and his son were in the habit of spending their week-ends - His idea was that in improving the land and preparing it for cultivation, he might be able to derive a modest income from it, and to live on it in his declining years. The military authorities, for good and sufficient reasons, considered that an area, of which this land formed a very small portion, was required for a manoeuvring area. The land is very conveniently situated to Sydney, near to one or two railway systems, and there is also the navigable George's River skirting one side. The Government decided to resume certain of this land, including the small area, which this man, who is only a -^working man dependent on his. weekly wage, had had the forethought to acquire, to provide a means of subsistence in his old age. It is a very inexpensive area, as honourable members will understand, because a man in his position could not have sufficient means to acquire land of a better quality. Offers to purchase have been made to him, and the other day I showed the Minister the original letter sent to him by a man named Kirkland, whom I know very well, in which he made an offer statiug that the most he felt prepared to pay was £600, a considerable advance on what the Department is offering. I may mention that the father and son were working this land, improving it at the time this resumption was decided upon, and I understand the offer of Mr Kirkland was made prior to the decision of the Government to resume the land. When the Government decided to resume, all chance of selling was at an end, and the matter has now been hanging in suspense for two or three years. The owner is in the very unfortunate position of neither being able to get a fair amount of compensation from the Government, nor of being able to dispose of the land privately, notwithstanding that he has an offer - larger than the amount the Government are prepared to give. When speaking on Supply the other day,. I brought the matterunder the attention of the Minister. I referred to what I considered was the undignified attitude of the Government-to call it by noworseterm--in making useof its powers by taking: men of that kind into Court in order to coerce them into the acceptance of a sum which they felt to be Mr W. Elliot Johnson. absolutely inadequate, and far below the true value of the land. The Minister said that no such thing was being done, and that my statement was incorrect. I told him I objected to men being harassed because they were not in a position to leave their employment without risking the loss of it , in order to fight the Government in the High Court, and that, even if they were successful, but did not get the full amount claimed, they would be mulcted in costs which would probably amount to more than the land was worth. Rather than risk the consequences of such a proceeding, many men were forced to accept a sum far below the real value of their property, and when I said that this was being done in this case the Minister said the statement was not correct. His answer is reported in. Hansard. Since then I have obtained a notice from the Supreme Court that was sent to this man, Mr. Walton. It readsIn the matter of the Lands Acquisition Act 1906, in the matter of the Judiciary Act 19031912, Commonwealth of Australia, and the matter of the disputed claim for compensation between the Minister of State for Home Affairs of the Commonwealth of Australia, applicant, and John Edwin W_alton respondent. Take notice that this matter for the determination (of the amount of compensation payable herein has been set down for hearing on Monday, the I4th day of June. That is Monday next. Yet when I said this sort of thing was being done the Minister replied that I was incorrect.",13
110,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"You said we were being hard on poor men. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Well , I say now you are being hard on poor men.",14
111,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"You shall have the facts when you sit down. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I know that these are the facts. When I asked the other day if this matter had been further considered, and said that the amount involved was not very large, the Minister said it was the difference between £200 and' £900.",14
112,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Righ t 1 Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Thafe.is not correct. I think the Minister has made a mistake. The amount offered, I understand, is £400.",14
113,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"What is your claim ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I do not know what the exact amount is. l£r. ARCHIBALD - It is £900 - moTe that £900. M i. W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Then the amount at issue is the difference between £400 and £900. But the point is that thia man has been offered £600 for the land by a careful Scotsman, who is not inclined to throw his money away.",14
114,Mr BEUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,You would go on the principle that the value of the land is its worth in the open market. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I take it that the probable value of the land is about £900 if a canny and very careful Scotsman is prepared to offer £600 for it.,15
115,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"When did he offer thisbefore the resumption or afterwards? . Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I do not know what the date was, but I understand that it was prior to the resumption - that the offer was made. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Thes e holders ought to be sympathetically treated.",15
116,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,And they are.,15
117,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Si r James Martin said in the Supreme Court, in regard to man ? resumptions, that the owners should be treated generously, and then have cent, added.",15
118,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I am quite willing proceed on that principle. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Es - his pecially in a-case of this kind, where land has a considerable prospective value for sub-divisional purposes. This land, in a direct line, is only 13 miles distant from Sydney, only 2 or 3 Commonwealth miles from a railway station, and yet £3 an acre is the value put upon it. I do not believe you can get land, buyporation ing privately, of course, anywhere within 13 miles of any of the capital cities Australia at so cheap a rate as £ 3 an acre. If the land were not resumed, syndicates would be willing to buy it and they would probably be able to sell at from 10s. to 15s. a foot, if not Land not very far away from this pargo ticular land was sold privately at the of 30s. per foot; and if land of that character, on the top of a cliff, very diffiI cult to get at in comparison with this ing to do that? land, is worth 30s. a foot, then this particular land must be worth a great deal more. I understand that surrounding hope. land, less favourably situated, has been valued at a very much higher rate, that a higher rate of compensation - been given by the Government. What is the explanation of that? There should be some explanation. I have tried to get a satisfactory reason for the action of the Department, but so far I have been unsuccessful. I ask the Minister not to adopt a Shylock .attitude in regard to small claims like this. This man is getting well on in years. He is reaching the time when he will no longer be physically able to carry on his ordinary occupation, and he had looked forward to going to this place in his declining years, with his son to assist him in developing the land. This son is now at the front-givin g his services to his country-and , in his absence, the father is being haled before the High Court at the instance of the Commonwealth, who desire to coerce and force him into accepting as compensation an amount far below what he believes to be the true value of that small land. If that is not harassing working men-me n who are not in a position to fight a Government-the n I do not know what term may be applied to it . Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is he a wealthy Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - He is 10 per a working man on weekly wages. If he leaves his employment without to the permission of his employer to go to the Court he will risk the loss of job, and, as I said before, if he wins the his case he may be mulcted in costs exceeding the value of his land. I say it is not a proper thing, it is not a fair thing, it is not a decent thing for the to put itself in that position when dealing with men of this kind. If they were dealing with a wealthy coror a wealthy individual the probability is that the matter would be arof ranged out of Court, but this is a poor man, and he is in consequence being forced to support his claim with all the attendant up, inconvenience and cost before the High Court. I ask the Minister to stop the more. High Court proceedings, and to again into this matter a little more carefully/ rate with a little more consideration for the man who has to lose possession of his land. will ask the Minister if he would be will",15
119,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I cannot hold out any Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Then and this man is to be dragged before the has Court.

120,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"There is no injustice at all. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It is injustice; a flagrant injustice! I feel very hotly about these things, because, if there is injustice and tyranny, it rouses me more than anything else.",16
121,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Si t down, and let me give the Committee the facts. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I say these are the facts, so far been presented to me. The mere fact of a man, whose son is at the war, fighting the battles of the Empire, being haled before the Court for a paltry matterof this kind is a disgrace to any Governtbat ment which lends itself to such a proceedI ing-to taking an undue advantage of working man's financial inability to fight a powerful Government in the of the country to obtain a fair and square deal.",16

I would suggest to the Minister the that he arrange to meet these men in in Sydney and avoid litigation by talking over the matter with them. Even if he paid them a little more than he now offers the it would be better than incurring the exof a big law suit. When I took over a site for the new post-office in Perth, amounting to £250,000 were made, but I went over, and, as the result of personal interviews with the claimants, I settled for £166,400. I urge the Ministo see these men, even if he has to pay their fares to Melbourne in order that Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - They canafford to leave their jobs to come'to office Melbourne. They are poor men. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Perhaps so. In one case in Western Australia. I settled for £58,500, where a claim was made for It is all very well to leave these matters to the officers of the Department; no doubt they will carefully consider them, do what they think is absolutely right. But a business man, as soon as he comes on the scene and discusses the issues involved with the parties concerned, is by usually able to arrive at an agreement which will avoid all litigation. The Minespecially in the case of small men, should talk over their claims with them with a view to a settlement out of Court. I am sure that the great Labour party not desire to crush any one. When I held office we could not arrive at an agreement with regard to the taking over the Duntroon Estate, and finally Mr. Campbell came out from England, and met me at the Federal Capital on 13th March, 1913. There was a difference of £30,000 or £40,000 between us, in but a3 the result of this personal intera little view we arrived at a satisfactory settlement within less than an hour. Many years ago in this chamber I suggested the erection of a Commonwealth building in London, and there was a lot of sneering at the suggestion. When the Cabinet decided to erect such a building, the High Commissioner recommended that we should choose an eminent man to design it, and we chose a big firm of London architects. When their design came to Melbourne it was exhibited in the Melbourne Town Hall, and Mr Murdoch, the Home Affairs architect, who thirty years before had been trained by the firm that designed it, discovered on spection that too much space was lost by the ornamentation. Subsequently, after a consultation between the honourable member for Barrier, who was then Minister of External Affairs, and myself, in which I pointed out that a business building ought to be on a business basis, the honourable member determined to send Mr Murdoch to London. Mr Murdoch went to London, and, without interfering with his old boss, Mr MCKenzie, he got put into the building accommodation that increased its rentals by £3,250 a year, and without destroying its ornamental appearance. If we continue without organization and system in the slipshod methods of the past, we shall continue to receive what we have been getting in the neck from the Germans, but if we mean organization, efficiency, that. mobilization, and progressive development on lines of modernization we must reform.

Unfortunately, our government is not organized, which is the point to which I am directing attention. Are we to have a capital designed in accordance with theideas of a little island, as our railway systems are ? We use little trucks, when, by using large ones we could save animmense amount of money. Mr BOYD:-The railways of Victoria pay. Mr KING O'MALLEY - In Tasmania we lose £70,000 a year on the in- railways.

The English architects attempted to dictate to us, and I did not think that we should allow that.

No one has claimed that the Board did not do justice to the designs submitted.",18

149,Mr FOWLER,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Canad a will become a greater country than the United States of America. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I hope so. No one would cheer that more than the Americans.,18
150,Mr FENTON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"The honourable member Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am a I was born in Canada, and made my mother to the United States of America when I was two years old. There I got my training, and then I came out here, and helped to make the laws, and laid out too the Federal Capital, and gave you a banking system that, had it been wholly carried out, would have created the governgreatest bank on earth. . Dr MALONEY - We should not have had our present bank had it not-been for the honourable member. Mr KING O'MALLEY - For fourteen years I was the only man in this House who made a speech on banking.",18
151,Mr BOYD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"That speech flabbergasted - everybody. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It laid the basis for the present system, which the Brisbane Conference adopted. I should like to know where Australia would be if it were not for that system.",19
152,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"The honourable member was not able to commend his ideas to his party. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Like members on the other side, the members of my party are not bankers, and it is hard to convince a man about a matter in regard to which he is ignorant. Minister of Home Affairs should open this competition to the whole world, and give effect to the promise of his predecessor. I do not think it is fair and honest, or Labour, to break a promise made to the whole world. If a private firm broke its promise, people would not do business with it. It is my universal rule that if a private man does not keep his word - with me, he shall never again do business with me where there is boodle concerned. The Cook Government's promise was published in the American newspapers, and made known all over the world. People talked about it, and Australia got a great advertisement in consequence. To repudiate it would be like the repudiation of a debt or of an agreement. The Labour Government ought not to stand for that. Are we to build a capital to suit a circumscribed, narrow, and peninsularidead people, or one that the whole world will come to see, and will talk about as the ancients talked about Athens and Troy? To-day we talk about Washington. A man who goes to America and does not visit Washington has not seen the country. Only the other day, when visiting a private house, a young lady was speaking to me about Washington. If we pay the highest price and do not get the best results, we shall show ourselves not to be business men. I am glad that the honourable member for Brisbane, who has travelled over the whole earth, and seen its capitals, drew attention to this matter. It will cost us as much for a slipshod capital as for a first-class one. I pointed out the other night, as the honourable member for Brisbane has done today, that after a great French engineer had laid out Washington, the little narrow men came in and said, "" We cannot afford to spend the money that this scheme will cost."" Until 1860 Washington was being built in sections, in shreds and patches. Finally, another great genius, a Mr Shepherd, a big business man, was made chairman of the Commission, and he said, "" This capital has got to start right."" He went back to the original plan. To carry out that plan cost millions of money, but Abraham Lincoln, and all the big men, were interested in the war at the time, and whild they were thinking about it Mr Shepherd was building Washington. That is why Washington is what it is today. In Australia we have a splendid chance to The create a fine city. Sometimes I do not care to discuss this matter lest, as I was Minister of Home Affairs, people may say that it is a case of sour grapes. That is not so. It is my enthusiasm for Australia,, the country of my adoption, that makes me take an interest in this matter.. I stay here because I like this land better than any other, not because I cannot get away from it. I have interests in other countries.",19
153,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Does the honourable member pay an .absentee tax ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I do not know how it is yet; it is only lately that my brother left me these things. I want to see this country get the best. I hope that the Minister will broaden out, and see that we get the best. Times being so bad that there are 33,000 men out of work in Australia, a board, or some authority, should be appointed to take advantage of Mr Griffin's knowledge and genius. When I asked Mr Griffin whs he was willing to abandon the immense business which . had come to him in America as the result of gaining the competition which made his name known throughout the United States, he replied, "" You seem to look at everything from a material stand-point."" I said, "" I look at a lot that way."" "" We l l , "" he answered, "" I do not. This is the final Capital of the world, and I would sooner leave to my family and my race the recollection that I helped to build it than have the wealth of Rockefeller."" ",19

He took my breath I had never previously met a Yank for like him. Things must have changed the less in America since I left there. Griffin said, "" I would sooner have name associated with the construction that capital than have the wealth of by him. Rockefeller, for that would pass away. I would like to have my name as the name of the founder of the American capital is remembered."" can go to Washington without seeing there the monument of the engineer who laid out the city.",19

When the honourable member for Parkes appears in Court he does not speak merely from his brief. He puts into his work the concentrated knowof ledge of thirty or for ty years of legal training. I hope that the Minister will take this matter to Cabinet, and that at £ 7 8 and £ 5 0 . Ministers will consider it over and over again.

As an old resident of New did South Wales I am bound to say that I have never heard of the name of either of , the gentlemen whose - valuations have guided the Minister- Mr Futter and Messrs. Slack and Company, though I the understand that the latter are house and to land agents in a Sydney suburb.",20

I have had a little experience in these matters. When I ""was Minister of upon Public Works in New South Wales for three years, I had a good deal to do with resumptions, and in my professional capacity I have appeared in many scores cases both for and against the Crown.",20

MinisI think that the Minister will conthe claimant produces his valuation for local rating purposes. He has produced one valuation which should carry great weight pracwith the Minister. He has been rated them on land in that locality on a basis three times as great as the amount which the Minister is offering; to pay. Latelv there has been a movement to accept local municipal valuations for land valuation purposes, as it is recqgnised that the men chosen for the purpose of making these local assessments are sufficiently competent to assess the value of land for taxation purposes. If the valuation of the local valuator in the Liverpool district is taken as a guide, the land would have a value at least three times the amount that the Minister is offering. I quite agree with the Minister that no value can be attached to the private offer that the honourable member for Lang said has been made for the land. It is very easy and a very common thing for claimants to get two or three people to make private offers. Thes9 persons know very well that there is no chance of their offers being accepted; as they risk nothing, they can possibly help their friends by putting in offers for the land. In these circumstances, private offers are of no value in arriving at the value of land resumed by the Crown, but I do dwell strongly upon valuations made by a local municipal valuator.",20
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"The private referred to was made long' before there was any idea of resumption. Mr BRUC E SMITH - The prospect of a big resumption of land at Liverpool has been in the air for some years. Every one knew that land was to be resumed for military purposes, and this particular land came almost within the area that it was thought would be resumed. There are always numbers of people who are willing to risk a little money by purchasing in such cases and securing the difference between what they give and what they may get for the land when it is resumed. They even do not fear the possibility of betterment.",21
168,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I have the local valuations. They are £ 1 5 0 and £ 1 0 0 , respectively.",21
169,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"They make a total of £250 as against the Minister's offer of £ 1 9 5 , but I understood from the Leader of the Opposition that the shire spirit valuation of the land was three times as member-? for Brisbane. great as the amount the Minister was offering. While the Minister is justified in ignoring private offers to buy the land, he should be guided to some extent by valuation placed upon it by the local valuator for rating purposes. years ago, Sir James Martin , one of ablest Justices we have had in AusJapanese, tralia, for guidance in regard to the great Darling Harbor resumption claims, which covered some millions of pounds, laid down the principles of compensation. He said that if the power of the Resumption Act was exercised by the Government, they should be prepared to give a man the full value of his land upon a generous basis for what they took, and that, if they cared to do so, they might add 10 per cent, to that valuation for forced sale in order that the public should not benefit by the sacrifice of private, in terests. I pass' now from that question to the matter raised by the honourable member for Brisbane, who has been contending that competitive designs are a failure; but I think that the honourable member got a little off the track. In order to prove his case he showed that, because one of a number of competitive designs had been adopted and was afterwards altered, the competition was a failure; but the case he instances does not seem to touch upon the question of the utilit y of calling for competioffer tive designs. I rather favour the system of calling for competitive designs. Twentyfive years ago, when I was Minister of Public Works in New South Wales, having found that the Government Architect had grown old and obsolete in his ideas, and that every public building was being put up according to his design, I altered the practice entirely, and directed that competitive designs should be. invited, not only from architects in New South Wales, but also from all over Australia. I also laid down the principle that any man who succeeded in winning a competition should have the right to carry out, in co-operation with the Government Architect, the erection of the building for which the design was submitted. As a result of this system an entirely new style of public buildings was introduced into New South Wales. I am glad to see the cosmopolitan displayed by the honourable He does not wish to confine competition to the British Empire, but wishes to go all over the world and invite everybody to compete. At the the same time, however, he claims that there should be no competition, but that we Many should entrust the work to one man. the Whether he was to be a Chinaman, or a German, or an Englishman, the honourable member did not say. In fact, the honourable member was mixing his ideas. It is quite obvious that it is not the competition to which the honourable member objects. He objects to interference, and messing in the Department with a complete scheme, after it has been sent in. I agree with the honourable member for Darwin that local knowledge is required in order to get a proper design suitable for Australia. People have gone from Australia to Adams, the great domestic architect in England, and have taken his designs bodily and imitated them for Australia, the result being that they were found to be utterly unsuited for our requirements. Houses, suited for cold climates, were built without verandahs or balconies; no consideration whatever was given to the necessity for wide verandahs and wide balconies. We require in a Parliament House, not only chambers in which we can debate, but also pleasant rooms, broad terraces, and balconies, well covered from the sun, so that when honourable members are not working in the chambers they may enjoy themselves in the open air without suffering discomfort from a semi-tropical heat. What we need is to give the men who compete for this work full information as to the conditions of our country. No doubt, through Mr Griffin having been brought to Australia, he will be enabled to adapt his design to the conditions of Australia. I agree with the honourable member for Brisbane that, when one competitive plan has been adopted, it should not be handed over to subordinates in the Department to tinker with it. The man who has prepared the plan and won the competition should have all the other plans submitted to him, so that he may incorporate suggestions from them in his own plan, and so that the ultimate design may be a complete scheme emanating from one man, and having in it all the consistency that he can produce. What is being done now, I do not know, but I take this opportunity of expressing my regret that, when the honourable member for Darwin was in office, heoadopted rules which excluded members of all the best British architectural societies from engaging in the competition for the Federal Capital buildings. honourable member's answer is that the British architects tried to dominate him, but I think he will admit that all those architects contended for was that certain conditions of competition should be observed. I cannot believe that all the highly-educated and cultured men belonging to the best architectural assoifr. Bruce Smith. ciations of England could have attempted to impose upon him any conditions that were not practicable and desirable, and I am certain that had he gone more fully into the rules of those great associations, containing some of the best minds in England on architecture, he would have found that he could have adapted his conditions so as to enable all the members of those associations to take part in the competition. As it is, the designs for the buildings have not had the advantage of competition by British architects. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The competition I arranged was only for a plan of the lay-out of the city.",21
170,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,But English architects have not had an opportunity to compete for the buildings.,22
171,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Oh , yes, they have; there was an original draft of the conditions, which I altered.",22
172,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Do I understand from the honourable member for Darwin jbhat Mr Griffin's design for the Houses of Parliament was the result of a competition which was open to the architects of England?,22
173,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Mr Griffin has not submitted any design for the Houses of Parliament.,22
174,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I thought he had done so since he returned from America. I am only endeavouring to indicate what I regard as a general principle to be observed. I agree with the honourable member for Brisbane that any competition for the Houses of Parliament should be open to the whole world; and I do think that, for the benefit of those who would like to compete, but will not have an opportunity of studying the local conditions, some statement should be drawn up which would give the competitors a clear idea as to climatic conditions and Australian requirements.",22
175,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,That was done.,22
176,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Then we are on the right track.' I have heard from time to time that the honourable member The for Darwin had imposed a condition that there should be accommodation for members day and night Mr KING O'MALLEY - Every member was to have his own room.,22
177,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Member s were to have private rooms, so that when they left their homes to go to what is still a distant part of the country to do their legislative work, they would be surrounded by all the comforts which they enjoyed at home. I do hope the Minister will take to heart the advice that once he has adopted a design of which he approves generally, he will not allow ""other officers in the Department to interfere with its homogeneity. The honourable member for Brisbane, who has blown hot and cold on this question in some respects, boasted that, after the design for the Commonwealth offices in London had been - accepted, Mr Murdoch was sent home to make alterations in the design, which added £3,250 to the annual rent produced. That action was interference with the complete scheme of the original architect. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The original architect readily concurred in Mr Murdoch's idea.",22
178,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"So long as suggested alterations are submitted to the deal with. original architect, and he has an opportunity of saying whether they will harto monize with his design, that is all that necessary; but to allow subordinates interfere with a complete scheme without giving the original architect an opportunity of incorporating and harmonizing their ideas with his own plan would be a great mistake. As long as the rights of the successful competitors are thus served, I think we are on the high road to .get' a building which will be not suitable to the requirements of honourable members, but a credit to Australia.",23
179,Mr FENTON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Maribyrnong) [12.35]. - I do not intend to go into the merits of settle between the parties. the case brought forward by the honorpeople able member for Lang, but I think that, after hearing the information which has been afforded to the House, he will be clined to modify the emphatic opinions expressed earlier in the debate. A land resumption case was brought under my own notice, and I know that claims conexchequer siderably higher than the market value of the land have been submitted from time to time to the Home Affairs Department. Every honourable member has a desire that all questions in connection with land sumption shall be settled in an amicable spirit. There is no desire to rush holder, whether he be rich or poor, into the Law Courts; but there are some men who seem to have a very contrary spirit. In the case I am referring to, there was possibility of the Home Affairs Departdealt ment bringing the land-owner to anyis thing like reason, and finally the matter had to be taken to Court. When the man found that the Department was not prepared to put up with his procrastination, he began to climb down on the very threshold of the Court. I know of a case in which a man claimed nearly £20,000, and finally the Court, taking the very liberal valuation submitted, and adding 10 per cent., awarded him something over £1,000.",23
180,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,The question is whether it would not be better to have a cheaper method for dealing with poorer men than submitting cases to the High Court.,23
181,Mr FENTON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I agree that a body should be created which would give an equitable decision in these cases, without resort to the High Court.",23
182,Mr ABCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,What would you propose ?,23
183,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,It is a difficult matter to,23

185,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,But often the man brings expense on himself.,23
186,Mr FENTON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I am aware of that; and I have just mentioned a case where prea man was not prepared to climb down until he was right on the threshold of the only Court. I know that, even then, the Minister and the Department were prepared to treat with him; but he continued his unreasonable attitude, and a Judge had to There are in the community who, though not ordinarily dishonest, think that the Government are always very fair game.

They must b© taught to realise that it is just as dishonest of them to put their hands into the public as into the pockets of a private individual.

187,Mr FENTON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"That is very Tarely no the case. On the contrary, some men arewith in a most munificent way. It not my intention to say much about the competition for the Federal Capital buildings, but if we can get the best talent amongst Australian architects, they should be given every opportunity. There are men in the profession here who are Australian-born and almost Australian-trained, and if they were allowed to enter into the ' competition for the designs of some of the buildings in the Federal Capital, they could do as well as, if not better than, many of the architects abroad. The argument of the honourable member for Parkes is very applicable in this regard; we have often gone thousands of miles to get designs from architects when we could get better designs from Australian men. I believe that a very talented young Australian has been emjployed in connection with the Federal Capital, and, to my mind, it would be a good idea to allow him, in conjunction with the successful designer of the Capital City, to have some say in the designs for laying out the City and its buildings. I am afraid that, in calling for designs for the Capital buildings, particularly the Parliament House, we will spend so much time in preliminaries, and in the examination of the various plans, that it will be years before we have any foothold in the Capital City. I have been told, on the best authority, that the chamber in which we are sitting was complete and ready for occupation thirty-one years before any exterior portion of the building was complete. This chamber was ready for occupation in the year 1856. If we really desire to get to the Federal Capital at the earliest possible date, there is no reason to wait for the general design of the parliamentary buildings, or other public offices, because all we require is a chamber with proper acoustic qualities, and lighting and ventilation on the most up-to-date methods. . Mr GROOM - Would not the chamber be part of the general design?",23
188,Mr FENTON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,That is so; but I do not suppose that the chamber of the new House will be very different from that in which we are how assembled.,24
189,Mr SINCLAIR,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,I hope it will.,24
190,Mr FENTON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I am now speaking of the general arrangement and furnishing, and not of the ventilation or lighting, in both of which latter respects the present chamber is very defective. I hope that the combined wisdom of the architects already at work will be directed to that end; and there ought to be no difficulty, considering that.Australian architects are now engaged in erecting town halls and other public buildings in various cities in the Commonwealth, according to the very latest ideas. As to the external parts of the buildings, we can wait until the finished design has been placed before us, as the outcome of the competition amongst the architects of the world; but, so far as the absolute chamber or chambers are concerned, there is no reason why, at the latter part of this year, or the beginning of next, accommodation'should not be ready for us at the Federal Capital. The honourable member for Bang, I see, is looking at me; and, doubtless, he has heard me express myself differently regarding the Federal Capital. However, I can now say that nobody has a greater desire than I have for the removal of the Seat of Government.",24
191,Mr CHARLTON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"If you remain a member until we go to the Federal Capital, you will have had a good innings!",24
192,Mr FENTON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"That is the interjection of one of the Jeremiahs in our ranks. A little while ago, the honourable member for Darwin was speaking of men of imagination and optimism, and, perhaps, I am more optimistic than is the honourable member for Hunter. Whether my time as a member be long or short, I hope that it will not be very many years before I see this Parliament at work at the Federal Capital. I hope there will be no undue interference with the original design that won the competition, for I believe that Mr Griffin deserves all the encomiums that have been heaped upon him this morning as one of those clear-brained, idealistic men whom it is a treat to meet, and who is just the sort of architect to give us the city we require. In my opinion, however, Mr Griffin would desire to call into his aid the man who has lately been co-operating with him.",24
193,Mr GROOM,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,In what way?,24
194,Mr FENTON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I understand that an architect, whose design was thought much of by the adjudicating Board, has been in association with Mr Griffin. He is an Australian who knows what Australian conditions require; and if Mr Griffin can be associated with such a man, the results cannot, I think, be otherwise than satisfactory. I do not think for one moment that Mr Griffin is narrow or niggardly in his ideas, or has any desire to keep the whole credit to himself, but rather that he is at all times prepared to enlist the sympathy and co-operation of others who are qualified to give him assistance. It is to be sincerely hoped that the ultimate result will be a design for a city which has not yet been equalled.",24
195,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Wentworth) [12.52] - I am glad that this question has been raised this morning; and perhaps it would be as well if I were to inform honourable members of the steps taken while I was Minister to secure a wide response to our appeal for plans for the parliamentary buildings. After the plan for the Federal City had been practically decided upon, and Mr Griffin's temporary association with the Department had been arranged, that gentleman took six months' leave of absence from Australia, in order to settle his affairs in America. He, at the same time, undertook to get into touch with architects in European and American centres, in order to ascertain which of themwould most commend themselves to the profession in their respective centres as members of an adjudicatory commission. Mr Griffin visited Europe, England, and, of course, America ; and he succeeded in getting 'together the names of a number of prominent architects who were ready to act. Those names were submitted to me, and in due course the gentlemen were communicated with. We then issued the terms of the competition, which set out in the clearest, most accurate, and unvarnished way, the actual climatic and physical conditions of the Capital Site. All the facts that could be ascertained were set forth; the prevalent winds, the average heat and cold, the building materials that an architect could expect to obtain reasonably, and so on. This was done in order to place all the competitors in the various countries in an equal position with regard to the probable cost, &c, of the buildings that were to be designed; and I do not think there was a single side of the problem that was not fully explained. We then invited a response from architects throughout the world, and offered prizes for the successful competitors. In order to guarantee that uniformity of plan and execution, to which the honourable member for Parkes and, in another way, the honourable member for Brisbane, has referred, itowas stated in the programme of it. competition that the successful architect, or architects, would be employed in the carrying out of the work. In this way it was sought to secure a great architectural feature in these first buildings on which the general aesthetics of the whole city would be moulded. The invitation was issued, and, in all human' probability, those who responded at once employed staffs to gather together the necessary material for the designs, for which prizes were offered, and in connection with which, an honour, far higher than any prize, awaited the successful man. Now, it was set forth in the programme that the prize design could be altered only by the Director of Designs and Construction at the Federal Capital. That condition was inserted deliberately, because T felt that the professional men would have confidence in another professional man, seeing that they would feel that no alterations would be made without good and sound reasons. But! what has happened ? We find now that that competition has been withdrawn entirely, and that the Minister, on advice other than that of his. responsible adviser, has drawn up fresh terms. All I can say is that, apart altogether from the breach of faith, there is certain to be a crop of actions-at-law all over the world, seeing that any one of the competitors who has proof that he did anything in anticipation of the competition, will have full right to take that course. And why should this be done behind Mr Griffin's back? What is Mr. Griffin here for? Why did he go all round the world, and see those architectural authorities in London, Paris, Vienna, and elsewhere? Why should Mr Griffin, as it were, be set aside in favour of some man who has taken only an academic, and a comparatively small, interest in the matter? What is the reason for deliberately refraining from inviting the assistance of the man whom the Department had at its disposal?",25
196,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Mr Griffin was asked for a report, was he not?",25
197,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Was he?,25
198,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Certainly .,25
199,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Then some one else drew up the report, not the Minister.",25

201,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Who drew it up? What business had any officer, besides Mr Griffin, to draw up a report?",25
202,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Surely could draw up a report if I requested him to do so?,26
203,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"That is a different matter. In that case, my complaint is that the Minister did request some other person to draw up a report.",26
204,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,I am responsible for that.,26
205,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"We have heard from the Minister, time after time,, that is no quarrel or difficulty with Mr . Griffin; and yet we find, as a result of this: coid-shouldering of Mr Griffin, that there is a trouble which may involve many partment. actions at law.",26

221,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Before the adjournwho ment I was explaining my apprehension that the failure to comply with the terms of the original competition for the liament buildings at Canberra would, in all probability, lead to actions at law an officer architects in various countries, which will be very troublesome, and perhaps very costly, to the Commonwealth. It is not too late to put this matter right. I would strongly urge upon the Minister that he should submit this particular question to the Attorney-General.",26
222,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,I am under the impression it has already been done.,26
223,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,There is nothing of it there in the papers. What was submitted to the Attorney-General was a question as to Mr Griffin's own status in the DeThat is quite a different matter.,26

225,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I do not remember seeing anything about it in the papers, but obviously the fact will be clear to any honourable member that if any person in the comis invited by a responsible Got vernment to enter upon certain deliberations, troubles, and expense, in the expectation that if successful he will w in a is certain prize under certain terms, and to that if those terms are altered without complying with the terms set out in the invitation, then that person has an action at law.",26

231,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"That , of course, cannot The worse feature of this case is that, apparently, the Minister has set unout to alter the whole thing without reference to or consultation, in the first place, with his responsible officer. He has gob some opinions from somewhere, but in his Department is as qualified to advise as Mr Griffin?",26
232,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"There are two officers Parquite as competent. I think so, anyhow.",26
233,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"There are two officers by as competent as Mr Griffin to advise! Is that what the Minister says ? If he holds that view, and will not accept the advice of his responsible officer, why is Mr . Griffin there?",26
234,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,You here.,27
235,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Of course I did, and I am prouder of nothing else. As far as I could, I endeavoured to see that by Mr . Griffin's presence in Australia there should be no more tinkering with his plan. There has been nothing else ever since, as these papers will disclose. I do not want to go into the matter full y. There will be a further opportunity of doing that on other Estimates. I do not charge the Minister with any breach of candour in this question; but, as far as I am able to understand it , the Minister said, in the first place, that the plan, as approved by me, had not been approved by me at all in effect, that no plan had been approved. Yet, I hold in my hand a copy of my approval of that plan 1 Eventually that excuse was discarded. No doubt the Minister found out the truth .",27
236,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,What is the date of your approval?,27
237,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"This approval is in reply to a minute by Mr Single drawing my attention to a minute from the A d ministrator. It is dated 7th July of last year. But the approval, which should be quite enough for any common-sense officer of the Department, was incorporated in this schedule, which was issued on 1st February, 1914, with a reproduction of the plan, so that everybody could know what it was.",27
238,Mr KING OMALLEY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,That will bind the Government.,27

245,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,I do not think I could insult my honourable friend. brought him The CHAIRMAN - Order ! These personal interjections must stop.,27
246,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"In this particular matter, having failed with regard to the authorization that had been given by their predecessors, some other excuse had to be found, and then it was said there was no plan. Afterwards it was stated that the only one there was was too small; that it was reproduced on the back of the schedule, and was obviously too "" finnicking "" for anybody to deal with. So that miniature was. But in due course Mr Griffin produced a plan on which he had been working all along, based on a scale of 1 in 800. Some excuse was, of course, required. They said it was not big enough, and that a map of l . in 400 was wanted! Now, the 5-feet contour levels shown on the plan of 1 in 800 are quite clear and apparent to the naked eye, and the plan is quite sufficient for the ordinary rough business of locating streets, &c. But here, again, a grievance was assumed. Mr ARCHIBALD.;- I wanted his levels.",27
247,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,H is levels of what?,27
248,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Bridges , and so forth .",27
249,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,But why did you want them ?,27
250,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Because it was his plan, and I wanted his levels, so that he could not say the levels were those of my Department.",27
251,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,What gave rise to that go suspicion in your mind ? Why should you imagine that he would try to shelter it himself behind any of your officials? ' The CHAIRMAN - Order 1 The honmember must address the Chair.,27
252,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"The whole thing show3 the amount of hostility and suspicion that has been raised against this officer, than who made great sacrifices to come here at all. So far as the lay-out was concerned, Administrator had had the position made clear, and yet in these papers will found a minute from the Administrator which I will , in due course, read to the we Committee, and animadvert upon, because u t I think it was disingenuous, to say the least of it . Having failed first of all in the contention that there was no authorization, and in the second place that there was no plan, papers will disclose that they then tried to block this officer in a number of ways. When Mr Griffin made certain proposals, no doubt with an eye to his water scheme, which, after all, covers the same area as the water scheme of the Department Board plan, there was no question of extravagance such as has been raised against him since; but in order to be sure that he was going to get adequate water for his plan he asked for a consultant opinion, from Mr De Burgh, a.great authority in New South Wales on run-off and other matters affecting water conservation and supply. The Minister, hearing of this, informed Mr Griffin that it was no business of his! The consultant opinion was refused him. The matter lay dormant for months, when suddenly the Minister came to Mr Griffin and demanded that day to know what all these data were regarding the ornamental water scheme! Then again, as an evidence of the sort of friction and trouble that has been going on to the detriment of the whole scheme, let me give two sets of estimates that the Minister himself invited for a Bridge across the northern end of this ornamental water scheme. One was invited from the Engineer-in-Ohief of Railways, and the other from the Inspector-General of Work3, Colonel Owen. If the Minister had been a keen student of character he would have known, as well as I do, that there has been the greatest friction, mentally if not otherwise, for a long period-eve r since the Departmental Board plan was set aside. Naturally all of these officers were anxious to have their plan put into operation.",27
253,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Absolutel y incorrect.,28
254,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Absolutel y correct-as correct as that I stand here. There was great feeling upon that question. Here we have these two separate estimates. Will the Minister produce them so that we may see exactly what the difference is. I am speaking entirely from memory; but I think Colonel Owen's estimate was more than twice as much as Mr Bell's estimate. - Mr ARCHIBALD - On e was for a railway. - Mr KELLY - No ; quite apart from the additional works which were dealt with by Colonel Owen's estimate.,28
255,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,On e was the report of a railway engineer; the other of a civil engineer. They were bound to differ.,28
256,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"They were both dealing with the cost of putting up a railway bridge, and I think I am accurate in saying that Sir. Bell's estimate was somewhere in the neighbourhood of £80,000, and Colonel Owen's £150,000, whereas the ful l cost of the civil engineer's idea of that bridge came out at something over £350,000. There is no easier way of dealing with a simple-minded Minister than that of putting before him excessive estimates if you want to stop anything from going through. Nothing easier in the world!",28
257,Mr BAMFORD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,That is not fair-to describe the honourable member as simpleminded.,28
258,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,I am speaking generally; I do not want to be in any way offensive.,28
259,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"All I have to say is that if I could not see as far as you, well, God help me!",28
260,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I have had criticisms about the eventual cost of the Capital City heaped upon me. I admit that it is impossible for a man to sit down and find out to the fraction of a penny what the Capital is going to cost. But present economy may mean ultimate waste. May I give one instance of what is in my mind ? Take one railway connection that in Mr. Griffin's plan was shown round the sides of hills, mainly in cuttings through soft country. That railway, as shown, will of course cost a great deal more now than a railway across level country. But the moment the town expands, if you have your railway on level country, you will have to buiid bridges over your railway for all the roads. You will have to lift them right up. and that in itself will be a tremendously expensive item. On the other hand, if you carry your railway under the contours of the hills, you may have a greater initial expense, but a considerably reduced expense ultimately in road construction.  Minister to be an engineer.",28
261,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"No ; but these are the considerations that ought to be given to any plan showing the lay-out, before damning it on account of the immediate expenditure which is likely to be involved. Anybody, if asked whether it would be best for a railway to be constructed under the hills, as is suggested by Mr Griffin, or across flab country, would say, if it Capital. was purely a railway proposition, that it should be put across the flat country. know that when I was Minister, the Director-General of Works came to me about this railway and asked me to settle the question. I looked at the plan withas out hearing what Mr Griffin had to say thing of beauty. about the cost of bridges, and saw that by putting the railway across the flat, you would eventually have all round Canberra. to l i ft the roads over the rails. I said that obviously the other course would ultimately be the cheaper and more effiask cient as well as"" the more aesthetic course, to pursue - The Director-General of handiwork ? Works was always referring to this railway. He thought it was wrong. close No doubt he still thinks that it is wrong.",28
262,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,So do I .,29
263,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"And he has persuaded the Minister to adopt that view, although I dare say that the honourable gentleman has never discussed the question with Mr. Griffin.",29
264,Mr WEBSTER,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Does the honourable member refer to open cuts or tunnelling,29
265,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Bot h to open cuts and tunnelling.,29
266,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,It is only a very short stretch of country. The expense saved ultimately in road construction deal more than the extra expense which the railway would involve now.,29
267,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"It is a matter not expense, but of beauty. Whoever saw the beauty of a town when approaching it through a tunnel? - Mr KELLY - Goo d heavens! Are we water going to disfigure our Federal City by ning an open railway through it for the benefit of those who enter it by train to the detriment of those who wish to the beauty of the city from the inside? honourable gentleman might as well say, "" What is the use of having a railway line in Flinders-street when we could take it up Collins-street ? "" I dare that my honourable friend, when he visited England recently, deeply regretted that he could not view the beauties of the country through his railway carriage window.",29
268,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I was sorry that could not see St. Albans, because the line ran through an open cut.",29
269,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,And on that one illustration the honourable gentleman would determine the building of the Federal,29
270,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,There are a good I many others of the same kind.,29
271,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Every town planner tries, as much as possible, to keep from the public gaze such an unsightly object a railway line. A railway is not a",29
272,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,The honourable member would have a twopenny tube running,29
273,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Hav e honourable members ever heard anything like this? I my honourable friends opposite whether they are not proud occasionally of their The papers, as I have read them, disthe departmental friction to which I . have referred, and this departmental friction is going to damage very materially the monetary interests of the Commonwealth, as well as the interests of the Federal City itself, by leading to an arbitrary alteration against the actual terms of the competition of the terms for the parliamentary buildings. That must ? be clear to any man of the meanest intelligence who examines the papers.",29
274,Mr WEBSTER,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"When the honourable member held office, did he have any assurance in determining the practicability is a great of Mr Griffin's scheme?",29
275,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"No such assurance was required. If the honourable member of sought such an assurance he would find it in the fact that the water part of the departmental scheme-the present object of attack-involve d the same quantity of as in the case of Mr Griffin's plan. runThe only difference between the two was that Mr Griffin's water plan followed and comparatively regular contours which the see contour levels themselves gave, whereas The the departmental plan aimed at retaining every little backwater. In the one plan there were places where stagnant water could collect; in the other we had say a formal water basin that would easily remain clean. I approved of the formal water basin. There is nothing impracticable about the matter. The only question of practicability relates to supply of the water. I Mr ARCHIBALD - That is everything.",29
276,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"If the honourable gentleman holds that view, why did he refuse the consultative opinion, which he could have obtained at a cost of one hundred guineas, from Mr De Burgh? Mr. Griffin asked for it. Mr De Burgh is the best man in New South Wales to consult on the subject. He is employed in all matters relating to water supply and watersheds.",29
277,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,We have an opinion on the subject; we know all about it .,30
278,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,The Minister may have Colonel Owen's opinion.,30
279,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"It is not Colonel Owen's opinion; but I suppose that he, or any other engineer, could collect such information.",30
280,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"If his opinion is to be accepted, then the Minister has it in the departmental plan, because Colonel Owen signed the plan which gives the same water scheme, as far as the area of city lakes is concerned, as the other.",30
281,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,I thought that the honourable member favoured Mr Griffin's scheme.,30
282,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Of course I do. Why should the Minister attack it because some one in his Department-althoug h he will not say so straight out-is attacking it? Every one in his Department has agreed to a scheme of similar proportions, so far as city waterworks are concerned.",30
283,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,It has to go to Public Works Committee.,30
284,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I do not regret that the Public Works Committee is looking into the matter; but it seems ratner strange that the Minister should be instinct with suspicion about this one question, and yet would not obtain a consultative opinion which would have thoroughly satisfied him on the subject. There are one or two other questions to which I desire to address myself.",30
285,The CHAIRMAN,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Order 1 The honourable member's time has expired.,30
286,Mr RILEY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"South Sydney) [2.36] I had not intended to speak to this question; but it seems to me that if the Minister and his predecessor cannot agree upon the advisableness of adopting some particular plan that will enable us to push on with the work of building the Federal city, we have little hope of arriving at finality in the matter. I regret that, although much money has been spent at the Capital, not one permanent building has yet been erected, either for housing the Parliament, or any of our officers. Much work of a substantial character has been carried out. We have, for instance, a good water supply scheme, which is almost completed; and a complete power plant, sufficient to light up the city, and to supply power for any works that may be established there. We have also the sewerage works under construction, while other important works are almost complete; but all these are practically standing idle because the Department cannot decide upon the lay-out of the city.",30
287,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,That question has to go before the Public Works Committee.,30
288,Mr RILEY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Quite so. I regret the delay that has taken place in determining upon a plan for the lay-out of the city. If the Minister and the two honourable members who immediately preceded him in his office have different ideas on the subject, and the engineers of the Department also differ, how is the matter to be settled? I think that the Government made a mistake in deciding to hold over for a time the competitive designs for the parliamentary buildings. If they had allowed the competition to proceed, the designs would have been sent in last March. As it is, I do not think that any definite step has yet been taken, other than to appoint another committee of experts, and to secure the advice of the Institute of Architects as to the terms of the the competition and the limitation of it to architects within the Empire and the countries with which we are allied.",30
289,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,We have been coming down here a long time.,30
290,Mr RILEY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"And I am afraid we shall continue to come down here for many a day. If a committee of common-sense, practical men- I care not whether they be engineers or architects-were appointed to determine the lay-out of the city, the whole matter would be quickly settled. I hope that the Minister will brush aside the various objections that have been raised, take the bit between his teeth, and decide the question for himself.",30
291,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I must refer it to the Committee of which ""the honourable gentleman is chairman.",30
292,Mr RILEY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"There is another question to which I wish to draw attention. I understand that the erection of all buildings in the Northern Territory is under the control of the Department of Home Affairs, and that the Government continue to erect wooden buildings, although I have it on the authority of competent men who have worked in the Northern - Territory, that the white ants eat such buildings almost as quickly as they are built. A Melbourne firm has started the manufacture of bricks at Port Darwin, - and is turning out an excellent article. Surely it would be common sense to avail ourselves of this supply on the spot, and to erect substantial brick buildings. As to the competitive designs for the parliamentary buildings at the Federal Capital, I think that the honourable member for Brisbane was somewhat confused in his reference to the different classes of architecture that might possibly be worked into any one design. An architect who proposed to prepare a design would first determine what style it should take - whether he should adopt the Roman, the Gothic, or some other style of architecture-and having made a selection, he would adhere rigidly to it. It is a mistake to suggest that if twelve men sent in competitive designs, we might have a building erected according to a design in which several different styles of architecture were introduced. If the Gothic style be adopted, then everything will be erected in accordance with that design. It is not likely that the Roman and the Gothic style would be incorporated in the design of any one building. If the competition be confined to architects in the Empire, and in those countries with which we are allied at the present time, I think we shall have many eminent men competing. I hope there will be no delay in pushing on with the work of laying out the Capital City. A visitor to the Capital at the present time finds in the nurseries millions of young trees ready for planting in the avenues. Many of these are going to waste because no decision has yet been arrived at regarding the lay-out of the avenues and of the city generally.",30
293,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,They are becoming too old to be transplanted.,31
294,Mr RILEY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Yes . If the Minister decided the lay-out of the avenues, these trees could at once be planted. I hope that the Government will do everything possible to hasten the acceptance of a design for the Parliament building, and that when finished that building will be one of the finest of its kind in the world.",31
295,Mr MANIFOLD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Corangamite) [2.46] - It is curious to find from speeches of honourable members that both those who live in Melbourne and those who live elsewhere are keen about getting this Parliament moved to the Federal Capital. The honourable member for Maribyrnong said that the sooner we get there the better.,31
296,Dr MALONEY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Hear , hear!",31
297,Mr MANIFOLD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"No doubt we shall some day adopt a definite scheme for the laying out of the-Federal Capital. The matter has been debated continually almost from the inception of Federation, but, unfortunately, each Minister wishes to take his own course. We shall arrive at some conclusion only when a plan has been adopted, and each successive Minister agrees to work on it. Until that is done in regard to both the Federal Capital and the Northern Territory there will be no progress. I have risen to bring under the notice of the Minister the manner in which land is acquired by his Department. The Department deals with two classes of land-owners-thos e who are reasonable, and learning that their land is wanted for public purposes, are ready to part with it for a fair price, and those » referred to by the honourable member for Lang, who try to get the greatest amount of compensation possible. The Department does not differentiate between them. It treats both classes alike, and irritates them as much as possible. I heard a trumpet sounding last night about the wonderful things done by the honourable member for Darwin when Minister of Home Affairs; but even under his administration what I complain of occurred. The departmental officers do not tell the Minister that certain land-holders are willing to accept a reasonable price, and do not get their cases dealt with straight away; they merely put before the Minister piles of orders"" for compulsory purchases for him to sign. When the man who is prepared to be reasonable receives a notice stating that his land is to be compulsorily purchased, he becomes unreasonable. My experience is that when you can see a Minister about any matter of this kind, he is prepared to deal fairly and expeditiously, whatever party he may belong to, but it is difficult for a private individual to get such a hearing, and in the end he has generally to see his representative before he can obtain reasonable treatment. A private person, if he goes to the Department, is treated unsatisfactorily. Indeed, he is almost cheeked by the departmental officers. When the honourable member for Darwin was Minister, the Department acquired a very valuable piece of land in my electorate. That land belonged to the shire council, whose officers, when approached, said that the Department could have it at any time on paying fair compensation. had been bought by the council about six months previously for a certain purpose, and had on it a windmill, and several pits had been made in it . Notwithstanding the statement of the council's officers, a notice of compulsory purchase was served on the council. I do not blame the Minister for this, because the action was that of his officers.",31
298,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Perhaps what was done had to be done to comply with the law.,32
299,Mr MANIFOLD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"If so the law should be made reasonable. In the case that I mentioned the land could have been acquired from the shire council at a reasonable price and without any trouble. The Department, however, was not content to get what it wanted in that way. It served a notice of compulsory purchase, and ordered off the land stock which was being raised there hy the tenant of the shire council. It also took possession of the land and cut off access from it in every way. I then took up the case. I saw the acting Secretary, who was then Chief Clerk, and he behaved very reasonably, and called in the Inspector of Works, before whom I laid the matter. were about 40 acres in the whole block, and the Department wanted about 10 acres. On behalf of the council I asked if it would give access to the balance, and the inspector .replied, "" I cannot tell you."" I said, "" That seems unreasonable."" He replied, "" We must refer the matter to the Defence Department to ascertain whether it will allow access."" "" Give me a letter to the Defence Department, and I will get its answer."" The In spector said, "" I cannot give you a letter,"" and the acting Secretary was forced to remark, "" Surely this is not the way to answer a gentleman. Cannot a ' chaser ' be sent to the Defence Department to find out whether it will give a road across the proposed rifle range?"" I pointed out that if access were not given to the land that was left that land would become useless to the council, but that if it would be given the council would like to move its improvements from where they stood .on to the land it was not proposed to resume. I showed that it would he useless to move the improvements if it were proposed to take the whole of the land, and that it would cost the Government a good deal It more to resume the whole block than to take only a portion of it . The reply I received was, "" What does it matter what it will cost the Government-the Department will pay ?"" Apparently it does not matter what waste takes place. It is thought to be sufficient that the Department will pay.",32
300,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,How long ago did this happen?,32
301,Mr MANIFOLD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,A b o u t two and a half years ago; but the same sort of thing is going on now.,32
302,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,I hope not; I do not know of it .,32
303,Mr MANIFOLD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"It is not possible for every private land-owner whose land the 'Department proposes to resume, to see the Minister. Indeed, it is difficult for a memberto do so u n t i l he has cooled his heels in the passage for hours.",32
304,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,I do not think that honourable members have had to do that since I have been a Minister.,32
305,Mr MANIFOLD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"The Minister is often busy, and a private individual has no chance of interviewing him. He must see the permanent heads in the various States, and that is very often There how all the friction arises. Many* cases could be settled quite reasonably, as owners are generally prepared to settle straight away; but the practice of the Department seems to be to irritate a reasonable man until he is brought up to the fighting point, and' once a man's blood is roused, trouble begins. The Minister says that the Department has I said, most trouble with the small men. It is the small men to whom Parliament should extend its protection. The man who has a portion of a large estate resumed can take his case to the High Court and fight the Crown, or make the Department toe the mark and come to a reasons ble agreement; but, as the small man cannot do this, it is our duty to see that he is not forced into the Court, and that he has every opportunity of getting a fair deal. The Minister claims that there is not much of this going on at present, but I believe that there are just as many cases nearly as bad as the one I have mentioned. When the Department wishes to resume land, it does not go to the leading valuers in the district to secure a valuation; it does not go to the men who are valuing land every day; it looks upon those men as rogues; but it gets its valuations made by men who probably have never valued an acre of land before. At least that is what has happened in my district. If the Department will not employ men who are accustomed to the work of valuing, and thus enable settlements to be more easily effected, will they accept the shire valuation ? At any rate, a caseshould be looked into before the irritating stage is reached. When we have to deal with men who are ready to part with the land we require, cannot we abolish the compulsory provision of the Act, and let inspectors go out and secure a valuation from some responsible person who knows the values of land in the district concerned, and then come to a settlement with the owners?",32
306,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,I am under the impression that I am not allowed by the Act to do so.,33
307,Mr GROOM,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,There is power in the Act to acquire land by agreement.,33
308,Mr MANIFOLD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"At any rate, very often if the owner could go before the Minister the whole matter of the acquisition of a piece of land could be settled in a few minutes.",33
309,Dr MALONEY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Melbourne) [3.0] - I am under the impression that the whole trouble in regard to land resumption could be settled very easily if the Government could be persuaded to provide that the price to be paid for resumed land is to be based on the valuation on which the owners pay land tax, with the addition of up to 10 per cent, for disturbance.",33
310,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,If we acquired land under those circumstances we would not pay what we are paying today.,33
311,Mr MANIFOLD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"The honourable member is speaking of the unimproved value only. Surely there is another value. - Dr MALONEY - Certainl y improvements would need to be valued separately. There should be a law providing that the [146] Commonwealth', the State, or the municipality may resume land on the valuation on which the owner pays rates and taxes, with up to 10 per cent, added for disturbance. I was under the impression that the basis of compensation for the resumption of land in the Federal Capital Territory was the value set forth on a certain date in the Land and Income Tax assessments of New South Wales. If there was one act on the part of the late Government that I could not censure, and that I wholly approved of, it was their step in - bringing to Australia the great man who had won, in open competition with the world, the prize for submitting the first design for our Federal Capital. No other architect who has visited Australia has had the honour of having his drawings-place d on satin-ex hibited in Vienna and Paris. When it was decided to throw open to the whole wide world the competition for the designs for our Parliament House at Canberra, and to get the greatestarchitects in the world to examine them, every artistic architect in the world, no matter under what sky he was born, would have full confidence in submitting a design ; and what architect with the pulse of honour in his composition but would glory in competing? Are we going to the olden days to judge of artistic temperament? Do we not know that there are men who would rather have had the honour of designing the great Parthenon of Athens, never surpassed in the grace of its lines of architecture, than have double their weight in gold in return for their services? The Minister once had the honour of speaking in St. George's Hall in Liverpool, a splendid hall of purely Greek design, copied from one of these ancient structures that once graced the southern slopes of Attica. That design, if copied in a sunny land like Australia, might be seen to advantage, but it was not suited for the dull, cloudy atmosphere of England. The honourable member knows that that glory of an architect's dream is today like a gleam of sunshine in that dull and cloudy city. Was it the salary of £1,000 that induced Mr Griffin to come here- a man who can show by his books that his in-; come in America was double and treble what he is making here? Is not jealousy on the part of heads of Departments responsible for some of the present trouble! Those men were not forbidden to enter into this competition. When the then Minister threw the competition wide open to the world, any member of the Public Service had a right to compete.",33
312,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,I do not think so.,34
313,Dr MALONEY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I know that to be a - fact. Mr KING O'MALLEY - And one public - officer, Mr MCDonald, did send in a - design.",34
314,Dr MALONEY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"If a great picture by Tintoretto or Raphael were sent to Australia, and the members of the art society, to which I have the honour to belong, were asked to amend that glory of painting, would they do it? No; they would answer that the result would be nothing but a botch. I could have wished, if the money had been available, that the Government had invited to Australia the three men who obtained the first three places in the competition, and that they had been asked to consult and combine the best features of the three designs. Our aim is to build a city that will equal tthe dream of the greatest architects of the world. Even in the so termed barbaric ages a ruler in India did not hesitate to send to Venice for an architect to build 'that wonder of the world, the Taj Mahal. The Indian race, with all their pride and affluence, at the time, did not scruple to import a Venetian to create that temple, and any one who has viewed that jewel of the architectural world, rivalling in splen- architects. dour and beauty the creations of the genius of the elder Greece, will admit that, through all the centuries that have passed since, their action has been justified. Shall not we also build for the future? Did ever an architect have before an opportunity to build a capital for a whole continent? No such opportunity has ever been presented in the history of the world. The prizes for the best plans for the lay-out of the city were awarded by judges appointed by the honourable member for Darwin. Will any one dare to raise a voice against those adjudicators? I congratulate the honourable member for Wentworth on having thrown open to the whole world the competition for designs for the Parliament House, but his action has been rescinded. compact with those who prepared to take .part in the original competition is to be 'broken, our escutcheon will be stained, and I will not remain silent, either in this House or outside, while such a breach of faith is attempted. By all means let the genius of Australia compete freely, and let no man's hand or mind be trammelled whether he be in the Public Service or out of it . The Minister having contradicted me on a statement. I made, I desire to fortify my argument with a quotation from Hansard. Speaking on the 15th October, 1914, the honourable member for Hindmarsh saidTo make sure of my ground, however, I conferred with the President of the Institute of Architects, who was good enough to call on me at my request, and he advised that little, if any, work had been done in"" connection with the competition, and that, therefore, there could be no liability.",34
315,Dr MALONEY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,How would he know what work had been done?,34
316,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Honourable members are asking for information, and I am supplying it. The gentleman referred to was Mr Tompkins. How in God's name could Mr. Tompkins say who had been working on the preparation of plans? The competition was advertised throughout the world, and if Mr Tompkins will swear an affidavit on oath that no architect had made preparations for a design, I will prosecute him for perjury. I know of one architect who had devoted three months' work to a competitive plan; and yet Mr Tompkins, who is not omniscient, who has not an X-ray intellect, professes to know what had happened throughout the world. The name of that gentleman does not loom highest in the list of Australian",34
317,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"If Mr Tompkins had been told how many architects had registered their names, he might not have made that statement.",34
318,Dr MALONEY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I do not suppose he knew. The poor little man went to the Minister and gave a ready answer without knowledge. I do not blame the Minister for having repeated what Mr Tompkins told him, but the escutcheon of Australia will be stained if the Minister depends on that statement to justify him in breaking an honourable understanding with the whole world.",34
319,Mr KELLY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Mr Tompkins' evidence would not be worth much in a Court of law. If our Dr MALONEY - I am astonished that there should be any doubt on this subject. It is all very well for the Minister to say that there has been no friction in the Department. Every member who cares to look into the official papers, as I have done, must see that there has been friction. One of the heads of the Department has written that Mr Griffin's engagement will expire two years hence. What does it all mean? I feel sure that if the Committee understood the whole of the circumstances, the dispute would be ended at once, and we could go ahead with the work of establishing the Capital. More than 3,000 men could be employed above the numbernow engaged in the Federal Territory. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Fiv e thousand.",34
320,Dr MALONEY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"As a supporter of a Labour Government in this time of strife and unemployment, I object to the Government not proceeding as fast as they should with the work at the Capital. If Mr Griffin were given an opportunity of giving effect to his design, I say 3,000 is a moderate estimate of the number that could be employed, but we are now told by the ex-Minister, who ought to know something of the matter, that the number is 5,000. It would seem that an Australian native, on whom the heads of the Departments have their thumbs, can never get fair play. I hope to see the day when a searching inquiry will be made into the manner in which large salaries are increased, and also to ascertain whether the Public Service Commissioner has ever refused to accept the nomination of the head of a Department. I know that a place was kept open for a medical lady while she was away in Western Australia, because, perhaps, she was the niece of a gentleman who lived, as she did, in the same street as did the Public Service Commissioner; and, in connection with this appointment, every medical man and woman in Melbourne and Sydney was insulted. I take it that in a Democracy like this we all desire that brains and telligence shall have a fair chance, and that men shall not be promoted unduly over the heads of their seniors.",35
321,Sir JOHN FOBREST,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Wester n Australia has no chance in regard to the appointment of nurses!,35
322,Dr MALONEY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"As to that, what has been done in relation to nurses, officers, and men who volunteer for the front, passes all understanding. There is one case to which I should like to call tention, and this will be of interest honourable member for Darwin, who was Minister at the time it occurred. When I was vipwing the plans, along with that [146]- 2 honourable gentleman, at Government House, I asked one of the adjudicators whether any of the competitors had takers advantage of the Australian sunlight Lav the way of designing a health city. The adjudicator told me that there was one plan which might interest me in this connection, and he showed me No. 9, which, by a system of orientation, provided thali the sun should shine on each of the sides of a building or square at one time or other of the day. Having studied the sun>cure in Germany, that plan appealed t& me; but, of course, I did not know the name of the designer, only his number being attached. When the prizes had been awarded, I made inquiries and ascertained that the designer of No. 9, unfortunately for himself, was an Australian native, employed in the Public Service. He had been an honoured officer in the Publie Works Department of Victoria, and had been transferred to the Federal service? but, as at that time there were very few works in hand for the Commonwealth, he was transferred to another branch. His design had excited the attention of the three adjudicators, and when Mr Griffin, on his arrival, asked for advice and assistance, this officer was placed at his disposal by order of the honourable member for Wentworth, who was then at the Department. This officer spent his holiday over the work that was handed to him; but, owing to some wire-pulling on the part of departmental heads, he was asked why he was out of his own branch. It is to the honour of the Government who were then in power, that they placed £50 on the Estimates as some recompense for the work which this officer had done, but the fact remains that this officer, who was the right-hand man of Mr Griffin, has been removed from where he was o? in- so much use. Under the circumstances it is strange that the Minister should tell us that nothing is occurring to prevent the progress of the work in connection with the Federal Capital design. I hope the Minister will see thai* the way is cleared up, so that this maunmay have a fair chance of building the city, and so that when the history of the times comes to be written, tBta Minister will be given the credit for having seen this work carried out. I hopeat- also that he will prevent certair. heads . to the in his own Department, V/KIO, in my opinion, seek to destroy Mr Griffin and to prevent him doing his good woric,_ from doing this. I am sure the Minister does not desire to ho referred to as the Minister who broke an agreement .made by a previous Government with the archithere tects of the world. He does not desire to be spoken of as the Minister who, for the sake of saving a few pettifogging shillings here, or expending a few more elsethe where, injured the future of a great city beyond repair. I hope he will rise to a higher level than that, and give this man the opportunity of making the beautiful city he has laid out, a city that shall the best and healthiest of any capital in the whole wide world. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - He is now only marking time.",35
323,Dr MALONEY,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"U p to the present he has been doing nothing else, and I asking the Minister, particularly as he a Labour Minister, to recognise that time has come for him to see that, whatfight ever may be the attitude of the heads of his Department, this man is given a fair chance to carry out his work. There are other men besides these particular heads who might take a share in this work. have in mind a very good architect, Murdoch, who might very well be assoLang. ciated with Mr Griffin in this work; what I want to urge upon the Minister most of all, and I think every honourable member of the House will agree with me in this, is that a man who wins the petition for the building of Parliament House shall have control over that buildhe ing, independent of all the Colonel Owens or all the Colonel Millers.  think the House ought to be thankful to the honourable member for Melbourne for the valuable suggestions he has made upon this subject, and particularly for his remarks upon the subject of sunlight, though the trouble is that his suggestions, if carried out, may interfere with the whole of the plans. I would urge the sum per foot, too. Minister to take into consideration the question of valuation, so that we may be able to arrive at some uniform process. At the present time, in New South difficulties arise owing to the fact that there are four or five different methods of valuing property. First of all, have the value put upon land by the municipalities; then we have a separate valuation by the shire3. For resumption purposes the StatefixesUp another valuato tion; there is another valuation for the Federal land tax purposes, and the owner has his own value. So that, altogether, are five valuations; and in order to bring an end to this state of affairs, I would urge upon the Minister the desirability of entering into consultation with different States to see if it is not possible to arrive at some uniform system.",36
324,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Parramatta) [3.32] - I wish to call the attention of be the Minister to the system of land recity sumption which obtains in all Departments. I had made up my mind prior to the last election that, if we were returned, some change should be made. I do not know any branch of the Public Service that needs reform so much as this does, am and we need reform in the interests of is the working men of Australia, the small the land-owners, the men who are unable to the Government, the men whose interest it is not to fight the Government. The big men can look after themselves. They are able to brief counsel and take risks that the small man cannot afford to I take. Take the case mentioned this Mr morning by the honourable member for This man came to see me the but other day, thinking that my honourable friend had not got back from his trip. I know him, and although I am bound to say I think he has put an absurdly high comvaluation upon his land, he is a thoroughly good, honest fellow. Why has put this valuation on his land? Remember he is only 17 miles away from Sydney, and in the course of the next few years Sydney is going to spread. Then this land will probably be sold by the foot for residential purposes. That is what this man had in mind, and that is what has led him to place this high value upon his land. I know that in some places at Liverpool land is already being sold at so much per foot, and at a considerable Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Lan d at Belmore, which is not far away, recently Wales, sold at as much as £20 a foot.",36
325,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Since I came into this Parliament I could have bought we ten acres of land near where I lived at Marrickville for £10 an acre. To-day it is worth, I suppose, £500 an acre. You cannot tell how quickly the city is going expand. This particular land is only n miles from Sydney, and that fact alone will enable honourable members to see why this man has put the value he has upon his property. Some of the finest grape-growing country in Australia is to be found in the Liverpool district. The owner of this land is an engine-driver in the employ of the Water and Sewerage Board, and he and his sons have spent all their spare time in improving the landin fencing and clearing it ready for the time when, upon leaving the service, he may settle there and develop an orchard. After working on it for all these years, he is now offered by the Government a price which, on the face of it, is most absurd. Here are his rate papers, which he presented to the Minister, and which show that he has paid to the Liverpool council rates on the basis of £250 unimproved land values. Add to that another £100 for his improvements, plus 10 per cent., to say nothing of its future accretion of value because of its possible use as building sites, and you have more than twice the amount that the Minister is offering. The Minister says to this man, "" Go into the High Court of Australia."" He drags a working man into the High Court to determine a £200 resumption. One cannot go into that Court, responsibly and adequately, for the whole of that amount. The law needs to be amended. Men are compelled to accept valuations far below the real value of their land because they cannot fight the Government. I have in mind a case at Baulkham Hills, near where I reside. There is a rifle range there, and three men occupying land which came within the danger zone received notice of the intention of the Government to resume their properties. It has taken me four years to get that matter cleared up.",36
326,Mr SHARPE,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Why did not the right honourable member clear it up while he was in office ?,37
327,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,I could no more clear it up than the honourable member could clear out the Beef Trust now that his party is in power.,37
328,Mr FENTON,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,He would if he had power that the right honourable member had as Prime Minister.,37
329,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"He would not. Mr Justice Street told him that there was no Beef Trust in Australia that was doing the slightest injury-that all his statements,' in the elegant language of Senator Pearce, were so much "" hot air.""",37
330,Mr SHARPE,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,The honourable member has not read the Commissioner's report.,37
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I have, and I notice that the honourable member never has anything to say about Mr Justice Street's findings. The elections are over, and everything, of course, is all right from his point of view! This man st Liverpool is now actually summoned to. the High Court. He is told that he must attend before the Court on a certain date, and show cause why he should not be paid the compensation offered by the Department. Here is the summons. This sort of red-tape costs the Department more than would be involved in giving most of these men whose land is resumed what they want. In the Baulkham Hills case, valuation after valuation has been obtained. The last secured by the Department was given by a Sydney man, a reputable valuer in the district of Parramatta not being called into consultation. The Department succeeded eventually in inducing these men to accept £9 per acre for their land. It is just opposite where I live, and I should be glad to take every foot of it from the Government at £12 per acre.",37
332,Mr SHARPE,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Is it a "" good spec. ? v",37
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"I do not want it as a ""spec."" Land in the district is very scarce, and I should like it for grazing my own cattle. These men took £9 per acre for their land rather than be dragged into Court. Men dare not go into Court over these small matters. In the Liverpool land case, the owner is almost prepared to take anything for his land rather than be dragged into the High Court, knowing what it may possibly mean when the Government begin to fight him with all the expert legal ability for which they are able to pay, while he cannot do so.",37
334,Mr FLEMING,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,The officials take advantage of that fact every time in connection with land resumptions all over the Commonwealth.,37
335,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Quite so. I am the aware that the Department has sometimes to take strong action. Exorbitant claims are sometimes made. But what is wanted is a facile Court where men could put their own case at little or no cost to themselves, and where they could obtain summary and substantial justice, instead of having their cases dragged on year after year. One of my complaints is that no officer of the Department has seen Mr . Walton about his land. A man has a right to be heard when his land is being taken from him ; he is entitled to put his case personally before some tribunal appointed for the purpose by the Minister. The sooner the Act is amended the better, so that all who are having their land, and, in many instances, their livelihood, taken from them, may be heard. In the Baulkham Hills case, to which I have already referred, the resident teacher, who is ting up in years, purchased a piece of land at the rear of his school, and spent his spare time in preparing it for his use in his old age. But he has now to pack up and go further away. The Government have the land; he agreed to take £ 9 per acre for it rather than go into Court. There should be some other tribunal where, if possible, resort could be had, without any costly proceedings, to conciliation and arbitration. The method of the Department is to have the land values assessed for themselves, without reference to any outside authority, and then to say to the owner of the land, "" Here is our offer; take it or leave >t. If you are not satisfied, go to the Higtt Court."" To go to the High Court might suit'the big man sometimes, but - would ruin the small man. In some cases it would be better to give one's property to the Government than to fight the question of compensation in the High Court. While the valuation in the case referred to is undoubtedly high, it must be remembered that the land is only 17 miles from Sydney, and adjoins a main road, so that it is only a matter of time when it will become worth a great deal more than £900. I hope that the Minister will undertake to bring in a Bill to provide for a Court before which a small man can get values assessed without interminable delay and considerable expense. But I ask the honourable gentleman to report progress now.",37
336,Mr ARCHIBALD,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,We must get Estimates through.,38
337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Le t us adjourn now, and we will give you your Estimates in good time next week.",38

AUSTRALIAN-MADE MOTOR CYCLES Motion (by Mr ARCHIBALD ) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",38
343,Mr JH CATTS,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,Cook) [3.55] - The other day I made representations to the Postmaster-General in regard to calling for tenders for motor cycles for the Postal Department. Is the Minister now in a position to make a statement in regard to this matter?,38
344,Mr SPENCE,MOVEMENTS OF ALIE N,"Darling-Postmaster General) [3.56] - A little time ago tenders were called for motor cycles of Australasian make. At the time it was not very clear that motor cycles were being the made here; but I am glad to say that tenders were sent in by more than one firm who were making the greater portion of parts of their motor cycles here. However, there were no specifications; and the honourable member for Cook and one or two other honourable members complained on behalf of several firms that they were afraid that the absence of specifications might subject them to unfair competition. The object'of having no specifications was to prevent certain firms being shut out, as - would have been the case had restrictive specifications mentioned the type of machine required. Also, it was not known that there were - firms who could compote in Australia. However, after inquiry, it has been Tecognised by the Department that it will be fairer to the tenderers to have specifications, and therefore, it has been de-. cided to call for short-dated tenders, and place all on a similar footing in regard to the requirements of the Department. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at' 3.57 p.m.",38
