Report adopted. NA AMENDMENT (INDEXATION) BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Gillard. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
3,Ms GILLARD,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Lalor-Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inof propclusion) (9.02 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Higher Education Support Amendment (Indexation) Bill 2010 amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to deliver on this government's commitment to sustainable funding for our higher education system. The amendment gives effect to the recommendation to increase indexation made by the Bradley review. Under new indexation arrangements, the safety net adjustment, which makes up 75 im- per cent of the current index, will be replaced by the Professional, Scientific and Technical Services Labour Price Index (discounted by 10 per cent) published by the Australian Statistician. This index is considered to better reflect wage price increases in the higher education sector and best replaces the discontinued Labour Price Index (Professional) proposed in the report of the review. The remaining 25 per cent of the index will continue to be the Consumer Price Index. From 2012 the revised indexation arrangements will apply to all amounts subject to indexation under part 5-6 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003. This includes all programs funded under the act, maximum student contributions, the OS-HELP loan limit and the FEE-HELP loan limit as well as the new SA-HELP loan limit which is subject to the passage of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009. Programs which will benefit from the improved indexation, in both education and research, are: - Commonwealth Grant Scheme - the new equity programs - performance funding - the Capital Development Pool - the Open Learning Initiative - the Structural Adjustment Fund - the JCU dental school - the Quality Initiatives program - the Australian Learning and Teaching Council - the Indigenous Support Program - the Transitional Costs Program - Joint Research Engagement program - Research Infrastructure Block Grants Scheme - Research Training Scheme and - Australian Postgraduate Awards program. In 2011 universities will receive additional funding equivalent to the increase in indexation on teaching and learning if they sign on to the government's new performance indicators. Student contributions will also be indexed at the new rate from 2011 delivering an increase in revenue to universities. At a time when, in response to the global financial crisis, some countries are reducing their expenditure on higher education, this government has acted to provide substantial additional resources to the sector. Take for example two comparable nations like England and the United States of America. In England there have been deep cuts to higher education spending. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) grant available for the 2010-11 financial year has been reduced by £449 million (A$740.9 million) compared with the previously announced plans. And in the US the experience has been mixed. In many states the push to address historic budget gaps has resulted in cuts to state government support. While there has been additional investment at a federal level to offset state cuts, this has not always been enough to prevent severe measures to address funding shortfalls. This is particularly the case in California where state budgets for higher education have been cut by US$8 billion. To deal with these funding cuts, both the University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) have eliminated spring enrolment in 2010 which means that many students who would have transferred across from a community college will not have the opportunity. According to the American Association of Community Colleges, California's community colleges may turn away up to 200,000 students this fall in the United States. In contrast to these approaches the Australian government has made a massive investment in the tertiary education and research sectors. This is because we know that Australia's universities have a critical part to play in making this country smarter, fairer and more prosperous. In order to meet our economic and social ambitions we need to make sure that our universities are properly resourced and able to tackle the problems, and teach the workforce, of the future. Our new system brings in a range of institutional and regulatory reforms, which, coupled with substantial additional resourcing, will allow more students from across the community to achieve a higher education qualification and find a rewarding job in the knowledge economy - Almost $4.2 billion of other funding Our reforms will also dramatically strengthen the nation's research effort and the national innovation system, which is so vital to building productivity And, importantly, this amendment puts the government's commitment to a much higher rate of indexation into legislation. The importance of providing this resourcing is made even more salient because we know that other forward thinking nations, such as many of the developing nations in our region are already increasing their investment. Over the five years from 2003 to 2007, China and India both invested heavily to increase total tertiary enrolments in all programs by an average of 16 per cent and 7.2 per cent per year respectively. This makes it even more important to invest in the knowledge and skills of our people if we are to thrive in the competitive global economy. My department estimates that this new, higher indexation rate will deliver over $2.6 billion in additional resourcing to universi- journed. ties over the five calendar years from 2011 to 2015. This comes in addition to the funding we will be providing for the student-centred system. The additional funding for extra student places is now $1.3 billion up from the $437 million estimated at last year's budget, over the budget forward estimates period. And of course, universities also receive additional resourcing from student contributions. This increase in funding is resulting from the 9.9 per cent overenrolment above-target places this year and continuing pipeline, far in excess of budget projections. This funding is in addition to the $7.1 billion of additional funding already committed to higher education, which is made up of: announced for higher education and research in the government's response to the Bradley and Cutler reviews; $1.1 billion announced on higher education infrastructure in the December stimulus package, and - $1.8 billion announced at the 2008-09 budget when the government came to power. This government has a massive reform agenda in higher education. Enrolments driven by student demand and informed choice, performance based funding, mission based compacts-all of these reforms will give universities an entirely new degree of control over their own destinies. There is a great deal of work to be done and by entrenching the new, higher indexation formula in legislation the government is clearly demonstrating that we are committed to driving reform backed by sustainable funding for the long term. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adNA Rearrangement",21

NA AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN NA NA INSURANCE) BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",23
5,Ms ROXON,AUTHORITY AND PRIVATE HEALTH,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Health Legislation Amendment (Australian Community Pharmacy Authority and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2010 (the bill) will amend the National Health Act 1953 and the Private Health Insurance Act 2007. The bill provides for amendments to the National Health Act 1953 to extend the authority of the Pharmacy Location Rules and the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority from 30 June 2010 to 30 June 2015. The bill also introduces amendments to the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 that will ensure the lifetime health cover policy is applied fairly and consistently to all residents of Australia who are eligible for Medicare. The bill addresses some anomalies currently in the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 that may inadvertently advantage or disadvantage some people with respect to the application of the lifetime health cover policy. Australian Community Pharmacy Authority This bill proposes amendments to the National Health Act 1953 relating to the arrangements for approving pharmacists to supply pharmaceutical benefits subsidised by the Commonwealth. These amendments are day. the result of the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement negotiated between the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and the government, and are aimed at ensuring that all Australians, particularly those in rural and remote areas, have reasonable access to the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. Significantly, this bill will extend the operation of the Pharmacy Location Rules and their administration by the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority. These rules prescribe location based criteria that must be satisfied in order for a pharmacist to obtain approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits at particular premises. Once approved, a pharmacist is entitled to be paid by the Commonwealth for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. The extension of these rules and its administration by the authority until 30 June 2015 will provide stability in the pharmacy sector and help to ensure that an accessible network of pharmacies exists to dispense pharmaceutical benefits to the Australian public. The amendments to the National Health Act 1953 will commence on royal assent. Lifetime health cover and new migrants Under lifetime health cover policy, people who do not take out private health insurance hospital cover by their ‘lifetime health cover base day', as it is known in the act, are required to pay a two per cent loading on their premium for every year they are aged over 30 when first taking out hospital cover. For most people, the lifetime health cover base day is the 1 July following their 31st birthday. The maximum loading a person may be required to pay is 70 per cent and is payable by people who first take out private health insurance hospital cover at age 65 or older. However, for migrants who enter Australia after 1 July following their 31st birthday, their lifetime health cover base day is the first anniversary after they are registered for full Medicare benefits (their ‘Medicare eligibility day') and they need to take out private health insurance hospital cover before this date in order to avoid the application of a lifetime health cover loading. This bill amends the legislation relating to lifetime health cover to ensure it is consistent and fair for all new migrants to Australia who are over 31 years of age and have full access to Medicare benefits. The amendments only apply to people whose lifetime health cover base day falls after 1 July 2010. The amendments do not affect Australian citizens. The bill resolves some anomalies that currently exist in the present legislation relating to new migrants. Currently, the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 refers to ‘new arrivals'. A ‘new arrival' must have arrived in Australia for the first time on or after 1 July 2000 and is not an Australian citizen or permanent resident. This has the effect of excluding people who temporarily visited Australia before that time, for example, as a tourist, and of excluding people who migrate to Australia with a permanent residence visa, even though they may be entering Australia for the first time. The bill removes an anomaly that allows migrants who turned 31 on or before 1 July 2000, and who were overseas on that day, to have access to ‘permitted days without cover', without ever actually holding private health insurance hospital cover. The Private Health Insurance Act 2007 allows people who hold private health insurance hospital cover to cease their cover in specific circumstances and for a limited period of time without incurring a lifetime health cover loading, known as ‘permitted days without cover'. ‘Permitted days without cover' are: - days on which a private health insurer has granted a suspension in accordance with Private Health Insurance (Lifetime Health Cover) Rules; - days on which the person is overseas for a continual period of more than one year; and - the first 1,094 days that the person is without hospital cover. The ‘permitted days without cover' provision recognises that there may be circumstances when it is difficult or impractical for people to maintain their hospital cover (for example, if facing temporary financial hardship) and is intended to make reasonable allowance for these unforseen eventualities. Because migrants who turned 31 on or before 1 July 2000 and who were overseas on that day were taken to have private health insurance hospital cover on their ‘lifetime health cover base day', they have access to a substantially longer period of time (in some cases up to almost four years) instead of the intended 12-month period from their registration for full Medicare benefits in which to take out private health insurance hospital cover without incurring a lifetime health cover loading. The amendment corrects this unintended outcome. Instead, such people will have 12 months from their ‘Medicare eligibility day', the same as all other migrants, and consistent with the original policy intention. The amendments in the bill will ensure that in the future, the lifetime health cover provisions have the same effect for all migrants. The change will ensure that the legislation relating to lifetime health cover is consistent and fair for all migrants. Additionally, the amendments will benefit the private health insurance industry by removing inconsistencies, which will result in simplified administrative procedures. The amendments to the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 commence on 1 July 2010. The amendments do not affect Australian citizens, nor any migrants who have had a ‘lifetime health cover base day' on or before 30 June 2010. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned. NA Excise Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2010 Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2010",24
6,Ms ROXON,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I move: Excise Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2010 Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2010 The excise and customs tariff proposals that I have just tabled propose an increase to the excise and excise equivalent customs duty applying to tobacco and tobacco products. Excise Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2010 and Customs Tariff Proposal (No.2) 2010 formally place before the parliament proposed increases of 25 per cent to the excise and excise equivalent customs duty on tobacco products. This equates to an increase in the rates of excise and customs duty applying to tobacco, cigars, cigarettes and snuff from 0.26220 to 0.32775 per stick not exceeding 0.8 grams per stick actual tobacco content in weight-I can see from the look on Mr Speaker's face that this is, I know, a complex way to put it to the House but I understand the technical requirements for this proposal-and from $327.77 to $409.71 per kilogram of tobacco content for other tobacco, for example, loose tobacco, with effect on and from 30 April 20010. These changes were gazetted on 29 April 2010 in accordance with section 160B of the Excise Act 1901 and section 273EA of the Customs Act 1901 and are now being tabled in the House of Representatives. The government is committed to reducing the rate of smoking in the Australian community and the revenue raised from this measure, along with existing revenues collected from tobacco, will be directly invested in better health and better hospitals through the new National Health and Hospitals Network Fund. A summary of the alterations contained in these proposals has been prepared and is being circulated. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned.",26
7,The SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"In calling the Minister for Health and Ageing, I have made a check, and there is no snuff box in the drawers. Ms Roxon-I am pleased to hear that, Mr Speaker. NA (TOBACCO) BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",26
8,Ms ROXON,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill seeks to establish in legislation the increase in the excise applying to tobacco products. Tobacco is perhaps the most deadly legal product available in Australia. It is the leading preventable cause of disease and premature death in Australia. In 2003 it was estimated that smoking results in approximately 15,000 Australian deaths a year. This is more deaths than murder, illegal drugs, motor vehicle accidents and alcohol combined. Tobacco related diseases are also responsible for approximately 750,000 bed days in hospitals every year. The total cost to Australian society to bacco is estimated at $31.5 billion each year. Cigarettes are toxic and poisonouscontaining 4,000 chemicals. Cigarettes are estimated to cause one in five of all cancer deaths. Smoking is a major cause of cancers of the lung, larynx, throat, oral cavities, sophagus, bladder, kidney, pancreas, stomach, cervix and the blood. It also causes heart disease, stroke, blindness, emphysema and increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and complications during birth. That is why successive Commonwealth and state governments have taken action to reduce Australia's smoking rates. This has included action at the Commonwealth level by increasing taxation, conducting hardhitting social marketing campaigns, banning tobacco advertising and introducing graphic warning labels. States and territories have also acted by banning smoking inside licensed venues, running Quitline services and hiding cigarettes from view at point of sale. This action has had a dramatic effect. The number of daily smokers aged 14 and over in Australia has been reduced from approximately 30.5 per cent of Australians in 1988 to 16.6 per cent in 2007. This is important progress-but we can and must do better. That is why the government has announced a comprehensive package targeted at smoking. Prevention is better than cure, and tackling smoking is one of the best investments we can make in keeping people healthy. In 2008 the government initiated two major reviews which looked at the issue of taxation for tobacco. The National Preventative Health Taskforce was asked to recommend action to reduce the health burden of tobacco, alcohol and obesity. In its report the first tobacco to- recommendation it made was to significantly increase the price of tobacco. It said: Increasing prices is one of the most effective measures that government can take to reduce tobacco consumption and prevalence. It recommended a staged increase in prices, oeup until the price of 30 cigarettes reached $20. The Australia's Future Tax System Review also looked at the issue of tobacco taxation and concluded: There is a strong case for a substantial one-off increase in tobacco excise. Australian retail prices for cigarettes are moderate by international standards and taxes constitute a relatively small share of the retail price. It recommended a substantial increase in taxation depending upon evidence on the costs of harm from tobacco smoking, the indexing of tobacco excise to wages rather than CPI and the removal of duty-free allowance for tobacco. These reports build on the evidence from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, South Africa and other countries demonstrating that higher taxation makes a significant contribution to cutting smoking rates. This has shown to be particularly effective for young people. Taxation has also been recommended by the World Bank and the World Health Organisation as one of the most effective ways to cut smoking levels. Acting on this advice, on 29 April the Prime Minister and I announced that the government was taking action to increase the price of tobacco. The government, as of 30 April 2010, increased the excise and excise-equivalent customs duty rate applying to tobacco products by 25 per cent. This is the first increase above inflation in the taxation on tobacco in more than a decade. This has seen the excise on cigarettes rising from 26.22c per stick to 32.775c per stick, and the excise on other tobacco, such as loose leaf tobacco, from $327.77 per kilogram of tobacco content to $409.71 per kilogram of tobacco content. The exciseequivalent customs duty on comparable imported tobacco products has been increased by the same amount. This has increased the tax on a pack of 30 cigarettes by $2.16 and the tax on a pack of 25 cigarettes by $1.80. These are averages; the prices are different for different brands. This means that the price of a regular pack of 30 cigarettes is now over $15 and a pack of 25 cigarettes is now over $14. This is expected to reduce the number of smokers in Australia by two to three per cent, or approximately 87,000 people. It is also expected to reduce the total consumption of tobacco by around six per cent. This move has been endorsed by the Australian Medical Association, the National Heart Foundation, the Cancer Council of Australia, the Australian Nursing Federation, the Public Health Association of Australia and Action on Smoking and Health, among other public health groups. This measure is part of a comprehensive package against smoking, including, in a world first, the fact that the government will introduce legislation to ensure that cigarettes in Australia are sold in plain packaging by 1 July 2012. This will remove one of the last frontiers for cigarette advertising and it was also a recommendation from the Preventative Health Taskforce. Logos, brand imagery, colours and promotional text will be restricted or prohibited. Mandated graphic health warnings will be updated and expanded. Research has shown that industry branding and packaging design reduce the effectiveness of graphic health warnings on tobacco products. The government is also investing over $85 million in hard-hitting antismoking advertising campaigns and it will be introducing legislation to bring restrictions on tobacco internet advertising in Australia into line with other media. And on this side of the House we have also taken the principled stand to refuse to accept political donations from the tobacco industry. The same cannot be said for those on the other side of the House. This comprehensive antismoking package follows the landmark COAG agreement that delivered fundamental reform to Australia's health and hospital system. The expected $5 billion of extra revenue from this measure, along with existing revenues from tobacco, will be directly invested in better health and hospitals through the National Health and Hospitals Network Fund. This will help deliver better health and better hospitals for all Australians. Under the government's National Health and Hospitals Network, the government is investing $7.3 billion in additional funding over five years. This funding will deliver new beds, more doctors and better hospitals. This bill will be crucial to funding those improvements. It builds upon other actions the government has taken to improve preventative health: - A record $872 million investment in preventative health including programs in schools, workplaces and community settings; - $103.5 million under the National Binge Drinking Strategy; - The decision to establish the Australian National Preventative Health Agency, which has been stalled by the opposition in the Senate for over six months; and - $449 million to improve the quality of care for Australians living with diabetes. Yesterday the government released its response to the National Preventative Health Taskforce, detailing where the government is taking action and what steps are still under active consideration. The government will continue to make further investments in preventative health, particularly once we have established our national agency to provide expert advice to the Commonwealth, the states and the territories. This bill represents the next bold step on preventative health. It will have a strong impact on combating the prevalence of smoking and reducing the number of preventable diseases and premature deaths in this country. The revenue raised by the excise increase will be directly invested in better health and hospitals for all Australians. I commend it to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned. NA (TOBACCO) BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Roxon. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",26
9,Ms ROXON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2010 is the second of the related bills which will increase the rates of duty for tobacco products, more detailed comments of which I have made on the earlier bill. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2010 contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995, in respect of imported tobacco products, that are complementary to the amendments made to the Excise Tariff Act 1921. These amendments increase the rates of customs duty for tobacco products by 25 per, which is the same as the increase in rates of excise duty. The increased rates of customs duty will apply to tobacco products imported from all countries, including those goods imported under any of Australia's free trade agreements. These amendments will ensure that the rates for customs duty on imported tobacco products are the same as the rates of excise duty on those goods when produced in Australia. Again these amendments will reduce the number of smoking related diseases and fatalities in Australia. As with the amendments to the excise applying to tobacco products, the amendments to the Customs Tariff Act will also take effect from 30 April 2010 and I commend them to the House.

Bill read a first time. Second Reading",29
10,Mr ALBANESE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (9.31 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Airports (On-Airport Activities Administration) Validation Bill 2010 will validate potentially invalid infringement notices and other matters done by persons not validly authorised under the Airports (Control of On-Airport Activities) Regulations 1997 in relation to certain activities at the following Commonwealth leased airports: Adelaide, Alice Springs, Archerfield, Bankstown, Brisbane, Camden, Canberra, Darwin, Essendon, Gold Coast, Hobart, Jandakot, Launceston, Melbourne (Tullamarine), Moorabbin, Mount Isa, Parafield, Perth, Sydney (Kingsford-Smith), Tennant Creek and Townsville. Under the Airports (Control of On-Airport Activities) Regulations, authorised persons, who must be appointed by the secretary of the department or the secretary's delegate, are empowered to issue infringement notices for contraventions of certain rules relating to the airport including parking infringement notices. In addition, authorised persons may perform certain other actions and exercise certain other powers. For example, under regulation 110, an authorised person for an airport may direct a driver of a vehicle used at the airport in contravention of a parking control to move the vehicle. Following an examination of parking infringement notices issued at certain airports and other authorisations recently, it has become apparent that the appointment of authorised persons at a number of airports has not been kept up to date, going as far back as 2004. In some cases, this was due to the administrative oversight by the department and, in some cases, that of the airports. As a consequence, parking infringement notices issued and other actions performed by persons without a valid authorisation may be invalid and of no legal effect. Payment of a parking infringement notice provides a person with immunity from prosecution for an alleged offence at the relevant airport. This significantly reduces the potential penalty which a driver may be required to pay for committing the parking offence. A driver may face a penalty five times the amount of the parking infringement notice should the matter be taken to court and the driver found to have committed the offence. This legislation will confirm immunity from prosecution from the relevant offences of persons who received the infringement notices and paid the corresponding amount. It is therefore important for the government to act quickly to bring forward this legislation. The bill will validate all actions performed and powers exercised under the regulations, including the issuance of parking infringement notices, at any current or former leased federal airport up until the bill commences, to the extent that those actions or powers were performed or exercised by persons not validly authorised. The bill will provide the necessary legal certainty that each parking infringement notice and relevant other action are valid and legally effective. On my instruction, the department took immediate steps to address this oversight prospectively, by seeking advice from each airport and appointing as authorised persons the appropriate persons at each airport. The department is undertaking a full review of all processes and procedures relating to its administration of the Parking Infringement Notices Scheme and the regulations more broadly in order to meet the standard required by the government. The authorisations are now all up to date and all parking infringement notices issued since 25 March of this year are valid. In the interim, this legislation is required to address the uncertainty about the validity of parking infringement notices issued prior to 25 March. I commend this bill to the House.

The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2010 will ensure that heavy vehicle owners who operate under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme (FIRS) are not unfairly levied with higher registration charge increases next financial year than vehicle owners who are registered in state or territory systems. The bill will ensure that from 1 July 2010, heavy vehicle owners of trucks and trailers registered under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme will pay a registration increase of only 4.2 per cent instead of 9.7 per cent. This bill proposes a minor, technical amendment to delete subsection 5(6) of the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985. The Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985 imposes registration charges for heavy vehicles registered under the Australian government's Federal Interstate Registration Scheme (FIRS) to recover the cost of road usage by heavy vehicles. Subsection 5(6) of that act specifies that any regulations made for the purpose of section 5 (amount of charge) must not take effect earlier than the first day after the end of the disallowance period. The effect of subsection 5(6) is that it prevents amended regulations that would lower the annual registration charges adjustment from a 9.7 per cent increase in registration charges to a 4.2 per cent increase from coming into effect on 1 July 2010. Instead the adjusted, lower charge would come into effect after 15 parliamentary sitting days from when the new regulations are made-which would not be until late September 2010. This would affect over 1,000 FIRS vehicle owners who would be charged the higher 9.7 per cent registration increase (determined automatically under the current regulations) rather than the proposed 4.2 per cent increase because the adjusted charge would not come into effect until late September. There is no administrative option available to deal with this issue. The act does not provide a ‘refund' power that could enable vehicle owners charged the 9.7 per cent increase to have the difference returned to them. Deleting subsection 5(6) will not in any way remove parliamentary scrutiny. The provisions of part 5 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 that facilitate scrutiny by the parliament will still apply to amendments to the regulations. Those provisions could still operate to disallow an amendment to the regulations that came into effect on 1 July 2010. The bill will help implement the agreement by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) that heavy vehicle charges should be adjusted annually to maintain cost recovery. In February 2008, the Australian Transport Council adopted the 2007 Heavy Vehicle Charges Determination, which ensures that the road user charge and heavy vehicle registration charges achieve cost recovery from the heavy vehicle industry for its fair share of road infrastructure and maintenance costs incurred by governments in Australia. In 2009 an agreed automatic adjustment formula was included in the Commonwealth Interstate Road Transport Charge Regulations 2009 for application to the 20,500 heavy vehicles registered under the FIRS. That automatic annual adjustment to heavy vehicle registration charges applies from 1 July each year. Adjustments to the heavy vehicle registration charge depend heavily on changes in the level of spending on roads and bridges and on changes in road usage by heavy vehicles. Roads expenditure across all levels of government has increased significantly in recent years. At the same time, there has been a substantial growth in the number of higher productivity heavy vehicles using the road network. The effects of those factors in the current automatic annual adjustment formula results in a registration charge increase of 9.7 per cent and a potential national over-recovery of $116 million from heavy vehicle owners and operators in 2010-11. All transport ministers agreed to address this over-recovery at their meeting held in Perth on 30 April 2010 by amending their respective charges legislation to ensure the formula neither under nor over charges the trucking industry. They also agreed that industry should benefit from this lower adjustment from 1 July 2010. State and territory governments will implement the adjusted 4.2 per cent registration charge increase from 1 July 2010. The adjusted 4.2 per cent figure has been calculated by the National Transport Commission following appropriate adjustments to the current charges formula to address any over-recovery resulting from changes in the heavy vehicle fleet mix. I asked the National Transport Commission to undertake public consultation on the proposed charges adjustment, consistent with requirements under the relevant legislation. It would be fair to say that industry acknowledges it needs to pay its fair share for road usage and that the 4.2 per cent adjustment is a preferable outcome for it than an adjustment of 9.7 per cent. The principle of cost recovery has been broadly agreed by all governments and industry and the charges aim to recover, not over-recover or under-recover, the heavy vehicle industry's share of aggregate government road expenditure. Governments have been spending more on roads; more and heavier vehicles have been using roads. The charges need to reflect these factors. This government is working successfully through COAG with all states and territories to deliver national, streamlined heavy vehicle regulation that will provide an even, certain and transparent playing field for the heavy vehicle industry. We need to be sure that this extends to all areas of industry operations, including registration charges. The passage of this bill is necessary to ensure that federally registered vehicles will not be differently and unfairly charged compared to vehicles registered under state or territory law. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned. NA Rearrangement",31

Question agreed to. NA (CONTINENCE AIDS PAYMENT SCHEME) BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mrs Elliot. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",33
13,Mrs ELLIOT,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased to introduce the National Health Amendment (Continence Aids Payment Scheme) Bill 2010. The bill delivers on the 2009-10 budget commitment to introduce the Continence Aids Payment Scheme. The Continence Aids Payment Scheme will assist people who have permanent and severe incontinence to meet some of the costs of their continence products through a direct payment. It replaces the current Continence Aids Assistance Scheme which provides continence products through a government agreement with a sole supplier. The bill will enable the formulation of a legislative scheme under which the Commonwealth will make direct cash payments as a contribution towards the cost of buying products that manage incontinence. Medicare Australia will transact the payments on behalf of the Department of Health and Ageing and the department will retain policy authority for the new scheme. Importantly, the bill introduces transition arrangements for clients of the current or- scheme to the new scheme from 1 July 2010. The bill also ensures adequate transparency and accountability by enabling the review of decisions made under the scheme, including via the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, as well as by allowing the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing, or the Medicare Australia CEO, to audit payment arrangements by requesting information about CAPS eligibility or payment(s). This power will enable prompt investigation into any claims of ineligibility or improper use of funds. Failure to comply with a request for information will be an offence under the National Health Act 1953, which provides a deterrent to behaviour which may be contrary to the intent of the new scheme. Consistent with the government's 2009-10 budget announcements, the program will be funded by a special (standing) appropriation enabled under section 137(1) of the National Health Act 1953. This is particularly important in the context of an eligibility based, demand driven program. Subject to the passage of the bill through parliament, the new Continence Aids Payment Scheme arrangements will take effect from 1 July 2010. Conclusion As I mentioned, I am very pleased to be able to introduce this bill and the change to the continence product supplier market that the introduction of the new scheme represents. I am also pleased to deliver on a very important budget measure. The Continence Aids Payment Scheme promotes consumer choice and control which is consistent with the government's Charter of Consumer Rights and Responsibilities for Community Care, released in 2009, and which is also promoted in the Commonwealth's aged-care programs through the Aged Care Act 1997. As a result of the successful passage of the bill, recipients under the scheme will have greater flexibility and choice in where they purchase their continence products. Product suppliers and service providers will have equitable access to the client base, in an open and competitive market. The Department of Health and Ageing will continue to work closely with the sector and the recipients of the scheme over the coming months to ensure a smooth transition to the new arrangements. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned. PAID PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Macklin. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",33
14,Ms MACKLIN,NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (9.48 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill will introduce Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme to begin on 1 January 2011. Eligible working parents of babies born or adopted from 1 January next year will receive 18 weeks parental leave pay at the federal minimum wage. The scheme is fully costed and funded by the government. It is fair to business and fair for families. This historic reform is a major win for working families who have been waiting decades for a national paid parental leave scheme. Australia is currently one of only two OECD countries without a national paid parental leave scheme. Today, with this legislation, we catch up with the rest of the developed world. Paid parental leave will give babies the best start in life. It means one parent has the financial security to take time off work to care for their baby at home during the vital early months of their baby's life. It will give mothers time to recover from birth and bond with their baby. The government's scheme meets the challenges and realities of modern family lifegiving parents more time at home with their new baby and helping them balance their work and family responsibilities. It supports women to maintain their connection with the workforce and boosts workforce participation. Our scheme also lets families make their own work and family choices. Parents can transfer the leave so mums and dads have more options for balancing work and family. And now, under our scheme, women in seasonal, casual and contract work and the self-employed will have access to paid parental leave-most of them for the first time. The scheme will prepare Australia for the challenges of the future. Business will benefit from the retention of skilled and experienced female staff but will not have to fund the parental leave payments. And because the government respects the work and family choices that each family makes, we will continue to support mothers whether they are in a paid job or at home. Families not eligible for paid parental leave, or who choose not to participate in the scheme, will be able to continue to access the baby bonus and family tax benefit if they are eligible. Acknowledgements This has been a long campaign for so many people and I do want to acknowledge the many, many women and men who have campaigned for paid parental leave in Australia. This day belongs to them. I would particularly like to acknowledge Sharan Burrow and the trade union movement for their tireless campaigning for Australian families, Marie Coleman and others from the National Foundation for Australian Women, as well as the current and previous sex discrimination commissionersElizabeth Broderick and Pru Goward. I would also like to acknowledge the leadership of Heather Ridout from the Australian Industry Group, Katie Lahey from the Business Council of Australia and those best practice employers who are already providing paid parental leave because they know it is good for business. It really has been a campaign that has been in the best interests of Australian families and now, finally, we have a government that will deliver a Paid Parental Leave scheme to Australian families. Policy development and consultation The Paid Parental Leave scheme outlined in this bill is based closely on the expert recommendations of the Productivity Commission. It is the culmination of over two years of policy development and public consultation to develop a scheme to respond to Australia's current social and economic circumstances as well as to help us to prepare for the future. Around a third of mothers return to work within six months of the birth of their child. Two-thirds of these mothers return to work because they need the money. Even so, Australian women's workforce participation during the peak child-bearing years is lower than for women in other leading industrialised countries. As a nation, we cannot continue to ignore the barriers to greater participation by women, who now make up 45 per cent of the paid workforce. This is why we committed before the 2007 election to explore ways to make it as easy as possible for working mums to balance their work with the important job of adjusting to parenthood, and bonding with their children. In February 2008, we asked the Productivity Commission to look at the economic, productivity and social costs and benefits of paid maternity, paternity and parental leave. The commission was also asked to consider the health and developmental benefits of any scheme for babies and their parents. The commission analysed the evidence from Australian longitudinal surveys and international research. It undertook extensive public consultation on proposals for the scheme. It sought public submissions and conducted public hearings. The Productivity Commission recommended the introduction of a government funded statutory scheme of paid parental leave, paid at the level of the national minimum wage for up to 18 weeks. It was a scheme based on sound evidence and rigorous analysis. In last year's budget, the government committed more than $250 million a year to Australia's first Paid Parental Leave scheme, based closely on the Productivity Commission's recommendations. This was a commitment to Australian working families that redressed more than a decade of inaction when those opposite were in government. We knew the scheme was needed, we knew it was affordable and that it balanced the interests of business and families. The government's commitment to consultation did not end when we announced the Paid Parental Leave scheme in the 2009-10 budget. During late 2009, 32 consultations sessions were held with over 200 key stakeholders, including major employer groups and trade unions, representatives of small business, family and community stakeholder groups, and tax professionals, payroll specialists and payroll software developers. For two years, the government has listened to what families have had to say about the scheme. For two years, the government has listened to the concerns of employers, large and small, who have provided very valuable feedback. We have listened to the community, gathered evidence and considered how to balance the interests of parents, employers and the wider community. The scheme presented in this bill flects this extensive consultation process and is fair, balanced and affordable. Eligibility for paid parental leave The government estimates that, each year, around 148,000 people will be eligible for paid parental leave. The scheme will provide eligible working mothers and initial primary carers of children born or adopted on or after 1 January 2011 with up to 18 weeks parental leave pay at the national minimum wage, while they stay at home to look after their baby or adopted child. In addition to full-time workers, women working part time, and in seasonal, casual or contract work, and the self-employed, may be able to access paid parental leave-many for the first time. A mother may be eligible if she has worked continuously for at least 10 of the 13 months before the birth or adoption of her child, and has worked for at least 330 hours in that 10-month period (around one day a week). To meet the needs of contractors, seasonal and casual workers who have irregular work patterns, a person can have a break of up to eight weeks between working days and still be considered to have worked continuously. Parental leave pay will also be available to parents who work in their own business or a family business, such as a farm. Generally, it will be mothers who claim parental leave payments in the first instance as they usually provide the primary care of their child during the initial months of the child's life. However, it is becoming increasingly common for men to spend some time being the primary carer of the child during its first year. Our Paid Parental Leave scheme is flexible and will allow parents to make their today reown work and family choices. The legislation allows all or part of the parental leave pay to be transferred to the child's other parent, provided they also meet the eligibility requirements and are the primary carer of the child. Paid parental leave must be taken in one continuous 18-week block within 12 months of the child's birth or adoption, including in cases where the payment is transferred to the other parent or carer. A person cannot work during the paid parental leave period, although they can stay connected with their workplace through ‘keeping in touch' provisions. Paid parental leave can be taken before, after, or at the same time as other leave entitlements such as annual leave or employer funded maternity leave to best suit a family's circumstances. A person will be eligible if they have vidual income of $150,000 or less in the financial year before the claim or birth of the baby, whichever is the earlier. This is a generous income test, but consistent with the principle of targeting government support to those most in need. A person must also be living in Australia and generally be an Australian citizen or permanent resident to be eligible. Some nonresidents are able to receive the payment, as is the case with family assistance. Families receiving parental leave pay will not be able to receive the baby bonus, and family tax benefit part B will also not be payable for the duration of the parental leave pay. Eligible families will be able to choose whether to take paid parental leave or the baby bonus, according to their individual circumstances. The government estimates that more than 85 per cent of families will be better off taking paid parental leave. These families will, on average, receive around $2,000 more than if they chose the baby bonus. This is after tax has been paid and all interactions with other family assistance have been taken into account. To help families make the choice that is best for them, an online estimator will be available from September 2010. The government values the hard work of all mothers, regardless of whether they are in paid work. We know that all mothers ‘work' regardless of whether they are at home or in a paid job, and that most mothers will spend time in and out of the workforce depending on their circumstances. We will continue to support mothers indiwhether they are in a paid job or at home. The baby bonus and family tax benefit will remain available for families not eligible for the scheme, and for those who choose not to participate in the scheme. Casuals Casual workers are set to be big winners from Australia's first Paid Parental Leave scheme. Women are more likely to be casual workers and make up almost 57 per cent of all casual employees in Australia. Almost 25 per cent of employed women work in casual jobs and receive no paid leave entitlements. To help seasonal, contract and casual workers access paid parental leave, parents who are not employed at the time of the birth of their child but have satisfied the work test will be eligible. Many seasonal, contract and casual workers have irregular work patterns and may not be in work immediately before the birth of their child. Under our scheme, an eligible mother who is a contract worker but whose contract finishes before her baby is born will still receive parental leave pay, providing she meets the work test. Eligible parents not employed at the time of the birth of their child will be paid directly by the Family Assistance Office. The role of employers Our scheme recognises that taking time off to have a baby is a normal part of working life. Our scheme is fair to business. The parental leave pay is fully funded by the government. And it does not involve any new taxes on business. It will help employers enhance the family-friendly workplace conditions many already offer. The government's Paid Parental Leave scheme is fair, balanced and economically responsible. The scheme will benefit employers by assisting them to retain skilled and valuable staff, without having to fund parental leave pay. Employers are integral to the rollout of Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme. Most women will receive government funded parental leave pay from their employers. By receiving parental leave pay through their usual pay cycle just as other workplace entitlements are paid, women will remain connected to their workplaces and be more likely to return to work. Employers will provide parental leave pay for their long-term employees-those with at least 12 months of continuous service. Other women will receive parental leave pay from the Family Assistance Office. The Paid Parental Leave scheme has been designed to minimise its impact on employers required to provide parental leave pay to long-term employees. We understand that it is important to make arrangements simple and consistent with existing employer practices and obligations. In any one year, nine per cent of all nesses will be involved in the Paid Parental Leave scheme, and only three per cent of small businesses. Employers will not have to work out if their employee is eligible. This will be done by the Family Assistance Office. The Family Assistance Office will also ensure that employers have the required funds before they need to make parental leave payments to their employee. An employer can choose to have these funding amounts advanced in three instalments, if this would be more convenient than fortnightly payments. It will be ‘business as usual' for a company's payroll-employers do not have to change their employee's usual pay cycle, set the up any special bank accounts or report back to the Family Assistance Office. They just have to pay the parental leave pay to their employee with the usual tax deducted. The participation of employers in the scheme is being phased into help employers transition to the new arrangements and align with the start of the new financial year. Employers may opt to provide an employee with parental leave pay from the beginning of the scheme on 1 January 2011. From 1 July 2011, employers will be required to provide government funded parental leave pay to their eligible long-term employees whose babies are born or adopted after this date. This transitional arrangement will be given effect in a bill containing consequential amendments, to be introduced separately. Parental leave pay will not result in the accrual of any additional paid leave entitlements by employees, nor will it affect the calculation of notice periods or severance payments, or workers' compensation or accident insurance premiums. The government is busialso working with state and territory governments to ensure paid parental leave is not subject to payroll tax. This bill provides employers with a right of appeal if the employer believes that the Family Assistance Office has incorrectly determined that they must provide government funded parental leave pay to an employee. Similarly, the bill includes appropriate compliance arrangements to make sure that parental leave pay is paid to eligible parents in a timely manner. Any delays in payment, disputes or debts that may arise in the payment process will be managed appropriately by the Family Assistance Office and the Fair Work Ombudsman. The government's paid parental leave can be taken in addition to existing employer funded schemes, either at the same time or consecutively. The government's scheme has been designed to complement and enhance the existing family-friendly arrangements that many employers already offer. Review and evaluation The government understands the importance of monitoring and evaluating the Paid Parental Leave scheme, allocating almost $3 million for this purpose. The government is also committed to a review of the scheme commencing two years after the scheme starts. Both the review and the evaluation will be completed by the end of 2014. Two issues the government has committed to look at in the review are paid paternity leave and superannuation contributions for the period of paid parental leave. In summary Australian families have waited too long for a national Paid Parental Leave scheme and, with this bill, we are catching up with the rest of the developed world. This has been a long campaign for so many people. This is a government that is finally delivering a Paid Parental Leave scheme to Australian families. Our scheme does recognise the challenges and realities of modern family life-giving parents more time at home with their new baby, helping them maintain their connection with their job and helping employers retain valuable and skilled staff. Today is a major win for Australian families, and I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. NA (ELECTRICITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2010 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Gray. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",34
15,Mr GRAY,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia) (10.10 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010 will implement significant changes to enhance the government's ambitious 20 per cent Renewable Energy Target. The enhanced Renewable Energy Target will help fight climate change, it will allow Australia to harness its vast renewable energy resources, and it will drive the deployment of renewable energy technologies, industries and jobs. This bill is at the core of the government's clean energy agenda. The Renewable Energy Target is a major climate change initiative implemented by this government to begin to build the low-carbon economy of Australia's future. Scientists and experts have told us that clean, efficient energy systems will underpin our economic prosperity in the future, and drive our climate change response today. Through the RET, the government is delivering responsible and strong action on climate change-in our homes, our schools, our workplaces and throughout the grid. The enhancements to the RET contained in this bill form a key part of the government's comprehensive strategy to save energy, cut waste and make the most of our rich renewable resources. From the power plant to the power point this government is supporting action, large and small, to reduce our carbon pollution. We are delivering smalland large-scale clean energy through targeted funding and a strong 20 per cent Renewable Energy Target. We are helping Australians save energy by modernising the grid, promoting energy efficiency, and improving the design and use of our buildings, appliances and cars. As announced in the budget the government will commit a further $652.5 million over four years for the establishment of a renewable energy future fund to support Australia's response to climate change. The fund will provide additional support for the development and deployment of largeand smallscale renewable energy projects, and to enhance the take-up of industrial, commercial and residential energy efficiency. Through a range of actions and initiatives, the government is giving Australians the tools to do their bit to conserve energy, and creating new clean industries and jobs. At the same time, the government recognises that it is important to build the foundations now that will enable our energy sector to take advantage of opportunities in a carbon constrained world. Electricity consumption in Australia accounts for more than one-third of national emissions. At the same time, Australia has a wealth of renewable resources. We have some of the world's best wind resources, and the highest average solar radiation per square metre of any continent. We also have huge potential in geothermal and wave energy. The development of renewable electricity is therefore a crucial part of these low carbon foundations for our future. The bill I am introducing today, and the government's coordinated efforts on conservation and efficiency, will deliver for our environment, for our economy, and for Australia's clean energy future. The current expanded national Renewable Energy Target scheme The government remains committed to ensuring that the equivalent of 20 per cent of our electricity supply comes from renewable sources by 2020. In August 2009, the parliament passed legislation to implement the expanded national Renewable Energy Target, which brought the former Mandatory Renewable Energy Target and previously existing and proposed state and territory schemes into one national scheme. It expanded the previous Mandatory Renewable Energy Target by more than four times from 9,500 gigawatthours to 45,000 gigawatt-hours by 2020. The RET creates a guaranteed market for additional renewable energy deployment using a mechanism of tradeable renewable energy certificates that are created by renewable energy generators and owners of small-scale renewable systems. The enhanced Renewable Energy Target The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010 amends the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 to separate the existing scheme into two parts-the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme and the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target, from 1 January 2011. These changes recognise the challenges that different parts of the renewable energy industry are facing. These changes will continue to support the full range of renewable technologies in both the large-scale and small-scale sectors. The Large-scale Renewable Energy Target will encourage the deployment of large-scale power generation using energy sources such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal, while the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme will provide clear and continuing support to households, businesses and community groups looking to play their part in Australia's low pollution future by installing renewable energy systems like rooftop solar panels and solar hot-water systems. The changes are expected to deliver more renewable energy than the original 45,000 gigawatt-hour target, which will help transform the electricity sector and support investment in both largeand small-scale renewable energy projects. Key design features of the enhanced Renewable Energy Target The Large-scale Renewable Energy Target The Large-scale Renewable Energy Target will operate in a similar way to the current scheme. It will apply to accredited power stations using eligible renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, biomass, hydro and geothermal energy. The profile of annual targets under the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target will be 4,000 gigawatt-hours per year less than the current annual targets. This is to take account of the small-scale component, which will provide a separate mechanism for smallscale technologies that will also contribute the government's overall target. To minimise the impact of these changes on the renewable energy market, existing banked renewable energy certificates will only be eligible for use in the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target. The Large-scale Renewable Energy Target will provide increased certainty for the development of large-scale renewable energy projects by allowing them to grow free from any uncertainty that may have been caused by strong demand for small-scale renewable technologies. The benefits of the RET and the recent changes are already being realised. For example, within a few days of the government's announcement to enhance the RET, AGL announced that it had entered into conditional arrangements for the construction of the 365 megawatt capacity Macarthur Wind Farm in south-west Victoria. The Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme The new Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme has been designed to work within existing deeming arrangements and the solar credits mechanism to provide clear and stable support to those installing small-scale systems such as solar panels and solar water heaters. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010 will allow for the creation of fixed price renewable energy certificates through the deployment of a range of eligible technologies. In addition to their obligations to support generation-scale renewables projects under the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target, liable entities will have a concurrent obligation to surrender small-scale certificates and thereby support Australians taking action on climate change on their own properties. The clearing house In implementing the Small-scale Renewto able Energy Scheme, the changes draw as much as possible on the existing renewable energy target legislative framework in order to minimise compliance costs. Small-scale certificates will be created as per the current processes administered by the regulator, and their creation, transfer and surrender will be recorded on the REC registry as is currently the case. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010 allows for the establishment of a clearing house that will act as a central point for the transfer of small-scale certificates at $40. Stakeholder feedback indicated that many liable entities and suppliers of small-scale systems wanted the flexibility to trade small-scale certificates on the market, without going through the clearing house, at a price set by agreement between the relevant parties. In practice, it is expected that many stakeholders will choose to receive an up-front discount on the cost of installation of a small-scale system from their supplier, as they do under the current arrangements, rather than trade the certificate themselves. However, while the clearing house will be optional, it will stand ready to transfer smallscale certificates at the $40 price. While there will be no overall limit on the creation of small-scale certificates, in order to maximise certainty for liable entities, the bill requires the regulator to estimate and publish for the information of liable entities the total number of certificates expected to be created at the start of each year. The annual targets will be adjusted each year to account for actual small-scale certificate creation in the previous year. Similar to the renewable power percentage in the Largescale Renewable Energy Target, this will be expressed as a percentage of the liable entity's relevant wholesale electricity acquisitions. To facilitate a more regular flow of smallscale certificates from suppliers to liable entities, liable entities will be required to their obligations on a quarterly basis, but with annual assessment by the regulator. Assistance to Emissions Intensive Trade Exposed Industries The government recognises that the Renewable Energy Target will have a cost impact on those undertaking certain emissionsintensive trade-exposed (EITE) activities. Partial exemptions are applied to all activities that would have qualified for assistance under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to account for this impact. Enhancing enforcement provisions The bill also presents a timely opportunity to further strengthen the compliance regime relating to the creation of renewable energy certificates through certain civil penalty provisions. This is an important step to maintain confidence in the regulatory framework and the operation of the renewable energy certificate market. Government support for renewable energy The renewable energy target is part of a suite of government policies encouraging the switch to cleaner energy. To complement the renewable energy target, the government is making significant investment in generationscale renewables through the $4.5 billion Clean Energy Initiative. This initiative includes the $1.5 billion Solar Flagships program to support the construction of large-scale grid-connected solar power stations operating within the energy market. This program will help position Australia as a world leader in solar technology. The Australian Centre for Renewable Energy is a key plank in Australia's commitment to clean energy technologies and deploying these technologies around Australia. It draws together more than $560 million in order to accelerate the development, comacquit mercialisation and demonstration of renewable energy technologies. It will thus complement the government's investment in generation-scale demonstration projects under the Solar Flagships program and the sustained commitment to householdand community-scale renewables through initiatives such as the Solar Cities program and the National Solar Schools Program. In addition, the Australian Solar Institute will provide support for the Australian solar community, helping to retain Australian solar expertise and develop the next generation of Australian solar researchers. The institute will foster greater collaboration between researchers in universities, research institutions and industry and forge strong links with peak overseas research organisations. The first round of solar grants funding program has been completed. Five projects receiving funding of $11.1 million-funding which underpins total project values of $30.9 million-have been supported, two of which are projects that are researching thin-film solar PV technology. And the government has now committed more than $200 million to accelerate geothermal energy technology development, demonstration and deployment in Australia, leveraging a total investment in excess of $720 million. Funding for several geothermal projects has already been announced. Conclusion This bill will encourage the deployment of both major renewable energy projects and household-scale renewable energy systems. The government will work with industry, the parliament and the community to pass these enhancements to the act and ensure a smooth transition to the new arrangements. The legislation before the House will deliver significant and timely sets of enhancements that will reduce Australia's emissions while driving new investment and creating new jobs.

16,Mr GRAY,RENEWABLE ENERGY,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia) (10.24 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2010 amends the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Act 2000. Together with the related Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2010 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Smallscale Technology Shortfall Charge) Bill 2010, it implements changes to enhance the Renewable Energy Target (RET) Scheme to separate the existing scheme into two partsthe Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme and the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target from 1 January 2011. Combined, the three bills further strengthen the government's commitment to ensure that at least the equivalent of 20 per cent of Australia's electricity is supplied from renewable sources by 2020. This bill establishes a separate rate of shortfall charge of $65 per megawatt hour to encourage compliance with obligations to surrender renewable energy certificates created from large-scale renewable energy power generation. The related Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Small-scale Technology Shortfall Charge) Bill 2010 establishes a similar shortfall charge in relation to the obligation to surrender certificates created from the installation of small-scale renewable energy systems. Both shortfall charges encourage compliance with the Renewable Energy Target Scheme, as liable parties who do not meet their obligations to submit certificates from small-scale or large-scale renewable sources will need to pay a charge. The level of the shortfall penalty will be monitored to ensure it remains effective as an incentive for investment in renewable energy. Along with the two other related bills I am introducing today, this bill represents a major step toward the transformation of the Australian economy and the building of Australia's low pollution future.

This bill establishes a separate rate of shortfall charge at $65 per megawatt hour to encourage compliance with obligations to surrender renewable energy certificates created from installations of small-scale renewable energy technologies such as rooftop solar panels and solar water heaters. The related Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2010 establishes a similar shortfall charge in relation to the obligation to surrender certificates created from large-scale renewable energy generation. Both shortfall charges encourage compliance with the Renewable Energy Target Scheme, as liable parties who do not meet their obligations to submit certificates from small-scale or large-scale renewable sources will need to pay a charge.

NA Cognate bill: NA AMENDMENT (REFORM) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 May, on motion by Mr Byrne: That this bill be now read a second time.",44
18,Mrs MOYLAN,FREEDOM OF INFORMATION,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Information Commissioner Bill 2009 and the cognate bill, the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009. In 1976, Malcolm Fraser said: If the Australian electorate is to be able to make valid judgements on government policy it should have the greatest access to information possible. How can any community progress without continuing and informed and intelligent debate? How can there be any debate without information? Malcolm Fraser's comment is not only incontrovertible but, surely, uncontroversial. In fact, it is extremely logical, but, as John Hartigan, the chairman and CEO of News Ltd, who quoted that very passage at a freedom of speech conference, pointed out: 30 years later, we are still waiting for the fulfilment of those ideals. Freedom of information was designed to ensure that the community could have continuing, informed and intelligent debate. It gave people the right to know-to seek documents held by government ministers, their departments and most statutory authorities, as well as personal information the government holds on individuals. Government was to be open and accountable, available for all to see and scrutinise, but with some understandable specific exceptions, such as matters relating to security. It has taken time for governments and the Public Service to adopt such an open, accountable attitude and to accept that informaBILL 2009 tion in the public sphere is not the enemy, that the information departments hold is not solely for their eyes and that the public should be able to ask for information without the spectre of interrogation and mistrust. It was interesting to read an article in the Australian by Senator George Brandis, the shadow Attorney-General. Commenting on the development of this legislation, he said: Access to government information was as much about the attitude of the public servants who administered the act. So Faulkner committed the Rudd government to the creation of ‘a prodisclosure culture within government and the public service around the release of, and access to, government information [to] change the culture of FOI from one of resistance to one of disclosure'. So, although black-letter law such as we are passing in this place today plays an important part in ensuring that the freedom of information policy can operate the way it was intended, also important is making sure there is a change of mindset and that ministers and everyone working in ministers' offices and government departments understand that the public have a right to know and that intelligent debate cannot ensue if people do not have access to information, as Malcolm Fraser said in 1976. But attitudes are changing, and the Public Service, led by ministers, has been increasing transparency. The ideals of freedom of information have been getting traction. Then Senator Faulkner, when Special Minister of State, proclaimed a new dawn for even greater transparency, pointing to these bills in front of us as just the start. My concern is that this dawn will never break. Some changes have been made in this legislationthat is true-to reduce the cost of freedom of information requests, but will the obstacles to obtaining relevant material remain firmly in place? That is the question that we all need to ask and the issue we all need to examine. The freedom of information bill abolishes all charges for a person seeking access to their own information. Previously there was a $30 application fee plus decision-making time fees. All charges are now abolished where a person is seeking information about themselves. All other freedom of information application fees-that is, where applicants seek access to government documents-are also abolished. This has been quite a significant problem for many people seeking information, as I will outline in more detail shortly. The decision-making time fee, which is set out in schedule 5 of the regulations to the act, currently $20 an hour, is waived for the first hour of all requests. For journalists and not-for-profit organisations, the first five decision-making hours are charge free. The distinction recognises that journalists and NGOs in the pursuit of information to inform public debate or criticise the government may place wide-ranging or technical requests that require greater examination by the relevant department. To further enhance this bill, the five-hour charge-free provision should be extended to universities, historians, researchers, writers and, dare I say it, politicians. People undertaking these professions also add to the public debate and inform society. Perhaps they too should be allowed the same concessions. Access time periods under the Archives Act are reduced by this bill as well. Commonwealth records can be accessed after 20 years, down from 30 years, and cabinet notebooks after 30 years, down from 50 years. Under division 2, certain information must also be published by an agency-that is, the structure of the agency, its functions and decision-making powers, senior officers, annual reports that are made available to parliament, information routinely provided to parliament, and how and when specific policy proposals can be commented on by members of the public. Overseeing the architecture and application of the Freedom of Information Act will be a new Information Commissioner. The mentioned measures are logical additions and certainly have my support and, I expect, the support of most people in this place. But the pertinent question is whether the government is really committed to transparency; or is this mere decoration to hide the ugly truth? The government is required by the Freedom of Information Act to release an annual report. It did so nearly two months after the minister signed off on the report. It is disappointing that the report was released right at Christmas, when everyone was on holiday and somewhat distracted with Christmas festivities. You have to ask why. A cynic might say that it showed that under this government there has been less freedom of information. During the previous, coalition government, in the financial year 2006-07, 80.6 per cent of freedom of information requests were granted in full, but under this government, in the financial year 2008-09, that plummeted to 71 per cent. So people can be excused for feeling somewhat cynical about this. Page 6 of the report reveals more curious statistics. The Australian Federal Police refused in full only 16.6 per cent of all freedom of information applications received, but the Civil Aviation Safety Authority refused 34.69 per cent. I am perplexed as to how the agency charged, in the interests of public safety, with regulations for aircraft and air traffic management requires more secrecy than an agency which undertakes surveillance, covert operations and counterterrorism activities. Let me give the House a real-world example about freedom of information. Constituents in my electorate have complained to me about a dramatic change in aircraft noise. As a matter of fact, it is the subject of a national Senate inquiry at the moment. Flight paths were changed without open, public consultation and the ramifications for people in the electorate of Pearce were real: it devalued their properties, it destroyed the quality of life in an area that is quiet and peaceful up in the hills outside Perth and it has left many people sleep deprived, so naturally people are very angry about it. In investigating why such a change happened without any open public consultation, I put a number of questions to Air Services Australia-the federal government owned corporation providing air traffic control management services to Australia's aviation industry. They told me that the basis for the changes rested on a CASA report which made safety recommendations, and that was the impetus for the change. I met with Air Services Australia again and asked to view a copy of the report, but they refused. I wrote to the minister and asked for the report and I was refused that report. My only option then was to apply under freedom of information to CASA directly, after also approaching CASA for the report, and I therefore wrote a cheque and paid the fee for the information. Some initial research on CASA's and Air Services Australia's websites revealed a discrepancy over which was the actual report that led to the changes, so in my FOI request I requested the report that led to the sudden changes to flight paths in 2008 and noted the report in question would make reference to CASA regulation part 172, which deals with safety management and air traffic services. The report that I received after paying the fee consisted of 10 pages, but when I received it, the vast majority was marked ‘deleted'. Only four sections with references to regulation part 172 were left, amounting to about 1½ pages. Peter Cromarty, the Executive Manager of Airspace And Aerodrome Regulation, informed me in his covering letter that he decided to release the report with material ‘outside the scope' deleted. I am quite puzzled as to how parts of the report could be ‘outside the scope' when I requested the report itself. My reference to part 172 was used as justification to narrow the information provided to only the four sections specifically mentioning part 172 and deny access to the rest of the document as being outside my request. The report goes to the heart of the issuethat is, whether the change really was for safety reasons or not. As most of it was blacked out, seemingly ‘outside the scope', the public would have every right to question the role of that document as the reason for changes to flight paths in Western Australia. My experience highlights the overly legalistic approach so often applied to FOI requests. Requests can be read down to the black letter, minimising their apparent scope, thereby allowing the peripheral and often more enlightening supporting information to be excluded. That was certainly the case here. No wonder people feel cynical about the operation of freedom of information. The fact that this culture of secrecy exists is worrying in a democratic country. But the fact that this secrecy culture is growing when the Rudd government says it is increasing transparency is, frankly, alarming. If members of this House are still not convinced of the problems faced by people seeking information, I would direct them to an informative article entitled ‘The minister is protected, but from what?' by Mike Steketee in the Australian, published on 21 November 2009. In the article, Steketee details how Richard Denniss of the Australia Institute lodged a freedom of information request. He asked for the internal assessment of the limitations of the proposed emissions trading scheme from the department of climate change. After receiving nothing substantial, and having his application for an internal review rejected, he placed an FOI request regarding his initial FOI request. The material uncovered is enlightening. For instance, Steketee reports that Neil Hughes, the director of the emissions trading division, rang Richard Denniss to confirm whether his request included material involving the minister. The answer was yes. But, later, Hughes circulated an email saying: The secretary and deputy secretary have agreed the request does not refer to the minister, fore ministerial briefing is now excluded from request. At another point, Steketee reports that Neil Hughes, a director of the emissions trading division, queried in a meeting, ‘how we can increase the charges, extend the deadline'. Such examples are not isolated. After the government's failed National Broadband Network tender, Senator Nick Minchin lodged an FOI requesting documents. Previously the government had refused to release any documents, despite two Senate orders to do so. Senator Minchin then received a $23,851 bill to have the request processed. You did not hear me wrong, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom: Senator Minchin-a senator in this place, in this Senate, in this parliament-received a $23,851 bill in order for his request under FOI to be processed. Freedom of information is certainly not free. Open, accountable governance is one of the principles which underpin the very foundation of democracy. Without openness and accountability, our democratic system of governance is seriously compromised. Time and time again, from this parliament we have observed parliaments around the world who do not have open and accountable government and the havoc that wreaks on their citizens, in so many ways. As I always say when I am talking to students, democracy is a fragile flower and, if people stop taking notice of what is going on around them and cannot get access to information about what government is doing, it risks unpicking all of the principles that are the foundation of a democratically governed country. The federal government talks about promoting a culture of transparency, and so far it has been just that-talk. Frankly, the Rudd government's record, exposed through the records they must disclose under FOI, has shown transparency diminishing. Even therewhere requests are allowed, the process is the frustrating. If we in this place feel that frustration in the discharge of our duty to the public, how much more frustrated must members of the public feel? I think that is something for us all to reflect on: if we cannot get this information in the discharge of our duty, how much more frustrating is it for the average citizen out there trying to find out information, sometimes about their own record-sometimes to correct the record about their personal life? How frustrating it must be for members of the public, and how cynical it must make them. Andrew Dodd's Radio National program The Law Report on 20 October last year highlighted what I think would be common sense. On the program it was said: I find it amusing that the department that has the responsibility for the national economy, cannot take credit card payment for an FOI request. In Queensland though, that's changed with the new Act. You can lodge FOI right to know applications via the internet and pay over the internet. And that's made life so much easier. It's passing strange that government agencies are still being dragged reluctantly into the internet era, I find it interesting that they, for some reason, seem to do a lot of work with the internet and seem to have no problems, but when it comes to making life easier for FOI applicants, it doesn't seem to have trickled down. It has not trickled down to this place, to the federal government. The ability of a country's citizens to seek and receive information is at the core of democracy, as I said. Open government guards against corruption. Information keeps governments accountable. But merely saying this does not make it happen. As I said before, we can pass all the islation we want in this place, but if there not a change of heart and mind then there are ways of escaping the responsibilities laid down in these acts of parliament, in the black-letter law. There is a very obvious and widening gap between this government's rhetoric and its performance. That is seen in a number of areas, and it is certainly being seen in relation to changes to the freedom of information legislation to make it more open and transparent. More and more, the government is withholding information. So I challenge all ministers: lead by example and encourage openness in your departments. There is no true democracy where there is no true open debate. And, as Malcolm Fraser so rightly says, ‘How can there be debate without information?'",45
19,Ms PARKE,FREEDOM OF INFORMATION,"I rise to support the Information Commissioner Bill 2009 and the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009, which together bring in the second stage of the government's reform measures in this area and continue this government's achievements in greater transparency and integrity in the structures and operation of our Australian democracy. In short, the measures contained in this legislation will make official government records available sooner, they will remove the cost burdens that previously existed in lodging freedom of information requests, they will make the FOI consideration process clearer and also subject to better oversight by the newly established Australian Office of the Information Commissioner, and they will extend the scope of the FOI Act. The changes being made in these bills may not generate major headlines, but they will institute reforms that substantially improve the openness of government and its agencies and substantially improve the range legand detail of information available to the is public. In practical terms, these changes will include: a freedom of information request process that is simpler, more responsive, cheaper and less restrictive, with a single formulation of the public interest test and fewer exemptions from that test; an improved day-in, day-out operational approach to freedom of information by government agencies, with a requirement that such agencies provide certain information as a matter of course and in accordance with a publicly available, agency-by-agency freedom of information plan; and a greatly improved system of FOI supervision and oversight through the creation of the Office of the Information Commissioner, which will itself include three important information officers, namely, the Australian Information Commissioner, the FOI Commissioner, and the Privacy Commissioner; The creation of an FOI Commissioner was one of the recommendations of the Open government report, which was the result of the review undertaken by the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Administrative Review Council in 1996. Indeed, a number of the recommendations in that report are now, finally, introduced through this legislation, after the previous government failed to take action on them for 11 years, only to then initiate a second, narrower review of FOI laws in 2007. Those who suggest that this government is all review and no action might reflect on the Howard government's record on FOI reform. Just like the national bioregional marine planning process, which was agreed to by the Commonwealth and the states in 1998 but then lay dormant for nine years, these important, long-recommended FOI reforms have had to wait for this government to come into see the light of day. With these changes, the inner working of government and of the public service, includthe ing those contracted and even subcontracted to provide services on behalf of the Commonwealth, will be made available more quickly, more easily and with greater process oversight to Australian citizens and to organisations, including media organisations, whose free and unfettered access to such key information is an essential part of the scruplication tiny that government should always be open to and an essential part of a well-informed and engaged electorate. The votes of Australian citizens and their aggregate influence within our electoral tem are cast on the basis of the information that is available to inform those votes. The quality of the information in the public sphere directly impacts upon the quality of the electoral outcome. For instance, Australian citizens should never have had to go to the polls in the mistaken belief that asylum seekers threw their children overboard. Every step we take to ensure that government and government agencies are open to the proper scrutiny of the public and of the media is both a step towards a higher quality Australian democracy and a step away from the dangers that are inherent in politically expedient secrecy. The changes to the FOI Act not only improve the right of access to information sought by the public, which is perhaps the most commonly understood purpose of FOI laws, but also put in place new obligations on Australian government agencies to ensure that they proactively publish relevant inforInformation mation. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner will be responsible for the compliance of government agencies in this regard, and agencies will be required to publish approved plans that indicate what information is to be made available to the public. Agencies will further be required to publish the details of an officer who will be point of contact for public inquiries about information that can be released under the Freedom of Information Act. Exemptions that exist under the act to allow certain kinds of information to be withheld will be streamlined, with a revised single formulation of the public interest test and a requirement that any refusal upon the apof that test include release of the public interest factors assessed in reaching the decision to refuse access. Previously this requirement applied only to the internal working documents exemption. Some imporsystant exemptions, such as the national economy exemption, will now be conditional exemptions. That is, they will be subject to the public interest test, when previously they were strict exemptions. This is another example of a shift towards openness, of an emphasis on disclosure rather than on secrecy. Such a shift is also evident in the new approach to the cabinet exemption. As it stood, the FOI exemption covered all documents submitted to cabinet or that are proposed to be submitted. The amended exemption is limited to those documents prepared for the dominant purpose of submission to cabinet. It will now not apply as a matter of course to documents that were attached to an exempt document and the scope of the cabinet exemption has been clarified by the provision of specific details as to what the exemption covers. The reforms in this legislation build on what was achieved through the Freedom of (Removal of Conclusive Certificates and Other Measures) Act 2009, which commenced operation in October last year and had the effect of repealing the power to issue conclusive certificates. That means that all FOI refusals on the grounds of the exemptions that exist in the FOI Act and the Archives Act are subject to full independent external merits review. This legislation continues the stream of reforms introduced by this government with a view to strengthening Australian democracy and increasing the fairness and openness of our electoral and political system. This is one of the clearest points of difference between this Labor government and its predecessor. It bears repeating that the previous government massively increased the threshold for political donations that did not need to be disclosed, sively increased the taxpayer funded printing and communications allowance, used conclusive certificates as a means of avoiding freedom of information scrutiny and amended the Electoral Act to close off the rolls in a way that disenfranchised thousands of Australian voters. By contrast, this government has delivered on its promise to address the issue of politiand cal donations and the undemocratic changes made by the Howard government to the donations and enrolment provisions of the Electoral Act, though unfortunately our efforts in this regard have at times been scandalously obstructed. We have delivered on our promise to establish a register of ists and a ministerial code of conduct and to reduce the public funding of printing and distribution by members and senators and to abolish the use of conclusive certificates. Through the amendments contained in the legislation before us today, this government is reforming the system of access to information about government and its agencies in the interest of greater access, greater transparency and greater oversight. This legislation delivers categorically on the commitments made prior to the 2007 election in the Labor policy document titled Government information: restoring trust and integrity in governcommitment ment information. Taken altogether, these things I have mentioned are structural improvements to the way in which our democracy works. They are done because this Labor government has a principled commitment to seeing these improvements made real. We have undertaken these achievements as a first-term government on a relatively small margin. We have implemented these reforms even though they are changes that in some cases increase the scrutiny and pressure that government can be subjected to and in other cases reduce the value of incumbency. They are certainly not mas- changes for which the government has received or sought any great credit in the media or, I dare say, in the course of dinner table conversations in households around the country. But, like changes that increase the quality of the air we breathe, these are reforms that deal with the essential substance of Australian democracy, and they will deliver benefits that go right across the breadth depth of government and public administration. Finally, I congratulate the Cabinet Secretary and Special Minister of State for these bills and the important reforms they contain. I welcome this further instalment of the Rudd Labor government's program of lobby- strengthening Australia's democracy.",49
20,Mr OAKESHOTT,FREEDOM OF INFORMATION,"I rise to also put on the record some views on the Information Commissioner Bill 2009 and the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009. With many pieces of legislation that go through this place-and this is one such example-the theory and the words that we see in the paperwork are commendable and very hard to argue against in any form. However, it is a case of flagging, for anyone who is listening, that the proof in pieces of legislation such as this one is very much in the implementation and the from those who late at night might be sitting behind a ministerial desk or an adviser's desk with a potentially politically embarrassing freedom of information request before them. The question then is what decision is made by the individuals involved in the implementation of reform documents such as this one. So by all means the changes to the object of the FOI Act are welcome but the test is yet to come with legislation passing this place. The test will come when the human discretion becomes involved at a later date, whether that is through an Information Commissioner, and the questions of who that person is; what their qualifications are; authority-delegated or otherwise-they have; what reporting commitments they have to the parliament and to various ministers, prime ministers and parliamentarians; what genuine commitment to public disclosure that individual has; as well as the overall culture of government generally and departments specifically. The culture, mainly, in Canberra is not at this moment in time one of open disclosure and open government. I sincerely hope that this is a step in the development and the change of that culture to one as per the words, where open government is the starting point and we work back from there rather than open government being the last port of call in freedom of information requests and an open, transparent and therefore accountable democracy. So the general tone of these amendments-that information held by government is to be managed for public purposes and is a national resourceare expressed in fine words and fine sentiments, but I do flag that I certainly will be watching closely. In this speech I will be raising a specific example where, if government are serious and genuine in their intent about reform, will consider starting to put these words practice immediately. The case in question I want to raise is in relation to the schedule exemptions. Listing through the changes to the publication guidelines for Commonwealth agencies subject to this act, the new types of information that are included in the reforms are details of statutory appointments, operational information of an agency, and the publication of information in documents to which access is routinely given through FOI requests. This final requirement is qualified concerning the publication of information that concerns personal information about any individual, information about the business or professional affairs of any persons, or any other kind of information of a kind deterwhat mined by the Information Commissioner through a legislative instrument that is deemed unreasonable to be published. This part provides for the new Information Commissioner to assist the agencies with their publishing obligations and to play the big brother type role. In reference to my previous comments, therein lies the question: just how hard and how often is this Information Commissioner going to press the button of open government rather than being subservient to the whim, the wishes or the potential embarrassment of individuals or departments? Perhaps most importantly, the proposed 9A outlines that an agency, in performing its functions under this part of the act, must have regard to the revised section 3 object of the FOI Act and then the schedule 3 exemptions and the part 1 open-access periods. Open-access periods are when the National Archives of Australia must make available Commonwealth records other than exempt records to the public. Currently records other than cabinet notebooks are not available for 30 years and cabinet books are not available for 50 years. This part of the bill changes the they Archives Act 1983 and brings forward these into periods so that Commonwealth records are available sooner. Records other than cabinet 3 notebooks will now be available for open access after 20 years, and cabinet books will be available within 30 years. That is, I think, an important step, but it does lead me to raise the specific issue before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal right now, which does directly sit at odds with the intent from government in this legislation and the language from government in this legislation. The new single-form public interest test which is weighted towards disclosure and the 30-year rule sitting alongside the Archives Act is directly at odds with the Clinton Fernandes case and the paperwork that he is seeking through the 41 situation reports in relation to the East Timor independence events of 35 years ago. Even now the question of public interest is having to be tested by an individual who potentially is exposing himself to hundreds of thousands of dollars of court costs. But he is an individual doing it for the national interest, ironically with Australian Government Solicitor acting for the National Archives of Australia seeking to block access to the contents of some of these 40 situation reports from that period, most on the grounds that they contain information the disclosure of which ‘could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the security, defence or international relations of the Commonwealth'. A couple of them are also deemed sensitive because they contain information sent as secret by other foreign governments. So not only is the Australian government now seeking to block disclosure to avoid ‘exceptionally grave harm to national security'; the government is also seeking to have the tribunal hearing held in camera on the grounds that even arguing why the documents are so sensitive would disclose some of the contents. This, remember, is about things that happened in 1975-35 years ago. So Clinton Fernandes, who was a guest of mine when we had the Indonesian President here, is not a mad, raving loony; he is a defence analyst connected to the University of New South Wales. He was responsible for the East Timor desk, in a period when the independence movement in East Timor was on. He has, he assures me, seen most if not all of these 42 situation reports. And he assures me and others that these situation reports are not against the national interest. They may cause some political embarrassment, but if we are talking about a public interest test, if we are talking about open disclosure, if we are talking about political embarrassment not being a reason for withholding documents, then here is a real, live test case before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that the Minister for Defence, John Faulkner, could override and release those documents and save a court process, the exposure of an individual and also genuinely demonstrate a commitment to public and the open disclosure in the national interest. Somewhat ironically, it is the same John Faulkner who, to his credit, is the person who is largely responsible, with a lifelong commitment and a political commitment to freedom of information and public disclosure, for the formation and introduction of this bill-and I congratulate him for that. But the challenge now, directly to him, is that here is a real, live opportunity for him, today, to move in his capacity as Minister for Defence, on the release of these documents from 35 years ago, under the Archives Actexactly in line, I would suggest, with the proposed legislation before the House today. Yet, in a court down the road, we have government acting completely at odds with the sentiments and the words that are contained within this document. Going back to my opening comments, these are good words. This is a good piece of legislation. It is necessary reform. But when the human discretion and the human interest test becomes involved in public policy, we start to put the rubber on the road, the meat on the bone-and any other cliche that says the real test of whether governments and individuals within government are serious about these good words. We start to see whether these words mean anything. Unfortunately, at the moment, in a court down the road, they are not worth the paper they are written on. It would be great to see that turned around as a first and genuine example of a new era of open government from the Labor government, which talks about the importance of open government to democracy yet is doing the exact opposite in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal right now. So there is my challenge for today, to the minister, to the government and to the advisors sitting in the boxes: let us see it. Let maybe have some truth about what happened around 1975 debated in the open forum and the public court. Yes, it may cause some political discomfort for former prime ministers Whitlam and Fraser, but let's bring it onlet's get the story told and have an open and honest debate about events from 35 years ago; let's start to learn the truth about those events; and let's then start to drill down on how we build stronger relations between Indonesia, Australia and East Timor as a consequence of those events from 35 years ago. So I welcome the words. I welcome the legislation. I look forward to the action to back up those words and this legislation before the House today.",51
21,Mr BYRNE,FREEDOM OF INFORMATION,"Holt-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for Trade) (11.11 am)-in replyIn summing up this particular piece of legislation I would like to welcome the contribution of all members to the debate. I would like to respond, however, to some of the comments made by the member for Stirling earlier in this debate. Senator Ludwig has acknowledged that the latest FOI annual report shows that the FOI Act is in need of reform. This is what makes the reforms in these bills so important. However, had the member for Stirling read the latest annual report, he would have found that the numbers do not always speak for themselves, and that some of the figures he quoted are not, as he said, evidence that there is less freedom of information under the Rudd government than there was under the Howard government. The latest FOI annual report for 2008-09 does show that FOI access requests are slightly down on the previous year. This decrease can be explained by a decrease in the number of requests submitted to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, as DIAC is providing access to international movement records outside of the FOI Act. us This is a change that should be welcomed. Departments are not requiring applicants to go through FOI but are giving them access through easier and less formal means. Refusal rates, we are told, were also slightly up. However, FOI requests for non-personal information have increased from 15 per cent in 2007-08 to 20 per cent in 2008-09, indicating that the FOI Act is being increasingly used to seek access to other documents, such as those concerning policy development and government decision making. Some of these documents just should not be released, as they relate to highly sensitive information such as matters of security or defence. This is one reason for the slight increase in refusal rates. I do not, however, think that the member for Stirling would ever suggest that such information should be given out, particularly in the national interest. But let us turn to the reason we are here today: because the Rudd government is ushering in a new regime for access to government information. After over a decade of secrecy in the Howard government-which John Hartigan labelled the most secretive government we have ever had, even in war time-these reforms are critical and necessary. These reforms are a key aspect of the Rudd government's policy to restore trust and integrity in government, and constitute the most significant overhaul of FOI since its enactment. The FOI Act is a cornerstone law in Australian government accountability legislation. These reforms will revitalise the FOI Act so that it provides a stronger foundation for more openness in government. Indeed, the proposed new objects clause for the FOI Act recognises that giving the Australian community access to government held information will promote Australia's representative democracy. Several witnesses in the public hearings conducted by the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee expressed support for the reforms in the bill and urged their prompt enactment by this parliament. I should acknowledge, however, that there are some witnesses who would also prefer to see other measures such as the removal of more exemptions and exclusions. The government believes that these bills represent the right balance between meeting the public interest in disclosure of government information and in establishing those interests where a strong public interest lies in maintaining ality of government held information. Together with the structural reforms proposed by the Information Commissioner Bill 2009 these bills aim to ensure that the right of access to documents is not unduly restricted by a liberal application of exemption criteria. Provision is made in the bill for a review to be undertaken of the FOI Act two years from the commencement of the bill. The review will be comprehensive and include an examination of agencies exempted from the operation of the act. I will, in summing up on this bill, mention two very significant changes to the FOI Act that will be effected by the FOI Amendment (Reform) Bill. The proposed new agency information publication scheme marks a significant change in the focus of the FOI Act. Instead of a framework that is largely reactive to access requests, the information publication scheme establishes a legislative framework for agency driven proactive publication of government information. This scheme goes further than establishing fixed classes of information for publication. Agencies will need to actively consider the information they hold, which can and should be made available to the public. In another very significant change the period that the FOI Act governs access to government information will be reduced while accelerating the application of the Archives Act. The bill amends the Archives Act to bring forward the open access periods for all records other than cabinet notebooks and census information from 30 years to 20 years. The open access period for cabinet notebooks is to be brought forward from 50 years to 30 years. These are some of the more significant changes. This bill, together with the Information Commissioner Bill 2009, comprises a strong package of measures to enhance public access to government confidentiheld information. Question agreed to.

The government recogis renises that the promise of better information disclosure requires independent oversight. The establishment of an Information Commission-an FOI commissioner-will introduce independent monitors into the FOI arena, which is an initiative long overdue. The commissioners will play an important role in delivering effective administration of the FOI Act. For that purpose they will have comprehensive functions, enabling them to address poor FOI practices as well as attitudes that are not conducive to the presumption of openness intended by the government's FOI reforms. This Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009 will also bring together the independent oversight functions for privacy and FOI regimes into a single office. This measure will strengthen oversight capabilities and allow for consistency in these interconnected areas of information policy. The establishment of the Office of the Information Commissioner underpins the government's objective to revitalise the FOI Act and also lays a stronger foundation for privacy protection and improvements in the broader management of government information.

29,Mr DUTTON,HEALTH PRACTITIONER,"Dickson) (11.25 am)The Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010 before us today signals the final stages of what has been a long and complex process. This bill provides consequential amendments to what is a significant reform, being the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme. It is important that we consider the wider ramifications of the Registration and Accreditation Scheme that underpins this legislation before I comment on the specifics of the bill. There has been strong in-principle support for a nationally consistent registration scheme for health professionals. Different registration and accreditation requirements between jurisdictions has, in the past, hampered workforce mobility and made it difficult to monitor the small number of practitioners who have been under scrutiny or are facing disciplinary action in a given jurisdiction. The guiding principles of the scheme are stated as, firstly, to provide for the protection of the public by ensuring that only practitioners who are suitably trained and qualified to practise in a competent and ethical manner are registered; secondly, to facilitate workforce mobility across Australia and reduce red tape for practitioners; thirdly, to facilitate the provision of high-quality education and training and rigorous and responsive assessment of overseas trained practitioners; next, to have regard to the public interest in promoting access to health services; and, finally, to have regard for the need to enable the continuous development of a flexible, responsive and sustainable Australian health workforce and enable innovation in education and service delivery. The process commenced when the Productivity Commission recommendations came down in January 2006 for a single national registration board and a single national accreditation scheme. The previous coalition government acted on the recommendations by reaching an agreement at COAG in 2006 for the establishment of a national registration scheme. In April 2007, COAG agreed on a single National Registration and Accreditation Scheme to commence in July 2008. The health workforce underpins our health and hospital system. Health workforce issues have been prominent in political debate and in the media recently. I think it is important that we take the opportunity to revisit some of the facts. The coalition, whilst in government, delivered nine new medical schools, including in regional areas. There was a 50 per cent increase in medical school places between 2003 and 2007. Additional funding was provided in 2006 for some 605 additional medical school places being phased in from 2007 to 2011. The coalition government also provided 3,700 additional nursing places between 2005 and 2007 alone. It was the coalition that commenced funding for practice nurses through the Nursing in General Practice Initiative and later with additional MBS rebates. The coalition clearly is committed to improving the quality of Australia's health workforce, despite this government's best efforts to rewrite history. Following the election of the Rudd government, the national registration scheme stalled and implementation has been delayed until July 2010. One of the primary reasons for developing a single national scheme for registration and accreditation was to reduce bureaucratic red tape across the jurisdictions. Unfortunately it seems, like in many policy areas of this government, there has been strong bureaucratic influence and interference with the establishment and proposed functions of the boards. Concerns still exist regarding the exertion of power by the ministerial council over national boards and, in particular, accreditation standards. The national law provides that the ministerial council may give directions to a national board for a proposed accreditation standard, or a proposed amendment of an accreditation standard. The only caveat originally on the ministerial council providing accreditation directives was that the proposed standard or amendment would have a substantive and negative impact on the recruitment or supply of health practitioners. This understandably stirred up considerable concern amongst health professionals and patient groups. On the face of it, this provided health ministers with the authority to interfere with accreditaout tion standards on the basis of workforce supply-should they be faced with a shortage, the concern was that they would be able to take shortcuts and lower the bar to increase workforce numbers. This provision did little for confidence in the safety and quality of health care in our country. It was only after the first Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry that a requirement was included for the ministerial council to give consideration to the potential impact of the council's direction on the quality and safety of health care. In fact, the committee explicitly recommended that the ministerial council consider the recommendations proposed by the Australian Medical Association in relation to this issue. The AMA recommendations included: defining ‘substantive and negative impact'; requiring the ministerial council to apply a public interest test that considers, amongst other things, the potential impact on the quality and safety of patient care; requiring the ministerial council to consult with the relevant learned medical college and faculties on best practice; requiring that ministerial council decisions to issue policy direction to national boards be unanimous; providing greater transparency of policy directives by providing justification and evidence for the decisions and publishing those decisions; and including specific provisions for review of directives. Despite the committee's and the AMA's recommendations, the ministerial council has provided only a very limited response. A provision has been included for the council to first give consideration to the potential impact of the council's direction on the quality and safety of health care. This falls well short of the calls of many stakeholders. Many stakeholders maintain there is a need at the very least for a public interest test for directives on accreditation standards. Withsuch, it is claimed that there will not be sufficient safeguards to protect patients under the current national law. A number of professions, including physiotherapy and psychology, have experienced delays or expressed frustration at the process for specialisation recognition under the registration scheme. Physiotherapists argue that specialisation is well established and recognised within the profession. It is claimed that specialist physiotherapists, like recognised specialists in other health professions, have extensive additional training and experience qualifying them to assess and treat complex and high-risk patients. This includes formal postgraduate qualifications and a rigorous external training and examination process. The argument is that removal of specialisation title recognition will make the referral process much more difficult for patients with specialised needs and will not be in the public interest. Clearly, the process has not been without difficulty and there remain a great number of issues to be resolved before implementation in July this year. The bill before us today amends the Health Insurance Act to streamline the recognition of health professions under the registration and accreditation scheme. The Health Insurance Act allows for the recognition of specialists, consultants and GPs for access to Medicare. There are a number of issues which have been identified by stakeholders and are evident in the Senate committee inquiry which is due to conclude its findings. The bill specifies requirements for consultant physicians and specialists to qualify for Medicare purposes. In addition to requiring medical specialists and consultant physicians to be registered in their speciality and recognition of the speciality for the purposes of the Health Insurance Act, this bill specifies that medical practitioners and consultant physicians satisfy any other requirements prescribed by the regulation. The provision does not relate to general practitioners or other health professionals for Medicare eligibility. It is argued that specialists and consultant physicians would already be required to be registered and on the specialist register to be eligible for Medicare benefits, and there seems to be little justification for creating additional requirements. The bill also provides consequential amendments to section 19 of the Health Insurance Act relating to Medicare benefit ineligibility for medical practitioners that are not authorised to render certain services under the practitioner's registration. The Australian Medical Association and the Royal Australian College of GPs submit that there are a range of health professionals who are eligible for Medicare benefits. Accordingly, it is argued that the bill should be amended to extend the relevant sections to other health professions eligible for Medicare benefits. Key nursing stakeholders have also raised some concerns regarding definitional amendments contained within the bill. Amongst other things, the bill removes the requirement that nursing care be given by or under the supervision of a registered nurseit removes the word ‘registered' from the definition. Whilst there can be different uses of the word ‘registered' for nurses, it would seem appropriate that there remain clear lines of responsibility and accountability for nursing care. The coalition understands the government is moving amendments to address a number of the issues discussed in relation to this bill. Whilst there have been extensive consultations throughout the national registration process, it does seem the government has again failed to do the groundwork for the basics on this consequential bill. It is becoming an unfortunate habit of the government to have to move amendments to their own bills because of oversights or lack of initial consultation. It is unfortunate, as I have pointed out, that the committee has recommendations which are pending, a report which is pending, but the government has not paid courtesy to that process or indeed to those people who have submitted evidence to that committee or indeed to the committee members. I hope that this process is able to provide to the government some lessons about the way in which they conduct their business and proceed with these amendments. These are significant reforms and they impact not just on health professionals but of course on patients as well. The coalition, like the government and all Australians, wants to see a rigorous process put in place to make sure that the high standards that we have adopted for many decades in this country will remain long into the future. We want to make sure that health professionals right across the country in every profession increase their professional development and that we reduce the sorts of cases that we have seen operating in Queensland in recent times under what is a completely incompetent jurisdiction in the domain of the Queensland state government. We hope that the government will learn from this process. We hope that the government will have the ability to conduct these negotiations in a more consultative way into the future. There are unintended consequences. There is no question about that. Some of them have been ironed out and some will require amendment into the future. To be quite frank, it would seem rather unacceptable to have the Senate only with a day or so reporting potentially with further recommendations and the government not waiting to take those into consideration. Having spoken to a number of professionals in the health workforce around the country over the course of the last six or 12 months in relation to this issue, I have heard that they believe their views have not been heard. They have expressed their views strongly but they have not been heard by this government. There is already a track record over the last couple of years of this government making lots of promises in relation to health but not having the capacity to deliver. Clearly, this is a government which promises a lot and has no problems in getting a headline but in the end just cannot deliver on the promises that it makes. Health is one of those areas and last night we have again seen that play out in the budget where the government has promised another 23 GP superclinics on top of the 36 already on offer. It has taken three years for this government to have two fully operational, yet that does not stop it from pretending that it is going to have another 23 rolling out some time, over the next couple of years or over the forward estimates, when I think it has proven to all Australians that has a Prime Minister that does not have the capacity to deliver on his promises. Registration and accreditation is one such area where commitments have been made to the professions and again people have been let down. That is why there is a great level of frustration amongst clinicians and health professionals right across the board. I think there are certainly some lessons to be learnt from this and I hope that the government is able to take those away. As I have stated in my speech today, the coalition will not oppose the bill with the proposed amendments.",59
30,Mr NEUMANN,HEALTH PRACTITIONER,"I speak in support of the Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010. The member for Dickson mentioned GP superclinics. There is one in his electorate and he should care to have a look at it from time to time. He did not even turn up on the day when it was opened. There is one for my electorate too. It is about to be opened in August this year. Unlike the previous government, we have not procrastinated on this issue of national registration as they did year after year1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004. Eventually in 2005 a Productivity Commission report came down. They were in power all through that time and they should have known for a start that national registration and accreditation is an important factor in any profession, be it law, engineering, medicine or nursing, so any registration and accreditation should be recognised. If, for example, you live in Coolangatta or Tweed Heads it is simply a nonsense that there is not the same uniform national registration and recognition of professional qualifications. It is simply ridiculous to think that there is a notional dingo fence there. For a long time the coalition government did little. I admit that from 2007 onwards they took steps, as the Productivity Commission report it came down, through the COAG process but it took them year after year to get there. If you had listened to the member for Dickson, you would think that they responded in March 1996 over this concern. They did not; they sat there and did nothing. This has been a long time coming. This is a landmark reform. This is very important. For years they blamed the states and territories. For years the current Leader of the Opposition constantly complained when he was the health minister about the states and territories. He would not meet them from time to time and in the end, before the last election, he had to simply admit that that was the case. This legislation is important. The member for Dickson was a little disingenuous about that. He failed to recognise that we have taken up the mantle of national reform in this regard after years of failure by the coalition government. We recognise that this is important and that it was stalled but needed to be pursued. We immediately got down to discussing the issue with the states and territories and in March 2008 signed an intergovernmental agreement to progress the national scheme. As for what we are doing here today, 10 health professions are going to have national, consistent uniform standards for their workforces. This is really important stuff. I am sure that our founding fathers, when they created Australia as a federation many years ago, would not have thought about these issues but we know how important they are. All people, whether they live Australia in Tweed Heads or in the Torres Strait, should get the same access to good and decent health care. We are going to make sure that there are health professionals in every part of this country. Whether you live in Perth, on the west coast, or in Palm Beach, on the east coast, you should have access to decent health care, high-quality and accessible health care, provided by doctors, nurses and other health professionals, such as physiotherapists and the like, who have uniform national standards of accreditation and registration. So this is an important national reform. Under the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions, the national arrangements for registration and accreditation will be implemented by the states and territories as part of their jurisdiction. We know that we had to get the cooperation of the states and territories because constitutionally that was required. The societies, associations and professional bodies that govern these professions are state based and so we have had to make arrangements with them. The member for Dickson was very critical of the Rudd government and used his speech as an opportunity to attack the government for what they have done. I can tell him that in my electorate alone we have seen major changes and reforms in health and hospital funding due to assistance by the Rudd government since we got into power in 2007. For years, the Ipswich-West Moreton area was neglected by the Howard government, whether it was infrastructure funding, school funding or health and hospital funding. With the election of the Rudd Labor government, there were immediate improvements in the area of health funding, including after-hours clinics, surgery waiting lists and operating theatres in the Ipswich General Hospital. These are important changes, and they have been made by the Rudd Labor government. in We have poured money into the Ipswich and West Moreton area in my electorate of Blair. For the member for Dickson to simply cast aspersions on the government's credibility, authority and authenticity in health reform is, I think, a nonsense when I look at the record of the previous government. They failed miserably in this regard. We are going to train 6,000 more doctors. The member for Dickson failed to note in his dissertation on health and hospital reform that the previous government ripped $1 billion out of the health system and capped GP training places. If he had been more active in relation to health and hospital reform when he was on ministerial leather, we would have seen more changes and better reforms in this area. Certainly in areas such as the Brisbane Valley, which I inherited from him following an electoral redistribution in Queensland, there is major need for further reforms and a better health system as well as further and better health funding for the Esk Hospital. The area of the Brisbane Valley was neglected under the tenure of the federal member for Dickson. We are working hard to improve health and hospital services in the Brisbane Valley, Somerset and Ipswich, after years of neglect by the coalition government. This bill contains important changes and reforms. It is an amendment bill. Stakeholders have been listened to and amendments have been made to the bill by reason of this listening aspect of the Rudd Labor government. The member for Dickson said that we were not taking notice of stakeholders. We did take notice of the AMA and the nursing associations and nursing professions. Amendments have been made to the legislation before us. This bill is an amendment to the original bill in relation to national registration. We took into consideration submissions made by the Australian Medical Association concerning issues of specialist and consultant physicians. Under the proposed legislation subsection (c) required that ‘he or she had to satisfy any other requirements prescribed by regulations in relation to the specialty'. The AMA did not have any problems with being registered in a specialty under state law. They did not have any problems about the specialty being prescribed in regulations made under the Health Insurance Act, but they did have problems with other requirements. The amendments in this bill clarify the purpose of the regulation making power in paragraph (c). The AMA also sought amendments, as the member for Dickson mentioned, to sections of the legislation governing the ability to render Medicare rebatable services. Again, we have listened to the concerns of the AMA and made amendments that address stakeholder concerns. We have widened the scope of sections 19C, 19CB and 19DA of the HIA, which apply to all health professionals that render Medicare rebatable services. The member for Dickson talked about concerns raised by the nursing profession. Again, we have listened to what they have had to say about the definitions of ‘nurse' and ‘nursing care' and made amendments accordingly. This legislation is about making sure our system is nationally consistent. It about making sure that where workforce shortages exist they are addressed. Where there is a need for social mobility of employment or there is a shortage of health professionals, these issues will be addressed. This legislation is about removing barriers or obstacles of a legal, constitutional and regulatory nature to people living in regional and rural communities-the kinds of communities that I represent in the federal electorate of Blair-having the health services that they need. Let us take locum health services as an example. In many small country towns there might be a hospital or one or two GPs, and it can be a challenge to get a locum in when a GP wants to go on holidays. National registration and accreditation improves the capacity and boosts the opportunity for these communities to get a locum in from interstate. It is very important that we make sure that doctors and health professionals can move across state borders. This legislation is a very important reform. Streamlining specialist registration and recognition will improve the health system in this country. It will also improve it in regional and rural communities. It will make sure that we have a national approach to a national issue. It will also make sure that we end the duplication and the silly eccentricities of federalism that prevent a uniform system across the country. It will obliterate red tape. It will make sure that we have the same system across every state and territory in this country with respect to national registration and accreditation. There is more work to be done, but the government is getting on with the job of listening to stakeholders, making national reform, putting in money where there was no money, making sure that nurses and health professionals get trained properly and rolling out GP superclinics, even in the electorate of Dickson.",63
31,Mr LINDSAY,HEALTH PRACTITIONER," Mr is Deputy Speaker Washer, as a doctor you will understand GP superclinics and you will also understand the disappointment that I feel because, after my electorate was promised one of the 36 superclinics almost three years ago, there is still no superclinic in Townsville and no prospect of one being started before the next election. That is very disappointing. The Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010 that the parliament is discussing today contains amendments to support the introduction and implementation of the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions. It provides transitional arrangements for this scheme. It is a positive initiative, which will nationally streamline the recognition and registration of medical people working in medical professions. There are 10 healthcare professions that are involved: medical practitioners, dentists, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, psychologists, optometrists, chiropractors, physiotherapists, osteopaths and podiatrists. In July 2006 the Council of Australian Governments agreed to set up the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions, and in March 2008 COAG signed an agreement to introduce the scheme by 1 July 2010. I observe here that in health things move very slowly indeed and the current health reforms being trumpeted by the government are also moving very slowly indeed. For example, the government announced that there would be a PET scanner based in Townsville-the first PET scanner in Queensland outside Brisbane. Of course it should be in Townsville, which is more than 1,000 kilometres from the state capital, but while the government said that we would get a PET scanner it did not say that we would not get it until 2013-14. The government should have made that clear, because there is an expectation in the Townsville community that a PET scanner is coming now. Many health reforms do not take place other than in the out years, and I think people are going to be quite disappointed that, although there is all this trumpeting about wonderful healthcare reform, they will not see anything happen for several years yet. This is the cynic in me speaking, but when it finally does happen I reckon we are going to see more of the same. There will still be the waiting lists on elective surgery, and there will still be the problems in the emergency departments. We do not seem to be able to get a handle on how to fix these problems. Often they are to do with workforce issues, particularly in the public system. One of the fundamental things that the government will not address is the workforce issues and the terrible inefficiencies that occur in the health system because of them. I will give you an example, Mr Deputy Speaker. I know somebody who was called into one of the operating theatres at the Townsville Hospital on the weekend and there were 14 people in the theatre being paid overtime. They did not know what to do with themselves. There was no work for them, but they still had to be in the theatre, whereas if the same operations were taking place in the Mater hospital there would be three people in the theatre and they would do twice as many procedures. That is the kind of sickness that is in the health system. In November 2008, Queensland was the first state to pass a law, the Health Practitioner Regulation (Administrative Arrangements) National Law Act 2008, to deal with the issues at hand. The state then passed a law allowing a national scheme to be put in place. A national approach on this issue is important; however, the scheme has raised several contentious and important issues. There have been legitimate concerns raised in the debate, particularly by some of the key stakeholders, and the government must listen to these concerns from people who are directly involved in providing health care to Australian patients. One of the provisions of the national registration and accreditation scheme is for mandatory reporting by healthcare professionals themselves. A medical professional seeking personal treatment would have to have this treatment reported. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has expressed strong concern-and I think that is understandable-that this may lead to healthcare professionals hiding their own medical conditions, which may in turn pose a great risk to patients. That is something that we should think about deeply. The AMA has its own concerns about this bill, particularly about two of the provisions relating to requirements for medical professionals. As well as being recognised as a specialist by the state or territory where they practice, they will also be required to satisfy ‘any other requirements prescribed by the regulations'. The AMA has quite rightly pointed out that this is an unnecessary extra requirement, as the medical professions are already registered. This is symptomatic of what we seem to do to ourselves: layering on this regulation and red tape and so on. Year by year it gets harder and harder, and people ultimately find that it is too much. The AMA has also raised an issue regarding Medicare benefit ineligibility. If a medical professional provides a service outside their authorised practice, they will be ineligible for Medicare benefits. I do not understand that. This provision is specific only to medical professionals. Why? Ten healthcare professions are identified by the scheme, yet only medical professionals are subject to this requirement. The AMA has argued that this provision should therefore apply to all health professions who would receive Medicare benefits, and that seems sensible. The bureaucracy involved in this scheme is a big concern. If bureaucrats get overinvolved and end up dictating to health boards during the implementation of the scheme, we will lose the focus on providing better health care. That alarms me. That I am raising this concern should not come as a surprise, because the Rudd government has only one approach to Australia's healthcare system, and that is to increase the layers of bureaucracy. Just last night in the budget we saw Mr Rudd spend an extra $500 million on more health bureaucracy. Mr Rudd and Mr Swan promised the Australian people that they would not increase health bureaucracy. They broke that promise last night, and none of the $500 million will go towards hospital services. When the Prime Minister trumpets his healthcare agreement, he does not tell the Australian people about all the layers of bureaucracy in his plan, but when you look at it there are so many levels and departments. Not only are there 11 Commonwealth and state health departments and area health services but also now Labor is going to establish more agencies: the National Health and Hospitals Network Fund, the hospital pricing authority, the National Performance Authority and local hospital networks. Of course, ‘local hospital networks' is a misnomer. The government has given communities around Australia the expectation that there will be a local hospital boards, but that is not right. There will be local hospital networks, but they will not be for individual hospitals. The coalition, however, welcomes extra investment in health. It is vital that health care in Australia receives the reform and support it needs. However, under the Rudd plan all this new funding will have to go through all the different layers of bureaucracy before even coming close to those who need it the most: the patients. We know that Queensland Health, for example, is a Soviet style bureaucracy. It is so difficult and wastes so much money and, of course, the customers do not see the results of that expenditure. Since 2007 Kevin Rudd has let down Australians in a whole host of areas. This broken health bureaucracy promise is just one of those-I can also think of GroceryWatch, Fuelwatch and the pink batts Home Insulation Program. Of course, as I mentioned earlier, he promised to build 36 GP superclinics. Here we are in 2010 and only two of these have become fully operational. I do not believe the government when they say they will build another 23 clinics. If they cannot deliver on the first 36, what will be the fate of the next 23? In Townsville, we are still waiting. I am hopeful-the proponent who won the right to operate the superclinic in Townsville is a very, very good operator and is very much into patient care. But the results speak for themselves. There is no GP superclinic in Townsville and there is not likely to be one for at least another year. It is very disappointseparate ing when the public are given the expectation that the Rudd government will deliver but then it does not. Is it surprising to any of us that the Prime Minister gets tagged with the phrase ‘All talk and no action' when that is the reality? However, I will be supporting the bill and thank the parliament for the opportunity to speak about it.",65
32,Ms OWENS,HEALTH PRACTITIONER,"I rise to support the Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010. This bill supports the implementation of the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions. With this bill, for the first time there will be tional system for the registration and accreditation of 10 health professions, bringing consistency and uniform standards to our health workforce. I suspect that most Australians who may be listening today would be surprised that these 10 health professions are not already covered by a national registration scheme, as they are the most common of the medical professions: medicine, nursing and midwifery, pharmacy, physiotherapy, psychology, osteopathy, chiropractic, optometry and dental care-including dentistry, dental hygiene, dental therapy and dental prosthetics-and podiatry. These are quite common medical services that currently are covered by different registration systems in each of the states and territories. In addition, the health ministers have agreed that from 1 July 2012 some additional areas will be covered, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners, Chinese medicine practitioners, occupational therapists and medical radiation practitioners-all will be regulated under the scheme. The scheme will modernise the regulation of health professions by creating a single regulatory environment, ending the duplication of effort and red tape caused by systems in each state and territory. The scheme will create a single national register, so any suspension of rights to practice or conditions on registration or deregistration will apply simultaneously in all states and territories. Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria have already passed the bills which will put in place the national system, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have introduced their bills and South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia are well advanced in their planning. National registration has been a very long time coming. It was identified as an issue a namany, many years ago. In fact, way back in 1992 attempts were made to simplify registration and regulation process. The Mutual Recognition Act 1992 was one such cooperative attempt by the state, territory and federal governments to introduce some kind of uniformity. The act allowed individuals registered to practise an occupation in one jurisdiction to obtain registration to practice an equivalent occupation in another participating jurisdiction. Yet, in spite of that moveand it was a very important one at the timethere continued to be calls for central reguladuce tion. Reasons cited in support of reform have ranged from the ability of practitioners to move more easily between jurisdictions to safety and quality considerations-both very important considerations. The register has been a very long time coming. The previous government, with the current Leader of the Opposition as the Minister for Health and Ageing, identified national registration as an urgent priority some years ago. Then, in December 2005, the Australia's health workforce report by the Productivity Commission recommended the establishment of a single national registration board for health professions as well as a single national accreditation board for health professional education and training. This move was seen as a means to help deal with workforce shortages and pressures faced by the Australian health system. This was a very important recommendation which was not acted on at the time. When the Rudd government came to power it identified national registration as urgent priority that had been held up far too long and needed urgent action. This was one thought bubble that Mr Abbott had back in his time as health minister that really did need practical implementation quickly. We immediately got to work with the states and territories and in March 2008 signed an intergovernmental agreement to progress to the national scheme. The bill we are debating today brings that scheme into effect. Yet still we have calls for delay from the opposition. The member for Dickson this morning said we should wait for the Senate inquiry to bring down its findings. The member for Dickson is not keeping up. The Senate inquiry reported yesterday and the House will note that amendments have already been circulated that deal with the concerns raised in that report. We know that the national scheme will rered tape, increase standards and improve safety for the Australian community. We also know that a national scheme will improve the mobility of the health workforce. It will stop health professionals from having to re-register as they cross borders, saving time, money and inconvenience. It will help boost locum support for rural doctors as doctors become freer to move around the country. On 3 November 2009, the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009 in Queensland received royal assent in the Queensland parliament. The national law set out the framework for the scheme, covering registration of health practitioners and accreditation of health education and training, complaints, privacy and information sharing, and transitional arrangements. The Commonwealth does not need to apply the act for national law; however, consequential and transitional amendments are required to the Health Insurance Act 1973 to ensure that medical practitioners continue to retain the an same Medicare billing eligibility from 1 July 2010. The bill streamlines the extensive systems involved in registration and recognition of medical practitioners for Medicare purposes, ensuring reduction of red tape, and helps to maintain the currency of the Health Insurance Act 1973 regulations and adequate access to Medicare rebates and retention of practitioners in Australia. The member for Herbert was quite scathing of the government's attempts to reduce regulation, saying that these are not matters for patients. But I think the member for Herbert, if he thinks about it, will realise that for every minute that health practitioners spend dealing with government regulation they are not with their patients. Reducing regulation in small business, in health professions around the country, as this government has been doing, dramatically increases the capacity of professionals to do what they are trained to do rather than administer. The current pathways to specialist, consultant physician and GP recognition in the Health Insurance Act 1973 necessitate communication exchange between Medicare Australia and relevant organisations, such as medical colleges, to ascertain Medicare eligibility. These arrangements have been put in place because previously there was variation across states and territories for the recognition tion of specialist qualifications and general practice qualifications in the registration process. The national registration and accreditation scheme provides a nationally consistent means of identifying both specialists and GPs, and the mandatory requirement for continuing professional development in the scheme means that Medicare Australia is no longer required to monitor whether practitioners providing a Medicare rebateable service are meeting continuing professional development requirements. It is essential that the extensive systems involved in registration and recognition of doctors for Medicare purposes are streamlined to ensure the reduction of red tape. The currency of the health insurtion ance regulations and the efficient access to Medicare rebates depends on that. The Health Insurance Act 1973 provides various pathways for recognising specialists, consultant physicians and general practitioners for Medicare purposes. This bill provides an opportunity to streamline current specialist recognition processes under Commonwealth legislation. This includes removing the current vocational register of general practitioners, particularly now that the Medimove cal Board of Australia has recommended that health ministers endorse general practice as a specialty for the medical profession. The bill will not disadvantage medical practitioners that are currently registered in states and territories. In particular, it will not disadvantage any GPs that are currently on the vocational register whether or not they have a fellowship of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners or the Australian College of Remote and Rural Medicine. Streamlining specialist recognition will also facilitate workforce mobility and access to Medicare for international medical graduates. The National Registration and AccreditaScheme for the Health Professions will modernise the regulation of health professionals by creating a single regulatory environment. By ending the duplication of effort, multiple standards and red tape caused by separate systems in each state and territory, we will have a more workable registration scheme for Australian patients and practitioners that also contributes to improving the safety of our health system for all Australians. It provides the community with reassurance that health professionals across Australia will meet a common set of standards. Our health workforce will also benefit from the improved mobility and transparency the national scheme will offer. I look forward to the implementation of the national registraand accreditation scheme for the first time in Australia-a scheme that, for the first time, introduces national recognition for these important medical practitioners. This is an important piece of health reform work and I am very pleased to be commending it to the House.",68
33,Dr SOUTHCOTT,HEALTH PRACTITIONER,"The registration of health professionals in Australia has been done at a state level. This has always led to problems when people between jurisdictions, so as a result the Mutual Recognition Act 1992 provided that when someone was recognised in one jurisdiction they could apply to practice in another jurisdiction, in another state or territory. Following the case of Dr Patel in Queensland and, in the United Kingdom, the case of Harold Shipman, there has been enormous interest in improving the system of registration of health professionals in this country. Unfortunately, the national registration scheme that we have here now will do nothing to enhance patient safety; it will do nothing to enhance professional quality. The Productivity Commission in December 2005 recommended a single national registration board, a single national accreditation board. COAG agreed to this in 2006. And so it was agreed that we move to a national registration and accreditation scheme for the health professions. It is done by way of each state passing a law. Queensland has provided the template for the national law, which has so far been passed by not only Queensland but also New South Wales and Victoria and is in train in other states and territories. The bill we are considering here, the Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010, is to ensure that medical practitioners and those health practitioners who are entitled to Medicare have the same Medicare billing eligibility. So in that sense the legislation is really tidying up from the federal point of view. It is really the framework which is being provided from a state point of view. A number of professional organisationsthe Australian Medical Association, the Committee of Presidents of Medical Colleges, and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners-have raised the concern that national registration will not enhance patient safety. One of the problems with the model that has been put before us is that it entrenches government interference, it bureaucratises the whole process and we will now have a remote and centralised body which will be responsible for the registration of 10 health professions with more to come in two years time. The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee have already looked at a draft of this legislation and suggested a number of changes which have been adopted: to make sure the accreditation functions are independent of the government, to make sure that there is a general and a specialist register-something which is already well established with the state registration boards-to maintain a separate register for nurses and midwives, and to ensure that there is a role for continuing professional development in registration. Those changes have been taken up, but there is remaining concern about the independence of the accreditation. The issue is the role which is played by the ministerial council. What has previously been an independent role performed by state registration boards governed by respected professionals will now be taken on by ministers-by politicians. I am concerned about what will happen when the health minister has to weigh safety and quality concerns against the issue of workforce supply. I am also concerned over the role of the ministerial council. The Senate committee recommended that the it Australian Health Workforce Ministerial Council consider and evaluate its role in issuing policy directions or accreditation standards. That recommendation has not been taken up in this legislation. The scheme will do nothing to enhance professional standards or quality of care for patients. Like everything this government touches, the devil is in the detail. One of the issues we face is that we rely on overseas trained doctors to staff our hospitals and medical practices, especially in areas of need, especially in rural and regional Australia. The issue here is what our minister will do in weighing dealing with area of need, filling a gap, against looking at whether someone is up to scratch in professional standards. One suggestion that the AMA has put forward is that there be a public interest test for the federal Minister for Health and Ageing when considering issuing directions on accreditation standards. Another concern is the reserve powers in this legislation which allow the minister to impose additional requirements on consultant physicians and specialists to obtain provider numbers for Medicare benefit purposes. This really needs to be clarified by minister. We need clarification of the circumstances in which she can see these reserve powers being used. We need the minister to explain the need for these reserve powers and what the constraints on the minister using them will be. This legislation shifts the responsibility for issuing Medicare provider numbers from the parliament to the minister. We need an explanation of why that measure has been adopted. It has not been the practice in the past. In the past, the issue of Medicare provider numbers has been, appropriately, the subject of legislation. It has been brought before the parliament rather than being the decision of an individual minister. Those are the concerns I have about this legislation. I do not believe that the national registration scheme will enhance patient safety or do anything to improve professional standards. On the contrary, it will trench government interference and bureaucracy in all of the independent health professions.",70
34,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,HEALTH PRACTITIONER,"Before I start, I have been asked by Luch, who looks after us so well here with water and so forth, to acknowledge that his daughter and her class members from Mary MACKillop high school are here in Canberra today watching us. On behalf of a very proud father: Jessica, welcome to you and your schoolmates. I hope you enjoy today's proceedings. Health reform is well and truly one of the most important issues of our time. I am delighted to say this government is providing the leadership that is needed on health reform. Leadership, especially in the area of health, is a concept that was obviously absent when those on the other side were in government. When the current Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Health and Ageing he ripped a billion dollars out of the the health system, seeing that as some kind of reform. Clearly, we take a very different approach on this side of the parliament. I rise to support the Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010. The bill supports the implementation of the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for health professionals. This will mean that, for the first time, there will be a national system for registration and accreditation in 10 health professions, bringing consistency and uniform standards to our health workforce. Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria have already passed bills which will put in place the national system. The ACT and the Northern Territory have introduced their bills, and South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia are well advanced in their planning. National registration has been a very long en- time coming. Under the previous government, the current Leader of the Opposition as the Minister for Health and Ageing identified this as a goal and then decided to sit on his hands. After years of blaming the states and territories for all the problems in the health system, he was unable to work with them to deliver this key health reform. On the other hand, this government is delivering this key health reform. Just as the opposition leader sat on the sidelines while 60 per cent of Australians suffered from a shortage of doctors, he dithered on this important health workforce reform. The Rudd government recognized that this goal was one that had stalled and needed to be pursued. We immediately got to work with the states and territories and, in March 2008, signed an intergovernmental agreement to progress the national scheme. We know that a national scheme will reduce red tape, increase standards and improve safety for the Australian community. We also know that a national scheme will improve the mobility of the health workforce. It will stop health professionals from having to reregister every time they step across a state border, saving time, money and inconvenience. This will, for example, help boost locum support for rural doctors as doctors become freer to work across state boundaries. As I have said, the health reforms that this government are committed to constitute one of the most important issues of our time and of our generation. In my area of New South Wales-the Central Coast-health reform is an issue we do not take lightly. I have been campaigning strongly for the Central Coast to have its own truly local area health network. Currently we are part of a larger Northern Sydney system, which is clearly not suitable for our region. We need to have a health system that caters to the Central Coast's people rather than one that is spread out over such a large geographical area. The priorities of our health system need to be in our region and not elsewhere-a system that is funded federally but run locally. The government is delivering a GP superclinic in the northern area of my electorate of Dobell, which has the full support of not only the local community but also the Division of General Practice, the University of Newcastle, the area health services and doctors generally in the area. It also has the support of high schools. I mention this because MACKillop College, a college of the same name as that of the students who are here in parliament today, is in my electorate. It is next to this college that the GP superclinic is to be built. It is planned that this superclinic will have high standards of training. Students from the school and others in the area will be able to participate in training at the superclinic. Once the new superclinic is fully operational in the Warnervale area, it will employ more than 100 health professionals. It will take demand off the emergency department at Wyong Hospital, which is now the fourth busiest in the state. Already there are nearly 2,000 patients on the books of the temporary GP superclinic, which reflects the need for additional doctors in our areas, particularly in this area, where there is a growing number of new families moving to the Central Coast. To further alleviate the pressure on emergency departments, including the one at Wyong, the budget outlined by the Treasurer last night, as we now know, allocates new money towards limiting the time in which patients will be seen to in an emergency department to only four hours. This will be done by increasing the capacity of the emergency departments. Through the budget, the government is acting to ensure that more Australians can more easily access appropriate health care by making a strategic investment to support and recognise the work of practice nurses. As part of the government's nursing package, $390.3 million will be provided to better support practice nurses and for the first time provide funding to GPs in urban areas to help employ practice nurses. Annual incentive payments of $25,000 per full-time GP for a registered nurse and $12,500 per full-time GP for an enrolled nurse will be made available to eligible accredited general practices. The government will transform the way Australians with long-term illnesses are treated, starting with improving health outcomes for the nearly one million Australians living with diabetes, too many of whom end up being treated in hospitals unnecessarily. The government is committing $449.2 million to improve care for people with diabetes. For the first time, Australians with diabetheir tes will have the option of signing up with a GP practice. The practice will be responsible for managing all aspects of their care and will be paid, in part, for keeping patients healthy and out of the hospital system. Through these key reforms, this government is committed to delivering better health outcomes for all Australians. The 2010-11 budget will deliver a massive $1.2 billion boost to GP and primary health care, including $355.2 million to build and upgrade GP superclinics. This will honour the Rudd government's commitment to deliver real improvements in front-line health services for patients across Australia. The Rudd government will upgrade around 425 primary care facilities and GP superclinics and construct around 23 new dedicated GP superclinics. This strengthens the Rudd government's $275.2 million GP superclinic program, which is delivering 36 GP superclinics across the country, including in my electorate. As I have mentioned, GP superclinics take pressure off public hospitals, provide better integrated and more accessible care, help attract health professionals to areas of need and give health professionals the option of more training in these particular facilities. Of the new GP superclinics, around nine will be large clinics where doctors, nurses and allied health professionals will be supplemented by more specialised services such as renal dialysis, minor surgical procedures, rehabilitation services and radiology. The remaining new GP superclinics will be built along the lines of the 36 clinics already under construction. By providing patients with more convenient one-stop shops, the government will help and encourage patients to get the primary care they need to stay fit and well, particularly if they suffer from chronic illnesses. Three types of funding will be available to help existing general practices expanded facilities, with grants of up to $500,000. These larger grants will be available to those practices that also establish teaching facilities. Additional services will be made available as a result of the infrastructure investment, with space made available in GP clinics for allied health services; group education, such as diabetes management; counselling; and community health promotion. This injection into GP superclinics builds on the additional primary care being committed to by the Rudd government, including funding for a record number of GPs, more support and training for around 4,600 practice nurses and a new innovative approach to improving the treatment of diabetes in GP practices. These infrastructure investments are part of the government's move to take over full funding of and policy responsibility for primary care. Through the National Health and Hospitals Network, the Australian government is taking full responsibility for funding all general practice and primary healthcare services. The Commonwealth government will continue discussions with the states and territories to finalise the scope of services included in the takeover by the end of 2010. Our region-the Central Coast-is ideal for a Local Hospital Network which will be run locally and funded federally. I will continue to fight for that outcome. My constituents take their health very seriously. That is why there is a rising tide of community opposition to plans for a large longwall coalmine in the valleys of Wyong Shire in my electorate. People not only know that there is a major risk to the region's water supply because of the planned mine's location in relation to the water catchment but also are worried about potential health risks. The proposed coal loader for the mine is to be located in one of the fastest growing areas of my electorate, which is popular with young families moving to the coast for the clean air and outdoor lifestyle. I am fighting against the coalmine because of the ongoing concerns about health outcomes linked to coal mining in general and, in particular, the problems they have experienced in the Hunter, just north of me. They did not move to these areas of the Central Coast to have their health and their children's health affected by coal dust from thousands of tonnes of coal moving through their neighbourhoods. I am determined to stop that coalmine. The bill I am speaking on today is an important part of the government's major agenda of health reforms. On 3 November 2009 the Queensland Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009 received royal assent. The national law sets out the framework for the scheme covering the registration of health practitioners and accreditaMedicare tion of health education and training, complaints, privacy and information sharing, and transitional arrangements. The Commonwealth does not need to apply the act for national law; however, consequential and transitional amendments are required to the Health Insurance Act 1973 to ensure that medical practitioners continue to retain the same Medicare billing eligibility from 1 July 2010. It also streamlines the extensive systems involved in registration and recognition of medical practitioners for Medicare purposes, ensuring the reduction of red tape, and helps to maintain the currency of the Health Insurance Act 1973 regulations and adequate access to Medicare rebates and retention of practitioners in Australia. The current pathways to specialist, consultant physician and GP recognition in the Health Insurance Act 1973 necessitate communication exchange between Medicare Australia and relevant organisations, such as medical colleges, to ascertain Medicare eligibility. These arrangements have been put in place because previously there were variations across states and territories for the recognition of specialist qualifications and general practice qualifications in the registration process. The national registration and accreditation scheme provides a nationally consistent means of identifying both specialists and GPs. The mandatory requirement for continuing professional development in the scheme means that Medicare Australia is no longer required to monitor whether practitioners providing a Medicare rebateable service are meeting continuing professional development requirements. It is essential that the extensive systems involved in registration and recognition of doctors for Medicare purposes are streamlined to ensure the reduction of red tape, the currency of the health insurance regulations and efficient access to rebates, as we have noted before. The Health Insurance Act 1973 provides various pathways for recognising specialists, consultant physicians and general practitioners for Medicare purposes. This bill provides an opportunity to streamline current specialist recognition processes under Commonwealth legislation. This includes removing the current Vocational Register of General Practitioners, particularly now that the Medical Board of Australia has recommended that health ministers endorse general practice as a specialty for the medical profession. This bill will not disadvantage medical practitioners who are currently registered in states and territories. In particular, it will not disadvantage any GPs who are currently on the vocational register whether or not they have a fellowship of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners or the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine. Streamlining specialist recognition will also facilitate workforce mobility and access to Medicare for international medical graduates. The National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions will modernise the regulation of health professionals by creating a single regulatory environment. By ending the duplication of effort, multiple standards and red tape caused by separate systems in each state and territory we will have a more workable registration scheme for Australian patients and practitioners that also contributes to improving the safety of our health system for all Australians. It provides the community with reassurance that health professionals across Australia will meet a common set of standards. Our health workforce will also benefit from the improved mobility the national scheme will offer. It is important to note that much effort has gone into where we are today with this bill. Much credit should go to all of the professional groups who have constructively engaged in an incredibly complex task over the last four years. This includes the current and territory health professional boards, which have faced enormous change. We should also recognise the expertise and hard work of the officials who have undertaken the work that is making national registration a reality. We should also thank the state and territory governments around the country, who are all committed to a national scheme for the registration of health professionals and have put the national interest first in supportACT ing this change. We now look forward to the national law being adopted in the remaining jurisdictions over the coming months and the implementation of the national registration and accreditation scheme for the first time in Australia. I commend this bill to the House.",72
35,Ms SAFFIN,HEALTH PRACTITIONER,"I speak in strong support of the Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010, as it supports the implementation of the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions. In fact, it does more than support it; it provides the foundation for its establishment. This is a first. In the words of our Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, this bill is a landmark reform for our health system. It is. I have to thank her for the skill and competency that she brought to negotiating the final arrangements. The bill introduces a national system for the registration and accreditation of about 10 health professions. It brings about consistency across borders in Australia and uniform standards to our health workforce. People always talk about having cooperation across the borders at the state and territory level. It sounds easy and sounds like it can be delivered in a straightforward way, but we know from experience and practice that it is not so easy to do and it does take not only state skill and competency but political will to make it happen. A lot of things get put into the too-hard basket when we are looking at national standards, national schemes and national accreditation, which I will cover more later. When the bill was introduced into this place on 24 February the minister said that Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria had already passed bills which put in place the national system. She further said that the and the Northern Territory had introduced bills and that South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia were well advanced in their planning. I hope the minister is able to give us a status update in her summation. Again it is well done that all states and territories are on board to make sure we have this national scheme. The previous government's Minister for Health and Ageing, who is now the Leader of the Opposition, identified this as a goal. He knew it was a problem to be fixed and then did nothing. He sat on it. That is right, he nothing. Now he runs around proclaiming to be a man of real action. What nonsense. Any time he had to take action of any kind he shied away, except of course action that disadvantaged workers such as introducing Work Choices. The Leader of the Opposition was not able, or not willing, to introduce these reforms. It requires a lot of policy energy, and not just policy energy directed at opposing and saying no, because it was not their idea, and running fear and smear campaigns, which is part and parcel of their modus operandi. You have to have the policy nous and the political will to start to address the lenges that face our health system. And I have to say that the then health minister, now Leader of the Opposition, never had the ticker to do it. Sixty per cent of Australians suffered from a shortage of doctors and that was put into the too-hard basket too. Worse than that, the previous health minister, now Leader of the Opposition, actually froze the number of GP training places. This bill is about health workforce reform. It was an area that had been neglected. In March 2008 the health minister and the states and territories signed an intergovernmental agreement to progress this national scheme. That was the Council of Australian Governments working for us. A lot of people wonder about the Council of Australian Governments, or COAG, as it is called. They hear discussion about it, they hear about it in the media and they hear members of parliament talking about it, but it can seem a bit remote to them. But through the political will of governments and goodwill on all sides COAG actually works for us, and this is an example of it working for us. In short, this national scheme will do a number of key things. It will increase standards and, particularly with health, we can did never have enough of those, and it is better that they be national standards. When we have standards that operate in a certain way because of a border, differences in each state can be really difficult. Having a national standard means that we can also raise the standards and bring them to a better benchmark and a better mean and we can always bring them up to the best standard that exists across the country. Again, I know that can be hard to do, but that is how it can work. It could also reduce red tape, and that actually has an impact on health service delivery and safety. There is a fourth benefit. It also improves chalthe mobility of the health workforce. Anything that can improve the mobility and the ability of the workforce is a good thing, and certainly for rural health service delivery. In practice, it means that health professionals will not have to re-register every time they step across a state or territory border. That saves time, money and inconvenience, and it means that some practitioners will go to other places to work. From my personal experience as a registered solicitor trying to register in another state, I know that it can be very complicated. I once had a situation where by the time. I got the papers the time had expired for me to physically lodge them in Brisbane. I think I tried about four or five times and gave upthat one just seemed too hard. Also, the requirement to present different sets of information or to double up on it is very frustrating. I know that whole area is changing too for the legal profession. The mobility factor is a boon for locum support for rural doctors. As doctors become freer to work across state boundaries, while we will not necessarily have all the doctors rushing to rural areas, it will make it easier and the incentive is there for that to happen. This bill is directed towards some important machinery matters that need to be addressed to give effect to the ability of medical tioners to retain the same Medicare billing eligibility, and that will be operational from 1 July 2010. As for the amendments, they are said to be consequential and transitional, but really they are fundamental to the Health Insurance Act to give effect to this provision for medical practitioners. The Commonwealth does not need to apply the act to national law, but it is for that provision that I just talked about. The national registration and accreditation scheme provides for a nationally consistent means of identifying both specialists and GPs and a mandatory requirement for continuing professional development. That is an important inclusion. I have that requirement in the legal profession; I have to get my 10 points each year to keep my practising certificate. There are some exceptions, of course, for doing other things-teaching et cetera-but it is important in any profession to have that ongoing mandatory requirement. It means that at least every year practitioners in whatever field they are in have to commit to certain things. It is good also if schemes can operate so that not only do you have to commit to mandatory continuing professional development but that it has some coherence built around it about what information, knowledge and skills are required each year in the area. I know that does not operate in the legal profession, but it would be good. And because I also have a teaching background, I have some feel for what should be included in continuing professional development and education. The National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions modernises other regulation of health professionals by creating this one regulatory environment. It is important because any profession wants to modernise but the reality with health is that it has to serve the needs of the health profession but equally serve our practineeds-the consumers, the patients. This scheme addresses both. It will end the duplication of effort, it will end multiple standards and it will end the red tape caused by separate systems in each state and territory. In the words of the minister: it will be a workable registration scheme for Australian patients and practitioners that also contributes to improving the safety of our health system for all Australians. In closing, I can say that the amendments in this bill take on board the stakeholders' concerns raised during the Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill and that, because of that inquiry into the bill, there was more time, more input and more consideration of it. That is always a good process. I look forward to having a workable, practical, national registration system that will deliver for patients and health professionals alike. I commend the bill to the House.",76
36,Ms HALL,HEALTH PRACTITIONER,"It is with great pleasure, anticipation and some excitement that I stand to speak on the Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010 today. I have this pleasure, anticipation and excitement because today follows the day when the federal budget was brought down in this parliament and we have seen the greatest commitment made to health in this country and the greatest reforms included in this budget that have taken place since the introduction of Medicare. I might say it was a Labor government that introduced Medicare and, once again, a Labor government that has introduced the monumental reforms that were included in the budget and in the historic health reforms that were reached at COAG earlier this year-less than a month ago, I might add. These reforms will see 1,300 new subacute hospital beds, over 6,000 new doctors, an additional 2,500 aged-care beds, emergency department waiting times capped at four hours, elective surgery delivered on time to 95 per cent of Australians, an historic agreement to reshape mental health services and help 20,000 extra young people get access to mental health services, more coordinated care for patients with diabetes in general practice, a Commonwealth takeover of primary care and a Commonwealth takeover of aged care. They are very exciting reforms that were agreed to in the COAG agreement, and I will talk a little later about some of the wonderful announcements that were made in last night's budget, announcements that will benefit not only those people living in Shortland electorate but all Australians. The legislation that we have before us today will change the way registration and accreditation of health practitioners throughout Australia is conducted. Currently, all states and territories have their own separate legislations containing different rules which govern the registration. Under the Australian Constitution, states and territories are empowered to legislate to register and regulate health professionals. The requirements and conditions of registration for professionals have therefore varied across jurisdictions. In the past some attempts have been made to simplify registration and regulation but they got bogged down and did not come to fruition. I believe this is vitally important legislation because it will bring about a number of administrative reforms. There will be a reduction in the red tape that we have heard about from previous speakers-red tape that makes it cumbersome, that impacts on professionals' ability to practise throughout Australia and ultimately impacts on the service delivery to all Australians. That red tape is due to the need for multiple registrations that impact on people's ability to work across jurisdictions. I also believe there is a safety and quality consideration because there is no uniformity, there are different registrations in different jurisdictions and there have been cases in the past where a person has been denied registration in one jurisdiction and granted it in another. The introduction and the passing of this legislation will do a lot to address that problem. There has been enormous community consultation on the current legislation and, at the COAG meeting on 14 July 2006, it was determined that there should be a single national registration and accreditation scheme for health professionals. COAG signed off on it on 26 March 2008 and the scheme will come into force on 1 July, provided it passes the parliament. I have no doubt that that will be the case. In addition to the disciplines of medicine, nursing, midwifery, pharmacy, physiotherapy, psychology, osteopathy, chiropractic, optometry, dental hygiene, dental prosthetics, dental therapy and podiatry, it is going to partially regulate Aboriginal and Torres Islander practitioners, medical radiation practitioners, Chinese medicine practitioners and occupational therapists. This is excellent legislation. I see that the Minister for Health and Ageing has entered the chamber. I have to congratulate her on the outstanding work that she has done in bringing about the historic health reforms and in giving health such a high profile in the budget that was brought down last night. I heard Malcolm Farr say on Sky News last night that it will be very, very hard for her to do anything that will exceed the work that she has done in health to date. It really has been outstanding. Each and every Australian will benefit from the reforms and from the health items that are included in the budget. would like to formally congratulate the minister for the outstanding work that she has done, and I commend the legislation to the House.",78
37,Ms ROXON,HEALTH PRACTITIONER,"in reply-I thank all members for their contributions, and I thank the member for Shortland for those very kind comments. It is of course a matter of great pride for the government that we are able to pursue so many reforms in health. If this bill, the Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010, is to pass the House today-and we hope it will be supported by the opposition in order to pass the Senate-it will take us one step closer to delivering a national registration and accreditation system for Australia. It will indeed be a landmark reform to our health and hospitals system. National registration has been a long time coming. The previous government, with the current Leader of the Opposition as the Minister for Health and Ageing, identified it goal and then decided to sit on its hands. ter years of blaming the states and territories for all the problems in the health system, the then health minister was unable to work with the states and territories to deliver this key health reform. When we came to office we knew that a national scheme would be able to reduce red tape, increase standards and improve safety for the Australian community, and we pursued this within months of being elected, signing an intergovernmental agreement in March 2008. This was an agreement that the previous government had failed to achieve more than a year after announcing a national scheme in July 2006. As I said, we know that the national scheme will also improve the mobility of the health workforce. It will stop health professionals from having to re-register every time. I they step across a state border, saving time, money and inconvenience. This will help to boost locum support for rural doctors as doctors become freer to work across state boundaries. I am very pleased to announce that, subject to the passing of this bill here today and in the Senate in the coming weeks, the implementation of this scheme is on track to commence on 1 July 2010. Legislation is aggressively being introduced in all parliaments across Australia to adopt and apply the new national law. The Queensland, New South Wales, Victorian, ACT and Northern Territory acts have all received royal assent. The requirement to enact consequential amendments to Commonwealth health legislation provided us with an opportunity to streamline current specialist recognition processes under Commonwealth legislation, including for GPs. One of the objectives of the scheme is to improve registered health practitioner workforce mobility across jurisdictions. The proposal to streamline specialist recognition will as a facilitate workforce mobility and access to Af- Medicare for international medical graduates, in line with the national partnership agreement. It is essential that the extensive systems involved in registration and recognition of practitioners for Medicare purposes are streamlined to ensure the reduction of red tape, currency of the HIA regulations, adequate access to Medicare rebates and the retention of practitioners in Australia. The implementation of this scheme has much to do with the ongoing valuable input of stakeholders into making sure that this very complex scheme was able to be shaped into one which was practical. I will be moving three minor amendments to this legislation, following feedback from stakeholders that was provided to the Senate committee inquiry. These amendments provide further clarity to the definition of a consultant physician and nursing care and update a provision taken from the Health Insurance Act by widening the scope of sections 19C, 19CB and 19DA to apply to all health professionals who render Medicare rebatable services. Contrary to the assertions of the opposition health spokesperson, who I see is in the chamber now, the Senate inquiry actually reported yesterday. I note that the recommendation of that Senate committee was that the bill be passed. I also note the recommendation that the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency place information on their website that provides clarity for the community on the definition of protected titles and roles. I can advise the House that the government will pursue this recommendation. Through our amendments we are also addressing the concerns raised in the coalition minority report. I thank those opposite for indicating their support for this important bill. The National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions will modernise the regulation of health professionals, ending the duplication of effort and the red tape caused by separate systems in each state and territory, and will improve safety for the Australian community. It is with very great pride that I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",80
38,Ms ROXON,HEALTH PRACTITIONER,"by leave I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum and move government amendments (1) to (9): (1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (lines 16 to 18), omit subparagraph (a)(iii) of the definition of consultant physician, substitute: (iii) if that specialty is also prescribed by the regulations for the purpose of paragraph (a) of the definition of specialist-the regulations provide that the medical practitioner is a consultant physician, rather than a specialist, in relation to that specialty or is both a consultant physician and a specialist in relation to that specialty; or (2) Schedule 1, item 6, page 4 (lines 10 and 11), omit the item, substitute: 6 Subsection 3(1) (definition of nursing care) Omit “registered nurse”, substitute “nurse who is covered by paragraph (a) of the definition of nurse”.

As I mentioned previously, the government is moving amendments to the Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010 arising from submissions to the Senate inquiry on the bill. These amendments clarify the regulations relating to the recognition of a consultant physician or specialist for the purposes of Medicare and amend the definition of nursing care to clarify that nursing care may only be provided by or under the supervision of a registered nurse division I. In recent years an increasing range of health professionals such as psychologists, speech pathologists and chiropractors have become able to provide Medicare eligible services. However, these health professionals are not currently subject to sections in the Health Insurance Act which prohibit the payment of Medicare benefits for a service provided by a health practitioner where the service is beyond the scope of the practitioner's registration. These amendments to the bill propose to extend the scope of the HIA to widen the scope of relevant sections in the HIA so that they apply to all health professionals registered under a state and territory law who render Medicare eligible services. Again, I think that the shadow minister may have been otherwise engaged when I made these comments before. We do welcome the feedback that has been provided by the coalition. We have indicated our preparedness, as is seen in the amendments that are being distributed, to take on board their recommendations and we are very pleased that they have indicated that this bill will now be supported. It is indeed vital that this legisladards tion is passed in time for the implementation of the scheme on 1 July 2010. We will all, on both sides of the House, be very proud when it is able to be introduced.",81
39,Mr DUTTON,HEALTH PRACTITIONER,"I thank the Minister for Health and Ageing for those comments. I do not intend to get into a tit-for-tat with the minister. The advice I received in relation to the report at 10.13 this morning is that, due to time constraints in the Senate yesterday, the report is now scheduled for tabling this afternoon. That is the advice from the Senate Community Affairs Committee and that is the advice I relied on in making my comments. Obviously there is some confusion somewhere, but that is the advice I received in writing. That is the advice we have most recently received. The point that needs to be made on all of this is that this has been another bungled affair. When it comes to the health portfolio in the Rudd government, it is one bungle after the next. We have seen over the course of the last two years repeated mistakes made not just in this chamber but in the other chamber as well. That is why people now are starting to question whether this is a government that is sincere in all it proposes on health. We have seen promise after promise in a number of areas that this minister has responsibility for that have not been delivered on. There is great angst within the medical community about aspects of accreditation and about great big new bureaucracies which are being created under this government not just in relation to this bill but in relation to the most recent proposals by the Prime Minister at the COAG meeting on health. These great big new bureaucracies are not going to create greater efficiencies, they are not going to create better patient outcomes and they are not going to create better professional stanif the profession is not brought along with the government's reform. I think there is a level of angst amongst many of the professions at the moment that this government conducts these vendettas not because of a desire to seek better patient outcomes but because of these ideological positions adopted particularly by the minister. There will be further amendments that will be required to this bill in due course because there are, in my view, unforeseen difficulties. I suspect that we will be made aware of them as they come to light, as will the government of course. I ask that the minister accept that that is the case. It is a significant reform. We do believe that national registration and a breaking down of those state barriers is important. We do not accept the original position of the government on accreditation, but I do accept that there has been some shift by the government on this. But again it was a ham-fisted approach from the start and it undermines the government's credibility. I do not think the Australian public believe anymore that this government will deliver on the promises that it makes. There will be unintended consequences, perhaps through no fault of the government but perhaps because of its ham-fisted approach. Either way, let us accept that there will be amendments required. I believe the minister should give an undertaking to the House that she will deal with those in a timely manner and in a way whereby the professions can accept that there is some give from the government in relation to some of the difficulties that will arise. That is the position of the opposition. We have been supporting the process as best we can, but there was considerable difficulty in what was first proposed by the government. This is not a perfect model that is being put forward and the amendments that will need to be made today and in due course, I hope, will address some of the ongoing concerns that the professions have to this approach. We support the amendments on that basis.",83
40,Ms ROXON,HEALTH PRACTITIONER,"I would like to add a couple of comments following those questions that have been raised by the shadow minister. It is difficult on this occasion to continue to have patience with an opposition who refuse to acknowledge that in this instance all 10 professions covered by this legislation, all states and territories the previous government that he was part of have signed onto this plan. If there were any complications, misjudgments or unintended consequences from the plan that the member opposite suggests that we put forward, I would remind him that it is his current leader who was the Minister for Health and Ageing at the time that the previous Prime Minister signed this agreement. It has only been our government that has been able to pursue it to implementation stage to iron out a vast range of complex issues. The only part of the comments of the shadow minister that I agree with is that of course a new national registration and accreditation scheme over time will need to be able to change if problems arise. It is a complex system, and no-one is pretending that it is not, but I think it is more than audacious come in here and deny the fact that we now have all 10 professions being covered by this calling for the registration and accreditation scheme to be introduced. We have all the states and territories on board. We are not required to pass the substantive legislation here. We are passing legislation which ensures that various financial benefits paid by the Commonwealth will be appropriately paid to people who are registered and accredited under this scheme. It is simply wrong, quite wrong, to say that this will have no benefit for patients and no impact on improving standards. The very purpose of introducing a nationally consistent registration and accreditation scheme is to enable the easy mobility of our vitally important health workforce across the country, which of course has an immediate impact on patients, who need nurses, doctors and other health professionals to be able to move where there is need, where there are better employment opportunities or where their families might be and continue practising. Of and course, it ties in very well with the national standards that will be established through the registration and accreditation scheme and expanded through the government's National Health and Hospitals Network, where we are introducing national standards that apply clinically across the whole country. I accept that the shadow minister would like to be sure that, if any future problems arise, they will be handled. Obviously, the government are always prepared to look at problems as they arise in the implementation of any scheme. It would be foolish not to. I do not think that requires an undertaking; I think that is common sense. I think the approach we have taken to date, including accepting the recommendations that came from the Senate committee report, is an important indication that we are prepared to do that. I to hope that this legislation will now pass this House and be able to be dealt with expeditiously in the Senate. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Third Reading",84
41,Ms ROXON,HEALTH PRACTITIONER,"by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA NA BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 November, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time.",85
42,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"We are here today to deal with amendments moved by the government to its own Do Not Call Register Legislation Amendment Bill 2009, introduced last year. There are a number of aspects to the amendment bill, and I will deal with them sequentially. Last year the government introduced legislation to extend the Do Not Call Register to business, government, fax and emergency service numbers. The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy had announced with great fanfare what a reform it would be to extend the current register-which, as we all know, was introduced by the previous government and has been an enormous success: more than four million people have registered their residential home numbers. At the time of its introduction, the register was restricted to residential home numbers. There was not, quite deliberately, an extension to business in particular. We have made it clear throughout this year that extending the register at this point to fax and emergency service numbers is something we would support. However, we shouted loudly from the rooftops that the extension of the register to government and business, and particularly to business, whilst simplistically well intentioned-as so many things from the government are-was unworkable in a policy implementation sense. The simple reason it was unworkable is that the legislation did not and could not adequately distinguish between a telemarketing call and a normal, day-today, commercial business telephone call. I made that very clear earlier this year with my friend and colleague the member for Dunkley, the shadow minister for small business. You would have had a situation where small businesses in particular, before they made a commercial call, would have had to check whether the business they were calling was on the Do Not Call Register if they did not have a pre-existing relationship. The Senate Environment, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee conducted an inquiry into this bill-and I want to pay tribute to my coalition colleagues on that Senate inquiry-and the evidence they heard from business groups, small businesses and big businesses was that this extension was utterly unworkable, and the committee reported to that effect. For many weeks the minister's response was silence. Clearly, what has occurred is that there was belated recognition that this policy, this announcement in last year's budget, this promise from the Labor Party, was not workable but no-one was prepared to admit it straight away. Then, on Friday, 30 April, the minister made an announcement with respect to the registration period for the Do Not Call Register as it currently applies to residential phone numbers. He announced that he would be introducing amendments to his Do Not Call Register amendment bill to extend the registration period, by regulation, from three years out to five years, initially. Provided the House and the Senate deal with this matter in the next couple of days, the effect of this will be that the registration period of three years-which, for many people, expires naturally on the third anniversary of the introduction of the register at the end of May-will be extended and everyone will have a five-year period. In that press release, the minister also, as quietly as he could, announced that at this stage the government was not intending to proceed with the extension of the Do Not Call Register to business-a belated recognition of the foolhardiness of his original announcement. They are still proposing to extend the register to government. We make the point that that will still harm small businesses in a very commercial sense, not in a telemarketing sense, in seeking to get contracts from government and the like. Obviously, we support extending the register to five years and we have made that point in the public arena. We welcome the fact that the minister has backed down on his extension to business telephone numbers. We note that he says he is going to keep consulting to try to work out how to introduce it, or words to that effect. We would encourage him simply to admit failure on this and to move on. When the minister announced that the government would not proceed with the proposal to extend the register to include business numbers, like so many announcements it was made on a Friday, on 30 April. There are some cynics in the press gallery who claim that the government likes to make announcements when they do not think they will get attention if there are going to be backdowns or admissions of failure. That was the immediate suspicion on this Friday and it was confirmed to many people when they went to the departmental website to look at the fact sheets because they noted immediately that the backflip and the date of the announcement was actually one week earlier, 23 April. Clearly, the Friday backdown had been planned for a week earlier, not proceeded with, but delayed an entire week just to try to avoid the scrutiny and humiliation of admitting failure on the extension to business. Our approach is to seek to facilitate, as fast as possible, the amendment to extend that registration period, as the minister has announced. He has announced that he intends to make this five years by disallowable instrument. I say here in this House that, as a matter of principle, the five-year extension should be part of the legislation so that the parliament decides. Last time, the parliament decided on an initial three-year period and the extension could be very easily and sensibly part of the legislation. The minister has said that he is going to do that by legislative instrument, which will mean that future ministers will have the discretion on how long the registration period should be. We think this legislation should contain an amendment and that the parliament can examine it in the future. Because we want to facilitate the quick passage of this legislation, we will do two things. Firstly, we will take the minister at his word that he is going to bring in a regulation for five years. Having made the point about it being a matter of principle, it would be preferable that the legislation was amended and that this was done in the legislation rather than by regulation. We will not seek here today to try to force that amendment. I call on the minister to make it part of the legislation but, at the end of the day, we will support the provisions of this amendment which, of course, take away the government's unworkable extension to business and extend the registration period for residential numbers. We have had good discussions among the whips in terms of the practicalities at what is a very busy time for the House and the Senate. On that basis, I have agreed to restrict my remarks and I am very grateful to those members of the coalition who have also agreed to restrict their remarks so that we can deal with this matter today. I call on the minister to consider what has been said and for him to back down entirely on his extension to business, which, he knows and the government know, will never see the light of day. The consultation for an extra few months is really just a mirage to try to deflect attention from the fact that this is unworkable, that it will not be proceeded with and that, if it were proceeded with, it would cause huge chaos in the business community.",85
43,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I am sure there are many of us here who have experienced telemarketers calling or at least know someone who has. We hear the stories of how annoying telemarketing companies call your home just on dinnertime or just when you are putting the kids to bed or the baby in the bath. We might be familiar with some of the comebacks that people have used to try to get these pesky telemarketers not to call again, such as the one where you repeat everything they say and, when they ask why you are doing that, you say you are training to be a telemarketer. There is the other one where you say: ‘Hold on. Could you speak a little slowly? I need to write all of these things down.' I could have fun with this topic all day. I speak in support of the Do Not Call Register Legislation Amendment Bill 2009, and I point out that there are some very serious sides to this subject. The bill amends the Do Not Call Register Act 2006 to enable the registration of all Australian telephone and fax numbers, including emergency service numbers. The bill introduces regulation of unsolicited fax marketing by prohibiting the sending of a marketing fax to a number on the Do Not Call Register. The Do Not Call Register, as first introduced, did not protect fax users. While business numbers are now subject to further consultation, that is an important area that we still need to pursue. Also, it did not include emergency services organisations. It has been a particular concern of the government that unwanted and unsolicited calls and faxes are wasting valuable business resources and could potentially affect the operation of emergency service organisations. So those annoying telemarketing and similar phone calls that some of us can often brush off with clever comebacks can actually affect, for example, the performance of small business. Contrary to the contribution of the shadow spokesperson on communications, these are issues that we genuinely need to talk about with respect to small businesses and how we can assist them in stopping unwanted telephone calls that affect their business. During public consultation undertaken by the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, submissions noted the impact of unsolicited telemarketing and fax marketing on businessesparticularly small businesses-through the loss of time, toner and paper and productivity. Also during this consultation there were good indications that approximately 86 per cent of respondents supported the extension of the register to all telephone and fax numbers. In my beautiful electorate of Dobell on the New South Wales Central Coast, I am sure there has been many a telemarketing call made to individuals and small businesses. Small businesses are what make the Central Coast economy tick. It is important that we continue to look at this issue in relation to small business. Receiving unwanted and unsolicited phone calls could be most unwelcome and unproductive for businesses. You can imagine what a takeaway shop owner would feel like if a telemarketing call came through during the peak time of lunch, when they were trying to serve people and conduct their business, or what a flower shop operator on Valentine's Day would feel if they were receiving calls from a telemarketer on something in which they had no interest. So we really do need to look at this and make sure that it is addressed properly. The Do Not Call Register Act 2006 was introduced in May 2007 to enable individuals to opt out of receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls by listing their fixed line or mobile numbers-used primarily for private or domestic purposes-on the Do Not Call Register. In response to concerns raised about restrictions on the types of numbers that could be listed on the register, a departones mental discussion paper was released on 15 August 2008 seeking community views on whether all telephone and fax numbers should be eligible for inclusion on the register. As I have outlined, submissions to the discussion paper indicated that the majority of respondents supported the inclusion of all telephone and fax numbers. The submissions to the discussion paper and representations made directly to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy indicated that businesses, particularly small businesses, would like to be able to receive the protections available under the register. In addition, the Emergency Call Service Advisory Committee raised concerns over the potential for telemarketing calls to adversely affect the operations of emergency service organisations and their ability to respond to genuine emergency calls. The bill amends the Do Not Call Register Act 2006 to enable the registration of fax numbers and particular emergency service numbers. The extension of the register to these Australian numbers avoids uncertainty by consumers or the telemarketing and fax marketing industries about who is eligible and avoids the need for complicated eligibility requirements. The bill provides all new registrants with the option to choose specific industry classifications that they wish to receive calls and faxes about. Marketers will be able to access these choices when they check their contact lists against the register and will be able to make a telemarketing call or send a marketing fax if it relates to an activity covered by an industry classification about which a registrant has chosen to receive calls or faxes. This mechanism has the benefit of allowing registrants to adapt their registration to their needs by selecting calls and faxes that are wanted and relevant. This will be of particular benefit to making sure that types of calls and faxes received are that you actually want to receive and do not affect your business or cause an imposition in unwanted telephone calls or faxes. The default position will continue to be that registrants opt out of all telemarketing calls and marketing faxes. A registrant will be able to take positive action to opt into receive certain types of marketing calls and marketing faxes. It is proposed that the amendments will apply to all registrants, extending the options currently available to consumers. In addition, this will provide more opportunities for telemarketers and fax marketers to call numbers on the register and potentially target their calls more effectively to interested recipients. In addition, the Australian Communications and Media Authority will have the ability to make a legislative instrument setting out the circumstances in which consent can be inferred to make a telemarketing call or to send a marketing fax to a number that is on the register. A number of consequential amendments will also be made to the Telecommunications Act 1997. One of these will be to give the ACMA the power to make an industry standard relating to the fax marketing industry. There are time constraints in relation to this bill so that we can get it through. It is important that this bill can and the process can be amended as quickly as possible. I have never had the chance myself to use one of those smart answers to a telemarketer, but I am sure that the changes to the Do Not Call Register will mean that people who do not want to receive those calls will not have to have those smart answers in the future because they will be able to ensure that they do not receive faxes or phone calls that they do not want. I commend the bill to the House.",87
44,Mr OAKESHOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I also rise in support of the Do Not Call Register Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 and to put a few thoughts on record about how it can be improved into the future. From my perspective this is a simple and practical move to allow individuals to have restrictions on who rings them or who gets in touch with them via fax machine. For something so simple and so practical to be so hard and to have such tangled outcomes says a lot about the broader political processes in Australia today and how it is at times so difficult to weave good policy out of the vested interests that get their claws into the process. This register is certainly, from a consumer's point of view, one that would be broadly agreed upon and supported. That is why, I suspect, the discussion paper in 2008 from a new government was undertaken following the actions of a previous government to introduce the very concept of a do-not-call register. I therefore assume-and I may be wrong-that there is general bipartisanship from both sides of this chamber about expanding the bill and seeing a continuation of the concept of the register. This bill is expanding the numbers that can be registered to include businesses and emergency numbers. I understand there have been some concerns in the emergency services sector that calls to 000 were in a sense wasting time that should be devoted to emergency calls. That is, therepass fore, an eminently sensible change to allow emergency numbers to be included on the register. Likewise, a common complaint from the very large small business sector on the mid-North Coast is as simple as the amount of fax paper that is used through telemarketing and fax marketing being a waste and a cost. When I talk about small business I talk about the genuine fiveemployees-or-fewer family based businesses where costs of ink cartridges matter and are watched on a daily basis with regard to how they are managed. It is an eminently sensible move to include small businesses and businesses generally in their ability to be on the Do Not Call Register. I talk about the tangled web we weave, however. I did note the shadow minister's comments with regard to the three years or the five years issue. I do find it a very strange outcome that we have legislation before this House which is not truly reflective of what the practical outcome will be in its implementation. The dispute of three years versus five years and the hot debate of the topic of the use of disallowable instruments versus presentation of the full legislative package before us I think are unfortunate. Likewise I make mention of the exemptions. The irony will not be lost on anyone in community that feature pieces of the exemptions are political candidates and political parties. For members of parliament and for other members of political organisations there is hopefully a deep sense of irony about us all wanting to be the consumers' friends by allowing people freedom of choice about who does or does not get in contact with them but wanting those involved in the political process to be allowed to annoy people as much as we want. I do see some irony there. I would have put up an amendment to the amendment. However, I do note there is still ongoing a review of the scheme looking at those exemptions for charities and political parties. The surveys clearly show that people are still frustrated by those phone calls that they receive even when they are on the Do Not Call Register. As a local example, the night before the by-election in the seat of Lyne the entire electorate of Lyne received an American style campaigning answering machine message from the previous member, causing enormous confusion-and, if anything, assisting my campaign. However, it was seen as intrusive. It was, in an electorate with a high elderly demographic, the cause of confusion. It did lead to a great deal of frustration for many people who felt their privacy was being invaded by the political process. That is something for consideration, for the future actions of everyone involved in the political process. It would be nice if we could empower people in a formal sense through the Do Not Call Register to include political parties and political organisations so that people do have that choice of whether they do want answering machine messages played down their phones the night before elections or by-elections. I certainly support this legislation. It is important. I would support the five-year expansion. I hope that disallowable instrument is brought in. I do raise one issue that may be dealt with in the detail of the legislation. That is the issue of the financial implications and the $4.7 million being allocated over four years, with $3.5 million of that to be recouped from telemarketing and fax marketing industry groups through the paying of fees to access the register. I would hope we have strict guidelines, controls and monitoring by ACMA and anyone else necessary over the use and potential misuse of those lists that are being accessed through the paying of a fee. If there is a contract in place, where someone is buying something from government and buying a list which is a do-not-call register, I would hope there are very strict guidelines around the use of that list-for example the on-selling of that list for other purposes; or the use of that list for targeted mail, compared to the use of telephones or fax machines. I would welcome feedback from the minister or parliamentary secretary, or whoever is going to respond, on that question of how tight the rules and regulations are for the telemarketing and fax marketing companies who are actually purchasing, in a sense, a do-not-call register list, and what they can then do with that list once they have paid for and then have autonomy over the use and potential misuse of that list. I would hope the guidelines around that are strict and that there is a genuine commitment to privacy through the intent of this legislation and the creation and expansion of the Do Not Call Register. Other than that, it is good legislation and I look forward to its implementation and a wide uptake from the community. It is a optin exercise, so people do have to commit to getting their own numbers on the list-and on the mid-north coast, I strongly encourage that. I know there has been uptake over the last couple of years, and the more people who feel empowered through that process, the better; and the better our democracy is as a consequence.",89
45,Mr SYMON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I speak in support of the Do Not Call Register Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. It was interesting to listen to the member for Lyne talk about many of the same things I am now going to. It is good to see there is widespread concern in the community. This bill makes important and useful changes to the existing Do Not Call Register Act 2006. It also contains consequential amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1997 in relation to fax marketing. Many people contact my office in relation to unwanted marketing and other junk calls and the existing Do Not Call Register is a very useful service. Although it only applies to private and residential phone lines at present, the number of people who contact my office about what I call junk calls-calls that they do not want-is enormous. And many of them actually do not know of the service, so it is always good to be able to direct them to it. Most people who are referred to the Do Not Call Register are satisfied with the drop off in marketing calls, although I still receive regular reports of rogue operators ignoring the restriction. Rogue operators seem to be more prevalent from overseas call centres, particularly India, who do not always follow the restrictions we have on that form of contact here, and that is something that needs to be addressed in the future. The existing Do Not Call Register Act has a registration period of three years for a dential or private phone number. There are now more than four million fixed line and mobile phone numbers registered on the Do Not Call Register as more and more people have become aware of the benefits. As other members have said in this debate, there is nothing worse than being annoyed by a junk phone call when you are at home with the family, trying to get inner ready, trying to the kids to bed-or, even as I have had happened to me, walking in the door with several bags of shopping and trying to get the door open, having the phone ring, dropping everything and running into find out it is someone I have never heard of before selling a product I do not want. As the Do Not Call Register will reach its third anniversary at the end of this monththat is, May-many people who registered in 2007 are at risk of dropping off the Do Not Call Register unless they reregister their telephone number. One of the intentions of this bill before the House is to change that. Up until now more than 40 per cent of people who had registered in 2007, at the start of the scheme, had reregistered as at the end of April, but that leaves the other 60 per cent to find out that they have dropped off the list when they start getting calls again. A provision of this amendment bill is to provide the minister with the power to make a determination to set the period of registration. It is intended that the initial determination will extend the registration period from three years to five years. Of course, those people who registered three years ago will now not be put in that position where they suddenly get those unwanted calls out of the blue, as it were. Importantly, this will also apply to those who are already on the Do Not Call Register, with the effect that phone customers who would have dropped off the register at the end of this month will now have resianother two years of less interrupted dinner times. I think everyone should be happy about that. And if this does not go through in time, by 31 May, there is also provision to reinstate any registrations that have already expired. This bill also contains an extension of the scope of the Do Not Call Register to cover emergency service and government teleput phone numbers. When the bill was first put before the House last year it also had an exemption for businesses, which I understand is now not to be included due to opposition concerns. Having said that, I have had many small businesses contact me about telemarketing calls, about unwanted junk calls and about faxes. This has been particularly from microbusinesses, one or two person businesses, who have to have a fax-an essential tool for all businesses-but who do not like the expense or the wasted time, again, in getting information about things they do not want. This change, in relation to emergency services particularly, will remove the potential that unwanted marketing calls may have of affecting the operation of emergency service organisations. This bill also contains provisions that will allow for all fax numbers to be registered on the do-not-call register. That does include businesses. So individuals, businesses, community and volunteer organisation will all be able to register their fax numbers so as they no longer receive piles of what I like to call junk faxes-what other people might call marketing faxes. It is bad enough receiving spurious information that has not been asked for but it is even worse when it comes at a cost to a household, small business or community organisation's budget. There is the cost of paper that, in most cases, goes unread into the bin. Then there is the cost of ink tridges or toner. Even a few faxes per day will soon cause an inkjet fax machine to run dry and that is when the cost hits home. If you wander down to your local Officeworks store or other supplier to buy an ink cartridge you find that they start at about $20, and that depends on the brand and type of fax machine that you have. They are very small. They do not last long; they get used up quickly. If you have a laser fax machine you need toner. Toner starts at about $100 and goes up from there. Again, you are paying for things that you did not want to print in the first place. That is bad enough for a small business; it can be far worse for a volunteer organisation. In many cases they run on the smell of an oily rag and those dollars can be better spent in other areas. The other problem is that many volunteer and community organisations use what we would call old fax machines. The modern fax machines that most of us use have memories; they can do more than one thing at a time. But if you have an old version of a fax machine you might find that if it is receiving you cannot use it to send. So if you are receiving a junk fax you have to wait until it is finished before you can do your own work. That is very unfair. There are not many forms of unwanted advertising that make the recipient pay directly for it but the sending of junk faxes is most certainly one of them. The only thing I can compare it to is spam email, because you are probably paying in terms of download. So if you are paying per megabyte or gigabyte you may be paying for some of those spam emails. The difference is that you can filter them or redirect them. You can get rid of most of them. You cannot do that with a fax, at the moment. I may, as an example, run through a list of junk faxes that have come through my home fax machine over the recent period. It is a fax carmachine I have had for years; it sits on an unlisted number-that is, it is a silent linebut the faxes keep rolling in. They are many and varied but they are not useful to me. They are not about information I have asked for; they are always about something elsesome rubbish. They include an advertisement for floating massages on Port Phillip Bay, another for the same but on Sydney Harbour, and faxes advertising dubious-sounding diplomas-at only one eleventh of the price of others! There are also faxes advertising holidays in Bali for dolphin watching and holidays in Thailand. There have even been faxes offering to list my fax number, for a fee of $38.50, so that I can receive even more junk faxes. Then we have faxes advertising solar panels and home and office carpet cleaning. And there seem to be lots of faxes about laptop computers. There are faxes for go-kart racing, clothes sales, more cut price laptops and cheap restaurant meals. None of these have anything to do with the business that I have been in or am in. Certainly I have never asked to receive any of them. And of course there are as for printer and fax ink cartridges, which I find quite ironic seeing those very as use up the ink in the fax machine. There are businesses that do this for a business: they sell other lists of supposed contact numbers so that people can send out yet more faxes. But I think that the fax that really took the cake was the one that was sent to me saying that I could send out my own junk faxes to 10,000 people if I pay an organisation $750 for their list and services. It would become almost endless if it went on that way. If the bill that we have before us at the moment goes through it will have the effect of allowing people to opt out of that. they want to keep receiving such faxes that is fine, they do not have to do anything, but if they are overwhelmed by them-and I know many are-there will now be something to do about it. The list of advertising faxes can go on but I think my point is made. Many small businesses, community organisations and households do not want faxes. Nor should they have to have them. Each one of these received faxes comes at a cost to the recipient, and their numbers are growing. This bill will provide relief from junk faxes and I am certain that it will be very popular with anyone who has ever been flooded with them. You may call it what you like but if it is not going to be used or read, to me it is junk. The extension of the registration period to five years is also a great improvement and I am sure will be welcomed by all those who have already chosen to register their numbers on the Do Not Call register. I suspect it will also give a bit of impetus and a bit of an advertising kick to the register so that more people take advantage of it and use it for their phone services. I commend this bill to the House.",90
46,Mr FLETCHER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Bradfield) (1.49 pm)When it comes to the use of communications networks there is inevitably a balance to be struck between the convenience of being accessible to all-being able to call anybody that you like and equally being available to be called by anybody you like-and the issues that that involves in terms of exposing yourself to being available to be called by those who you may not wish to hear from. Those issues-that are difficult to balance up-were addressed by the Howard government when then communications minister, Senator Coonan, brought forward the Do Not Call Register legislation. That introduced If effective protection against consumers being interrupted in their own homes by marketing calls that they did not wish to receive. What we have seen with this bill is a rather poorlythought-through suggestion that the same mechanism ought to be extended to business. It is a policy intent which has been justified, unfortunately, in a rather anecdotal and emotive fashion, and without much careful and sober analysis. When you think about it, businesses are in a very different position to households. Businesses, by definition, succeed on the basis of selling and marketing their services. Therefore, it is very important that businesses have available to them the capacity to market their services. Indeed, what businesses do on a regular, daily basis as part of their core activity is communicate with each other, very often by telephone. This proposed provision to extend the operation of the Do Not Call Register to business would, if it were to proceed, have significant adverse consequences on commerce as it is carried out on a daily basis, and would do very substantial harm to many businesses. This, unfortunately, is a fact that did not appear to have been thought about when the Rudd government decided that it would extend the application of the Do Not Call Register to businesses. The usual nanny state instinct to regulate first and think later seemed to kick in, and it is unfortunate that was necessary for there to be quite an extensive campaign by concerned business organisations to highlight the serious adverse effects of this ill-thought-through extension of the application of the Do Not Call Register. A substantive piece of work was commissioned from Access Economics by the Australian Direct Marketing Association. Access Economics sought to quantify in an analytical fashion the costs and benefits of the proposed extension of the Do Not Call Register. It found that it would impose some quite significant costs on all businesses including, for example, the decline in the efficiency of sales and marketing activities and the flowthrough loss of revenue. Certainly, it also quantified the loss of productivity that businesses experience when they receive unwanted calls, but it made the point that this needs to be thought of in its totality. If you say to businesses, ‘You will have a significant proportion of your target business market removed from you,' that is a material cost which needs to be weighed up against the purported benefit. It is very clear when you analyse the position of businesses that they are in a quite different position to the position of consumers, and the proposed extension of the Do Not Call Register to businesses was not well thought through. Analysis shows that a much better position would be to say, ‘Let us not extend the Do Not Call Register to businesses; let us recognise that when you go into business you engage in the activity of selling and marketing to others and it is a perfectly reasonable part of the bargain that you are also available to be marketed to.' It significant that many businesses have come forward to raise precisely that concern. We do consider it most unfortunate that the Rudd government was proposing an extension of yet another piece of interventionist regulation, a piece of regulation which was it poorly thought through, which would have had significantly adverse impacts on the conduct of business and on the conduct of commerce and which would have had serious adverse economic consequences. We are pleased that that provision is now not included in the bill as it stands before this House, but we call upon the minister to acknowledge that he made a policy error in even bringing it forward and to give certainty that this matter will not be proceeded with. I certainly pay tribute to the many organisations that have worked to put the facts in front of this parliament, particularly the Australian Direct Marketing Association.",93
47,Ms BURKE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"In October 2005, I introduced a private member's bill into this House calling on the government to introduce a Do Not Call Register to protect consumers from unwanted and unsolicited telemarketing calls. The then Howard government advised that this bill was outrageous and that it could not support the bill and claimed that it would not work. Indeed, the arguments that the member for Bradfield has just raised for extending the list are the very arguments that the government of the day put up for why we could not have a Do Not Call Register at all. To come into this place claiming credibility for the legislation is a little stretched. Yes, the Howard government did introduce the bill, but only after outrageous consumer demandonly after talk-back radio ran with this issue for three years. Eventually, Senator Helen Coonan, as the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, said, ‘Yes, we have heard the public; we are is going to do something about it.' So I want to say thankyou to the consumers out there, the people of Australia who said, ‘We want something.' Registers were already operating successfully in the US and UK and I for one could not understand why we could not duplicate that here. The technology existed. It was an easy transition. After overwhelming public support for my campaign, the campaign on behalf of the Labor Party policy, the Howard government finally bowed and decided to adopt a policy to establish a Do Not Call Register, pretty much modelled on my private member's bill. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",94
48,Ms BURKE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"In that year alone, telemarketers made over one billion calls to Australian households. You do not get to claim much in this House, but I am claiming the Do Not Call Register-I am! When the register was finally launched in May 2007, the public voted with their feet with over one million numbers registered in the first month of the register going live. Since that time, nearly 4.7 million homes, mobiles and VoIP numbers have been listed on the Do Not Call Register. This translates to roughly one in three Australian households who have opted out of receiving telemarketing calls. Most Australians want their house to be their castle, not a telemarketing paradise. This vindicates the popularity of the Do Not Call Register while reinforcing the message that the public wants to be able to choose whether or not to receive a telemarketing call. A recent survey by ACMA found 93 per cent of those registered noticed fewer telemarketing calls after registering their home phone. From May 2008 to May 2009, ACMA received 12,000 complaints amounting to a 60 per cent drop from May 2007 to May 2008-figures of over 30,000 complaints. These statistics speak for themselves. The Do Not Call Register has been an outstanding success and is testimony to the will of the community to support my campaign. The Do Not Call Register Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 builds on the Do Not Call Register Act 2006 and the Telecommunications Act 1997. It broadens and entrenches the Do Not Call Register as a powerful tool for consumers to choose to protect themselves from nuisance calls and fax machines. There has been considerable community pressure to extend the register period of the Do Not Call Register from three years. Initially, when the bill was introduced by the Howard government it caved into the industry and said, ‘Okay, after three years all numbers will fall off.' This was a mistake and there has been outstanding public pressure to extend it. As this initial three-year period starts to expire at the end of May this year, there will be a million people who will fall off the register. By the end of April, 40 per cent of people had reregistered their numbers, leaving the majority of people vulnerable to having their numbers drop off at the end of this month. This bill lengthens the registration period for numbers registered on the Do Not Call list initially from three to five years, including existing registrations. This will prevent numbers from dropping off the registration at the end of this month.",95

51,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the fact that he has presided over the two biggest spending budgets in Australia's history, including $26 billion of new spending since last year. I ask: why does the Prime Minister only become an economic conservative at election time? Why would anyone believe that, after three years of being addicted to binge spending, with an election looming the Prime Minister can now go cold turkey?",96
52,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Let us go to the facts first. In this budget, spending as a share of GDP falls from 26.2 per cent of GDP in 2009-10 to 23.6 per cent of GDP in 2013-14. That is less than the average under the Howard government, of 24 per cent of GDP. That first point is a matter of fact. Secondly, I would draw the attention of those opposite to this: when they were pursuing expansionary fiscal policy, the economy itself was expanding. They were being pro-cyclical; they were fuelling the fires of inflation. As a result, had 10 interest rate rises in a row. What is the hallmark of an economic conservative? Acting counter-cyclically. When you have a global economic crisis of the type which has come in, what you do is you support the economy. That is what we have done. That is why, in the course of the global financial crisis, the Australian economy has emerged with the fastest growth, the second lowest unemployment, the lowest debt and the lowest deficit, and is the only economy of the major advanced economies not to go into recession. The reason why is that this government stepped up to the plate and injected a national economic stimulus strategy. That is why, if you look around the world today, they constantly ask this question: how did Australia do it? Budget This government is proud of the fact that we negotiated this economy through the worse global economic recession since the Great Depression. This government is proud of the fact that we kept unemployment down, to now 5.3 per cent. This government is proud of the fact that we defended hundreds and thousands of small businesses from going bust. This government is proud of the fact that it has engaged in the building of the biggest school modernisation program in the country's history. And this government is proud of the fact that, unique of the major advanced economies, we kept this economy out of recession. This is a budget of responsible economic management, and I challenge those opposite to reflect on how the previous government fuelled the fires of inflation, with one pro-cyclical, pro-inflationary budget after another, particularly in pre-election years. We are proud of our economic record and determined to prosecute the case of long-term economic reform. NA",96

It is a budget that returns to surplus and pays down debt ahead of every other major advanced economy. The government will have peak debt and will get the budget in the black in three years-three years early. This is part of the fastest positive turnaround in the fiscal position since the 1960s. How has this been done? It has been done by imposing a two per cent spending cap over the forward estimates, and it has also been done by offsetting all new spending-unlike those opposite, who went into the election year every time spending like drunken sailors. What we have done is impose on ourselves the discipline that we said we would impose on the budget last year when we took the responsible action to stimulate our economy to support small business and to support employment. So the policy successes of the past 18 months now mean that the Australian economy is recovering powerfully. The budget forecasts growth of 3¼ per cent in 2010-11 and four per cent in 2011-12 and, as the Prime Minister said before, an unemployment rate of 5.3 per cent, the envy of the developed world. If you look around the world you can see what an extraordinary effort that has been: employers and employees cooperating to make sure that breadwinners had a job, to make sure that they had a pay packet coming into put food on the table, to make sure that small businesses had a pipeline of activity. That is what we did last year and, now the economy is recovering, what we need to do and are doing in this budget is putting in place a very strict fiscal discipline. Of course that strict fiscal discipline means that we can get on with our reform program. That means that we can put in place the biggest improvements to health and hospitals in over 30 years, something supported very strongly on this side of the House and certainly not understood by the Leader of the Opposition. It means we can invest in the skills of our workforce, that we can invest in infrastructure and that we can invest in renewable energy and clean energy and it means that we can boost savings through boosting superannuation. Of course it means that we can give a real boost to the small business sector. These are all important reforms for the future and they are all built on fiscal discipline, on financial discipline, so much so that this is what the rating agency Standard and Poor's had to say last night: this budget ensures Australia's public finances ‘remain among the strongest of its peer group'. So this side of the House is proud of Australia's economic performance and we are very optimistic about the years ahead. This responsible budget puts in place the framework for strong growth and it means that we can turn the success during the global financial crisis into a stronger economy for working families. Budget",97
57,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister and I refer him to last night's postbudget statement from the Business Council of Australia that ‘if the resource boom were to falter or be killed off the whole budget would collapse in a heap'. Given the deferral by Santos of a decision to proceed with a $15 billion LNG project in Gladstone and a review by BHP of its $17 billion Yeelirie uranium mine, can the Prime Minister guarantee that his great big new tax on mining will not cause the resource boom to falter?",98
58,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Can I draw his attention to the fact that there have been a range of statements on the budget by a range of peak industry bodies. First of all, the tralian Industry Group refers to this budget as ‘a credible budget'.",98
59,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,98
60,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite seem to regard the peak body of Australian manufacturing as irrelevant to the national economic debate. Try this one. The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia says that it provides ‘certainty' for small businesses and that they can ill-afford more instability or change as they are recovering from the global financial crisis. Also, Standard and Poor's, which the Treasurer just referred to a minute ago, says: The deficits and additional borrowings do not alter the sound profile of Australia's public finances, which remain among the strongest of its peer groupin the world. Therefore when it comes to third-party commentary, and I do not go to the various other groups who have commented positively on initiatives in health, education and elsewhere, let us go to the core proposition advanced by the Leader of the Opposition concerning the resources superprofits tax. First of all I would say to the Leader of the Opposition he should study carefully the fact that that tax-in other words, one on profits-was in the first instance advanced by the Mining Industry Council to the Henry tax review. That is one point. The second is this. I will draw his attention to this fact: the petroleum resource rent tax was introduced some 25 years ago and introduced at a rate of 40 per cent. Can I say to those opposite that in the subsequent 25 years we have seen one huge expansion of the resource projects on the North West Shelf and beyond, including the biggest resource project we have ever seen, the Gorgon project. Thirdly, I would draw his attention to the fact that when we are dealing with a tax on profits it is in fact a better arrangement than a tax on volume, which is what Ausroyalties are about. The reason for it makes basic economic sense, namely that if you have got small to medium companies starting up they are sometimes excessively penalised by the volume that they extract from the ground, as opposed to a tax on profits which means that when the company later develops they in fact have a greater financial base to sustain that payment to the general revenue. That is why we had an underpinning economic logic to this proposed tax reform. Finally, I would say to the Leader of the Opposition this: if you look carefully at the modelling contained within Treasury's response to the analysis contained in the Henry report, namely the modelling of Econtech commissioned by the Treasury in relation to the impact of this tax arrangement on the mining sector overall and taking into account also the additional tax benefits for the exploration sector, it actually predicts a 5.5 per cent increase in the overall level of mining activity in the Australian economy. Therefore I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that I know these four sets of facts present a problem when it comes to his core rhetorical argument, but I would also conclude on this. The Australian people actually own these resources. The Australian people deserve a fair share from these resources. The Australian people deserve a fair share when it comes to their super. The Australian people deserve a fair share when it comes to reducing the tax on small business. The Australian people also deserve a fair share when it comes to the most profitable mining companies in Australia contributing more to the long-term infrastructure of our nation. Miners deserve a fair share. It is a great industry. The Australian people deserve a fair share because they own this resource and it is their entitlement to obtain a fair share for themselves and for their children and for the nation's future. Budget",98
61,Ms REA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on how this budget delivers on the priorities and values of the Australian government?,99
62,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question, because it goes to what a budget is all about at the end of the day. It goes to what you are seeking to do for the future of the nation. The values which have driven this government in putting together this budget are: firstly, how do you bring about long-term sustainable economic growth through responsible economic management; secondly, how do you bring about a budget which delivers for all Australians a fair share of the natural wealth of our country; and, on top of that, how do you, through a budget, also make sure that we are investing in the future needs of our economy? These are the enduring and underlying values which have governed not just the budget brought down by the Treasurer last night but the three budgets that we have brought down so far in the history of this government. I say to those opposite: when it comes to building a surplus for the future, it is absolutely important to make sure that we are entrenching our long-term prosperity in strong economic management. It is entirely appropriate to underpin growth when we have a situation where the global economic recession was threatening the very survival of our economy. The challenge now is to ensure that we build the surplus for the future, and that is what this budget does. With responsible management, the government will have peak debt and get the budget back into black in three years-three years earlier than we predicted last year. I congratulate both the Treasurer and the finance minister for their work in producing the analysis and the policy discipline underpinning the document. I also say to those opposite that what we have here is Australia returning to surplus faster than any other major advanced economy in the world. We will emerge from the global recession with less than one-tenth their average debt. Getting it right in terms of strong, long-term economic management is a core value for this government because it underpins what we can then do for working families, for all Australian families, for pensioners, for carers and for those who rely upon government to secure their future. Fairness for our country's future-and this was part and parcel of the question that was asked before by the Leader of the Opposition-is why in this budget we have produced further tax cuts for families. If you are on $50,000 a year, you are paying 18 per cent less tax than you did three years ago. The budget also rewards savings for families, with a 50 per cent tax cut on bank interest up to $1,000. It also simplifies tax returns for 6½ million Australians. It also increases superannuation for Australian workers. They deserve decent security in their retirement. On top of that, we are investing in the future of our health and hospital system. The development of the new ‘A national health and hospitals network for Australia's future' is fundamental to the future security and health security of Australian people. This is a document of fundamental reform. There is $7.3 billion worth of investment contained within the budget in order to produce more doctors, more nurses and, of course, more hospital beds for the future. That is what we are doing in terms of fairness through this budget. Beyond that, it is not just about strong economic management; it is not just about delivering fairness for the future; it is also about how we secure our future against the long-term challenges that we face. Again, the Leader of the Opposition asked questions about tax. We have an obligation to make sure that the overall tax impost on Australian businesses remains globally competitive. That is why we are unapologetically bringing down the company rate for businesses large and small. It is why we are unapologetically bringing about tax breaks for small business. It is why we are unapologetically investing in the future of our infrastructure-road, rail and port. We are unapologetically investing in the future of our skills. We are unapologetically investing in the future of renewable energy in this country, because our country depends on those investments. As the Treasurer reminded us before, it is what we do for the future in bringing about strong economic management we believe in; what we do in bringing about a fairer Australia we believe in; securing Australia for the challenges of the future we believe to be our duty as the elected government of the country-and we are doing so on the basis of securing our international economic reputation and entrenching it for the future. This year our budget deficit is 2.9 per cent of GDP and coming to surplus in three years. The average of the major advanced economies is 9.5 per cent of GDP. Not one of them is forecast to come into surplus in the next three years. Our debt in 2015 will be 3.4 per cent of GDP. The average of the major advanced economies is 93.9 per cent of GDP in 2015. Our growth in 2010-11 is 3.25 per cent of GDP. The average of the major advanced economies is 2.4 per cent of GDP. Where the rubber really hits the road is on how we actually protected jobs. Unemployment is at 5.3 per cent here; the average of the major advanced economies is 8.4 per cent. In the United States, unemployment is nearly 10 per cent, and in many countries in Europe it is 10 per cent. These are the values which guide this budget. It is about securing our future; it is about fairness for the future. It is also about strong economic management. And it is about entrenching this country's international economic reputation, which now remains unparallel across the advanced economies of the world. Budget",99
63,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to Budget Paper No. 1 at appendix A: ‘Sensitivity of budget estimates to economic developments', and I quote: ‘The overall impact to the fall in the terms of trade is a decrease in the underlying cash balance of around $2.1 billion in 2010-11 and around $5.1 billion in 2011-12.' Does the Treasurer agree with his own budget's assessment that a fall in Australia's terms of trade would completely wipe out the government's proposed wafer-thin surpluses?",100
64,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the shadow Treasurer should give up karaoke and take up policy. Every set of budget papers, every budget, contains a sensitivity analysis. This is simply the case in the budget papers every year. The fact there is a sensitivity analysis that says, ‘If this set of events happens it might have that impact,' does not in any way erode the credibility and the standing of the forecast this budget. In no way at all does it do that. The forecasts in this budget across the board are cautious, they are credible and they are realistic. What did the opposition say last year when they were attacking the budget? They claimed our forecasts were too optimistic. They trashed the budget in this House and they trashed it around the country for being too optimistic, because the first refuge of a scoundrel is to trash the forecasts. The forecasts are prepared by the same Treasury that the opposition worked with for something like 12 years. It is the same Treasury that produced sensitivity analyses like that for 12 years. So these are forecasts of the Treasury which are credible and realistic. They are forecasts of the Treasury which match the forecasts of the Reserve Bank generally. They are forecasts which generally match the forecasts of the International Monetary Fund. But this year like last year, the opposition want people to come in here and somehow believe that there is something wrong with the forecasts, because they cannot get their act together when it comes to economic policy. They cannot tell us when they would bring the budget back to surplus. They cannot tell us what savings they would make in the budget. They cannot answer the most simple questions about an alternative macroeconomic framework because they simply do not have one. They have been coming into this parliament for years talking about the need for savings whilst they have been up in the Senate blocking the savings that are essential in our budget. They simply are not credible at all when it comes to economic policy, and their having no alternative framework means that they want to come in here and trash the Treasury, trash the Reserve Bank and trash the International Monetary Fund. There is in simply no alternative framework among those opposite. They have so little credibility that nobody listens to them any more. NA",101
65,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon Mrs Mary Easson, a former member of this place as the member for Lowe. On behalf of the House I extend to her a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Budget",101
66,Mr HALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Why is it important that the 2010 budget and forthcoming budgets be framed within the government's fiscal discipline rules?,101
67,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I also say how delighted I am to see Mary Easson in the chamber today, and I am sure I speak on behalf of many members in saying that. The government has put in place some very strict fiscal rules in order to ensure that we get the budget back in a strong position after the impact of the global financial crisis. The rules that we have put in place are these. First, we will not allow tax as a proportion of the total economy to go above the level we inherited from the former government. What has happened? The levels of tax as a proportion of the economy now and across the forward estimates are substantially lower than the level we inherited from the Howard government. Second, we will not allow spending growth to go beyond a two per cent real increase until such time as the budget returns to surplus. What has happened? We have adhered in this budget to that rule and we have extended it so that now that rule will continue to apply until such time as the budget surplus reaches one per cent of GDP. Third, when tax revenue recovers from the impact of the global financial crisis-and it has partly recovered-we will not spend that revenue but allow it to help drive the budget back into surplus early. What has happened? That is precisely what has occurred. Finally, new spending will be offset by saving. What has happened? Across the forward estimates period, the aggregate excess of saving above spending is $544 million-half a billion dollars. So all these rules have been adhered to, and one of them has not only been adhered to but been extended. The result is that we are back in surplus three years ahead of schedule in three years time and the level of debt Australia has will be half of what was initially projected. It be 6.1 per cent of GDP, which is less than one-tenth of the average of developed world economies. I notice that the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, was on Insiders last weekend indicating that he would set the bar for the government about when we returned to surplus. He said that it would be reasonable to return to surplus within three or four years. Guess what, Mr Speaker: we have jumped over his bar, we have leaped over that bar, and got the budget heading towards surplus in three years. I take this opportunity to welcome the new shadow minister for finance, the member for Goldstein, to the podium. He is my fifth shadow minister for finance. I have had five. And who knows-there may be more. I am up against a basketball team. We have had five shadow finance ministers. I shared a platform with the new shadow finance minister last night on Lateline and this morning at the annual accountants breakfast. Do you know the interesting thing, Mr Speaker: in both of these contributions I do not recall the words ‘debt and deficit' passing the lips of the shadow finance minister. Why? Because the infamous debt and deficit scare campaign is dead-stone dead. What has killed it? The budget is heading back to surplus three years ahead of schedule and debt is peaking at six per cent of GDP. The scare campaign of the opposition has been exposed for the giant fraud that it is. The opposition has a single political strategy. It is simple and it is straightforward. It is to block, blame and bluster. That is all that the Leader of the Opposition and his team are contributing to Australian politics. There is a lot of rhetoric, there is a lot of fluff and there is a lot of flim flam, but we are approaching the business end of the season where the Australian community is going to will start asking for some detail. We have had virtually no detail from the Leader of the Opposition yet, but he has a big test on Thursday night and that is to come up with some detail and to come up with some specific costed savings-not just one-liners and colourful, glib grabs but some specific costed savings. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance and also on aspersions being cast on a member: I was present at that breakfast this morning and the shadow finance minister certainly did mention debt and deficit.",101
68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mackellar!,102
69,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I return to the point I was making. The budget rules the government put in place put a real constraint on spending. They require governments and prospective governments to match spending with savings. We have had a sequence of dog-ate-my homework excuses about when we are going to get some serious savings and when we are going to get some explicit commitments about how the opposition is going to pay for all the promises it is putting forward, but thus far we have had very few commitments. By this stage in 2007, the then Leader of the Opposition, now the Prime Minister, had $3 billion worth of explicit savings commitments out there, virtually all of which have since been delivered. I have a couple of final tips for the Leader of the Opposition. Investments do not hit the bottom line and therefore cannot be used for spending. So, whether it is the Australian Rail Track Corporation equity investmentMr Hockey-Or the NBN?",103

You might like to come up with a glib one-liner suggesting that you can, but you cannot spend the proceeds. My final suggestion is that, if you want to be treated seriously, you have got to have some costed, four-year, over the forward estimates savings in your budget reply to show where the money is coming from.",103
72,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his comments at a dinner in Perth last week, when he said: We must broaden the economic base, as China could implode. I studied it, lived there and the language. I know China better than anyone here. Its success can swing on one good or bad decision.",103

74,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my right! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has the call.,103
75,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, given the budget assumes continuing strong demand for our resources, particularly from China, what would be the impact on the budget of an economic slowdown in China?",103
76,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I welcome the member for Curtin and Deputy Leader of the Opposition returning to the subject of China, because the last time she stood at the dispatch box to talk about China I think it was in defence of China's human rights record, or was it in defence of Chinese human rights activists? It depended on which day we were talking about. One day we were too hard; the next day we were too soft. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition refers to my engagement with the business community of Western Australia. Of course I spoke to them about the long-term challenges which we face in North-East Asia. I said that, therefore, broadening the economic base of Australia by making sure that the corporate tax rate was brought down across the country was a sensible course of action on the part of any reforming government. That means that, if you do face a rising Australian dollar which is affecting the international competitiveness of all companies which are exporting, one way this governChina ment can assist in enhancing their competitiveness is to bring down the company rate. That is what we have done. The second thing I would say in response to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is: when she looks at the question of the govspeak ernment's assumptions, based on Treasury advice, about the future trajectory of commodity prices, these fall at the conservative end of the spectrum based on what market analysts are saying. There are commentators out there in the marketplace who this morning have affirmed and affirmed again that this falls within the range of what most people analyse to be long-term demand for Australian commodities. In fact, the commodity price projections contained within the budget papers, I recall, also after a period of time come down, as you would expect in any rational analysis of where the price would go over a period of time. Therefore, the Treasury, in putting together this analysis, has been entirely mindful of where these prices will go over time. For example, I would draw her attention to the fact that the budget forecast when it comes to the terms of trade is up 14¼ per cent in 2010-11 and then down 3¾ per cent in 2011-12 and, for the medium term, there is a decline by 20 per cent over 15 years and a return to just under 2006-07 levels. This is the sort of discipline which the Treasury officials apply. The Treasury officials applied in their provision of advice to the previous government. The only thing that has changed on this occasion is that that does not suit the political case being advanced by that lion of Chinese human rights, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member the Curtin. Budget",103
77,Ms JACKSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. What are the government's plans to increase community access to primary care and health services outside of hospitals?,104
78,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hasluck for her question because I know on this side of the House people are delighted with the announcements from last night to invest more money in primary care, the front line of our health system. Whether it is more money for GPs, whether it is more money for infrastructure for general practice or whether it is more money for practice nurses, all of these initiatives are vital for making sure that constituents in our electorates can get the health care they need when they need it. One of the key initiatives from last night deals with the very fact that we know people do not get sick just between nine and five, Monday to Friday. People need care and access to nurses and doctors after hours. Unfortunately, what many of us might think is anecdotal when people come to our electorate offices and say, ‘I can't get access to a GP,' or, ‘My GP stopped opening late on work days,' or, ‘My GP doesn't open on the weekends any longer,' is not anecdotal; this is real. What we know is that in the last decade, during the watch of the Leader of the Opposition as the health minister, the percentage of doctors providing their own after-hours services reduced from around 50 per cent to 28 per cent. So what we have committed, as part of a $2.2 billion investment into primary it care, is the expansion of an online and phone service to be able to get immediate advice from a nurse, follow-up advice from a GP and referral through our Medicare Locals to a local GP if someone who rings the service needs to have a GP visit. Mr Truss-What if you haven't got one?",104
79,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hear an interjection opposite: what if we don't have one? This is the whole point. This is actually why we are investing millions and millions of dollars in training more GPs, because your leader, when he was the health minister, put a cap on GP training places. That is why we are investing in funding for more than 5,500 new GPs, because electorates like those of the member interjecting do not have enough GPs. He perhaps might ask the Leader of the Opposition why he neglected this issue for so long and left it for us to pick up the pieces. Of course, those opposite might say, ‘What happens if we don't have a GP in our electorate right now?' That means that the constituents-the mums and dads who are worried about a child with a temperature or someone who perhaps does not drive who gets sick at night-will be able to phone up and get advice from a nurse and a GP immediately. Those opposite might be dismissive of this, but anyone who has young children knows that having someone on the end of the line to give them a bit of quick advice-to tell them that it does sound serious and they should go to hospital or that they need not worry and a bit of Panadol might work-is important. These issues are day-today issues for our constituents and for all Australians, and those opposite neglected these issues. What has also been a very significant investment is another $355 million into infrastructure for GP services-more GP superclinics and of course 400 general practices that will be able to expand their own services. I thought that perhaps I might take the opportunity to ask members on the shadow front-bench, as we are progressively opening these superclinics across the country, whether they might have more guts to turn up and represent their electorates than the shadow minister for health did!

87,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I cannot let the opportunity pass because I know that the member for Petrie would not forgive me. On Friday we turned the first sod for the Redcliffe superclinic at the hospital site in her electorate. It was covered on the Redcliffe and Bayside Herald front page with, ‘Super boost for GPs: $5 million clinic to ease the strain on hospitals'. What the local community in Redcliffe told us is this will be the first time ever that GPs will be trained in the electorate of Petrie-the first time ever. Twenty medical trainees going through this superclinic, year after year, making sure that the shortages in the region will be able to be met. This is fundamentally good news and I am sure that those communities are very happy with the timetabling of this GP superclinic. Finally, I would like to make mention of the fact that today is International Nurses Day, and the nurses who work very hard across our country should be congratulated for the hard work that they do. I know that many nurses were very excited about the investments in the budget last night, probably most importantly the $390 million for better supporting practice nurses. These are nurses who work with our doctors in general practice to provide extra services, particularly for chronic disease and prevention. This investment will allow up to 3.8 million tional GP services to be provided because of the time that is freed up while nurses provide important care to members of our community. I would also like to encourage members of this House-I know the member for Lyons and a number of others have already put in their requests for new GP superclinics. And I am sure that, like the member for Parkes and the former leader of the National Party, John Anderson, who made pretty fast tracks to our doors to ask for a superclinic in Gunnedah, we will have backbenchers and others arguing for these investments to be made in their electorates. We will welcome those requests, we will take each of them seriously and we look forward to providing more support for members of the community who need access to GP and nursing care. Budget",105
88,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.41 pm)Mr Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister. With commodity analysts predicting a glut in global resource production by 2014-15, and with mining companies already paying 33 per cent more tax on their profits than all other Australian companies, how will miners pay double the tax of other companies and still grow at the 20 per cent figure predicted by this government under a new great big mining tax? How can the assumptions in this budget be taken seriously when they are built on such flimsy ground?",106
89,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Groom for his question, and I do not think he was listening to the answer I gave to an earlier question about the Treasury's assumptions about the change in commodities prices over the short, medium and long term. This, by the way, is the same Treasury which provided advice on future courses for commodity prices for the previous government. The other part of his question goes to the addi- underpinning assumptions for the budget itself. This has been the subject of some interesting discussion today, as the member for North Sydney would be well aware. On the underpinning assumptions of the budget 12 months ago, in May 2009, the member for North Sydney had this to say: The Treasury has some pretty heroic assumptions in their forecasts of how quickly we come out of recession. Mr Hockey-Yeah, that's right!",106

When asked on Insiders what is the benchmark the government must meet, he said: Well they could do it if they triedthat is, bring the budget into surplusin three to four years. Joe, we are doing it in three. Mr Hockey-You won't!",106
95,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We actually got to the inner margin of what you set as the benchmark. Can I just say that, in this entire debate about economic credibility, assumptions and the budget, what we see is a federal opposition which is the least economically literate federal opposition we have seen for decades. On the Liberal Party, we also have some interesting comments about the level of literacy and the question of financial conservatism. My attention was drawn to a comment recently, contained in the Sydney Morning Herald, which refers to the economic literacy of the Leader of the Opposition. This is what was said in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 10 April of order, obviously on relevance. How could the Prime Minister's answer now be relevant when he was asked a question about the issue of resources and how they could be taxed into oblivion and still grow in the budget forecast by 20 per cent a year for the next four years?",107

97,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order, those on my right! The Manager of Opposition Business should ignore taunts if he really wants to hear my response to his point of order. The question did go to how seriously the budget forecast should be taken, which allows a fairly wide response, but I would ask the Prime Minister to relate his material to the question.",107
98,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I draw my answer to a conclusion. The comment which is contained in the herald reads: When he lost a fight with Peter Costello in the expenditure review committee over some expensive proposal or other he'd go straight John Howard's office to try to get the decision overturned … He never really understood the meaning of fiscal conservatism …,107
99,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat. On the question of relevance, the Prime Minister must go to relating his material to the question.",107
100,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Resources have been around for a long time, both when the previous government was in as well as under this government. The point that I am making is that, when it comes to responsible economic management, we have relied upon the same Treasury advice as Peter Costello relied upon. We are relying on the same Treasury advice, which is to serve independently the governments of both political persuasions, and we have acted professionally based on that advice concerning future assumptions for commodity prices. But, as a former long term cabinet colleague of the Leader of the Opposition said, he never really understood the meaning of the term fiscal conservatism. Budget",107
101,Mr TURNOUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for Education and Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House the investments the government is making in skills through the budget and the importance of these measures for Australia's productivity?",107

103,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! If the member for Leichhardt's fan club on both sides of the chamber can just be a little quieter, I will give the call to the Deputy Prime Minister.",107
104,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am certainly a member of the member for Leichhardt's fan club and I thank him for this important question. Of course, the member for Leichhardt knows, into and I have spoken to him on many occasions, about the need for investment in skills in this country, and last night's budget contains an important skills package. Today I want to highlight just one part of this important package. It is the right time to be generating even more investment in skills, as the budget papers show we are moving towards a full employment environment. In this environment, we want to make sure that young people get a start in life, that they get a tradean opportunity for a start in life. Last time our country went through an economic downturn, apprenticeship commencements went through the floor. The really bad news is that, after they went through the floor, it took 14 years for commencements to recover-so sharply down and 14 years to recover. As a result of the global recession, apprenticeships were threatened once again. As a government, we became very concerned as we saw signs, in the 12 months following September 2008, like apprentice and trainee commencements falling by 20 per cent-worrying signs for all. We could have stood back and done nothing in these circumstances, but, just as we took quick and decisive action to support jobs, we took quick and decisive action to support apprenticeships. This included in October 2009 our $100 million Apprentice Kickstart program, designed to reverse the decline in traditional trade commencements, aimed squarely at young Australians leaving school and provided over the summer months. We also invested in a $145 million package to secure Australian apprenticeships for those apprentices who had become out of trade because of the economic circumstances their employer was facing and needed a new opportunity in order to complete their apprenticeship. The great news is that, taken together, these measures have assisted more than 40,000 businesses in national skill shortage areas, enabled more than 49,000 apprentices to remain in work or complete their training and ensured that around 24,400 young apprentices started in the trades over skills the summer. That is great news. As a result of last night's budget, today we are opening the second phase of Apprentice Kickstart. Today, employers can put on a young person and get special new incentives for doing so. The incentives for putting on that young person have more than tripled. We expect this phase of Apprentice Kickstart over the next six months to support 22,500 commencements. We are focusing this initiative on smalland medium-sized businesses, businesses with fewer than 200 employees. Once again, our target is young Australians aged 19 years and under in the key areas of construction, automotive, mechanical engineering, hospitality and electrotechnology. These are real opportunities for young people, available from today. Today, together with the member for Eden-Monaro and my ministerial colleague Senator Mark Arbib, I went to Country Energy and I met with a young apprentice called Thomas Watson. I met with his supervisor, who started life as an apprentice, a man called John Bruce, and I met with the overall boss, a man who also started his life as an apprentice, Phillip Green. This proves that getting a trade gives you employment support for life. It is the doorway to great opportunities. We have acted decisively to save jobs. We have acted decisively to save skills. Today I ask Australian employers to get in and take advantage of this program and give a young Australian a fantastic start in life through a trade apprenticeship. Economy",107
105,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Does the Treasurer endorse the reported remarks of Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, Ric Battellino, when he said in reference to mining that the best thing that could happen is for one of the big projects to fall over? Given the Treasurer's very high regard for the Reserve Bank, which project is Mr Battellino referring to the South Australian Olympic Dam expansion, the LNG project at Gladstone in Queensland or maybe Western Australia's Yeelirrie uranium mine? Does the Treasurer have a preference for which big mining project should fall over?",108
106,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I do not endorse that statement at all. Our ambition for economic growth in this country is for all our industries and for a very strong mining and mineralproducing industry. In fact, if you look at the material we published last Sunday week, we talked about how we as a country will deal with the two-speed economy that comes from mining boom mark 2. We talked a lot about the mistakes made by those opposite in mining boom mark 1. They failed to put in place the necessary investments in the capacity-producing stuff. They failed to put in place the essential investment in infrastructure and left this country with a very serious infrastructure deficit which has put upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates. That was the legacy that they left to us as we came to power at the end of 2007. This government is determined to put in place an economic framework which will cope with mining boom mark 2. At the moment, we have had the tail end of the global recession on the one hand and a mining boom coming on the other, off the back of very strong growth in this region-not just Chinese growth, not just Indian growth but growth right across the region. The one thing that sensible people who study these things know is that a greater percentage of global growth is going to come from the Asia-Pacific as we move forward. It is not going to come from Europe, and we have seen evidence of that. The United States is recovering, but what the global economy is waiting for and relying on is greater growth in this region, and that is a great thing for Australia. What it means for Australia is that if we get the domestic settings right we can maximise the prosperity that flows from that and we can spread the opportunities around to ensure that all of our economy grows-not just some parts growing very strongly but all of our economy growing. This is why the Prime Minister talked before about using the revenue from the Resource Super Profits Tax to cut the corporate rate, to do something for small businesses so that we grow together. So we have an ambition for a very strong mining industry in this country-a fair system of taxation that returns fair value to the Australian people for their resources, not the resources of the mining companies. We have put forward a perfectly reasonable proposition. We are discussing that with the mining industry. We will work our way through those issues. The sorts of statements that are being made by some opposite and some of the industry were made when this matter was raised in the late 1980s. The whole roof of the economy was going to fall in, but it did not. The biggest single project approved in this country's history was the Gorgon project approved at the end of last year-a $50 billion project approved under a resource profits tax. We on this side of the House will defend the national interest. Our national interest is to make sure that we grow our economy sustainably to make sure that the Australian people get a fair share of their resources and to make sure that we grow together, and that is what we are doing. Working Families Mrs D'ATH (2.56 pm)-My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. How is the government supporting working families?",109
107,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Petrie very much for her question, because this is a government that delivers for working families. Earlier today I introduced legislation into the parliament for Australia's first paid parental leave scheme, a milestone reform and a major win for parents and their babies-and our scheme is fair to business. The Leader of the Opposition, by contrast, wants to impose a great big new tax on business to pay for his paid parental leave scheme. This government's Paid Parental Leave scheme is economically responsible and was funded in last year's budget. Australian families have had to wait far too long for a national paid parental leave scheme, after 12 years of inaction from those opposite. It is this government that is going to deliver Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme. Last night's budget builds on this major reform for Australian families. Another round of tax cuts will help Australian working families. A worker on $50,000 per year will be $1,750 better off as a result of three rounds of tax cuts. And a new standard deduction for work related expenses will make tax time that much simpler for six million families. The standard deduction will be $500 in 2012-13 and $1,000 in 2013-14. The standard deduction will reduce a family's taxable income. As taxable income reduces, family payments increase. This will see around 280,000 families receiving on average around $250 more per year in family tax benefit part A in addition to the benefit that they receive from the standard deduction. This will be a double win for Australian families. It will also see around 15,000 additional families become eligible for family tax benefit part A for the first time as a result having a lower taxable income. Families will also be able to claim a tax deduction equal to 50 per cent of interest earned on $1,000 in deposits. These are deposits in approved banks, building societies and credit unions. This will lower the taxable incomes and taxes of an estimated 5.7 million depositors, three-quarters of whom have incomes of less than $80,000 a year. Around 200,000 families paying less tax on their deposit interest will have reduced taxable income, and these families will receive around $85 more in family tax benefit part A each year. This is a government that continues to deliver for Australian working families through paid parental leave that will support parents and their children and through a fiscally responsible budget that will see more families benefit from family payments. Budget",109
108,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the Treasurer's remarks on radio 2GB today: The surplus in this budget is not dependent upon the resource super profits tax. Of the $12 billion of mining tax revenue the Treasurer claims to collect in the budget forward estimates, only $9.8 billion is allocated for specific spending. Isn't it the case that the Treasurer's supposed surpluses do rely on at least $3.2 billion of unallocated mining tax revenue? If not, where is the money going?",110
109,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Very sloppy again, Joe.",110
110,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will refer to members by their parliamentary titles.,110
111,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In fact, all of the initiatives we have announced that are dependent on that do add up to the revenue over the forward estimates, so I do not know what figures you are reading. But one thing I do know is that we are not doing in this budget what those opposite always did in election of year budgets. I have done a bit of research about spending and what has happened in previous budgets. Between the Liberal Party's 2006 budget and their 2007 election year budget, they committed almost $90 billion in new policy. Think about that: $90 billion between their 2006 budget and their 2007 election year budget.  of order. The Treasurer in the opening remarks to his answer admitted that he did not know the answer to the question, so therefore how could he possibly be relevant to the question he has been asked? He is blathering on trying to fill in",110

Between the Liberal Party's 2006 budget and their 2007 election year budget they committed an extra $90 billion. What have we done between the last budget and this one in terms of extra spending? We have offset the lot-game, set and match.",111
114,Mr DREYFUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Tourism. Will the minister inform the House about the benefits of the resource superprofits tax for the resources sector and the Australian economy?,111
115,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Isaacs for his question. On behalf of the Australian community last year I had the privilege of being one of the signatories witnessing the biggest ever investment in Australia's history in a single project, the Gorgon LNG project, which is now bringing benefits to many businesses in Australia and opportunities for employment and training to thousands of Australians. That investment decision proved that taking on a fight 25 years ago, in terms of putting in place a tax regime for the petroleum industry, meant that we actually got the balance right. It is in that context I can say that no-one can deny that the resources sector is a key part of Australia's future. The current debate is about getting the balance right. The difference between the government and the opposition is that we actually believe the Australian community at the moment is not getting a fair share with respect to its return on the development of its national resources from a nonrenewable sector point of view. I simply say that the government is absolutely committed to ongoing engagement for the resources sector for the purposes of getting the balance which not only means we continue to attract investment but also guarantees that the Australian community gets a fair return for the development of its resources that can also be used to invest in our future, invest in company tax cuts, invest in infrastructure and invest in skills, to name a few opportunities. Let us go to some of the scare campaigns at the moment with respect to the supposed impact on the Australian economy of what the government has announced to date. I start Budget by going to the Treasury's independent modelling by KPMG Econtech-I might say, the preferred economic modeller of the previous government. Let us deal with a few facts with respect to their modelling. I go to that modelling which says that cutting the company tax rate to 28 per cent and introducing the resources superprofits tax, combined with the removal of the impact of royalties, would actually expand mining output by 6.6 per cent in the long run. It also goes on to say: All other industries are expected to expand by 0.3 per cent in the long run. The report further says that the combined effect of introducing the resources superprofits tax and cutting the company tax rate by 2 percentage points will add 0.7 per cent to Australia's GDP over the next five to 10 years. That independent modelling clearly indicates that this reform will strengthen the Australian economy as a whole. That is no different, I might say, to the history of the petroleum resource rent tax, which tells the same story: the industry has flourished as a result of the tough tax debate we took on 25 years ago. I appreciate that, from the government's point of view, this is going to be a long, tough tax debate. That is because our government is absolutely committed to getting the balance right-not only ensuring appropriate investment for Australia that creates jobs and prosperity but also correctly ensuring, unlike the opposition leader, who finds economics boring, and actually guaranteeing the Australian community a fair return for the development of its resources. We as a government stand in support of the Australian community's right for a fair return for the development of their resources. The opposition, unlike the Western Australian Premier, currently believes that the resources sector should not pay higher tax for the opportunity to develop our resources. I am pleased to say this government stands in support of the Australian community in ensuring they get a fair return for the development of their resources. The opposition leader should hang his head in shame. He is more concerned about corporate donations than the proper return on the development of Australia's resources.",111

124,Mr OAKESHOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, following last night's budget, following the COAG agreement with the states, and following your visits to hospitals-including being the first Prime Minister ever inside a Lyne electorate hospital",112
125,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,112
126,Mr OAKESHOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, credit where it's due! Prime Minister, will you now commit to three critical steps for the growth regions of Australia, including: (1) local input into decisions being made now around boundaries for local hospital networks; (2) a long overdue commitment to full, 100 per cent equity of funding for growth regions; and (3) an immediate injection of capital for bed shortages in growth regions?",112
127,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lyne for his question. He is right that I had the opportunity to visit the Port Macquarie Base Hospital, in his electorate, on two occasions-first to speak with his local health experts on the needs of their particular hospital. It is a growth region; there are a huge number of people moving there. But it was one of those things that have been left behind in long term planning. That is not the particular fault of one side of politics or the other the New South Wales government, but it frankly has not kept pace with the long term needs of that growth region. One of the things I was also able to do when I visited the honourable member's electorate was to announce an allocation of $5 million or thereabouts for, I think, a second linear accelerator, in the Port Macquarie Base Hospital. This doubles the cancer treatment services available to his constituents, given what is currently there. Of course, there is more to be done. That is part and parcel of a much wider program of regional integrated cancer care centres, announced by the Minister for Health and Ageing a month or so ago, which went to some 22 different locations across the country. In fact, Bunbury, in Western Australia, was one of the recipients; Tamworth, I seem to recall, was another recipient; along with other areas right across the country, to improve cancer services in regional areas. Mr Truss interjecting",113
128,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I note the interjection from the Leader of the National Party that it did not go to his electorate. This is a $560 million investment which went nationwide, to seats where this government has no representatives and is unlikely to obtain representatives in the future. It was based on a needs analysis in the health department. If you look at places like Bunbury, if you look at places like Tamworth, if you look at places we have located these regional cancer care centres, you see that these are important centres for the Australian population-and the one core value at work is that people in non-metro Australia should have access to decent cancer care. The overwhelming feedback from them is: why should we have to travel to our capital cities when we get diagnosed with one form of cancer or another? It is bad enough getting a cancer diagnosis. Having to in rip up your family, go to the capital city for weeks, sometimes months, on end, to get even basic diagnostics or cancer treatment, is one of the reasons many people do not bother. Do you know what the terrible statistic is? And I say this to the Leader of the National Party: if you live in non-metro Australia, in regional and remote Australia, you are three times more likely to die within the first five years of your diagnosis of cancer than if you live in one of our capital cities. That is unjust. It is wrong. That is why the Minister for Health and Ageing announced a $560 million investment right across the country. The first of the three points contained in the honourable member's question went to the input into the definition of local hospital authority boundaries. That is an important matter when it comes to the proper allocation of resources to, for example, the Port Macquarie Base Hospital. I have been on the record already as saying that the area in which this hospital is currently located is too big. In our discussions with the New South Wales government they have concurred that these current areas are far too large to be sensitive to local health needs. That is why a fundamental reform will occur. When it comes to Port Macquarie Base Hospital, therefore, it is critical that the needs of that region become central to the local health authority which is constructed in that area. We will be reflecting that view to our friends in the New South Wales government when those delineation questions occur. The second point he raised was about growth funding. It is a growth region. The reason we have introduced activity based funding is to make sure that the money flows to those hospitals which are actually deliverlast ing the services. When I spoke to his local health professionals up there they welcomed activity based funding because, rather than just being given an administrative grant once a year-they are out there working hard delivering a large number of elective surgery procedures and treating a whole lot of patients-the money will flow after the number of services they deliver. Therefore, all allocation of resources to that hospital would go up. Therefore, introducing activity based funding for the first time in New South Wales-and for the first time in every state except Victoria-will assist hospitals such as his at Port Macquarie get a proper investment of funds consistent with the delivery of services in those hospitals. The third point is about immediate investment. I draw the honourable member's attention to the $7.2 billion additional investment outlined in the Treasurer's statement last night. This is investment in more hospital beds, more doctors and more nurses and the enhancement of elective surgery procedures and accident and emergency. In his particular hospital, noting the shortage of beds which exists, I am very mindful of the fact that New South Wales would have received an allocation of approximately, I think, one third of the 1,300 sub-acute beds which are fully funded in the budget. I would therefore strongly suggest to the honourable member that he make his representations very clearly known about the need for additional beds in his area, because I have spoken to his local health professionals and they know that their hospital-Port Macquarie Base Hospital-is at its limit. The last thing I would say in response to the honourable member's question is to do with a point referred to before by the Minister for Health and Ageing. It goes to the other arm of healthcare reform-that is, the reform of primary care. The health minister night, to the derision of those opposite, announced details for the large-scale expansion of not just investments in GP superclinics but further investments in GP practices. Also, if you look carefully at the statement which has been put out on nurses you will see that we provide further investments into GPs and their local clinics to make it more financially possible for them to engage practhe overtice nurses in those clinics. These are really important reforms for delivering GP related services on the ground. Again, the honourable member, I am sure, in consultation with his local GPs, will make a submission to the government-the health department-to make sure that proper funding flows on the basis of needs analysis across the country for the enhancement of GPs and GP related services, and we welcome his expression of interest in it. In fact, I would say to all members opposite: if you are facing problems and challenges in your electorates when it comes to GP services, you should take seriously what the Minister for Health and Ageing has put forward and get your submissions in from your local GPs so that we can enhance and roll out a much more flexible delivery of health care services for the entire Australian community.

129,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. How will the government's $1 billion investment in rail freight in the budget help get trucks off the roads, improve national productivity and create jobs for regional Australia?",114
130,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and his ongoing interest in these issues. Indeed, last night's budget delivered another $1 billion injection into the Australian Rail Track Corporation. That lifts our contribution to some $3.4 billion over six years-twice as much funding as was given for the national rail freight system by the previous government in half the time. Twice the funding in half the time! This will support some 1,500 jobs in regional Australia. We are fixing the rail lines between Maitland and the Queensland border-some 58 separate projects towards the border; in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales; between Whyalla and Broken Hill and between Broken Hill and Parks; between Albury, down through Melbourne to Geelong; and between Gheringhap and Maroona and between Koolyanobbing and Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. We are straightening the rail lines, we are building new passing loops and we are ripping out the old wooden sleepersMr Hockey-Some of your backbench colleagues!",115
131,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and replacing them with new concrete sleepers. Stick to trying to add up, Joe. We are doing all of this in order to raise productivity, support jobs and ensure a national return. This is an investment. This will lead to higher productivity and a higher return to the Australian Rail Track Corporation over a period of time. It is good for jobs and good for the economy, particularly in regional Australia. This brings our nationbuilding investment in rail, roads and ports to some $37 billion. We have now more than quadrupled the investment in rail and more than doubled the investment in roads over a similar period of time. And we have done all this within the budget and fiscal framework of ensuring that we return to surplus in just three years. Budget",115
132,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Treasurer. Treasurer, given that the government had a $1 billion blowout in the computers in schools program, a $1 billion fix-it job in the home insulation program and a $1 billion blow-out in the border protection measures, why should anyone believe that in three years time there will not be a single new policy announcement that costs $1 billion or a budget blowout that wipes out the $1 billion surplus?",115
133,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have outlined to the House earlier today, we have put in place a very strict fiscal discipline. And we are adhering to the strict fiscal discipline. We have made cuts-some of them have been painful-and we have restrained spending right across the forward estimates. Not only that, but, as the finance minister was saying before, we intend to do that and extend that out until the budget comes back to one percentage point of GDP. We are doing something that those opposite were utterly incapable of doing, particularly at the height of a boom. We have a strict fiscal discipline in place, which has brought this budget back to surplus in three yearsand three years early. And we have halved debt. We have put forward a credible plan. It is so ironic for those opposite to ask a question like that. When are they going to bring the budget back to surplus? Can they answer that question? We look forward to Thursday night for a few answers from those opposite. Budget",115
134,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs and the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy. Will the minister advise the House of the initiatives for small business which are part of the government's new tax plan and how these initiatives have been received?",115
135,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to thank my friend and colleague the member for Braddon for his question and for his continued commitment to small business, the backbone of northern Tasmania. The Rudd government supported small business through the global recession, the deepest global recession in 75 years. We did that through the economic stimulus package, including the small business tax break. Now we want to support small business through the recovery phase and that is what we are determined to do. From 1 July 2012 every small business in this country would get the ability to write-off the value of any asset up to $5,000 instantly-not spread over time, but instantly, in the year in which they buy it. That is a very good initiative for every small business in this country. I refer to a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition when he announced that they would oppose these small business tax breaks by denying the funding that would be used to fund those small business tax breaks. The opposition leader said that only incorporated small businesses, only companies, would benefit from the tax initiatives that have been announced. That is completely untrue. Sole traders, partnerships and companies all would benefit from the ability to write-off assets to the value of $5,000 each. In addition to that, the government would provide a head-start reduction in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent for all incorporated small businesses-that is, 720,000 incorporated small businesses. So 2.4 million out of 2.4 million would get the instant write-off; 720,000 would get this small business tax reduction head start. I was asked about reaction to it. Reaction, I am pleased to report, has been very favourable indeed. The Council of Small Business of Australia said: The new tax measures are set to help improve small business cash flow, support increases in production and productivity and promote innovation and entrepreneurial activity. That is good. That is terrific. Even just yesterday, the Australian Newsagents Federation issued a warning that said: The Australian Newsagents' Federation (ANF) is concerned that small businesses may lose the urgently needed tax relief that has been recently announced by the Federal Government. How would they lose that initiative, that tax relief? They would lose it at the hands of the opposition leader. The opposition leader has said that he will try to use the coalition's numbers in the Senate to block the passage of the Resource Super Profits Tax, which is financing these small business tax breaks. What has the opposition leader got against small business? He does not care about small business because it is the revenue source. Let us find a little bit more about reactions to this tax initiative and the stance of the opposition leader on it. When he made his headland speech very recently on 30 March he said this: The economic stimulus wasn't necessary to strengthen Australia's economy at a time of global recession. He is saying that economic stimulus was not necessary. We know their position on the economic stimulus that supported small business. They are opposed to it. They voted against it and they remain opposed to economic stimulus. He said that if you look across the Tasman New Zealand has done just as well as Australia. New Zealand had five quarters of negative growth. New Zealand went into recession. The opposition leader says, ‘If it is good for New Zealand it is good for Australia.' This is a man who has cultivated this ironman image. He has an iron fist in the face of small business. He has an iron fist in the face of working Australians and says: ‘Here's a bit of discipline for you, pal. Here's one up the bracket. We'll show you a little bit of discipline. We'll make you hurt. We'll make you work harder.' That is the attitude of the opposition leader, because he is extreme, he is erratic, he is risky and he is dangerous. He is an extreme, erratic, risky, dangerous opposition leader and he would be an extreme, erratic, risky and dangerous Prime Minister. He betrayed small businesses and the Australian people during the global economic recession and he wants to betray small business and the Australian people during the recovery. The Rudd government is the best friend that small business has ever had.",116
136,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I am not sure a standing order covers copyright on sloganeering, but anyway.",117
137,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer and I refer to page 6-32 of Budget Paper No. 1, which says: Cleaner fuels scheme expenses are expected to increase from 1 July 2011, due to the commencement of payments in relation to gaseous fuels, particularly LPG, made as part of the phasein of effective fuel taxation. Will the Treasurer inform the House what the new excise tax rate to be applied to LPG used in motor vehicles will be, particularly the family car?",117
138,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have been informed that the changes that are contained in that commentary in the budget are a result of the decision of the former government. I am happy to get back to the honourable member with the details he has asked for. Mr Hockey-It's your budget! He doesn't know what's in his budget!,117

140,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Human Services and Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law. How will the budget help encourage personal and national savings, and what stands in the way of Australians receiving the benefits of these important reforms?",117
141,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. The government does believe it is important to provide assistance and support to Australians who are saving for the future. As the Treasurer announced last night, the government is improving the taxation treatment of savings by Australians by cutting the tax rate on their savings by 50 per cent for the first $1,000 of Budget savings. Almost 5.7 million Australian taxpayers will benefit from this measure, and around one-third of the beneficiaries will have incomes below $37,000. Importantly, about 3.3 million Australians will have all of their interest income below the $1,000 cap, therefore receiving the full discount. For too long interest on deposits and other mechanisms has been unfavourably treated compared to capital gains, which are already concessionally taxed. Those capital gains are often out of reach of lowand middleincome earners. This is a very important measure in improving the equity of our tax system. For a taxpayer with a taxable income of around $50,000, the measure will reduce their annual tax liability by up to $177.50. If they reinvest this benefit into their savings account, after five years they will have almost an extra $1,000 in savings. This measure, announced last night, is a very important complement to the superannuation measures announced by the government on 2 May and also contained in last night's budget. These measures boost superannuation not only by increasing the superannuation guarantee but also by giving the contributions tax back to low-income earners and allowing people who are over 50 with low balances in their superannuation accounts to top them up at a concessional tax rate. These are all measures funded by the resource rent superprofits tax, as is the tax concession on savings more generally. They are all measures that the Liberal Party would deny Australians; all measures that the Liberal Party would try and stop Australians having the benefit of. We know that the Leader of the Opposition does not support Australians saving for the future. We know he does not support the increase in the superannuation guarantee, and we also know he does not support tax concessions for superannuation. This is what he had to say in his book, Battlelines: At some point, saving money by keeping people off the pension while forgoing revenue to encourage them to make alternative provision becomes counter-productive. He says: It could be simpler and fairer for the revenue vided in superannuation concessions to be paid as a pension instead. So the Leader of the Opposition would wipe out the tax concessions on the savings of millions of Australians. He would wipe out the tax concessions of people nearing retirement so he could fund the abolition of the age pension means test. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow treasurer, in what we have seen today, have engaged in what has to go down as the weakest response to a federal budget in living memory; the weakest and most pathetic response we have seen in this House on the day after a budget for a long, long time. What we see from the Leader of the Opposition is a plan to cut a swathe through the retirement incomes of Australians, and oppose this government's measures to improve incentives for Australians to save. The Leader of the Opposition said this morning on AM: Everyone will know where we stand. They'll also know what we're against … Well, they are against Australians saving more. We know that. We know they are against superannuation. We know they are against somebody who is aged 30 now on average weekly earnings having $108,000 more in their retirement income. We know this risky and erratic man wants to cut a swathe through the retirement incomes of Australians and oppose incentives for hard working Australians to look after themselves and save more. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",117

143,Mr RUDD,UNITED KINGDOM ELECTIONS," Mr Speaker, also on indulgence, it is right of course that the Leader of the Opposition congratulate his political colleague Mr Cameron on becoming the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

147,Mr RUDD,UNITED KINGDOM ELECTIONS,"I said that the Australia-UK relationship is one which prospers and has prospered since we had Prime Ministers of different persuasions in our respective capitals way back to the time of the war. Mr Cameron indicated he would like to get down to Australia at some stage. We look forward to the foreign secretary in the making, William Hague, making his way to Australia as well. We do a lot with the British in Afghanistan and we do a lot with the British in the G20. This will be a good relationship between Australia and the UK, as it has been in the past and will be in the future. Can I conclude by paying my particular public respects to, of course, Gordon Brown. Gordon Brown has served as a distinguished Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and as a staunch ally and defender of Australian interests as well. Can I say also that his role chairing the G20 meeting in London in April of 2009 was a pivotal event in making sure that the global economic recession then did not slide into something much, much worse. He will go down as a person whose contribution at that critical time in all of our economic destinies was that of a true statesman. I thank the House.

152,Mr HOCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I note that the Treasurer has again refused to debate me on a budget matter. It should not come as a surprise that he has sent the howdy-doody doll, the pretend Paul Keating, out to do his bidding yet again. Yet again the Treasurer has turned away the opportunity to debate me about issues relating to the nation's finances or the nation's economy. That should not be a surprise because we have a Treasurer that is more interested in spin than substance given the various different prebudget spins that he used. At first only a few weeks ago, on 19 March, he said it was ‘pie in the sky' to contemplate surpluses earlier than those that had been previously forecast. He said that to Kerry O'Brien. When I actually wrote an op-ed in the Australian Financial Review outlining how the government could in fact bring the budget back to surplus earlier, not only was that ridiculed but in fact the Treasurer was so unimpressed with that contribution that he tried to do it last night in the budget. He has failed the test, and the test is reality. This government has a tendency to make promises that it cannot deliver. He has a tendency to create expectations that cannot be met. Consider the rather undignified way in which the Treasurer stood up in the chamber today and urged Budget us to come clean on when we would deliver a surplus, when in fact as Treasurer he has never delivered a surplus and as Treasurer he never will deliver a surplus. Yet he is calling on us to give him the path, to set the route, to delivering a surplus some time into the future. Labor will never deliver a surplus under Kevin Rudd. Labor will not do so because even after last year's budget with a $54 billion deficit, which was the biggest spending budget in a generation, and even after last year's budget where the government predicted the end of the world as we know itso even under the terms of those budget parameters-in this budget the government has increased spending by $26 billion. If you thought they were throwing in the steak knives, wait because there is more. There is a 2010-11 budget that will spend an extra $26 billion. In fact, the 2010-11 budget forecasts a massive $40.8 billion deficit. It took 25 minutes for the Treasurer to get the words out last night of a deficit of $40.8 billion. Do you know why? Because the fact of the matter is that, when they actually deliver a surplus according to their own forecasts, by that stage this government would have borrowed over $700 million a week to fund their deficit. That is $100 million per day, every day, to fund their deficit. Then the hard task of repaying the $93 billion starts. What is it with Labor and $90 billion debts? Anna Bligh now has apparently something like $90 billion of debt in Queensland. Paul Keating left $96 billion of debt. If a change of government does come at the next election, how much is the Labor Party debt going to be? Around $90 billion. It is something that is fixed in the DNA of the Labor Party: leave the debt and get the coalition to do the hard yards of paying off the debt. That is because the Labor Party loves to spend money. Of the entire budget numbers, of all the budget parameters, of all the budget estimates, there is only one number you can rely on Labor to deliver, and that is how much they are going to spend. But it goes even further. That is not even an accurate figure from time to time, because in 12 months under this government we have had blow-outs on the NBS. We have had a $1 billion-plus blow-out on the PBS. We are now spending $1 billion to fix up their failed border tion policy. We are now spending $1 billion to fix up their pink batt program-what a disaster that was, costing four lives. Now we are spending $500 million on a new health bureaucracy. What upsets me most about that spending program is that only a few weeks ago Kevin Rudd solemnly promised the Australian people that there would be no new health bureaucracy associated with his hospitals plan. That is what he promised. Well, he misled the Australian people-$500 million on a new health bureaucracy. This is the Prime Minister who said that the greatest moral, social and economic challenge of our time was dealing right now with climate change. Of course, what happens? He dumps the ETS. Again, we remain a little confused, as Australians would be, with last night's budget. The Treasurer spent a lot of time talking about the emissions trading scheme and dealing with climate change, but it was not in the budget numbers. Let us get this right: last year, the government had the ETS in the budget numbers but they failed to deliver it. This year, they have not got it in the budget numbers but they say they are going to deliver it. This is everything about Labor. Do you know why they took it out of their budget numbers? Because it would have added a full one per cent of GDP to their expenditure and about the same, one per cent of GDP, to their revenue, which would have made them by far one of the biggest governments in recent times. The government set the parameters on expenditure and revenue. They could not meet those parameters three weeks ago, so they go into a flat panic and start to change everything that they promised. Remember the double drop-off for mums at the last election. The government were going to deliver more than 200 child-care centres. They dropped off the double drop-off. They dropped it off. Those child-care centres-whooshprotecdisappeared. We remember that they were going to have pink batt program mark 2. Pink batt mark 1 was such a successful program that they wanted to do it all again. They were chiding us to support program mark 2. We did not agree to that-and, thank God, we did not, because they could not hold that policy for 24 days, let alone 24 months. When it comes to expenditure, the Labor Party never let you down on the programs from the last election. Remember computers in schools-a $1 billion program; it is now $2 billion, probably for half the number of computers. Remember the $150 million solar panel program. It blew out by $850 million. Everything seems to be $1 billion. Everything rounds out at $1 billion. There is $1 billion extra on computers in schools, $1 billion extra on border protection, $1 billion to fix up pink batts, and the government is going to deliver $1 billion surplus in three years time. As if that is a monstrous figure to Labor-a $1 billion surplus in three years time! Roughly, it is somewhere between one-third and one-quarter of one per cent of expenditure under Labor. The heroic deed out of last night's budget is that Labor are laying claim to a budget surplus they will never deliver. Labor are laying claim to something three years in the future, and they are doing it heroically as if they have been the poor sods that have had to carry the whole world on their shoulders over the last 12 months. Kevin Rudd saved the world, and now Kevin Rudd is redefining the world as a world that revolves around his spending promises and, today, a world that he says revolves around his values. The Prime Minister is a person who does not have values when it comes to the management of the country. The Prime Minister used the most powerful words a Prime Minister could invoke: ‘the greatest, moral, social and economic challenge of our time'. Imagine if Keating, Hawke, Howard, Whitlam, Fraser, John Curtin, Ben Chifley or Robert Menzies were to use words as powerful as those-you would walk into the trenches with them, you would walk out of the trenches with them, you would follow them to the end of the earth because, as our Prime Minister of Australia, they are using wartime words that declare the greatest challenge for our nation in the view of our leader. And then the Prime Minister dumped that. He claimed just before the dumping that you would be a political coward if you did not move now. The Prime Minister has defined his own person. He is a political coward. The Prime Minister said: ‘It is the greatest moral, social and economic challenge of our time.' I will tell you what the greatest social and economic challenge of our time is: it is to get rid of Kevin Rudd. That is our great challenge. And we are going to do it because the Prime Minister is reckless. The Prime Minister is reckless with his words. The Prime Minister is reckless with his actions. The Prime Minister is reckless with his spending. Australians are going to pay a heavy price, because it is not just about the $100 million every day that this government is borrowing in order to spend between now and 2012-13; it goes beyond that. It is a $93 billion debt, with a $6 billion interest bill every year. That is $6 billion that cannot be spent on health, education, national security or defence. It is $6 billion that is not availference able every year to help the most vulnerable and the most needy in our community. This government talks about caring but it does not care. This government talks big on rhetoric but it is not a government that is built on substance. It is not a government that is built on values. We have come to the conclusion, as have the Australian people, that the more the government talks about values, the fewer values it has. The more the government talks about courage, oh what little courage it has. The more the government talks about fiscal conservatism-as the Leader of the Opposition identified todayone wonders why it is that they suddenly become fiscal conservatives around election time. It is because the Prime Minister is a chameleon. Between elections, the Prime Minister spends recklessly. He spends money on a whole range of different things. One that we happened to come across in the budget papers only last night was a $10 million grant to a trade union for an education fund. It is a one-off $10 million grant to one of the Prime Minister's anti-Work Choices campaign mates, the Trade Union Education Foundation, for the development and delivery of moral, national workplace education programs. Strike me light! Of all the things you could spend $10 million on, a development and delivery program for national workplace education initiatives is the one that would ring the bells. I was at a fundraiser for Charlie Teo's Cure for Life on Saturday night where I heard the most distressing stories, as did a thousand other people, about people who have suffered brain tumours. Ninety-four per cent of people who suffer a brain tumour die. It is very sad. As the people from Cure for Life were desperately trying to raise money from the audience I thought to myself: ‘Wouldn't a million dollars make a huge difhere? Wouldn't a million dollars or $10 million or $100 million or a billion dollars make a huge difference to the lives of so many people if it were money well spent?' That is why my colleagues and I get so damned angry about the waste. That is why we get so angry about the government's spending $1 billion fixing up a pink batts program, spending $1 billion fixing up a failed border protection program and spending $500 million on new health bureaucrats. We get upset because the job of doing the right thing for Australia is unfinished. Money is precious and our future is precious, but we have a Prime Minister who is careless and reckless. He is reckless with money and careless with his words. We stand for the right of the Australian people to a prosperous and vibrant land in the future, the government is doing everything it can to destroy the opportunities for our children and beyond.",120
153,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Prospect-Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law and Minister for Human Services) (3.54 pm)-We have heard a lot from the opposition about deficits in recent times, we have a shadow Treasurer with a massive credibility deficit in this country. We shadow Treasurer who cannot make a basic or simple point about the budget papers or the budget. You know an opposition is having difficulty on the day after a federal budget is brought down and you know they are not attacking matters of substance in the budget when they start attacking the forecasts, when they start attacking the Treasury modellers and when they say, ‘Our biggest problem with this budget is the forecasts; biggest problem is the modelling.' That is always the case with an opposition. You know they are in trouble when they start doing that. But it is particularly the case with this opposition, because this shadow Treasurer has form. We had projections and forecasts in last year's budget, as we do in every budget, and the shadow Treasurer came out then and said they were wrong. He said, ‘We don't believe the forecasts; we don't believe the projections.' On 13 May last year he said: The Treasury has some pretty heroic assumptions in their forecasts for how quickly we come out of this recession. Of course, forecasts and projections are not an exact science. Things can change. But last year's forecasts and projections were the Treasury's best estimates. They were conservative. They were the best indication that the our Treasury could give about what would happen to the budget and the economy. We know now that they were not exactly right, but they but certainly were not ‘heroic'. They certainly were not too optimistic. The shadow Treasurer now has an even bigger credibility problem because he is trying to rewrite history. He is trying to airbrush the transcript. He is trying to rewrite what he said 12 months ago in order to boost his credibility today. He tried to do this just yesterday, almost 12 but months exactly from the day on which he said that the Treasury's estimates last year have a were too optimistic. He said this: They were saying, and we were taking their advice, as you were, that this was the end of the world. Well, it wasn't the end of the world. Last year the shadow Treasurer said the Treasury was too optimistic, and now he is saying that last year they were too pessimistic. So the shadow Treasurer has a credibility deficit problem of Greek proportions. If Standard and Poor's were rating the credibilour ity deficit of the shadow Treasurer they would give it junk bond status because he has no credibility. There is a yawning credibility gap when it comes to his statements about this budget, and this is before we get to the shadow Treasurer's comments about how long it would take this government to return to surplus. In his famous interview on Sunday on Insiders, he was asked by Barry Cassidy: What's a reasonable time-frame, a reasonable timetable for returning to surplus? The shadow Treasurer replied: Well they could do it if they tried in three years … But the thing is Barrie they have locked in five to six years of deficits for just three months of negative economic growth-five to six years of deficits. That is a pretty spectacular own goal from the shadow Treasurer-the alternative Treasurer of this country. The decent thing for the shadow Treasurer to do after he said that on Sunday would be to say, ‘Well, I said if they tried they could do it in three years, and they have. Well done. I said if they made cuts and made an appropriate fiscal policy setting then they could do it in three years, and they have done it. So good on them. Well done.' But this shadow Treasurer would never do that, and this Leader of the Opposition would never let him. That is why this shadow Treasurer has a massive credibility deficit. The opposition does not want to talk about the return to surplus, but I do. I want to talk about this budget's projections and this budget's forecasts because they are so important. But the shadow Treasurer will raise every other issue that he can think of to avoid talking about the projections for return to surplus because it has undermined the very centrepiece of the opposition's political campaign. It has undermined the very centrepiece of everything they have said for the last two years. Everything the opposition have said about the government's fiscal settings lies in tatters. The fact of the matter is that, when this country was faced with a massive downturn in the world, the worse downturn in 75 years, the global financial crisis, we took the view that it was necessary and prudent to stimulate the economy. We did that because we felt it was the best way to keep unemployment as low as possible, but we also did it because we felt it was the best way to keep government finances as robust as they could be for as long as possible. We knew that, if you had a long and sustained downturn with unemto four ployment higher than necessary, government revenue would go down, government expenditure would go up and you would have a bigger deficit for longer than you needed. We knew that. We made the judgment that it was necessary to stimulate the economy-yes, to go into deficit and, yes, to stimulate the economy through expansionary policies but to do so in order to maintain and protect government finances in the medium term by avoiding a long, prolonged and deep downturn. The opposition took many positions on this. It took them a long time to work out what their position was, but eventually they decided that this stimulus would not work. The shadow Treasurer and the then Leader of the Opposition said it would not create one job, it would not work and it would not stimulate the economy and they opposed it. Fair enough-that was their position, but their position today lies in tatters. They said the government would lead us to what they called monstrous, unimaginable debt and huge deficits. They warned that Australia may go into default. They warned that catastrophe would rain down upon us because this government dared to stimulate the economy to keep unemployment low and to protect finances in the long run. They warned of calamity and it has not happened. In fact, something quite the opposite has happened. We have a deficit this year of 2.9 per cent of GDP, compared to the average for major advanced economies, the nations we compare ourselves with, of 9.5 per cent. We have our net debt peaking at 6.1 per cent of GDP. The average for major advanced economies will peak at well over 90 per cent of GDP. We will have Australia returning to surplus before any other advanced economy, and we will do so while protecting our AAA rating, all through the downturn and in the upswing as well. We are doing what we said we would do. When the budget went into deficit we said we would implement some fiscal rules to make sure it returned to plus as soon as possible. We said we would limit real growth in government spending to two per cent and we would bank any improvements in tax revenue to see us go into surplus. I saw the shadow Treasurer again on Insiders, in a particularly sloppy performance, educating the Australian people and lecturing us about what ‘real' means. He said, ‘You've got to remember, when they say it's real growth, that is over and above inflation.' He pointed out that it is possible for government spending in total terms to increase by more than two per cent. We appreciate his insights into that, but he was saying it was easy. He was saying, ‘They don't have a real test on government spending. It's not a proper restriction on government spending. It'll be very easy to meet.' The analysis shows that in fact the previous government rarely met that test. In eight out of the 10 years before the global financial crisis, government spending grew by more than two per cent in real terms and the average was 3.7 per cent-almost double. Now that they have the luxury of opposition, where they can carp and criticise and whine, they say, ‘Two per cent is easy,' but it is something they could not achieve in their 12 years in office. And we are doing this while we are setting up the economy to the future. The MPI today is about the budget's so called failure to secure the future of the economy. We are returning the budget to surplus ahead of any other major advanced economy while we are conducting a major reform of the health system, making a massive investment Australia's health and hospital system and making a very significant investment in skills so that when the economy returns to growth we are not faced with the sorts of skills crises and skills shortages that economies often are faced with as they come out of a downturn. We are doing things like sur- reducing corporate tax, but, perhaps most importantly, we are doing so while setting up Australia, with the ageing of the Australian population, with massive improvements to our superannuation system. We are increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent, effectively repaying the contributions tax of low-income earners and allowing people over 50 to catch up on their superannuation payments if they have a low balance. As our population ages it is so important that we bolster superannuation. We will add half a trillion dollars to the savings pool in superannuation over the next 25 years with these reforms, and the opposition just do not get it. They oppose it. They oppose the increase in the SG and they say there is no link to the resource rent superprofits tax. They say the SG will not cost the government any money. The shadow Treasurer said this in that infamous interview on Sunday and he said it again last night. It appears he has not read the budget papers, because the budget papers make it clear that the increase in the superannuation guarantee will cost the government in revenue forgone over $3 billion a year by the time the superannuation guarantee hits 12 per cent. The shadow Treasurer says it will not cost one dollar-he is right about that: it is not one dollar; it is $3 billion and it is linked to the resource rent superprofits tax. He just does not get basic economics. They oppose these measures. They oppose our measures to introduce a fairer, more equitable and more efficient tax system in Australia, which all the modelling shows will increase economic activity, both in the mining sector and more generally. The party who are supposedly the party of free enterprise opposes the reduction in the broad corporate tax rate. They oppose the reduction in corporate taxes for small business. They oppose the reduction in corporate taxes for big ness and they would whack a big tax on all big and medium sized business in this country. They are supposedly the party of lower tax, but they ran a government which was the highest-taxing government in the history of the Australian Federation. They have the temerity after all that to introduce a matter of public importance in this House which alleges that the budget has not secured the ture of the Australian economy. The Australian economy has been through a difficult time. The world economy has been through a difficult time. And two years ago, if you had predicted that the Australian economy would have performed as well as it has over the past two years, many people would have questioned your predictionand, indeed, may have questioned your sanity. The Australian government, working together with businesses, employers, unions, other governments, the Reserve Bank and exporters, has seen the Australian economy come through the global financial crisis in the best shape of the world's advanced major economies. That is an achievement the opposition would deny for cheap political purposes. That is an achievement they stood against when they stood in this chamber against the stimulus, when they voted against the stimulus at four or five in the morning, when they debated through the night to oppose the stimulus because they saw it as such an important matter, and when they saw it as a matter on which they stood as a major distinction between the government and themselves. They stood against jobs. They stood against keeping government finances robust by stimulating the economy to avoid a long and deep recession in Australia. They stood against the creation of 200,000 jobs. They stood against a plan which saw the Australian economy grow when every piece of modelling shows it would have shrunk, when every other major advanced economy of busicomparative size in the world shrank over that period. Our actions and the actions of Australians who worked with us saw the economy grow and jobs created. And the opposition still does not get it: the challenge now falls to us, having helped Australia through the global financial crisis, to assist Australia in the recovery, to build on that, to capitalise on that. fu- The opposition stood against those things, and that is their right, but now they stand against Australia building on our achievements of the past two years, on the achievements of all Australians. They simply do not get economics, and perhaps that shows why we have seen today the weakest response to a federal budget that we have seen in living memory. It is a response from a shadow Treasurer and a Leader of the Opposition which has left commentators gasping with disbelief that they could be so poor in their response, that they are reduced to attacking the Treasury modellers, as they did last year and as perhaps they will do in the future. But it just goes to show: the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia have lost all claims to economic credibility.",123
154,Mr TRUSS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Last night's budget simply lacks credibility. It is a budget that is closely associated with spin, but has no spine. It is a typical Labor document: all about the spin but completely lacking in substance. The Treasurer said it was going to be boring, partly because he had released all of the details in the previous weeks to make sure there would be nothing interesting on budget night. He did this because he had a secret plan. He hoped that by pretending the budget was boring and had nothing of content in it he could get away with quietly and secretly putting his hand in your pocket to take more money out-to hurt Australians across the country with higher taxes and increased burden, but little value upon which it was spent. The centrepiece of this budget is clearly three or four major new taxes. The most obvious one is the big new tax on mining to raise billions and billions of dollars. This is not just a tax on big multinational corporations, as the government would try to pretend. It is not even just a tax that will the super funds and mum and dad investors. All of those are also being hurt. Indeed, in the very first week we saw something like $15 billion wiped off the value of Australia's superannuation funds as a direct result of Labor's big new tax. They claim they are the friends of superannuation. They have their acolytes out there boasting about and welcoming some kind of additional tax on employers so that there can be better superannuation savings. But, at the same time, they are imposing taxes which tear away at the investments of individuals for their retirement and severely damage the superannuation funds. But this great big new tax affects us also in everything else that we do. Our electricity prices will be higher because coal and gas will be more expensive. Our houses will be more expensive to build because bricks and cement will be more expensive. Our food will be more expensive because the fertiliser and the farm input costs all go up as a result of Labor's big new tax on mining. So this is like so many other Labor taxes: a tax on ordinary Australians. It is a tax on the household budget. It is not just a tax on Rio Tinto and BHP and other large corporations; it is a tax on pensioners, it is a tax on Australian families and will badly damage their day-today budget. The second tax, which I have already mentioned, is the big new superannuation guarantee levy, which will add substantially to the cost of all Australian employers, including hundreds of thousands of employers who are not going to get any tax cuts. The government has been boasting about the fact that they are offering some small taxation concessions for company tax to small business. But only about 12 per cent of small businesses pay company tax. And yet all of them who have employees are going to have affect to pay the new superannuation tax. Of course, the third big Labor tax that is lurking around like a redback in an outback dunny is Labor's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. One minute it is gone, the next minute it is back. We do know there is funding in the budget to keep the bureaucracy rolling over, and everyone knows that in reality, after they have endured all of this taxation splurge, there is still more that Labor has in its mind. No-one can ever escape those taxes; they are going to cost jobs and investment and prosperity all over the country, and that is especially going to be in regional Australia because so many of these industries that are going to cop the big new taxation regime are employing people outside of the capital cities. But in spite of all these new taxes, we still have a deficit this year in the budget of almost $41 billion-the second-highest deficit since World War II, when our nation was mobilised to fight a rather expensive war on two fronts. Australia had a lot to show for the deficits in the 1940s: we won a war, we secured our peace. But I do not think the people of Australia are going to march on ANZAC Days in the future to commemorate the construction in 2009-10 of school halls and dodgy roof insulation. I do not think they are going to be as joyous about the building up of a huge deficit for wasteful government programs as they were when our country was at war. If you want to look at the centrepieces of the expenditure side of this budget, look no further than the $1 billion for the cost overruns on the school computer program, the extra $1 billion for managing asylum seekers and the $1 billion to undo the insulation scheme. The latter is an extraordinary program-$1.4 billion to put insulation in people's roofs and now $1 billion to take it out. It reminds me a bit of the old Whitlam RED scheme-dig the hole and then pay somebody else to fill it up. That is what we have in this particular instance-$1.4 billion to put insulation in people's roofs and $1 billion to take it out. And it is all on the budget cit; it all adds to the budget deficit, and it will all have to be paid off. The great honour of the Rudd Labor government, its great legacy for the people of Australia, is that it has delivered the two gest peacetime budget deficits in our nation's history. That is the record of the Rudd Labor government. The fiscal conservative, the person who said on television screens before the last election that he was going to balance the budget, that he believed in balanced budgets, has delivered the two biggest budget deficits in our nation's history. I heard last night that Visa had sponsored Labor's budget party in Parliament House-probably an appropriate choice of sponsor because another $41 billion has gone on the Australian government's Visa card. In this instance, the Australian people have to pay it all back. The Treasurer last night told us that the cards were all going to fall into place and that it was all being done under the highest standards of responsible economic management. Yet he is basing this budget on the predictions that we will have the best terms of trade our country has seen for 60 years, that our exports will grow every year, that there will be substantial investment growth, of something like 20 per cent a year, that unemployment will fall and that inflation will not go above 2½ per cent. This is simply not credible. All that is supposedly going to lead to a $1 billion surplus in three years time. Well, as we heard in question time today, Labor cannot keep budgets within tens of billions of dollars, so anyone who believes there will be a surplus of $1 billion in three year's time simply has not been watching Labor in government. One other point that I find very interesting is that the government is predicting that the new excise slug on cigarettes will result in fewer people smoking. That is the excuse for this big new tax. So a 25 per cent increase in defithe excise on smoking is going to reduce smoking; however, a 40 per cent tax on mining is going to increase, to boost, mining expenditure! That is simply not logical. The finance minister came in today and big- said-and he said it once previously-that this budget kills stone-dead the coalition's debt and deficit argument. He is wrong, by $100 million a day. Every day, with this budget and the budgets that are to follow, Labor will be out in the marketplace borrowing $100 million from the Chinese, from the Middle East, from Europe and from Australians. The government will be competing with business and with homeowners for money to pay for their deficits. As a result, there will also be upward pressure on interest rates. So I assure the finance minister that the coalition's debt and deficit argument is not stone-dead-it is well and truly alive, and it is alive by $100 million every day. Every day we wait for a change of government we will be $100 million poorer as a nation. Labor's previous budgets did not stand the test of time. None of them fulfilled their promises. This time, we are being asked to believe it will be third time lucky. That is simply not going to happen. Labor's adherence to the Charter of Budget Honesty is in theory only. The Prime Minister's claim to be an economic conservative is simply empty. This is a big-taxing, big-spending government. They have learnt nothing from the damage they have inflicted on the Australian economy over the last couple of years. The Australian people are going to continue to pay $100 million every day to pay for the debt in the budget that has been brought down and for Labor's plans for the future. This is not a responsible government. They have lost the right to be the managers of the Australian economy. (Time expired)",126
155,Mr SHORTEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"MaribyrnongParliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services and Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction) (4.19 pm)-I wish to support the view that the government budget of last night helps secure Australia's economic future, building on our previous actions. Last night's budget aims, with responsible management, to have peak debt and to get back in the black in three years-three years early. Firstly, my case relies upon the fact that the details of the budget are good for ordinary people, with the tax cuts and key investments which have been spelt out. Secondly, many independent commentators have assessed last night's budget, which has been put before the parliament, very positively. Thirdly, any fair-minded comparison with the rest of the world shows that that our tions are working well. The alternative solutions proposed by the opposition are both inconsistent and not in the national interest. Every year with a budget is a tough year, and, with the global financial crisis, recent years have been tough and they have been messy. The Rudd government understand that we face an opposition that is hungry to sit where we sit and to have the power that we have, and they will not be too scrupulous about how they achieve that. I also acknowledge that, now that the luxury of watching the Liberal Party's imbecilic leadership vaudeville show is over, the opposition will grit their teeth and unite behind the Leader of the Opposition because there is too much at stake for them not to. Malcolm Turnbull, the member for Wentworth, has been in the tent, has been out of the tent, has tried to pull the tent down and is now back in the tent. But I am sure that even he will pull his head in as the election approaches. They will throw every economic smear, every economic scare campaign and every economic label they can at us. I acknowledge they are led by a man with 20 years experience inside the Liberal Party, as a staffer, a minister, a confidante and a hatchet man of the former Prime Minister. He has been known to describe himself as the ideological love child of the member for Mackellar and the former Prime Minister. Indeed, looking at economic strategies, I understand that in the film Back to the Future Marty MCFly and the doc required a souped-up DeLorean sports car to travel back, whereas in this case the Leader of the Opposition simply did it by naming his shadow cabinet. I acknowledge that as part of their economic strategy they have exhumed the political careers of a number of people, probably to their own surprise. We need to remind the public of what this opposition stands for economically. We also need ac- to remind the public that the government is the party of the big picture, the big idea and the big policy. I believe that this budget passed last night demonstrates that we are not distracted by the 24-hour news cycle or the carping of commentators who would attack this government. Last night we announced major changes to the tax system. We will lower company tax for small business. We will raise retirement incomes for workers by increasing employer superannuation contributions to 12 per cent, and we will look after lower income earners with a $500 rebate. Superannuation was opposed by the conservatives when the last Labor government brought it in, and the rate remained stuck on nine per cent through the Howard years. Now there is progress in superannuationthe best and most sustainable way for Australians to fund their retirements. We will also be changing the tax system so that Australians get a fair share of the profits from the development of our mineral resources-those resources which are our birth right as the lucky country. The $35 billion in revenue lost in the past decade as mining profits raced ahead of royalties paid will not be lost over the coming years. It be contributed towards the infrastructure we need for our future, to helping lower tax rates, so ensuring that other parts of our verse economy can in fact thrive. I believe last night's budget did demonstrate that we are the party of economic responsibility in the interests of ordinary tralians in Australia. We have aimed to end government debt by 2012-13. We will have better health with $2.2 billion for hospitals and the significant addition of skills training to make sure that our workforce is equipped to tackle new challenges and that economic recovery does not stall because of the skills shortage. Indeed, we have delivered on the tax cuts we promised and have also made it easier for people to claim a tax deduction with a tick-and-flick approach rather than the lengthy and laborious process that is currently in place. We are determined that people will get the opportunities they deserve. particular, we are engaged-as I alluded toin the largest reform of health since Medicare, trying to secure a sustainable future for ernment. public hospitals in primary care. I acknowledge that the project is almost vertigo-inducing in its scope and ambition. It is a project that will affect and support every Australian who uses a hospital. Our skills policy will ensure that we have the right set of skills for people. But it is also easy, when we look at last night's budget, to forget how far we have come economically in recent years, to forget how much has changed over the past two and a bit years since the Rudd government was elected and to forget what in fact has been achieved. I believe that, when you look at the steps of our stimulus package and the support of our financial institutions, we have weathered in a far better capacity the economic storms that the rest of the world has experienced. All reasonable comparisons with other major will advanced economies throughout the world demonstrate that the Australian economy is in good shape. This has occurred through a di- combination of factors, but there can be no doubt that the macroeconomic policies of the government in the past year and a half are part of the contribution towards the success Aus- of our economic performance compared with the other major developed economies with whom we trade. The fact that our debt as a proportion of GDP is so much smaller at 2.9 per cent than the 9.5 per cent average across our major advanced economic partners demonstrates how well we have been performing. The fact that unemployment, which is such an important issue, is so much lower on average than that of our economic partners demonstrates our ongoing commitment to making sure that fighting unemployment remains not just a priority but the outcome of our economic policies. Keeping people in In jobs-supporting people in jobs-through the global financial crisis has in fact been one of the hallmarks of this successful govThird-party commentators-people who do not have a particular axe to grind for either the Liberal Party or the Labor Party or the country branch of the Liberal Party, the National Party-have made observations to which I would like to draw the attention of the House. Kyran Curry, from Standard and Poor's, said: The projected deficit and additional borrowings over the next three years did not alter the sound profile of Australia's public finances, mained the strongest of its peer group. Robert Jeremenko, from the Taxation Institute of Australia, said last night: The Taxation Institute welcomes the government's positive steps towards simplifying tax time for millions of Australians. The government's moves to introduce an optional $500 tax deduction for work related expenses and also managing tax affairs, phasing up to $1,000, is that will vastly reduce compliance costs for millions of taxpayers. Pauline Vamos, from the Association of Superannuation Funds, said last night: By confirming their response to the Henry review, what the government has done is ensure that the majority of Australians will retire on an adequate and comfortable standard of living. She also said that we have seen equity restored by allowing low-income earners a rebate in their contributions tax. From the Macquarie Group, Brian Redican said last night: What's positive is that theythe governmentare allowing the improvement to flow through to the deficit rather than spending more, which is always a temptation in an election year. This temptation, I sadly report, was not one which the now opposition could resist in the years that they were in government. To continue his quote: That, in turn, means there's less upward pressure on interest rates. John Brogden, former New South Wales Liberal leader and now CEO of IFSA, said: The policy announced by the government eight days ago is good for Australia and good for Australians. This is referring to the superannuation changes. He also said: It will deliver an extraordinary benefit to the economy, and there is no argument that it can't be which re- afforded by business. John Brogden went on to say: This is visionary policy. It is visionary for Australia's retirement incomes, and it is visionary for the Australian economy. Ms MCKew-He's right.",129
156,Mr SHORTEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And he is right. I understand, as the member for Bennelong says, a great step Mr Brogden is right. He said: I understand what the critics of the super tax on mining are trying to do. They are trying to link the negative effect on the mining industry with the negative effect on the superannuation industry. These figures today here indicate pretty clearly that it simply does not hold up. It does not hold up in the short term and it does not hold up in the long term. Through this budget and by supporting the other measures, which we have done in the past two years, Australia is becoming a better and fairer place due to the Rudd's government's determination to meet its economic commitments with fairness. It should not be forgotten that we raised pensions for the aged and for people with disability. Unlike previous governments, which have sought to buy the votes of pensioners with one-off handouts, we have put it into their base rate, which allows people to count on it. When I listen to the Liberal Party's scare campaign on debt, I think that the fact that we are going to pay off our debt quicker than anyone expected demonstrates the solidity and responsibility of an excellent budget last night.",131
157,Mr ROBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This budget and its outcomes are simply not believable. It is a house of cards. It is a con. The surpluses forecast in this budget are manufactured with new taxes-taxes pulled out of the hat some two to three weeks ago when the government saw that the budget parameters were not going to be met. This government was spooked. This government had knee-jerk policy for crass political purposes. These surpluses are based on minerals growth and new taxes yet the minerals growth will be choked off by the biggest of these taxes, the $9 billion a year tax on mining. No-one can have confidence in the forecast as a consequence of these new taxesnew taxes which were literally conceived in the last two to three weeks, new taxes which received no consultation with business, new taxes which put $9 billion a year on our strongest and most profitable sector in this economy in a world which faces great uncertainty. I had a call from a friend of mine a few days ago. The friend runs some significant mines in countries in Asia, countries that have some political risk. This friend of mine rang the other day and said he is no longer being asked about political risk in Asia. He said the sovereign risk which has always dogged his attempts to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to invest in these Asian tries is now similarly enjoyed by Australia. Australia is now the laughing stock of sharemarkets around the world because they cannot understand how the government of Australia-so blessed with resources, so blessed with the opportunity to protect itself against further shocks in the world financial markets-would seek to tax those companies that exploit those resources in a way which would make Australian companies uncompetitive. They cannot understand how a government would reduce the competitiveness of our mining companies and impose an effective tax level of 57 per cent, when the nearest tax level of other competing countries is 40 per cent in the United States, 38 per cent in Brazil and lower for every other country. This means that many of the new projects-the $310 billion worth of projects that are being considered by companies at the present time-will not pass the hurdle rate, will not pass the necessary return on investment, because our mining industries are facing an effective rate of tax of 57 per cent. It is a disgrace. It does indicate the lack of instinct that this government has for the risk associated with business, for the way in which decisions are taken with regard to these major resources. It does show the political crassness of this government and the way in which it goes about constructing important documents like this budget. There is great uncertainty associated with the forecast side of resources. By putting a great big new tax on, already we are seeing many projects that are no longer being considered or are being put on a shelf so that companies can reconsider where those investments go. Already people are being put off in terms of potential job opportunities. Combine that with the forecast increase in spending-a $26 billion blow-out in spending over the next three years in this budgetcounand you see the pressure on interest rates going up, and uncertainty associated with the spending programs and with the forecast revenue. This budget confirms this is a government that is losing its way. (Time expired)",131
158,Ms KING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have to admit that when I saw the terms for the MPI moved by the opposition this morning I had to check the date, as I thought it was April Fool's Day and someone was having a lend of me. Here we have a budget that reflects the policy successes of the past 18 months, reflects that the economy is in recovery and builds on these successes to secure our economic future, and the opposition moves this motion in these terms. They must be kidding themselves. Look at what has actually happened over the course of the last year. We come to this debate from a period of severe economic difficulty across the globe. Many OECD countries have fallen into recession as a result of the global financial crisis. The GFC has cost many countries a considerable number of jobs and has provided a severe dent for their long-term economic sustainability. Just last year the IMF forecasted that the Australian economy would contract by 1.4 per cent in 2009. But, as a result of the stimulus package put in place by the government in the last budget, the Australian economy actually grew by 1.4 per cent across 2009. That growth has not happened by accident. It has been on the back of the stimulus and on the back of the hard work of local communities and employers keeping people in work. Had we followed the opposition's advice-which in essence was to do nothing-we would be in recession today and thousands of people would be out of work. We now find ourselves in a position where the Australian economy has performed where other countries have not. Thankfully, because of the Rudd government's economic management, we are now in a strong position to move forward. The government understands that, while we may have proven resilient throughout the global financial crisis, we now need to use this opportunity to set our economy up for the future-not throw away opportunities as happened under the Howard government. When we came to government the economy was facing significant capacity constraints, through lack of investment by the previous government in infrastructure, skills and trainof ing. The previous government had failed to invest in those areas to drive the productivity and future growth of the economy. The government used the opportunity of the economic stimulus in last year's budget to try and turn this around so that, as the economy recovered from the global financial crisis, we would be in a stronger position to grow. This budget seeks to build on that investment. Firstly, there is our commitment to keeping our finances strong. The government took action to protect jobs during the global financial crisis, and we now plan to protect and create jobs into the future by securing our economic position. Our strong financial discipline, as shown in this budget, ensures we get back to surplus in three years-three years earlier than predicted, and ahead of every major advanced economy. While other advanced economies have faced recession, subsequent job losses and long term deficits, Australia has avoided a recession, created 225,000 jobs and will return the budget to surplus earlier. It is no secret that our population is ageing and the cost of health is rising. We have recognised the challenges that this poses for our nation, and that is why the Rudd government has focused on health and hospital reform. This budget supports our National Health and Hospitals Network by further delivering $2.2 billion of investment into health over the next four years. We have worked hard to reform and invest in our health system because we know how important this is for the long term sustainability of the healthcare system. The 2010-11 budget also addresses the cost-of-living pressures for families. It is Australian families that have worked so hard in the wake of the global financial crisis, and it is Australian families that are now being rewarded for their hard work. The government is supporting families with a new round personal tax cuts from 1 July 2010. This is the third round of tax cuts in the three years of this government. The budget also addresses our actions towards improving Australia's economic capacity. I am delighted that this budget invests significantly in skills and infrastructure, with a $661 million investment to help people boost their qualificaconcerns tions by taking part in some 40,000 additional training places and support for 22,500 new apprentices, which builds on the Apprentice Kickstart program. We have also expanded on our nation-building agenda by continuing our commitment to local roads and infrastructure. With this budget we have acted to create jobs, to fund and reform our health and hospital system, to save and bring us back to surplus early, to invest in infrastructure and build our nation's capacity, and to boost newable energy and tackle climate change. This budget is all about taking advantage of our strong economic position and setting our nation up for the future. NA Parliamentary Library Committee Membership",132

Question agreed to. NA NA BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed.",134
161,Ms BURKE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"In continuing my remarks I will not take too much time. I was saying just before question time that the government has listened to the of consumers who have asked for the extension of the cut-off period from three to five years, and we will be doing that. At the end of April 40 per cent had reregistered numbers, leaving the majority of people vulnerable to having their numbers dropped off at the end of this month. This bill lengthens the registration period for numbers registered on the do-not-call list, initially from three to five years, including existing registrations. This will prevent numbers from dropping off the register from the end of this month causre- ing untold grief to re-emerge in people's homes. It will also give certainty back to the industry as well, so it will assist people within the telemarketing community not to have to redo the whole list again. So it is a win-win for all concerned. The bill will also reinstate any numbers that drop off the register between the end of the month and the time at which the bill commences. As soon as these amendments come into effect, the numbers of those who registered later in 2007 will not need to be re-registered until 2012. That is why we need to get the bill through as quickly as possible today. The government has been particularly concerned that unwanted and unsolicited calls could potentially affect the operation of emergency service organisations and that unwanted and unsolicited faxes are wasting valuable business resources. Again, we have listened to consumers' concerns, especially the emergency services. The receipt of telemarketing calls by emergency service organisations is quite troubling, as these calls may potentially impact on emergency service responses. Telemarketers are bypassing emergency numbers such as 000 and directly contacting emergency service operators such as the fire brigade through the use of predictive dialling equipment. These calls divert emergency resources while the telemarketing calls are being answered. This is an absolute disgrace. There have also been concerns raised by fax owners. Indeed, many small businesses and individuals in my electorate have contacted me about the bombardment via fax from unwanted marketing. The register does not allow them to opt out of receiving unsolicited commercial faxes at present. Much of the cost of marketing faxes is transferred to the recipient-in fact, all the cost is predominantly transferred to the recipient in time, productivity and the tying up of communications equipment as well as additional costs of consumables. Small businesses are waiting for business to come through the fax; they do not want it to be tied up with unsolicited marketing. The bill enables the expansion of the register to enable the registration of emergency service and government telephone numbers and all fax numbers. This is a welcome addition, and one that many in the community have been calling for. These amendments will benefit any Australian who owns a fax machine or has an interest in the efficient operation of emergency service organisations as well as government agencies. All of us know that in our electorate offices a ridiculous number of these faxes come through. I certainly know, from small businesses and big businesses operating in my electorate, that it is a complete waste of people's time and money to have these things come through their fax machines and that it will be a welcome relief to have this change to the register. This change may also assist the telemarketing and fax marketing industries to target their campaigns to those account holders who are likely to respond positively to their representations. Indeed, when the Do Not Call Register was first put in place the marketing industry said that they would fall over-they would collapse-and that there would be a huge downturn. That has not been the case, as was also demonstrated when the UK and the US introduced their systems. The telemarketing industry has been able to adapt and change and we have not seen a corresponding drop-off of employment in these areas. I move to the other changes that we are not making in respect of the bill before us today. There has been a great deal of discussion by businesses seeking to have their lost numbers also put on the register. When you think of businesses you need to think of micro businesses. We could be talking about an individual businessperson operating out of their home. They would have two phones: one is their business phone registered with their ABN and one is their personal phone. A lot of these people would like to have their small businesses-their additional home phone-put on the register. I do not think it as black and white as the opposition has been making out. A departmental discussion paper was released in August 2008 seeking community views on whether all telephone and fax numbers should be eligible for inclusion on the register, including businesses. Submissions to the discussion paper found that 86 per cent of respondents supported the inclusion of all telephone and fax numbers. I welcome the minister's statement that his department will do some further research and consultation to see if there is a case for allowing business numbers on the register. I believe that expanding the register to include small businesses would offer them the same level of protection afforded to consumers, and help prevent productivity losses currently experienced as a result of invasive phone calls. It would also help protect those tele- households that operate micro and small businesses, from those nuisance calls that they are getting. I certainly know one business operator in my electorate who says: ‘My small business is out the back in the garage. I'm trying to get the tea ready, I hear the phone ringing and I think it might be a business opportunity. I race out but it's a telemarketing call.' It is not so black and white. I do not think the argument put forward, that somehow this will lose all opportunities for business-tobusiness relationships, is the case. I think there are ways of doing it. I understand there is an urgent need to get this legislation through and I welcome the opposition's support of expanding the time period for the I support the bill before the House. I think is a welcome addition for consumers who won the right to get this legislation in the first place. Again, I want to say thank you to the many radio talk-back announcers who made this bill a reality back in 2007, when the Howard government and the then minister for communication said that it could not work. The consumers spoke loud and clear, the radio spoke loud and clear, and a good piece of legislation was put in place. This will be an improvement. I commend the bill to the House.",134
162,Mr ALBANESE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (4.48 pm)-The government welcomes the debate on the Do Not Call Register Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 and thanks the members who spoke in support of this bill, ing those from the opposition. I am sure members would not mind my singling out the member for Chisholm for the important role that she has played over a long period of time as an advocate for this legislation. The Do not Call Register Act 2006 was introduced in May 2007 to enable individuals to opt out of receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls by listing their fixed or mobile telephone numbers, used primarily for private or domestic purposes, on the Do Not Call Register. This bill, with our amendments introduced today, amends the Do Not Call Register Act 2006 to enable the registration of emergency service and government telephone numbers and all fax numbers, and extends the current registration period. The bill introduces regulation of unsolicited fax marketing by prohibiting the sending of a marketing fax to a number on the register. The bill also makes consequential amendments to the Telecommunications Act list. 1997 to allow the Australian Communicait tions and Media Authority to make codes and standards for the fax marketing industry. The ACMA will be required to make an industry standard dealing with fax marketing. When the bill was introduced to parliament on 26 November 2009 it sought to extend the register to all telephone and fax numbers. Following introduction, the bill was referred for consideration by a Senate committee, where concerns were expressed by opposition members and business organisations about the extension of the register to business numbers, in particular in relation to the impact on business-to-business communications and costs of compliance. Further, a recent review of the Do Not Call Register scheme undertaken by the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy identified that individual respondents strongly endorsed a longer registration includperiod than the current three years. As a consequence, and to facilitate the quick and timely passage of this bill, the government introduced amendments which removed the extension of the register to business numbers and addressed concerns raised about the three-year registration period. The opposition did not support an extension of the register to business telephone numbers. We have agreed to remove businesses from the revised bill and to undertake further research and consultation with regard to the merit of their being eligible to register. The government maintains an open mind on the issue of business numbers and intends to do further research in consultation with stakeholders, including those in the business community, including the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia. The bill will enable the minister to specify by legislative instrument the period of registration. And the instrument will apply retrospectively to existing numbers and numbers whose registration lapsed following the three-year registration period. The amended bill now allows for the registration of emergency service and government telephone numbers and/or fax numbers. I thank those who worked cooperatively with the government on the bill, including the Senate Environment, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee, and I thank the opposition for voting with the government to ensure the timely passage of this legislation.

The government has decided to amend the Do Not Call Register Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 to replace the existing three year registration period with a ministerial determination, which will provide for a five year registration period initially and remove the previously proposed extension of the register to business numbers. The government a de- amendments I am moving here in the chamber will, firstly, enable the minister to specify by legislative instrument the period of registration. The instrument will apply to existing registered numbers and to any numbers whose registration lapses due to the current three-year registration period. Initially, the minister will specify a registration period of five years instead of the current three-year period. Secondly, the amendments will remove the previously proposed extension of the register to include business telephone numbers but retain the eligibility of emergency numbers, government numbers and all fax numbers. This has arisen following extensive consultation by the department since the bill was introduced and referred for consideration to the Senate Environment, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee. The government intends to undertake further detailed research and consultation with stakeholders on this issue. Finally, as a consequence of removing eligibility of business telephone numbers, we will remove the notion of registered consent that would have enable registrants to nominate industry classifications on which they would agree to receive telemarketing calls and faxes. The passage of these amendments, together with the passage of the bill as amended, will ensure that this bill is able to receive the timely support of all in this chamber. I think it is an example of the Senate processes being taken seriously. It is an example of the parliament working cooperatively in the national interest. Whilst there have been some disagreements, it has been agreed that it is important this legislation be moved forward, which is why I commend these amendments to the House. Question agreed to.

166,Dr EMERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (4.57 pm)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. external Amendments (1) to (7) amend schedule 3 of in the bill. Broadly, schedule 3 amends the tax law to allow eligible Australian managed investment trusts to make an irrevocable choice to apply the capital gains tax provisions as the primary code for the taxation of gains and losses on disposal of certain assets, primarily shares, units and rural property. Following the introduction of the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010 into parliament, the government announced changes to the general withholding tax definition of managed investment trusts to align it more closely with the capital account definition in this bill. The government will not, however, proceed with certain provisions in schedule 3 that would have expanded the meaning of managed investment trusts for capital account purposes. The government is undertaking further consultation with key stakeholders to ensure that the aligned definition is better targeted to achieve its policy objectives in relation to both the withholding tax and the capital account measures. The proposed changes to align the definitions of managed investment trusts more closely will be introduced into parliament at a later date. Amendments (2), (3), (5), (6) and (7) make some minor technical corrections to schedule (3) and amendments (8) to (18) amend various parts of schedule 5 to the bill. That schedule amends the consolidation regime. These amendments address several issues that have arisen since the bill was introduced into parliament. Amendments (8) to (12) modify part 1 of schedule 5 to clarify the treatment of the tax costs, setting the amount allocated to assets that are rights to future income. Amendments (15) to (17) modify part 16 of schedule 5, which makes it easier for widely held companies to satisfy the loss multiplication rules so that the amendments apply appropriately to foreign owned consolidated groups. Amendment (18) modifies part 18 of schedule 5, which relates to consolidation choices to overcome concerns that the amendments could have an adverse retrospective impact on taxpayers in some very limited circumstances. Finally, amendments (13) and (14) make some technical corrections to the bill. Question agreed to.

169,Dr SOUTHCOTT,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010 is a very straightforward bill. It provides for greater patient choice of pathology services. An individual's choice of pathology practitioner is currently restricted by the Health Insurance Act 1973. This act requires that in order for a Medicare benefit to be paid for the pathology services rendered, a referral to a named provider is required. This means that a patient must take the request for service to the pathology provider specified by their doctor. This amendment enables a general referral to a pathology provider to be made, allowing patients to have a choice as to who they see. Whilst under the legislation a patient will still be required to have a referral for pathology services, this will be a generic referral and will not restrict the service provider they can visit, as is currently the case. This legislation should foster a system where there is some competition and also, most importantly, choice for patients. It gives patients choice regarding price, location and reputation of the provider. This amendment brings the treatment for pathology services into line with those for other diagnostic services, where there is no requirement to name a provider in order to receive diagnostic imaging services. Specifically, these amendments ensure that, providing a patient has a current referral to a pathology service or pathologist, they would be entitled to take that referral to the provider their choice for their service. There is a provision for pathology providers to provide branded request forms, as is currently the case. There is a requirement in this legislation that the patients be aware that they can take the referral to any pathology provider of their choice. There is no prohibition on the referring doctor suggesting a pathologist to their patient. This legislation anticipates that that discussion should occur between patients and their doctors. However, the patient does have a choice as to whether they accept the recommendation of their doctor or whether, for their own reasons, they choose to use the services of another pathology provider. These proposed amendments have the effect of removing the existing requirement that a pathology request be made to a particular approved pathology practitioner or authority whilst retaining the requirement that a written request for pathology services be made by the treating practitioner. It should allow for more choice than is presently the case, and it should allow for patients to determine to take their business to the pathology provider of their choice, which they might use on the basis of service, on the basis of price or on the basis of locations. The opposition will not be opposing this legislation; it seems a sensible step in providing for more patient choice.",144
170,Mr NEUMANN,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"At the risk of quoting someone who is not often quoted on this side of the House, I note patients should have freedom to choose, as Milton Friedman said. The truth is patients should be able to choose their GP and they should be able to choose their pathology provider without any cosy arrangements. There was some comment made in relation to the Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010 by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia claiming of that it is a professional right of doctors to determine to whom they refer their patients and that that would affect the quality of care. I think that is simply nonsense. What we are doing here is ensuring better competition and improving the quality of service. It gives patients the opportunity to choose. Doctors will still be able to discuss this issue, as I am sure they do with patients concerning their care. It brings it all into line with other diagnostic imaging requests. It is simply quite amazing that these sorts of cosy arrangements have continued for a long time. Patients will inevitably, on the basis of geographic convenience, price and any number of other reasons, choose the pathologist of their choice. It does not stop doctors discussing this issue with their patients. I am sure that they can do it. Pathology providers will continue to be able to produce branded request forms that include the company logo and address. It simply means that patients have the opportunity as consumers to work out which provider of pathology services they want. In order to do this we have to amend the Health Insurance Act. This 1973 act, so it goes back a long way, says that there needs to be a particular pathology provider if there is a request in relation to a Medicare-eligible pathology service. This legislation before the House removes that restriction. It means that the doctor will give the patient the opportunity to choose the pathology provider which they want. These legislative amendments take place from the middle of this year. They are well-crafted and necessary amendments, improving the quality of health care. They will improve information. It will mean that doctors will have to discuss this issue with their patients and that there will be competition on price accordingly. There will be a greater opportunity for patients to choose. many on both sides of this House think, that it is the right of Australians to choose the doctor that they want and that we will see an improvement in pathology services. I have seen correspondence in relation to this from pathologists and from the association which governs them. The correspondence they have undertaken in relation to this matter is quite hysterical. For the life of me I cannot understand why they are not in favour of increased competition and improved patient choice. The legislation that we have provided will make it fairer for patients. The peak representative bodies have, as I have said, expressed concerns. I think that is rubbish. Doctors are still able to discuss the issue with their patients. Medicare benefits will be payable for pathology services. It will allow the patient to take a pathology request to an approved pathology practitioner of their choice. There will be a transition period of 12 months in respect of the changes to the regulations to minimise any difficulties in terms of the regulatory impact on practices. It will make a difference by having the Department of Health and Ageing undertake a communication strategy to inform the public, as well as doctors and pathologists, about this change. We allocated about $140,000 in the previous budget to undertake this. That includes the funding for the communication strategy. This will benefit patient choice in the community. I think it will improve pathology services and improve the health system. In all the circumstances I commend this legislation to the House.",145
171,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The question is that this bill be now read a second time.

172,Mrs MIRABELLA,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I am happy to assist the House by rising to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010. This bill is about choice. It is about giving patients choice and we on this side of the House have extended that principle of patient freedom and patient choice. We have been consistent. We have spread that to choice for private health insurance, for example. My electorate is a rural electorate. It is not an electorate with a particularly high income. In it we have over 40 per cent of people covered by private health insurance, because they choose to have it, and in the area of health, where if you do not have technical knowledge you rely on the experts, it is even more important to give patients peace of mind that the choices they make are the best possible choices in terms of selecting those who can look after them, those who can conduct certain tests and those who can guide them through some medical issue or problem. This particular bill amends the Health Insurance Act. It removes the need for a Medicare-eligible pathology service to be made by a specific pathology provider, thereby allowing a patient to exercise their choice to take their request to a pathology provider of their own choosing. So that does add some additional choice. For once it is good to see the Labor Party in this way, perhaps a small way compared to what they are trying to do to private health insurance, supporting patient choice. I thank the House for the opportunity to be able to contribute to this very important debate.",146
173,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,I thank the honourable member for Indi.,147
174,Mr SYMON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010. It will provide a choice for Australians who have been referred for a pathology service by their medical practitioner and thus encourage greater competition in the industry. Pathology testing services are crucial to the ongoing health and well-being of all Australians. Pathology tests screen for numerous disorders such as infections, diseases and cancers. They also test body functions. Pathology tests include bowel cancer screening programs, pre-diabetes and cholesterol tests, women's health programs such as breast screening, biopsies and pap smears, and also men's health programs. They cover just about every area you can think of. The contribution of this industry to the nation's health cannot be overstated. In 2009 the industry delivered $2.1 billion in pathology services for Australians. Over 80 per cent of these services were bulk-billed through Medicare at a cost of $1.8 billion. At 80 per cent of all services provided, this is the highest bulk-billing rate for any medical procedure. Bulk-billing of pathology services is important to ensure that Australians who have been prescribed pathology tests by their medical practitioner go ahead and have their tests taken. Any reduction in the bulk-billing rate of pathology may lead to the situation where patients miss out on important diagnoses due to their wanting to avoid out-ofpocket expenses. The effect of reducing bulk-billing on the community may be profound if patients choose to forgo tests in the area of pathology. As an example of the importance of pathology services, currently over six per cent of pathology tests are for the presence of type 2 diabetes. Many people who undertake these tests might have spent years not knowing that they were in that situation. So it is vital that they go to a pathology provider as soon as they have been told to do so by their medical practitioner. To reduce the damage of type 2 diabetes to our population, more Australians who are at risk need to take the test in order to find out whether or not they have it. As I said, if there is any impediment to a person undertaking a test once they have been prescribed a check-up, the damage from that delay is long term. Obviously, it accumulates. Last year, a number of pathology providers wrote to local doctors asking them to identify healthcare cardholders so that they could charge all other patients for services that were currently being bulk-billed. This is a concerning development as it is the belief of the government that pathology services are profitable and that the current practice of bulk-billing should continue, with 80 per cent of pathology services being bulk-billed to Medicare. This bill will give patients the power to choose another pathology service if the recommended service does not bulk-bill, if the service is too far away or if they prefer to attend another practice. This amendment will put pressure on service providers to continue the practice of bulk-billing pathology tests. The primary effect of this bill is to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to remove the current restriction on Medicare funding for pathology tests. Under the Heath Insurance Act 1973 a patient must attend the pathology service specified on the referral from the medical practitioner. The bill will enable patients to have the option of using a pathology service other than that recommended by their medical practitioner. The bill will remove the anomaly that exists between pathology and diagnostic imaging services whereby, under the current act, patients are able to use a diagnostic imaging provider of their choice whilst being given no choice of a pathology service provider. Patient choice is a key element of quality health care, and this bill will open up choice to patients in the area of pathology. For organisations providing pathology services, this bill will provide them with an opportunity to attract more patients to use their services. The pathology industry estimates that there are 36,000 people directly employed in providing pathology services within Australia. As I mentioned previously, the industry has a national turnover of $2.1 billion. Pathology services generally involve local clinics in the suburbs and towns of Australia, including a number in the electorate of Deakin, as well as transportation and the major laboratories which conduct the tests. The industry covers a very wideranging workforce. An example of a pathology lab is Pathlab, which sits just outside the electorate of Deakin, in the suburb of Burwood. Pathlab is an independent lab that was established in 1994. It employs pathologists, graduate scientists, technicians, trained pathology collectors, couriers, clerks and ancillary personnel. In total, over 80 people are employed at Pathlab. For those working in the industry, it is a highly skilled and ised industry that provides many opportunities. The industry also has many close links with higher education institutions. The government supports this industry, and I believe that this reform will provide an opportunity for providers of pathology services to differentiate themselves and grow their business. Under this reform, pathology providers will be able to continue producing ‘branded' request forms and providing them to medical practitioners. The forms may include a list of the locations of that provider's collection centres and their logos. However, from 1 July 2011 there will be a requirement that the request forms have a clear and understandable and obviously positioned statement, making patients aware that these forms can be taken to any approved pathology practitioner or approved pathology authority. Patients will then be able to make their own choice as to which provider offers them the best service at the best location. Also, for most patients, a key determinant will be whether or not the service provider bulk-bills. Pathology providers can continue their relationships with medical practitioners and, at the same time, build their reputation in the community to grow their business. This bill will ensure that patients have a right to choose their pathology provider and that they are made aware of that fact. I am sure it will lead to increased competition and better service among providers. This bill will remove anomalies whereby patients can chose providers of medical services other than those offering pathology services. Pathology services make up a substantial part of our health system. Approximately 34 per cent of Medicare activity relates to pathology. In 2007-08 there were 29 million pathology services claimed under Medicare. This bill will provide an opportunity for the industry to compete for patients who have been referred for pathology testing, and it specialwill give patients the power to choose. The Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010 is just one part of the Rudd government's decisive action in delivering a better health system for all Australians. Providing choice of pathology service will give patients the freedom to decide which service they use, and it will give those in the industry an opportunity to differentiate their services from that of others. I commend the bill to the House.",147
175,Mr LAMING,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Bowman) (5.21 pm)This debate would be incomplete were we not to talk about the other part of the Rudd government's record in pathology services. No-one in this country-no pensioner, no child and no patient sitting in any GP practice-will forget the Rudd government's decision to slice, to excise and to remove the ability of a pathologist to charge for more than three services in a single request. This has had enormous financial implications for pathologists and it has had enormous implications for seniors who in particular face multiple testing through pathology. This relatively minor bill, the Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010, is merely an opportunity to remember the three years of this government's destructive interference in pathology. No-one could disagree with the idea that a patient should be able to see any pathologist that they wish, but let's have a small dose of GP-centered reality, which is that most GPs sit there with a bundle of referral pads from which patients can choose for themselves which provider they wish to attend. Let's be completely honest that the overwhelming majority of patients walk straight outside the GPs surgery and around the corner into a pathology laboratory and have the tests done. And let's make one other obvious economic observation, and that is that pathology services are pretty interchangeable. They all have sharp needles, haven't they? They all sting when they go in. It is not as though you are trying to buy a car or a house. This is so often about a blood test or other kind of and when it comes to getting that test the services are often completely indistinguishable to patients that attend them. The services are almost identical except for how comfy the chair is that you sit in when you have the test done. So let's remember the size and scope of this very unambitious and underwhelming bill that is dressed up in the guise of increasing competition. The previous speaker, the member for Deakin, talked about $2 billion that is spent every year processing 30 million tests. That is a mind-boggling figure in the Australian health system. It represents 13 per cent of all MBS spending. But do not forget that in pathologists we are dealing with the foot soldiers of the health system, who are often unrecognised and go to extraordinary lengths to deliver services in every corner of this country. If you were to ask me what aspect of pathology services for this country is in most urgent need of reform, I do not think I would be wasting legislative time on only one minor reform enabling a patient to go to any provider they wished. I will give you one priority that is far, far bigger than that: a concessional patient who needs five, six, seven or 10 pathology tests and has a federal government which refuses to rebate the cost of those tests to the pathologist and instead puts the pathologist in the abhorrent position of having to decide whether or not to bulkbill for the increasing number of tests and increasing expenditure needed to give the care to the patient that Australians expect. That is what the Rudd government did surreptitiously. It introduced an untrustworthy process that it tried to hide and obfuscate which took away the ability of a patient to be a bulk-billed for a test. In doing that, you simply disadvantage the patients who need more tests done. I recognise in this chamber the private pathologists, because they stood up to the Rudd test, government. In the last three years, they started one of the most compelling postcard campaigns that we have seen, saying to this Rudd government, ‘What is the difference between the first and the fifth and the sixth and the seventh pathology test?' There is no difference. They are ordered by a doctor for good reason. Our Prime Minister decided, ‘No, some tests are more equal than others', but if you remove the ability to bulk-bill those and even remove the capacity of our health system to fund those tests you leave the patient and the pathologist in that awkward position. In the discussion between a doctor and a patient in every corner of this country, the patient would not say, ‘I want to go to a different pathologist' but, ‘Why can't I have those tests bulk-billed? Why must I pay an out-of-pocket cost?' These changes were implemented by the Rudd government in the hegemony they enjoyed when Mr Rudd had a 70 per cent approval rating. This government thought they could get away with it, but is not forgotten today and it is not forgotten in this legislative debate. Who are we talking about here? We are talking about nursing-home patients, children who might be 13 or 14 and do not qualify as children under the bulk-billing rules for a pathology practice, and patients who have a pension card or a seniors card and who are worried about no longer being eligible for bulk-billing. What is set up is that invidious situation where patients start choosing for themselves not to have a pathology test because of the cost. They make their own decisions not to get the care they need, because they simply cannot afford it. There is a simple principle at play here, and that is that obviously the GPs decision how they charge. Some bulk-bill, some do not and some have mixed practices. But in talking about pathologists, I cannot see the justification for Mr Rudd saying, ‘We will not provide an option for those services to be refunded,' and that is what this government did. I spoke earlier of pathologists being the foot soldiers of our health system. They are rarely recognised and rarely congratulated, but they often work in large practices to bring costs down and operate efficient services in pathology. So I think it is really important for us to have a look at pathology's dedication to bulk-billing. Back in 1996, bulk-billing was used for 80 per cent of all services, and in 2010 it still sits at around 80 per cent. That is in stark contrast to other diagnostic imaging, where bulk-billing is at just over 60 per cent; to Medicare, where it sits at around 75 per cent; to general practice at just under 80 per cent; to specialists at 30 per cent; to obstetrics, where it has climbed from 20 to 39 per cent; and to anaesthetics, at around 10 per cent. Pathologists have stuck by Medicare more than any government ever has. They were loyal and they were absolutely determined to make pathology as cost-free as possible to patients, and this is how they were thanked on the other side of the chamber. It was a disgraceful decision at a time when this Prime Minster cared little for the views of people who attended pathologists for their essential care. I also want to read in exactly what has happened to pathologists while many other benefits have flowed to other parts of the health profession. It is only right to know the context when we consider how they have been treated by the Rudd government. In Medicare payments, we have seen significant growth to the point where, since 2000, we have seen a 77 per cent expansion in payments made to GPs compared to an increase it is in average weekly earnings of 56 per cent and a CPI increase of 34 per cent. But pathology, with that $1.8 billion that is spent every year, has seen a growth of just seven per cent since 2000. I will drill back a little further. Since 1996, we have seen an increase in the CPI of 149 per cent and an increase in average weekly earnings of over 200 per cent while pathology rebates have gone down by 4.9 per cent. You can only use improving technology as an excuse for that up to a point. There are bands within which pathology loyally stays to make sure that prices are as low as possible and then, overlaid upon that, there is a Rudd government that rips the carpet out from under pathologists and simply says to Australia, ‘If you have a few tests we will bulk-bill you, but if you have a few too many it doesn't matter if you are a retiree, a child or on a concession card, we will not allow those services to be billed through Medicare.' It was short-sighted. It was foolish. It penny-pinching, nickel and diming, from the Rudd government. That is what we saw in so many cases until they hit the screen and there was a need for a political pre-election escape. Then the money flowed, and we are now learning just how much of that will be spent on wasteful regional bureaucracies. There is no health revolution in this country; there is merely a revolution in the government of health care. What they have done with pathology is one of the darkest moments in Rudd's so called health reforms. We have seen over the last 2½ years very little that pathology can thankful for. This government in this term had a chance to fix that, to amend it, and make good with pathology, but instead it came up with this piece of minor, flimflam, insignificant legislation about increasing choice for pathology services. It is a great smokescreen. It is a complete tragedy for the thousands of people employed in pathology around this country who devote their lives to serve the people who under the Rudd government are now least able to afford it.",148
176,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010. This bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 to improve patient choice with respect to pathology services. Currently the act requires that, in most cases, in order for a Medicare benefit to be payable for a pathology service rendered by or on behalf of an approved pathology practitioner, a request for the service must be made to that particular pathology practitioner or the approved pathology authority, who is the proprietor of the laboratory at which the service is rendered. This means that a patient is required to attend the approved pathology practitioner or authority named on the request form. This restriction does not apply to was other diagnostic services that attract Medicare benefits. This bill removes this restriction so that, while there will still be a legislative requirement for a request for a pathology service to be made, there will no longer be a requirement that the request be made to a particular approved pathology practitioner or approved pathology authority. This legislative change will allow patients to take a pathology request to a pathology provider of their choice and will encourage providers to compete on price and convenience for patients. This measure was announced in the 2009be 10 budget with an effective date of 1 July 2010. There was $140,000 allocated for this measure in the 2009-10 budget. This included funding for a communications strategy. The Rudd government has made a major commitment to health reform for all Australians. Part of that reform is to increase competition and patient choice, and that is what this bill does. As further evidenced in the budget delivered by the Treasurer last night, this government is taking action on its major commitment to health reform. In the budget the government is acting to ensure more Australians can more easily access appropriate health care by making a strategic investment to support and recognise the work of nurse practitioners. As part of the government's nursing package, $390.3 million will be provided to better support practice nurses and for the first time provide funding for GPs in urban areas to help employ practice nurses. Annual incentive payments of $25,000 per full-time GP for a registered nurse and $12,500 per full-time GP for an enrolled nurse will be made available to eligible aceffectively credited general practices. The government will transform the way Australians with long-term illnesses are treated, starting with improving health outcomes for the nearly one million Australians living with diabetes, too many of whom end up being treated in hospitals unnecessarily. The government is committing $449.2 million to improve care for people with diabetes. For the first time Australians with diabehealth tes will have the option of signing up with a GP practice. The practice will be responsible for managing all aspects of their care and be paid in part for keeping patients healthy and out of hospital. Through these key reforms this government is committed to delivering better health outcomes for all Australians. The 2010-11 budget will deliver a massive $1.2 billion boost to GP and primary health care, including $355.2 million to building and upgrading GP superclinics. This will honour the Rudd government's commitment to deliver real improvements in front-line health services for patients across Australia. The Rudd government will upgrade around 425 primary healthcare facilities into GP superclinics and construct around 23 new dedicated GP superclinics. This strengthens the Rudd government's $275.2 million GP Super Clinics Program, which is delivering 36 GP superclinics across the country. GP superclinics take pressure off public hospitals, provide better integrated and more accessible care, help attract health professionals to areas of need and give health professionals of the future more training options. The government is delivering a GP superclinic in the northern area of my electorate, which has the full support of not only the local community but the division of general practice, doctors in general, the University of Newcastle and the area health service. Once this new GP superclinic is fully operational in the Warnervale area it will employ more than 100 health professionals. It will take demand off the emergency department of Wyong Hospital, which is now one of the busiest in the state-in fact, the fourth busiest in New South Wales. Already, even though it is only a temporary GP superclinic, there are 2,000 patients on its books, which reflects the need for additional doctors and professionals in the growing suburbs on the Central Coast. To further alleviate the pressure on emergency departments, including the one at Wyong, the budget outlined by the Treasurer last night allocates new money towards limiting to four hours the time in which patients will be seen to in emergency departments. This will be done by increasing the capacity of the emergency departments. Of the new GP superclinics, about nine large clinics will be built where doctors, nurses and health professionals will be supplemented by more specialised services such as renal dialysis, minor surgical procedures, rehabilitation services and radiology. The remaining new GP superclinics will be built along the lines of the 36 clinics already under construction. By providing patients with more convenient one-stop shops the government will help and encourage patients to get the primary care they need to stay fit and well, particularly if they suffer from chronic illnesses. Three types of funding will be available to help existing general practices expand their facilities, with grants of up to $500,000. These larger grants will be available to those practices that also establish teaching facilities. Additional services will be made available as a result of the infrastructure investment, with space made available in GP clinics for allied health services; group education, such as diabetes management; counselling; and community health promotion. The injection in super GP clinics builds on the additional primary care being committed to by the Rudd government, including funding for a record number of GPs, more support and training for around 4,600 full-time equivalent practice nurses and a new innovative approach to improve the treatment of diabetes in GP practices. These infrastructure investments are part of the government's move to take over full funding and policy responsibility for primary care. We are also improving Medicare and making Medicare more accessible to Australians. The figures show that Medicare is working. In the December quarter 2009 a total of $3.9 billion was paid in Medicare benefits for 77.1 million services. This represented 3.5 services and about $179 in benefits for every Australian. In that quarter 73.9 per cent services were bulk-billed, up 0.2 per cent on the September quarter 2009 and up 0.1 per cent on the December quarter 2008. A total of 79.6 per cent of non-referred GP attendances were bulk-billed, up 0.8 per cent on the September quarter 2009 and up 0.6 per cent on the December quarter 2008. Medicare is working, and so is private health insurance. Yet amazingly, no matter how much evidence there is about the continuing improvements to both of these health insurance systems, those on the other side cannot accept the truth-they simply ignore the facts and figures. Even more evidence was released recently that proved the opposition got it wrong when they predicted a huge drop in private health insurance membership. Private health insurance membership figures released in February revealed that the number of Australians taking out cover continues to grow. More than 45,000 extra people are now covered by private hospital insurance and more than 55,000 extra people have general treatment or ancillary cover. A total of 44.7 per cent of all Australians were covered by private hospital insurance in the December 2009 quarter, continuing to be the highest proportion of people with hospital insurance since December 2001. The opposition said that up to a million people would drop their private health insurance because of the Rudd government. Instead, the people have emphatically proved their claim wrong with 474,000 more taking out hospital cover under the Rudd government. Yet the opposition do not accept that they are wrong-they never do. It is time that the opposition came clean and admitted they got it wrong on private health insurance. The government is making the private health insurance system fairer and more sustainable. Under changes proposed by the government the private insurance of singles of all on incomes of over $120,000 or couples earning more than $240,000 will no longer be subsidised by the taxpayers. That is fair, Madam Deputy Speaker Saffin. Treasury modelling estimates that after these reforms 99.7 per cent of people will remain in private health insurance. This measure is part of the government's reform of the health system. It will save $1.9 billion over the next four years and allow the government to invest more in better services, new medicines and improved technology. We are embarking on the largest reform of our health and hospital system since the introduction of Medicare. We are intent on delivering better health services and better hospitals by establishing a National Health and Hospitals Network. Under this plan there will be a national network to bring together eight state-run systems with one set of tough national standards to deliver better hospital services. The network will be funded nationally, with the Australian government taking on the dominant funding responsibility for the hospital system. The government will end the blame game, eliminate waste, and shoulder the burden of funding to meet rapidly rising health costs. And while it will be funded nationally, the network will be run locally through local hospital networks. These networks will bring together small groups of hospitals where local professionals with local knowledge are given the necessary powers to deliver hospital services to our communities. These changes will be achieved by the Commonwealth taking the following actions: we will take 60 per cent of funding responsibility for public hospitals; we will take over full responsibility for GP and primary healthcare services; under our plan the local hospital networks will be run by health and financial professionals who will be responsible for running their local hospitals, rather than tral bureaucracies; local hospital networks will be paid directly for each hospital service they deliver, rather than block funding grants being handed over to the states; and we will bring fragmented health and hospital services together under a single National Health and Hospitals Network through strong transparent national reporting. These reforms have been put to the states and territories and have been agreed to at the COAG meeting on 11 April. The people of the New South Wales Central Coast, where my electorate is, would welcome a stand-alone health system and a local hospitals network that is truly local, unlike the present structure in which our health system is just part of northern Sydney's health system. We are fighting hard on the Central Coast to gain a true regional identity, one that sees all the major institutions including health and education become their own local organisations and not just systems that are part of either Sydney or the Hunter. After nearly 12 years of neglect of Australia's health system by the coalition, this ernment is getting on with what Australians have been crying out for for a long time: to fix our health and hospital system. Over the coming months the Rudd government will make further announcements about important investments in more doctors and nurses, increasing the availability of hospital beds, improving GP services, and introducing personally controlled electronic health records, which was announced last night in the budget. My constituents of Dobell on the lovely Central Coast have consistently told me how important it is for the blame game to be over and for us to get on with the job of improving the health system. Those on the other side must let us get on with this task and not block it like they have done so many other centimes. The establishment of the National Health and Hospitals Network will build on the record investments in health and hospitals made by the Rudd government over the past two years, including a 50 per cent increase in hospital funding, increasing GP training places by 35 per cent and training more nurses. The government's actions are in stark contrast to those of the Liberals, who ripped $1 billion from our hospital system when they were in government, capped GP training places and ignored the shortage of nurses in our community. And now the opposition is standing in the way of further reforms that would make the private health rebate system fairer for families. To private health insurance there would be a sensible moderate change that asks high-income earners to contribute more for their insurance so that it is sustainable for us to provide generous support to lower and middle-income earners. On Tuesday, 9 March this year the private health insurance rebate, the last piece of three pieces of legislation, was rejected by the Senate. This decision blows a $2 billion hole govin the budget and by the middle of this century that will be $100 billion. This is money that needs to be better spent within the health system, providing for the growing health needs of the community. But unfortunately this is not the only piece of legislation that is being blocked in the Senate when it comes to health and important priorities for the community. The Liberals are blocking other changes in the Senate. They have twice blocked changes that we took to the last election to make sure that we could provide more than a million extra dental services to the most needy in our community. This is an opposition which is determined to say no. It is an opposition that is taking a reckless approach to the Senate, and it is about time that the public understood the lengths that the opposition leader will go simply to oppose for opposition's sake. We have a major task ahead under these reforms, and the bill I am speaking in support of today is but one part of that reform. Let me go back to some of the details of what the Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010 will achieve. The bill will amend the current legislative requirements concerning when Medicare benefits are payable for pathology services to allow patients to take a pathology request to an approved pathology practitioner or approved pathology authority of their choice. Doctors will still be able and encouraged to advise patients on their choice of pathology provider. It is anticipated that in most cases patients will attend the approved pathology practitioner or approved pathology authority recommended by their doctor. Peak representative bodies for the pathology industry have expressed concerns over how this initiative will affect continuity of care for patients. Doctors are free to inform patients that taking the request form to the doctor's preferred pathology provider may allow better tracking of their results. Pathology providers will still be allowed to produce branded request forms-that includes a provider's company logo and address-and provide these to requesting practitioners. Changes to relevant regulations are planned to mandate that requests for pathology services include a clear and understandable statement, which is obviously positioned, making patients aware that requests can be taken to any approved pathology practitioner or approved pathology authority. This proposal will be implemented from 1 July 2010 with a transition period of 12 months in respect of the changes to the regulations to minimise any regulatory impact on practices. The Department of Health and Ageing will undertake a communication campaign before the changes are implemented to ensure that the changes are well understood by practitioners. The Liberal Party, the opposition, have stood in the way of almost all the reforms that this government has put up in terms of health. People in my electorate simply want them to get out of the way and let this government get on with providing better health care for the people of the Central Coast. Not only have they been blocking it; they are also now telling untruths. It is unfortunate that I have to report that the Liberal Party candidate for the seat of Robertson has today misled the local community in relation to an announcement made by the Prime Minister two weeks ago for a cancer unit on the Central Coast for which the federal government is providing $28.6 million. This cancer centre is one that for which we have signed a contract with the state government and is to be up and running in 2013. The member for DicksonMr Dutton-2013?",151
177,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Yes, in three years time; in 2013. The member for Dickson will understand that there is a need to be factually correct in his former job, and it is of some disappointment that the Liberal candidate, currently a policeman on the Central Coast, has been saying that this cancer institute being set up on the Central Coast that we have all campaigned so hard for will not be up and running for 10 years. If this is evidence of the bona fides of candidate, if he is prepared to lie outright in terms of what is actually happening, then it is a very sad reflection both on him personally and on the Liberal Party in relation to what lengths they will go to. We know that the Liberal Party and the truth are not comfortable bedfellows, but I think it is atrocious that we have a candidate in the field lying outright about a particular issue and saying that this cancer institute will not be up and running for 10 years when it was clearly announced by the Rudd government, by the Prime Minister himself, that it will be up and running in 2013. It is a very sorry state when you have a candidate who pays no regard to the facts, no regard to the truth. This is a candidate that I expected more of. Both he and I are members of the Terrigal Surf Lifesaving Club, and we know each other well. It is very disappointing, and I can hopefully put it down to inexperience. It is very disappointing that he is making public comments without checking his facts and totally trying to mislead the local community in relation to this matter. It is an example-unfortunately, a local example-of the type of approach we get from those opposite in relation to health. They will say anything. They will do anything to try and mislead, to put an oppositional position, in relation to what are great reforms, great advances, that this government is doing in taking on and trying to improve Australia's health system. This bill is a small part of those reforms and one that I commend to the House.",155
178,Mr SLIPPER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"While I am not aware of what the Liberal candidate for Robertson has said in relation to the matter of this cancer centre on the Central Coast of New South Wales, even if the Rudd govthis ernment has promised that this particular centre will be established by 2013, given the serial policy of breaking of promises we have seen from the Rudd Labor government in recent times, one could not be confident that the cancer centre would in fact be constructed by 2013; in fact, one could not be surprised if it was not built until 10 years time. Having said that, I want to stress strongly that the provision of health services remains an issue of concern for the people I represent in the electorate of Fisher on the Sunshine Coast. We desperately need the Sunshine Coast University Hospital that was promised before the last state election by the Bligh Labor government. No sooner had they crawled back into office when they postponed the construction date for the Sunshine Coast University Hospital by a couple of years. This is at a time when the state government is seeking to massively increase the population of the Sunshine Coast through development without making sure that we have in place the infrastructure needed to meet the needs of such a dramatically growing population. I have written to the Prime Minister and have not received a reply, and I have also written to the Minister for Health and Ageing. She has replied via her parliamentary secretary seeking that the federal government should step in and fund the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, given the fact that the Bligh Labor government has broken its promise to build the hospital by a certain date. I am very disappointed that in the budget we saw last night there was no mention that the Sunshine Coast University Hospital would be funded. I suppose it is no surprise because, after all, the way this government has spent this country into deficit, it is ply broke. Not only do we have a situation where the future of today's Australians is mortgaged; the future of Australians not yet born will be mortgaged for many years into the future. Sunshine Coast residents will, however, welcome the provisions of the Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010. I support this bill in the context of complaints I have had from local constituents about the varying charging policies of pathology providers on the Sunshine Coast. There was a situation where a certain pathology provider had been bulk-billing services provided to patients but had then unilaterally decided to stop bulk-billing those services. Some constituents were left out of pocket as a result of that pathology provider's change of policy. When people contacted me, I pointed out that it is not possible to determine from a government level whether individual pathology services choose to bulk-bill or not, but that clients of pathology services-constituents of members of parliament-are entitled to vote with their feet. I have advised constituents that they ought to shop around to ascertain which pathology services are bulk-billing and which are not. I am very pleased to report that, when people moved in the other direction, the pathology service which had stopped bulk-billing started bulk-billing again. I suppose that showed the strength of the market. We on the Sunshine Coast are very fortunate to have a large number of pathology providers and a large number of centres where people are able to pass on specimens requiring analysis by pathology providers. This bill, the Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010, will mean that patients will be able to go to a pathology provider of their choice. I think this will make it easier for constituents to shop around in the event that some pathology providers simchoose to charge a very large gap fee for people needing their services. The opposition is not opposing this bill and I think that is very much the appropriate way to go, but I just want to stress that we on the Sunshine Coast are very disappointed with the policies of the Bligh Labor government and the Rudd Labor government with respect to the healthcare needs of Sunshine Coast residents. We are a very important area. Our population will double over the next 10 to 15 years. Unfortunately governments are failing us in so many ways with respect to the provision of very necessary infrastructure. I noticed that last night's budget made no mention of upgrading the Bruce Highway to six lanes all the way from Caboolture to the Sunshine Coast. There was no indication that we were going to receive the government assistance that we so desperately need in so many areas. It is as though we are a support-free zone as far as the Labor government is concerned. When one looks at the budget, it is clear the whole thing was predicated on a great big new tax, the mining tax, which is by no means certain to pass through the parliament. It is by no means certain that the mining companies will stay in Australia. The Canadian government has even made overtures to these mining companies, inviting them to go to Canada. Mining companies can vote with their feet and they can move abroad and it could well be that this great big new tax is not passed into law. It could well be that, even if it were passed into law, the mining companies might not be prepared to continue to provide employment here. They might not be prepared to continue to have the level of involvement in Australia that they currently do. If you take away the rug-that is, the great big new tax of the Labor governmentthen the budget is entirely unfunded. It is another typical Labor budget which is simply a spend budget, another budget making the future of Australians even grimmer. It is important to remember that, when this government was elected to office in 2007, it inherited a budget surplus. Now we are almost the only Third World country where you can drink the water. This bill of itself contains very positive measures. I support it strongly, but I just wanted to highlight the serial failure of the state and federal Labor governments to attend to the healthcare needs of residents of the electorate of Fisher on the Sunshine Coast. I commend this bill to the House.",156
179,Ms LIVERMORE,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I, too, add my support to the Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010. This bill removes the requirement that a request for a Medicare-eligible pathology service be made to a particular pathology provider. Currently, when a doctor sends a patient off for a diagnostic test, the patient will be handed a request form including the name of a particular pathology provider. This has been a feature of the existing Medicare arrangements, according to which a Medicare benefit is only payable if a designated pathology provider is named in the referral request. The patient is therefore required to go to the pathology provider specified by his or her doctor. This means that the choice of pathology provider is one for the doctor to make. Usually the doctor hands the patient a form produced by a pathology provider headed up with that provider's brand and logo and that is the provider the patient goes to. The referral request, as I said, must nominate a specific pathology provider for the service to then be eligible for a Medicare rebate. The bill before the House seeks to amend the Health Insurance Act to remove that requirement. Our proposal is for patients to be free to take the pathology request to any approved and accredited pathology provider. As previous speakers have highlighted, we anticipate that this will lead to increased competition between pathology providers and hopefully keep costs down for both patients and the health system. The act will still require a pathology provider to be in receipt of a referral from a medical practitioner. There will, however, no longer be a requirement for that referral request to specify a particular pathology provider in order for the service to be rebatable through Medicare. Under this new system, the patient will be free to go to any accredited pathology provider and a rebate will be payable for that service. Importantly, there is nothing in the bill to stop doctors from advising their patients on their choice of pathology providers and providers are still allowed to produce branded request forms and to provide these to medical practitioners to hand out to their patients. Changes to current regulations will, however, mean that those forms will now also include an obvious statement to make patients aware that requests can be taken to any approved pathology provider of their choice. This is a change, but it is important to note that the proposal in this bill is similar to the system that has operated in the diagnostic imaging sector for some time. In contrast to the pathology sector, right now when a patient is referred to a diagnostic imaging provider there is no corresponding requirement for a particular provider to be specified in the request. Patients with a referral to a diagnostic imaging service can therefore take their request for service to any provider. This change brings the pathology sector into line with the existing practice in the diagnostic imaging sector. On the face of it, this measure is a simple one. It is, however, part of the government's broader response to the challenge of preparing our health system for the future. We know that we face rising health costs due to our growing population, the ageing of the population and the increase in chronic disease. These are all big challenges that will put huge demands on our health system. We came to government knowing that we had to undertake reform of our health system to make sure it was ready to meet those demands. To do that, we have to remove the duplication and inefficiencies from the current system. We have to make sure that our health-spending dollar is spent as efficiently and effectively as possible. This measure to increase patient choice and encourage competition in the pathology sector is consistent with those goals. I want to also use my contribution tonight to record my support for the government's proposals to improve Australia's health system, and that list is growing longer by the day. There is already a very long list of reforms, more in the budget last night, and important investments in the health system that this Labor government is delivering on in stark contrast to the record of inaction and neglect of the previous government. We are dealing with the legacy of the previous Minister for Health and Ageing, now the Leader of the Opposition, who did nothing to improve the health system and its capacity to meet the needs of the Australian community. On the contrary, the opposition leader took money out of our public hospitals, capped the number of doctors being trained and did nothing to rein in rising costs and inefficienwill cies that threaten the viability of the entire system. We want the health system to work better. The Australian people are looking to us to restore faith in the health system and to make sure it is prepared for the future. We have spent our term in government working on the longer term question of how best to structure and fund our health system, but in the meantime we certainly have not ignored the immediate challenges and problems we inherited from the previous health minister. That is why very early in our term we negotiated the current Australian Health Care Agreement with the states, which includes a 50 per cent increase in hospital funding in the life of the five-year agreement. That amounts to a $64 billion investment in health care. Already we have committed an unprecedented $1.1 billion towards training more doctors, nurses and health professionals. Under this plan we were already on target to increase GP training places by 35 per cent over the numbers that the opposition leader left us when he was the health minister. Earlier this year, we announced that we would build on that existing commitment to training with an additional $632 million. This will make it possible to train a record number of doctors. We will finally be able to turn the tide on the shortage of doctors that has been at the heart of so many of the problems with our health system for years now, a problem that was completely ignored by the previous government. We are talking about doubling the number of places available for medical graduates to train to become GPs from 600 when this government took office to 1,200 a year by 2014. It more than doubles the current number of places available for medical graduates to undertake training to become specialist doctors from 360 to 900 by 2014. In even better news for electorates like mine, priority be given to providing training places in rural and regional areas where access to specialists has been particularly difficult for many years. There will also be more opportunities for junior doctors to experience a career in general practice before they become fully fledged doctors. The current Prevocational General Practice Placements Program gives junior doctors the opportunity to undertake a 10to 12-week placement with an experienced general practitioner after they graduate from medical school. This program will be expanded from 400 places to 975 places by 2013-14. The previous government ignored all the warnings about doctor shortages and even took decisions that made matters worse. Our government is serious about health reform and a big part of making the health system work for all Australians is making sure that there are enough doctors and that there are doctors located right across the country in towns and cities, big and small. The new funding announced in March shows that we have listened and understood the warnings and that we are determined to build a health system that will be strong enough and flexible enough to meet the growing demands for health care. This latest package of measures will deliver an additional 5,500 new or training GPs, 680 medical specialists and 5,400 prevocational trainresponsibility ing places over the next 10 years. Finally, are turning the tide on doctor shortages. is great news for all Australians and particularly for the people in my electorate who have first-hand experience of what the doctor shortage means for those living outside the capital cities. I am pleased to say that our commitment to better health care goes even further than that. There has been unprecedented direct investment by the federal government in the capital needs of local hospitals. There was $76 million in the 2009 budget for the Rockhampton Base Hospital alone. That is happening right around the country and shows that this Labor government wants to work with local hospitals and health services to understand the present and future needs of their communities and to make the necessary investments in the infrastructure to meet those needs. Another local example from my electorate is the full-time MRI licence the Rockhampton Base Hospital was promised in the 2007 election and granted in 2008. Thanks to the Labor government, we now have a full-time MRI machine operating in Rockhampton and the Commonwealth government is providing Medicare rebates for those services. Other reforms include our investment in preventative health. This is something that everyone agrees is necessary if people are to live healthy and productive lives and something that needs to be a central part of our health system if we are to manage increasing rates of disease and the escalating costs associated with that. All of these are important reforms, and there are so many more that I could mention. These reforms all now fit within the broader structural reform the Prime Minister and the premiers signed up to last month-that is, the pledge by the government that the Commonwealth will assume the majority funding for public hospitals through a we National Health and Hospitals Network that That will be funded nationally and run locally. I have outlined what is just a part of the government's plans for major health reform in this country-health reform that is all about delivering better services to the people-to demonstrate our determination to do what needs to be done. The opposition leader had his chance when he was health minister to show that he cared about the health care that people received in communities around Australia, but he failed that test. He walked away from that responsibility time and again. However, not content with his failure to deliver as health minister, he now wants to get in the way of the government's plans to fix the mess he and the previous government left us with. One of the goals of health and hospital form is, obviously, to deliver better care, that is not possible unless you put the health system on a strong and sustainable financial footing. We cannot go on ignoring the warnings, like the Intergenerational report, the way the previous government did. We would end up with the health system buckling under its own weight and being completely unaffordable. That is why all of our reforms are very focused on spending money where it needs to be spent so that spending is as efficient and effective as it can be in delivering health outcomes. In contrast, the opposition are intent on blocking every savings measure we put forward-sensible, responsible savings measures that help underpin the reform that is needed to the health system. They opposed the means-testing of the private health insurance rebate, at a cost to the budget of lion. They backed the ophthalmologists when the government tried to adjust rebates for simple procedures. They blocked the government's efforts to close down the flawed chronic disease dental scheme, a program that was supposed to cost $377 million over four years but which has cost $800 million in the last two years alone. The list goes on. Altogether, the opposition are blowing an $11 billion hole in the health budget over the forward estimates. The opposition's failure to implement changes like these is financially irresponsible and puts our health system at great risk of not being able to cope with the rising demand from our growing and ageing population. We know we need that money to be put to work in a better health system. The people of Central Queensland have been telling me for years about their priority when it comes to health services: there is a great need for an improvement in cancer services in Central Queensland to stop the heart breaking reality of so many people having to travel to Brisbane and be separated re- from their family to receive the treatment but that they need once they have been diagnosed with cancer. That is why I welcomed the call in November last year for applications to the government's regional cancer centre program and I strongly supported the application which went forward to that program from the Rockhampton Base Hospital. I was delighted when the Prime Minister came to Rockhampton just a few weeks ago to announce that, indeed, the Rockhampton Base Hospital would be the site for one of those regional cancer centres. We will be putting $67 million towards the upgrade to cancer services in Rockhampton which will serve the whole Central Queensland community-people in places like Emerald and Gladstone as well as in the rural towns around Rockhampton. Among other things, the funding will provide for additional che$2 bilmotherapy chairs, taking the number of chairs from five, I think, to 16, and also for moving towards being able to provide radiation therapy in Rockhampton. I raised the issues of the MRI and the cancer centre just to illustrate once more why the government are so focused on finding efficiencies and savings within the health budget. We need to get the most out of every health dollar to ensure Australians can get the care that they need now and into the future. The change contained in the bill before the House right now is a fair and common sense proposal and it is consistent with this goal. It increases choice for patients, and we also hope it will increase competition in the pathology sector. It is a very sensible reform and one that I am happy to support.",158
180,Ms GRIERSON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I rise to give support today to this amendment to the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010. This important amendment aims to improve patient choice in respect of pathology services. The act in its current form requires that, in order for Medicare benefit to be payable for a pathology service rendered by or on behalf of an approved pathology practitioner, a request for the service must be made to that particular pathology practitioner or to the approved pathology authority, who is the proprietor of the laboratory through which the service is rendered. The Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill amends the Health Insurance Act by removing this restriction. To explain it more simply, under the current act a patient is effectively required to attend the approved pathology practitioner or authority named on the request form by a GP or specialist. This legislative change will allow patients to take a pathology request to a pathology provider of their choice and will encourage providers to compete on price and convenience for patients. It improves choice and increases convenience for patients, and that is something the Rudd government is committed to providing in the healthcare sector. Doctors will still be able and encourCare aged to advise patients on their choice of pathology provider. It is anticipated that in most cases patients will attend the approved pathology practitioner or approved pathology authority recommended by their doctor. It must also be mentioned that pathology providers will still be allowed to produce branded request forms that include a provider's company logo and address and provide these to requesting practitioners. This proposal will be implemented from 1 July 2010, with a transition period of 12 months in respect of the changes to the regulations, to minimise any regulatory impact on practices. This amendment will ensure that patients have real choice in pathology services. Most importantly, it will make access to pathology services easier for patients. I must stress that, in my own electorate of Newcastle, having choice in terms of access to medical services and having convenience a in accessing those services is an issue that is front and centre. Recently in Newcastle we saw the closure of the Lambton Family Medical Centre. When we do not see a patient centred approach to the provision of medical services, as elected representatives we certainly learn all about it. The medical centre that I am referring to was owned by Primary Health Care. This centre was closed by Primary Health Care with no notice to staff or patients. In fact, it was closed on Friday, 19 March. Anyone who turned up at the door of that surgery or who rang trying to arrange future appointments or get access to other information or services on that Friday was told of the closure. Staff and doctors themselves were informed on that very day. A sign was placed in the window of the Lambton Family Medical Centre informing anyone walking past that the practice was closed, that the transfer of the practice would happen over the weekend and that Primary Health would take the Lambton Family Medical Centre to its other Newcastle based medical centre, located at Charlestown. I must stress that the Lambton Family Medical Centre premises have been used as a general practice surgery in Lambton for 108 years. Lambton is a suburb with many long term residents, so you can imagine that there is an amazing attachment to that centre by those much older patients. The premises were leased to Primary Health Care by one of the doctors working with that practice. When the distress of patients over the closure became obvious, naturally I wrote to Primary Health Care for some explanation as to why they would close that practice so abruptly without regard to patient need, as was being brought to my attention. I received a response from Dr Bateman, the CEO of Primary Health Care, and I spoke to him personally on the phone. He said to me that the LFMC was no longer a viable practice and he could not be assured that the lease would be renewed or of the continuity of availability of the two full-time GPs and four part-time GPs operating from that centre. He also said that it was tough managing medical practices, that the rebate was not sufficient make them viable and that he actually used his own pathology services to cross-subsidise the practice. I can say to you that the patients were not particularly interested in these excuses. They were very concerned, particularly when on the following day, Saturday, a company called Sidameneo, acting on behalf of Primary Health Care, came into vacate those premises and ‘make them good'. I have seen photos and I have looked through the window at the damage done to that surgery. It is extensive, it is extreme and certainly there would be concerns that there was some intent to do as much damage as possible. I looked up that company, Sidameneo, in the Australian Securities and Investments Commission records, which showed that this company is a one-share, one-dollar company and it has four directors: Thomas Henry Carwardine Bateman, Edmund Gregory Thomas Bateman, Edmund James Carwardine Bateman and Mr Andrew Duff, the Secretary of Primary Health Care. Obviously the patients were witness to the fate of that practice-it is in their local ping centre-and they were distressed by it and concerned that a practice that they had frequented and felt a sense of loyalty towards was being treated in such a way. I am told that there were 11,900 people registered with the Lambton practice who were active patients in the last two years. As I mentioned, they started to contact me immediately after the closure, concerned for their patient records, for the continuity of their care and about the transfer of the practice and their records to Primary Health Care's Charlestown centre. I visited the site of the former Lambton Family Medical Centre. I had advertised my planned attendance at the centre only that morning on local radio and, when I arrived, there were already 70 people waiting to see me. Over 100 people came during the next to two hours to talk about their experiences. They expressed to me their anger towards Primary Health Care for the way the practice had been closed and for how they had not been informed. They expressed that there was now some great distrust towards Primary Health Care. Many patients told me of the disruption to their care. One IVF patient needed constant monitoring by her doctor. Another patient was booked in for heart surgery, but, because specialist results were no longer available and no-one could track those down in time, his heart surgery had to be deferred. When told about the transfer of records to the Charlestown centre, patients were particularly telling me that it was inconvenient. It is not a great distance from Lambton, about seven kilometres, but it is across a major highway, with little public transport connectivity, and very inconvenient for older patients to attend. Some alleged they had attended that centre to ask for their records or to ask what was happening, and there were long queues of people outside the surshopgery trying to find out about their records. They also had no access to recent medical tests. Many of the older patients are on a special anticoagulant drug that needs constant monitoring. They wanted someone to tell them that their records or their test results were there and they needed to find their GPs. At that stage I had 200 patients sign a petition requesting that their records not be left with Primary Health Care and that GP Access, our local division of general practice, manage the distribution of their records. I wrote to Primary Health Care suggesting that they could perhaps consider entering into an agreement with GP Access to manage the transfer of the 11,900 patient records. GP Access, of course, is the nation's leader in after-hours care and has a call centre available all day. It offered to manage record transfers at no cost to Primary Health Care and no cost to patients. The patients who were arriving at Charlestown were told that, if they did not find a GP to help them access those records within a month, they would be charged up to $100 for their records. They had great difficulty, given the shortage of GPs, getting an appointment with another GP. Fortunately GP Access provided some special after-hours clinics at the local centres that they operate to renew prescriptions and to attend to any urgent matters for those patients. Some local GPs whose books were closed offered one consultation for the patients of Lambton Family Medical Centre just to help them out-and remember this was two weeks before the Easter period, so it was a very hard time for those patients. That offer was refused by Primary Health Care, as was their right. They said to me that they were competitors. GP Access and Primary Health Care are commercial competitors in the medical services field. They said they would not be entering into any agreement. That was disappointing because it would have brought some credit to Primary Health Care and would have shown some concern for their patients. The difficulty was that only one doctor transferred to the new Primary Health Care centre from the Lambton centre. Of course he was able to make appointments for any Lambton Family Medical Centre patients, but patients then told me of the difficulty of getting an appointment and the queues that they had to endure to access any doctor at the new centre. Unfortunately, things did not end there. It seems that Primary Health Care had entered into a contract with the previous doctors who worked with them, and then they proceeded to exercise restraint of trade clauses. This is in a regional city that already has shortages of medical general practitioners. It is a difficult situation where five doctors are taken out of circulation and Primary Health Care can only offer access to one, but then seek to exercise a restraint of trade clause through litigation. There was also litigation from the landlord, a doctor who owned the premises, for the damage to property. It is a fairly nasty situation. As the member for Newcastle, my priority concern is patient care. I would like to share with you some of the stories of patients at that practice. For example, one of my constituents says she had been a patient at that centre for more than 36 years. She had two pulmonary embolisms nine years ago and has weekly blood testings to determine her medication levels. Usually she could ring the family medical centre and get the results over the phone without having to speak to her doctor. When she rang the new Primary Health Centre at Charlestown for results after her records were transferred, she was put on hold for 30 minutes before being told those results were not available. She called four times the next day for those results but still was not given an answer. She had her number taken each time and was told she would be called back, but she was not called back. During the last call she was told her new doctor would have to call back to get her results. She was not called back until 7.30 pm the following evening, two days after her initial inquiry. Another constituent of mine from North Lambton is a 33-year-old mother of two. Her husband tragically passed away on Good Friday of a terminal illness. As a former patient of one of the doctors who had practised at Lambton Family Medical Centre, she was required to contact her doctor to have the death certificate of her husband signed. She went to the Charlestown Centre on Saturday, the day after her husband died, to ask if her previous doctor was available to sign the certificate. But she was told that they were unable to contact that doctor and that no other doctor was available to sign the death certificate. Fortunately GP Access did assist her to find that doctor and have the death certificate signed. Primary Health Care must have realised that their actions were extremely rude and inconsiderate and so they asked her to come and speak to them about that. They spent a few minutes apologising before spending the rest of the time justifying their actions, seeking sympathy for their own position. Her words to me were, ‘I don't like to be rude, but, after 10 minutes of hearing them justify their position, I left.' That is just unacceptable. Another constituent told me that his neighbour, a former Lambton patient, had a serious diabetes condition and for over 20 years had been with one of the former doctors. He was unable to access the new surgery and when he tried he faced long waits to see his doctor. Because he had built up trust with that doctor, he did not want to see other doctors. He did manage to find another GP in a nearby suburb, but his health deteriorated rapidly and he was faced with a wait of up to a week for an appointment. Unfortunately that patient passed away shortly after. I do not draw any connection to that, but what I have to say is this was distressing for very many aged patients. There were no measures put in place by Primary Health Care to monitor high-needs patients and respond to their needs. Another patient complained of the loss of independence. One of my constituents, who is blind and has a guide dog, could walk to the surgery and now feels that his whole independence has been taken away from him. I know that each patient has an individual situation, but these were just a few of the hundreds of patients who shared their stories with me. It is not good enough for Primary Health Care to adopt a corporate approach to the delivery of medical services. Under duty of care, under negligence laws, it must be a case of them having to do a little bit more than they did in the case of the Lambton Family Medical Centre. I am distressed for my constituents that Primary Health Care conducted themselves in such a manner. I do feel there was an opportunity for decent collaboration that would have assisted continuity of care and certainly Primary Health Care could do everything it wanted after that, after it fulfilled that responsibility, to compete hard for their share of patients. I would have thought that the bottom line of any business would always improve when customer service was at least part of the plan. When I look at the media records around Primary Health Care-their closure of the Lambton Family Medical Centre, their closure of another practice here in Canberra in a similar way and the speed at which Dr Bateman and Primary Health Care enter into litigation, a very good way of stopping any opposition-I have to say to Dr Bateman: that is not acceptable practice. I was so concerned about that sort of action that I wrote to all the peak bodies in Australia asking them how they enforce or encourage best practice and ethical standards in such an important area, patient care. I asked them: - Does your professional code of conduct encompass ethical behaviour regarding notification to patients and staff of the closure of medical practices? - What principles do you think should apply to the notification and management of closures? - As each state and territory has different laws governing patient records, what general principles and protocols around the management of patient records do you include or do you think should be included in your professional code of conduct? - Given the GP shortage, particularly in regional areas, how does your organisation view the current mismatch between the professional duty of care to patients and plication of commercial provisions such as restraint of business clauses that restrict cess and competition? I have received one response in that short period of time, from the Australian Medical Council. They have been instrumental in drawing up a national code of professional conduct for medical practitioners. That new code, Good medical practice, is very much needed because we are looking at requiring national registration of medical practitioners from the middle of this year. (Extension of time granted) I thank my parliamentary colleagues for their support in allowing me to extend my time to address these issues. I am pleased that there is going to be a national code of conduct, but how is it going to be enforced? If it is going to be enforced through litigation, how are people going to withstand that conduct? We know that Primary Health Care has undertaken litigation around the use of the term ‘primary health care'-a phrase that preceded their existence. They are claiming all commercial rights to that phrase. I understand the issues of commercialisation and profit and return, but I do not think they fit well with a patient centred approach to medical care. I say to Primary Health Care: you would do well to try to marry your commercial needs with the needs of patients in a more humane and ethical way. As you can imagine, Madam Deputy Speaker, I became very involved with the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, and her office and with the Prime Minister on these issues. I am delighted to see in the budget that, just as in the legislation we are discussing, we have put patient care at the centre of the relationship between doctors and pathology services. The situation with the Lambton Family Medical Centre in my electorate is unrethe ap- solved. GP Access have done everything they can to help the patients to find new docactors and to assist the doctors who have been misplaced, but litigation continues. The litigation is now even extending to other places that host doctors from the LFMC who have not been satisfied to stay under the umbrella of Primary Health Care. I note from recent press articles that Primary Health Care adopted a practice at some of their centres of charging a copayment up front. When a patient walked into one of these centres and said, ‘I want to see a GP,' they would pay a co-payment. They might be told, ‘It'll be 30 minutes wait.' If they had to leave before actually seeing a doctor, to pick up their child from child care or whatever, even if they had sat there waiting for two or three hours, they would have to forfeit the copayment. I find it extraordinary and unbelievable that that would be acceptable to any firm in general practice. I say to Primary Health Care: please reconsider taking legal action in the case of doctors involved at the Lambton Family Medical Centre, please reconsider your conduct for the sake of your reputation, and please follow the codes of conduct that are being developed by the professional medical peak bodies. Patients in Newcastle will be very pleased that the Rudd government is addressing some of these problems. E-health records will be such a benefit. Patients having control of their records will be exemplary in the area of patient centred care. At this stage in Newcastle people are receiving half a page of notes to represent 20 years of interaction with their doctors. That is not a patient record. I do not know why Primary Health Care are not giving patients their full records, but I do not think it is acceptable. Eheath records will be an improvement, as will be the ability for doctors to apply for infrastructure grants. Looking at the destruction of the Lambton Family Medical Centre, I know it is going to take a grant to restore to a surgery. I am told by the landlord that the improvements that were damaged are his improvements; they do not belong to Primary Health Care. That is, of course, a matter of legal dispute. Grants for infrastructure will be a great thing, as will Medicare Local, using local networks of GPs, who can cooperate around these issues. Those are very welcome developments. I thank Minister Roxon. I thank the Prime Minister for his interest in this matter. I ticularly thank GP Access, who did everything they could to assist the patients of LFMC in this regard.",161
181,Mr DUTTON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010 removes the legislative requirement for requests to be made to a particular approved pathology provider for Medicare benefits to be payable. The change will allow patients to access pathology services at any approved pathology provider. It is claimed that this measure will give patients additional choice and encourage price competition within the sector. On the face of it, the intent of this bill seems worthy. The coalition supports patient choice in accessing health care but we note concerns regarding the implementation of this change to pathology referrals. This is a significant change, and proper consideration needs to be given to patient safety and quality of care. The 2009 budget measure was not subject to consultation. Submissions to the Department of Health and Ageing on implementation of this measure only closed on 22 February, some 12 days after the Minister for Health and Ageing introduced this bill into the parliament. As such, compelling concerns raised by stakeholders were not considered by the government prior to proceeding with this bill. There is variation in the range of services offered by pathology practices, the it methods and equipment used and methods of communication between pathology practices and referring doctors. Cost is a very important consideration for patients, but it may not always be the most appropriate basis for deciding on a service provider. In the minister's second reading speech she admitted that ‘there are often valid clinical reasons for recommending a particular pathology provider over another'. The minister's only comment on this issue was to say parthat the government will continue to encourage medical practitioners to discuss options with patients. That is an entirely insufficient response to a fundamental issue in this legislation. Clinical issues are not the only concern, though. Presently there are clear lines of communication between referring doctors and pathology practices. Pathology practices ensure that results are provided to GPs and other medical practitioners in a timely manner by means of established delivery systems and compatible IT systems. Pathology practices also often have established means of contacting referring doctors after hours and in cases of emergency. The government has failed to explain how new referral pathways will operate in cases where the pathology practice is unknown to the referring doctor. A lost or delayed result may have very serious consequences for patients and medico-legal implications for the referring doctor. There are over 2,100 collection centres and almost 400 pathology laboratories in Australia. On the available information, there will be no way for referring doctors to trace results if a report goes missing or if the result is delayed. These are issues that the government should have considered and resolved prior to proceeding with this legislation. It has been noted that similar arrangements already exist for diagnostic imaging. There are differences between pathology and diagnostic imaging procedures, and the number of tests per patient is generally lower for diagnostic imaging. Imaging tests are usually undertaken with the patient present, and the patient is provided with the results. is also argued that imaging methodology is standard across all providers and, unlike pathology, diagnostic imaging is not as frequently used to monitor chronic conditions or medication treatment. It is incorrect to claim that the process that works for diagnostic imaging will work for pathology services. The government's record in health has done nothing to improve the situation for patients. There is growing concern in the community about decreasing levels of bulk billing for pathology. This largely affects older Australians-self-funded retirees and pensioners with fixed incomes. Now faced with a situation of increased patient out-ofpocket expenses, the minister is responding by rushing through another measure. Once again, she has not thought through the detail, and bungling of this measure will affect patient health outcomes. It is irresponsible minister of the Crown to announce a policy without having any plan for its implementation. Unfortunately, we have seen the disastrous consequences of such recklessness with the Rudd government's Home-Insulation Program. This minister has a long list of bungles of her own. This House, and most Australians, are all too familiar with her bungled handling of health policy, including her baseless cuts to the cataract surgery rebate, the attempted capping of Medicare benefits for macular degeneration treatment, the bungled capping and backflip on Medicare IVF assistance, the cutting of funding for chemotherapy treatment, the complete farce of amending the government's own midwife and nurse practitioner bill and then withdrawing the amendment and her blatant broken promises on private health insurance. Whilst there might be support for the intent of the bill before us, its implementation looks set to again be a It bungled episode by a minister who has not worked through the detail. The minister has introduced a simple bill on pathology referrals without any idea of how it will operate in practice. If this minister cannot get the so called small ticket items right; how on earth can Australians trust this minister-or indeed this Prime Minister-to deliver major reform for our public hospitals? The Rudd government could not manage a program putting insulation into ceilings. It is no wonder that there is so much concern about their ability to manage the health and hospital system. This will only get worse with the economically reckless Rudd government. The Rudd government cannot be trusted to run a $100 billion health system, and the minister's inability to be across the detail is on display with this bill today. There are significant unresolved issues regarding the implementation of this measure which for a the government should have addressed prior to its introduction. The coalition does support measures which improve patient choice, but the government must demonstrate that a different pathology referral process can work and that patient health outcomes will not be adversely affected. A Senate committee inquiry into this bill is in its final stages and will hopefully provide some of the answers and do the work that the minister should have done. Before I close, I want to address some of the false allegations that were made in an earlier contribution by the member for Dobell in relation to the candidate for Robertson, Darren Jameson. This was a grubby attack by the member for Dobell on the Liberal candidate for Robertson. It was a grubby, baseless attack, and it needs to be addressed. What I can say about Darren Jameson",167
182,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The member for Dickson is straying. I did not hear the comments from the member for Dobell, but this is notMr Dutton-They were at length.",169
183,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,The member for Dickson will hear me out. This is not relevant to the bill. There are other forms in the House in which this matter can be taken up.,169
184,Mr DUTTON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"On the point of order, if I might just point out to the House and for your consideration that this is in fact relating to this bill, not just because there was a contribution made in the member's speech but also because the health insurance amendment bill 2010 directly relates to the issue which is in dispute. The comments that were made by the member for Dobell relate to",169
185,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"If you can link them to the bill then I can see it, but I cannot at the moment. If you can relate it for me then please do.",169
186,Mr DUTTON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"They relate to a service in relation to cancer and oncology services in this electorate, and that is how it relates to the health insurance amendment bill 2010. Some of the funding in this bill, as I understand it, is provided for these services, including those to which the member for Dobell referred earlier. So it is entirely priate that this be addressed because the Liberal candidate for Robertson, Darren Jameson, in a press release said that he was disappointed to learn that the new cancer clinic at Gosford Hospital announced by the Prime Minister was not a priority, is at the bottom of the list and could be some years away from becoming a reality. To quote: Like all residents on the Central Coast IDarren Jamesonwelcome any funding that is directed into health services in that local area and as such I fully support the announcement made by the Prime Minster in Gosford. However, it's unforgivable to give false hope to cancer suffers and the impression that this facility was about to be delivered, when in reality the announcement was yet just another photo opportunity for the Prime Minister and the Premier. Mr Jameson goes on: I now urgently call on the government for some direct action, to commence discussions with the Central Coast Radiotherapy Oncology Centre …",169
187,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,I think the member for Dickson has made his point and is straying from the bill again.,169
188,Mr DUTTON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I of course take your counsel. But, for your consideration, this is directly related to the health insurance amendment bill and to that head act. I do think it is relevant to address it not only because of that but also because it was brought up and addressed at some length in a previous contribution, and apparently that was within the standing orders.",169
189,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"The member for Dickson, as I said, I did not see it. If the speaker did not take it up with the member for Dobell, I will actually go and view that. The difficulty I have is that if everybody bends the rules then I am left with no rules. Then I am-and every occupier of the chair is-put into an insidious position. But as the first Deputy Speaker-you have copped me, appro- I am sorry-I actually have to set the benchmark a bit higher than the rest. I appreciate what you say. Latitude can happen in debate, but I think we are straying now and I would ask you to wind up if you are getting to that point.",169
190,Mr DUTTON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I of course would not seek to cause you any distress. In conclusion, the coalition does support this bill. We do not support grubby attacks like that from the member for Dobell. We have highlighted the concerns in relation to this bill. We hope that the minister heeds the concerns of the industry and of patients. The coalition is about choice. We are about providing better patient outcomes. We are concerned that this is going to be yet another botched attempt by the Rudd government in relation to health. The Rudd government promises so much in relation to health, not just this bill but other measures, and, regrettably, on many occasions, just gets it wrong or simply cannot deliver. They are our reservations and we highlight them again. We support the thrust of the bill but we are concerned about yet another bungle by this minister.",169
191,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,I thank the member for Dickson for his assistance.,170
192,Mrs ELLIOT,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,I thank all the members who have made valuable contributions in relation to this debate. Of course the Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010 removes the legislative restriction that effectively requires a patient to take a request for a pathology service to the approved pathology practitioner or approved pathology authority named on the request in order for a Medicare benefit to be payable for the pathology service provided. This legislative change will allow patients to take a pathology request to an approved pathology practitioner or approved pathology authority of their choice and will encourage pathology providers to compete on price and convenience for patients. These amendments will take effect from July 2010. Of course doctors will be encouraged to continue to advise their patients on the best choice of pathology provider for their needs. I commend the bill. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading,170

194,Mr GRAY,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia) (6.51 pm)-I rise today to speak in support of the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2010. It is an important bill for a number of reasons. It will amend the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 and in so doing deliver real benefits to Indigenous students around Australia. By adjusting the 2010-12 financial appropriations to cover the cost of the Sporting Chance Program, the bill will make a significant contribution to closing the gap in education outcomes of Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians. By adjusting the 2010-12 financial appropriations to cover the cost of the Sporting Chance program, the bill will make a significant contribution to closing the gap in education outcomes of Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians. As the Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia, I am acutely aware of the challenges Indigenous students face, particularly in rural and remote communities. That is why the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Bill 2010 is so important. We know that education is the pathway to opportunity and secure, well-paid jobs. But only a bit more than 47 per cent of Indigenous young people in 2006 got to year 12 or equivalent. In 2008 the employment gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians aged 15 to 64 stood at around 21 per cent. This bill amends the act to include ongoing funding through the Sporting Chance program, a program which uses sport as a hook to engage Indigenous students in learning and, through the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program, move from remote areas for postsecondary education and training. The funding provided under this bill will help ensure Indigenous students are supported to overcome barriers to education and deliver very real benefits to rural communities. It is lutely essential that both sides of the parliawill ment work together to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, to maximise educational opportunities and to ensure as many Indigenous students as possible complete their high school education. We need Indigenous people job ready, and education is a critical part of that process. This is the first time that a government has recognised Indigenous disadvantage as a national problem which requires a targeted and measurable approach. This is a significant but necessary challenge. In November 2008 the government committed to reduce the gap in life expectancy and opportunities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. This will not be an easy task, but it is one that we as a government are determined to take on. One of the main reasons I stood for parliament was my belief that as a country we can overcome the very real social challenges in our Indigenous communitiesand this is not restricted to education. Indigenous Australians have higher infant mortality rates and lower life expectancies, and higher levels of alcohol and substance abuse are prevalent amongst Indigenous communities. The Closing the Gap report 2010, released by the Prime Minister earlier this year, affirmed and underlined what we already knew: that the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous life expectancy at birth is almost 20 years-it is in fact 17 years. Indigenous children in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory are almost four times more likely to die before they reach the age of five than nonIndigenous children. This is an absolute disgrace. The Closing the Gap report provides a framework to move forward. It has redefined the way we as a government approach the issues we face as Australians. As a government we will achieve a halving of the gap in absoliteracy and numeracy within a decade. We have the gap in year 12 attainment or its equivalent by 2020. We are working towards this goal and making progress that this bill will ensure continues. This bill will complement the government's other initiatives to close the gap in Indigenous education. Examples of our goals are to have the gap for Indigenous students in reading, writing and numeracy before 2018, and by 2020 to have reduced by half the Indigenous young people aged between 20 and 24 years who have not completed year 12. As it stands today, the gap between the proportion of Indigenous and non-Indigenous students who complete secondary school is huge. In 2006 only 47.4 per cent of Indigenous young people got their year 12 equivalent. In 2008 the employment gap between Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians aged 15 to 64 was 21 per cent. Some of the most insightful programs to help young people both to stay at school and, by staying at school, become job ready, are the Clontarf programs. A program which I have become closely associated with in Western Australia is the Clontarf Girls Academy. I would like to read a couple of case studies, examples of young students who, in taking advantage of the sports based Clontarf program, have been not only to stay in school but, by staying in school, have been able to, firstly, perform better, but secondly, have a better opportunity at getting their lives on track. I will read the example here of someone who, in my case study, is anonymously ‘student A'. A year 11 student transferred to Clontarf from Kalgoorlie in the middle of the year. Mr Randall-A good program.",170
195,Mr GRAY,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"I know the member for Canning is a strong supporter of the Clontarf program, and has been for many years. He is acknowledged for his support for Clontarf by all of the members of the Clontarf organisation. It is a great credit to them that they have an advocate as strong as the member for Canning, but it also speaks volumes for him that he is, and has been over the years, such a strong supporter of Clontarf. Mr Randall-Very nice of you, thank you.",172
196,Mr GRAY,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"Despite having strict parents, this young woman still did not attend school on a consistent basis from the time that she had enrolled in the college. It was not until the school and the academy had discovered her talent for singing that her attendance improved. She was asked to sing at a number of school functions but was told that she had to be there to practice with the school teachers' aide. Student A came every day in anticipation of the event and soaked up every opportunity to learn from her new singing tutor. Student A successfully performed at two school functions and continues to be at school everyday in preparation for year 12 in 2010. This is what Student A said: Singing in front of people is a really big fear of mine, but I think practicing with Judy and being a bit more proud of myself made me a bit more confident. Singing at the Girls Academy Awards and Mass was a huge step for me. I was nervous on both days, but I think getting back a positive response from the audience definitely boosted my confidence more. It was a great experience for me and I enjoyed myself. To have young Indigenous women reflecting that they not only enjoyed the experience at school but got from it greater pride and personal confidence speaks volumes for the way in which these programs work. I will read from case study B: As the Girls Academy began interviewing for the Development Officer position earlier in the year, one of the candidates expressed her concern for a young relative of hers located in Cairns, Queensland. The young woman, aged 17 was not expected to graduate high school because she had disengaged the year before and become involved in drugs and alcohol. She loved to play basketball and it was widely known she was quite a talented young player. She had a significant presence about her, but was not confident that she could make it to graduation for a wide range of reasons. With the help of Ricky, the Academy was able to negotiate the terms of her transfer from her previous high school and basketball club and got her started at the school in a the core curriculum available at the school. Staff were not sure how city life would fit in with her, but she seemed to have a relatively stable home life to help her cope. It was first thought that this student did not have the capacity to communicate verbally as well as any other student. It was also thought that this student could not understand directions or written English beyond the age of 11 according to her carer. As she progressed through her classes, the Academy continued to push her limits. She started to demonstrate a vast array of abilities in the classroom and in the sporting arena. While her punctuality and occasionally, attendance, was an she continued to excel and soon became one of the most competent students in the school. The young woman eventually graduated and has requested help from Academy staff to help her jump to the next chapter in her life. Here is an example of her writing as seen in her Academy journal in response to a guest speaker: I thought the guest speaker spoke about a lot of important things in regards to our Indigenous mentality. She also addressed a few issues that we have here at school, such as the listening part. She was very inspirational and I really enjoyed her life stories, especially about the missions the dreamtime. I could go on with outstanding case studies that demonstrate the importance of the Clontarf Academy. I could go on with case studies that point to the importance of the work that Ricky Grace and Role Models does, but I do not need to do that. Suffice to say that these institutions are wonderful. They do a great job and it is appropriate that the government, through this initiative, supports these programs. It provides the right enduring mechanism to help get young Indigenous people job ready so that they can take up job opportunities such as those made available through Generation One through a whole range of companies, today. I commend this bill to the House.  speak on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2010. The bill amends the funding tables in the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to include the additional $10.93 million allocated to the Sporting Chance program announced in the 2009-10 budget. There is no additional appropriation in this bill; it simply transfers $10.93 million from Appropriations Act (No. 1) to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 from 1 January 2010. The Sporting Chance program is an initiaissue, tive of the previous, coalition government, originally announced in the 2006-07 budget. The initial commitment was for $19.6 million over four years to 30 June 2010 to establish 20 sporting academies. This initiative was inspired by the Clontarf Foundation Football Academy, Western Australia, which was established in January 2000, and which my colleague the member for Canning has had so much to do with and has been so supportive of. In passing, I might say that the member for Canning has been praised not and only by the opposition side of the House, as one might expect, but also by the parliamentary secretary, for his work with the Clontarf Foundation Football Academy and the great support he has given them. I note that in December 2008, as part of the Rudd government's Closing the Gap strategy to address Indigenous disadvantage, the government provided a further $10 million over four years to expand the former coalition government's program. This continued support is a testimony to the success of the program. It is one initiative actually achieving its desired outcomes in engaging Indigenous boys and girls in school through involvement with sport. The Sporting Chance program is delivering positive results for Indigenous students, particularly from remote and rural areas of Australia. I am pleased to note that the results collected in 2009 indicate attendance rates are starting to climb and are, on average, better than attendance rates for Indigenous students not involved in the program. What is equally pleasing to note is that more than half of the academy students were reported by the schools to be improving their academic performance and many were also reported to have made significant gains with respect to behaviour and self-esteem. Without education, trying to excel in life on the whole, and obtain employment in Australia, is very difficult. It is a given we must provide every Australian the best educational opportunities we can, but it is particularly important for young Indigenous people. No matter where you look around the globe, education remains the fundamental means to improving living standards and decreasing poverty. I cannot stand here today and say that I am proud when I read statistics which show Indigenous life expectancy in this country remains lower than average life expectancy in Australia. It is an issue we all remain concerned about and I know that those on both sides of the House would like to improve it. While acknowledging that we have a long way to go to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, we certainly did make progress under the coalition government. Under the 11 years of the previous government, incremental progress occurred across all sectors of Indigenous education as a result of targeted federal government programs such as the one we are speaking about today in the House. We know that Indigenous participation in the vocational and educational training area improved in all locations between 1996 and 2005, with much of this improvement occurring in remote areas. Indigenous higher education graduates also continued to have higher take-up rates into full-time employment. A notable contribution toward this improvement was the former coalition government's funding towards tutorial assistance to help Indigenous students improve their literacy and numeracy. But we still have a long way to go in improving literacy and numeracy. Trends show that Indigenous Australians fall behind the rest of the population when it comes to literacy and numeracy performance. Results from last year's NAPLAN tests are mixed. Literacy and numeracy improvements for that years 3, 5 and 7 have been countered by a decline for year 9. As the Centre for Independent Studies concluded this year in a major policy paper on Indigenous education, there is negligible improvement in student performance. So, for a moment, let us talk about other markers of improvement. Recent reports tell us that Indigenous school retention rates from the start of high school to year 12 have risen from 30.7 per cent in 1995 to 46.5 per cent in 2008. Even with these signs of some improvement, what hope for an education does any child in this country have if we cannot even keep them in our school system? Needless to say, when it comes to Indigenous attendance in schools, there is still much to be done. We all know that the reality is that secondary education and training opportunities are limited for those living in remote communities. These young people need the extra support to become leaders, mentors and role models within their home communities. A young Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person should and can be encouraged to undertake study or training opportunities and then return to their home town and contribute to their community through their improved knowledge, life or skill sets. I know that the member for Canning, who will make a contribution to this debate tonight, has a significant Aboriginal population and a significant interest in his electorate because of the basing of the Clontarf Foundation in Canning. I am sure he will have some success stories to share with the House and I am sure that he has seen such situations occur many times. It is true that some of us in city seats do not see the real life examples day by day, but we do want to encourage those who are working amongst the communities. Some young people may never return to their home towns but still will create a sense of hope opportunity for younger members of their community. This is what we need: role models who will demonstrate that education opens doors and enriches lives. There is a real need to expand on the opportunities so that Indigenous students can have these role models as their teachers and educators. The government has made promises to Indigenous Australians through Closing the Gap, but it has failed to deliver on any real reform. But we certainly will not be opposing this bill. We want to continue supporting the work of those who are directly involved in this program. We need to give Indigenous students across our country the best possible access to quality education. I commend this bill to the House.",172
197,Mr TREVOR,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"I rise tonight to speak in support of the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2010. It is a bill that will make valuable and important amendments to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act, effectively providing scope for the improvement of education outcomes of Indigenous Australians. The bill will maintain commitments to initiatives introduced by the former government, including the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program and the Sporting Chance Program. The bill will increase appropriations for non-Abstudy payments by $10.3 million between 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2013. This funding is as a result of a 2009-10 budget measure, which provided an additional $10 million worth of funding over four years for the Sporting Chance Program. The government's arrangements will see more funding flow to Indigenous students. The current forward estimates of Commonwealth funding for Indigenous education over 200912 total approximately $2.3 billion, some $200 million more than the estimated $2.1 billion announced by the former government and prior to the commencement of the 2005-08 quadrennium. The appropriations outlined in this bill will enable the Commonwealth to continue to exercise public leadership and maintain its dedicated support for localised initiatives which improve Indigenous education outcomes. This role includes collaboratively setting policy directions and priorities in Indigenous education, as well as engagement with stakeholders and investment in research and evidence in conjunction with states, territories and non-government education providers to support future reforms and systemic improvements in the education and training sectors for Indigenous Australians. The act has appropriated funding for two quadrenniums for the purpose of improving education outcomes for Indigenous Australians. The bill will transfer funding for the 2009-10 budget measure Closing the Gap Sporting Chance Program from the annual administered expense of the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000. This is necessary because funding under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act did not include the additional appropriation of these funds for this program. This will allow all funding for the program to be combined under the one act. The new arrangements for supplement recurrent funding will provide states and other education providers with greater flexibility in how they use Commonwealth funding to address the needs of their Indigenous students. However, the bill will allow the Commonwealth to continue its national leadership role in Indigenous education through the retention of targeted initiatives as Commonwealth own purpose expenses. It should also be noted that funding for some initiatives appropriated under this bill is not evenly spread across the quadrennium. This may create the illusion that funding under the bill decreases in 2011 and 2012, but the reality is that both the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program and Indigenous Youth Leadership Program finish their expansion phases and will see increasing numbers of participants completing from the end of 2010. This bill is important for Indigenous Australians. It is an important step that will in closing the gap in education between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students. The provision of this funding will allow improvements in Indigenous education outcomes. The Indigenous students of our country are at a severe disadvantage because of significant gaps between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous levels of literacy and numeracy skills, year 12 or equivalent attainment and employment outcomes. The funding in this bill aims at reducing these gaps through the programs that it will support. There is certainly no denying the fact that there is a significant gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students in education. Despite the fact that the majority of Indigenous students meet the minimum standards of reading, writing and numeracy, the success rate of them meeting this standard is far lower than the number of their nonIndigenous classmates that do so. The government is committed to ensuring that students from all backgrounds and all locations have a chance to access good education. The government is working with both government and non-government training providers to achieve numerous very important goals that will provide greater opportunities for Indigenous students. One of these goals is the halving of the gaps in literacy and numeracy achievement. The target is to have each of the gaps in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 reading, writing and numeracy achievement between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students by 2018. Other goals include halving the gaps in year 12 or equivalent attainment and also halving the gaps in employment outcome for Indigenous Australians. The government and non-government training providers also aim to see every Indigenous four-year-old in remote communities have the opportunity to access an early learning program. This aim in particular is of critical importance to achieving the goals of assist halving the gaps, because, as with any endeavour, it is important that people get the best start and the best opportunities from the outset. By starting Indigenous people in remote communities on the path of learning at a young age we can provide them with the same chances of success that most young people receive, and encourage them to continue learning as they grow and develop. It will, in effect, significantly contribute to the achievement of the goals of halving the gaps. The government has committed to establishing national collaborative arrangements that will assist us to collectively work towards these targets. However, the Commonwealth must maintain an ability to provide national leadership and perspectives to close the gaps. An important component of the plan to close the gaps is the Sporting Chance Program, which uses sport to engage Indigenous students and show the value of education, and $10 million dollars was committed to the program in the 2009-10 budget, with $5 million dollars directed towards establishing 10 new sports based academies, with a specific focus on improving the participation and engagement of girls, and $5 million going to the Former Origin Greats which will be used to establish academies that will focus on rugby league in Queensland and New South Wales. Past evidence has shown that this program has been successful at achieving improvements and working effectively towards closing the gap. Under the Sporting Chance Program, improvements in attendance and considerable success in retaining students end of year 12 at the schools in which they have been operating have been achieved. Average attendance rates are climbing and the attendance rates of Indigenous students involved with the program are better on average than those of Indigenous students not involved with the program. This is quite significant and demonstrates the effectiveness of this program. These facts also demonstrate why the program should continue and why the appropriation of funds for it is so important. The success that the Sporting Chance Program has achieved is substantial and it would be irrational to allow it to end. This bill will ensure it continues, helping to achieve the government's goal of delivering better education outcomes for Indigenous students and closing the gap between Indigenous and nonIndigenous education outcomes. This bill amends the table in subsection 14B(1) of the act to include additional funding for the Sporting Chance Program. This will bring it into line with the Commonwealth's suite of targeted assistance measures and adjust the 2010-12 appropriations agreed as part of the new federal financial relations framework. By extending the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 we provide appropriations to continue our election commitments such as providing funding for additional teachers in the Northern Territory, and, in a bipartisan way, continue good programs introduced by the opposition such as the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program and the Sporting Chance Program. This funding will also allow us to continue to work with Indigenous communities, philanthropic organisations, corporate leaders and national organisations to build the partnerships that are so critical to improving outcomes for Indigenous Australians. By amending the appropriations under the act the Australian to the government can continue working with a range of stakeholders to develop and implement innovative measures to close the gaps in reading, writing and numeracy achievement between Indigenous and nonIndigenous students by 2018. There is no denying the irrefutable fact that Indigenous students are at a severe disadvantage in comparison with their nonIndigenous peers. The statistics demonstrate this unmistakable fact. The government is committed to the goals of halving each of the 2008 gaps in years 3, 5, 7 and 9 reading, writing and numeracy achievement between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students by 2018. The funding appropriated under this bill will go a long way towards helping achieve this goal, which is why this bill is of such importance. The government needs to ensure that Indigenous students are not forgotten. It is our duty and the government's goal to work towards closing the gap that has for a long time created a huge difference between education outcomes and employment opportunities of Indigenous and nonIndigenous students. This bill is a step towards achieving a closing of the gap and creating a higher level of equality, which is why I commend the bill to the House.",175
198,Mr RANDALL,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"I am pleased to rise to speak this evening on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2010 for the main purpose of supporting, and bringing to the House's attention, the tireless efforts of the Clontarf Football Academy, its programs and some of the magnificent outcomes that it achieves. As we have heard, this bill is procedural in nature, bipartisan and to include the additional $10.93 million allocated to the Sporting Chance Program in the 2009-10 budget. The Sporting Chance Program is an initiative of the previous coalition government that was originally announced in the 2006-07 budget. This program is one of the few initiatives actually achieving its desired outcomes of engaging both Indigenous boys and girls in school through involvement with sport. The principle is very simple. Through sport we encourage young children to stay at or to go back to school, in turn improving their employment prospects for the future and their all-round well-being for having done so. We have seen the value in using incentives to keep kids in schools, using sporting activities and high-profile sporting identities as a vehicle to increase the level engagement of Indigenous students to improve their educational outcomes. Unlike the Labor government's inaction on its closing the gap strategy, the Sporting Chance Program delivers real results and I am pleased to say it is one of the few programs that have continued relatively untouched. In last night's big taxing, big spending budget, the money allocated to the Sporting Chance Program through to 2012 was confirmed. In addition to the $22 million committed to the program in December 2008, the Prime Minister's additional commitment of $10 million to Clontarf directly over four years, to expand the football academy, is the money we here are speaking about transferring today, which has essentially already been expended by Clontarf and they need more. At this stage I say that I was very grateful for the kind words spoken by the member for Brand, Gary Gray, in relation to my association with the Clontarf Football Academy and this program generally. I say, on behalf of the member for Brand, that he also needs to be recognised as a new champion in this government, given his tireless work for and on behalf of this program, of the Aboriginal football program at Clontarf. Obviously, we in opposition do not have the same ability to necessarily get the message through to the government of the day. The member for Brand has taken that up and, as a champion of this program in Western Australia, he has seen that those involved have had access to the highest levels of government, which include the Prime Minister. I know that we are not meant to hold up things in the House, but as this is about the Prime Minister, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, I am sure you will not mind! What I am holding up is about the Prime Minister attending Clontarf in Perth last year, announcing the $10 million program over the four-year period, which was very much welcomed. That had a of lot to do with the member for Brand making sure, as I suspect, that every member of the cabinet up to the level of Prime Minister appreciated what was going on at Clontarf. That was well done. It is good to see we are all working to the same ends. In the short period of time that I have left I will talk about Clontarf, but hopefully I will continue on this at a later date. As I said, the Clontarf Football Academy uses sport as a means of ensuring young Indigenous boys get an education. When it was first rolled out, people said, ‘But why is it only for boys? How come there's not much for girls in this program?' Gerard Neesham's view of that, and it might sound a bit unusual to some, is that where the boys are the girls will be. That is true of this program. They provide the sporting program for the boys to play football, because that is the great hook to get them to school, and we know how good Indigenous boys in this country are at Australian Rules football. It seems to come to them so easily. Sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker.",177
199,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,Can I remind everybody that phones are not to ring in the chamber.,179
200,Mr RANDALL,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"The fact is that while providing the program for the boys in this instance they also provide programs for the girls at the same academy on the Clontarf campus. Sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker.",179
201,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,Take it out or you might be following it!,179
202,Mr RANDALL,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"Yes. I have only a couple of seconds to go. I need to compose myself. It has been said that a lot of these boys do not actually proceed to a high level in football. I can tell you that many of the boys that have been in this program have been drafted at the AFL level. This template that Gerard Neesham uses could be transferred to other sports, and I am sure it has been to rugby. It is a very good template which could also be transferred to the sports that girls involved in. As a result, it needs a huge amount of funding. In the time left I would like to give you a bit of history about this. Gerard Neesham went to Graylands Teachers College with me many years ago. He reached a high level in football. He played for the Sydney Swans and, as we know, he was the inaugural coach of the Fremantle Dockers. Once he had finished coaching the Dockers, he had been looking for another direction in life and he went to teach Indigenous kids at Clontarf. At that stage they did not have a football program so he decided that it would be an opportune time to introduce role models in a program, because obviously he himself was a very good role model having been an achiever at such a high level in sport. As he says to me, ‘Don, when you go all throughout the deserts of outback Australia you see that one thing that combines the Indigenous people is their love of Australian Rules football. They can all tell you who played in the grand final for Carlton several years or who won the Brownlow Medal and in what year. They wear their colours and their football beanies.' He saw that as a unifying opportunity in education to get the kids to school. When I return to this speech, hopefully some time later, I will be able to tell members about the retention rates, how the program is spread out, how it is funded, why it is such a necessary program into the future and why all forms of government, both federal and state, and businesses need to continue their support. NA",179
203,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Perth-Darwin National Highway",179
204,Mrs MOYLAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Last Monday, 3 May, I attended a forum hosted are by the East Metropolitan Regional Council to discuss putting the Perth-Darwin Highway and, more particularly, the Swan Valley bypass section of that highway on the Western Australian and national agendas. The forum was organised by the East Metropolitan Regional Council's Director of Regional Services, Rhonda Hardy, and her staff. It was well supported by local and state governments, community action groups, progress associations and road transport organisations. All agreed that construction of the PerthDarwin National Highway bypass is essential to advance individual safety, to safeguard the integrity of the Swan Valley and to ensure the efficient transport of goods. All who attended the forum agree that this project is urgently needed and will require a concerted effort by all parties to get it started. Since my election to federal parliament in 1993, national highways in Pearce have been a major focus of my work, and none is more important than this bypass. I have made numerous representations to government over the years and continue to get the answer that it is 10 to 20 years away. Initially, there some community disagreement about the route it would take, but this argument has long been settled and it is unacceptable for the public to continue to be told that the ject is still years away from commencement-indeed, on the never-never plan. While the state government needs to give this work priority, the federal government provides the funding for highways of national importance, such as the Perth-Darwin National Highway. There was nothing in the budget delivered by the government last night to reassure the people of Pearce that this project will be funded any time soon. In fact, despite the public statements by the government that a third or $3 billion of the $9 billion to be raised annually by the application of a royalty tax on the mining industry for infrastructure, only $700 million appears to have been allocated in the budget papers for infrastructure in 2012-13. This is a mere drop in the ocean when considered on a national scale and is unlikely to fund even one major project such as the Perth-Darwin bypass. I know that there are many competing projects nationally. The funding of the bypass is critical because the southern end of the Great Eastern Highway is currently the major arterial road carrying goods between the eastern states, the airport, the port of Fremantle and the rapidly expanding development of the north-west of Western Australia. This route carries heavy haulage trucks and general traffic through the heart of the beautiful Swan Valley. This is the oldest wine growing region in Western Australia. It has great heritage value and it is a major tourist precinct, just 20 minutes from airport. The current road, although being upgraded, was never meant to carry heavy traffic, including extra long and extra wide haulage vehicles. They are using this stretch of was road in vastly increasing numbers. In fact, 4,744 heavy haulage vehicles now take this route Monday to Friday, and it does not take much imagination to realise that this number prowill increase hugely as the new north-west projects come on stream. These are just the big, heavy haulage trucks-that is, doubleand triple-load and wide-load trucks. That number does not take into account other trucking movements on the road or the vast amount of domestic traffic, including tourist traffic, that travels to the Swan Valley and beyond into the great north-west of Western Australia. In 2011, work will commence on the giant $4 billion Oakajee Port and Rail project, which will in time include a 1,134 hectare industrial estate. The billions of dollars of raw materials, building supplies and equipment necessary to complete this infrastructure will largely be transported on the Great Northern Highway. Further into the future is the Browse Basin LNG project-a giant project-which will provide impetus for rapid growth and development of the north-west, thereby putting further pressure on the highway. Work on this highway and, in particular, the bypass needs to be scheduled and funded without further delay. I call on the federal government to ensure on behalf of the people of Pearce and other road users that, if they are going to tax the mining sector, they stick to their public statement about delivering a third of the $9 billion tax to infrastructure and allocate some of that to the Swan Valley bypass and the Perth-Darwin National Highway immediately. I thank Mayor Charlie Zannino, and his crew in the City of Swan for their advocacy for this bypass and congratulate Rhonda Hardy for her initiative. (Time expired) World Fair Trade Day",179
205,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak about the importance of choosing Fairtrade Certified products for our homes and workplaces around Australia, including in Australian Parliament House. World Fair Trade Day was held on 8 May 2010. It was a fantastic day to raise awareness about how a small choice that we can make can mean big changes for some of the world's most impoverished and vulnerable people. World Fair Trade Day and Fair Trade Fortnight are events which aim to encourage people to make the switch from conventional products to ones bearing the Fairtrade Certified logo, which indicates that agreed labour, environmental, and developmental standards have been met. Organisations like the Fair Trade Association of Australia and New Zealand, along with Oxfam Australia, World Vision, Uniting Care and many others have all been working hard to help people make the connection between poverty, human rights, and fair trade. Many Australians do not realise that some of the big brands of coffee, tea, sugar and chocolate that they see on supermarket shelves use suppliers who pay unfairly low prices to producers. This means that communities are driven into poverty and cannot afford basic amenities and services, including housing, education and health care. Fairtrade Certified standards guarantee a minimum price to coffee growers and add a Fairtrade Premium which goes towards local development and environmental sustainability, ensuring basic health care and education is available to local communities. I was very concerned to hear that forced child labour is widely used on coffee, tea, sugar and cocoa plantations and that children as young as five-years-old are forced to form backbreaking labour for many hours a day under extremely brutal conditions. These children are exposed to hazards on a daily basis, including injuries from heavy machinery, poisoning from pesticides, for which they are given no protective equipment, and beatings and torture from the plantation bosses. Most importantly, they are denied their basic right to education. This compounds and reinforces the poverty cycle. They have no access to health care, no freedom and no rights. Last year the US Department of Labor released a report entitled The Department of Labor's list of goods produced by child labor or forced labor, which details the origins of products made with child labour. The report reveals that there are at least four countries where child labour is used to produce tea, five where it is used to produce cocoa, twelve where it is used to produce coffee and an astonishing fourteen countries where it is used to produce sugar. This data along with the information I received from campaigns run by World Fair Trade Day recently helped convince me to make the switch in my own office. All the coffee, tea, sugar and drinking chocolate in my electorate office is now Fairtrade Certified, and we promote this fact to our constituents and within the office. I am proud to say that as a result my electorate office has now been awarded Fairtrade Workplace status by the Fair Trade Association of Australia and New Zealand. Fairtrade Certified products not only ensure fair prices and environmental sustainability but also prohibit child labour and sanction companies who are found to be breaking the rules. We know that Fairtrade is already working to help address these fundamental issues of human rights and poverty. More than five million people across 58 per- countries are already benefiting from the improvements Fairtrade brings. While I am proud to have a Fairtrade Workplace at my electorate office and am encouraged by this good news, I also feel that there is a fantastic opportunity now for other workplaces to make that switch. As leaders we have a responsibility to set an example for the community with our values, as Australians we have a responsibility to assist those people far less fortunate than us in developing countries and as consumers each and every one of us-at home or at work, whether we are at the supermarket, at our local cafe or buying for our workplacehave the opportunity to help make poverty history just by looking for the blue and green Fairtrade Certified logo before we buy. That is why I am going to write to each member and senator. In the coming weeks they will receive a letter from me asking them to choose Fairtrade certified products for their electorate offices and to support the campaign to make the big switch here in Australian Parliament House. You will recall, Mr Speaker, that to kick off the campaign in February this year I wrote to you and to the President of the Senate asking both of you to make the switch throughout Parliament House. I am eagerly awaiting your responses, which, I am told, are on their way. I note the previous commitments of various members and senators from both sides of the House and encourage all of them to make the change. Gilmore Electorate: Health Care",181
206,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"Last month I participated in the Relay for Life walk, which supports the Cancer Care Council every year as a fundraising event. It was the biggest turnout they had had so far. As you can imagine, this really pleased the organisers, and over $200,000 was raised. Each team had to walk the circuit of the Nowra sports oval for 24 hours, and I am pleased to report that the team of which I was a member was called the Plodding Pollies, made up of local politicians and their staff, families and friends. To remind each participant why they were there, the circuit of the walk was dotted by hundreds of A4-sized epitaphs to family and friends who have succumbed to cancer. Each sheet carried its own personal message written by a surviving friend or family member in its own unique style and with special embellishments. Those who had passed on ranged from the very young to the very old. Cancer does not discriminate. The simplicity of each message saddened me. It affected me that someone so loved was taken away prematurely. It was sad because perhaps the person who had written the message had only been able to stand helplessly by, unable to do anything. Each of us, I am sure, has been touched by cancer in some way. Whether your experience of cancer relates to yourself, a family member, a friend or a colleague, once you have lived it, you do not want to repeat the experience. That is why earlier this year I wrote to the Minister for Health and Ageing on behalf of a constituent of mine who is within reach of help but is simply waiting for a signature on a bit of paper. John Beauchamp of Orient Point is suffering from a form of leukaemia known as myelodysplasia. As a result of this condition he developed a rare blood disorder called PNH, requiring treatment with the drug soliris, which was recommended for inclusion in the federal government's Life Saving Drugs Program over a year ago. On 9 February, I was contacted by the department which informed me that the government is taking the necessary steps to see that this drug is included on the LSDP. May has now arrived and Mr Beauchamp's life is seriously at risk, so I again wrote to get an update on where the matter rests, reiterating the need for urgency. Perhaps simply saying that Mr Beauchamp has a rare form of leukemia called myelodysplasia is not sufficient and I should elaborate. The condition leads to blood clots in the body and kidney failure. It destroys red blood cells, reduces the amount of white blood cells in his body, which are necessary for fighting infection as well as reducing platelet levels. He has been getting blood transfusions twice a week and cannot work. Slowly but surely his quality of life is being diminished on so many levels. He has had to give up work because he is chronically tired and is now facing the prospect of selling his home to pay for very expensive medical treatment. Soliris can help Mr Beauchamp, but at the moment it is out of his reach. Soliris was once available for free by the manufacturer Alexion to a number of patients, and, although this had stopped by the time Mr Beauchamp was diagnosed, I commend Alexion on its charity and compassion. The minister only needs to sign off on the recommendations from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, which said that it should be included in the program. Mr Beauchamp is physically very weakened. An attack of the flu could well mean a death sentence for him. I really do not know what is holding up the decision, but it would seem that if the drug were capable of being supplied by the company free of charge in a limited distribution then possibly the clinical criteria have already been satisfied. Mr Beauchamp himself has discussed this with fellow sufferers who have all reported remarkable results. They have gone from two transfusions every week to one in eight months. Some have already returned to work and are making plans for a new future. No wonder John is waiting anxiously at the minister's pleasure for his lifeline. The local newspaper is also very supportive, and I thank Glenn Ellard who wrote the piece that I sent to the minister with my latest letter. I have repeated some of Glenn's comments in this statement in the hope that they will reinforce the story in the mind of the minister. Next year, when I again go into the Relay for Life, a 24-hour relay, I do not want to be reading John's epitaph on one of the hundreds of pieces of A4 lining the Nowra Showground oval. John's case is symbolic of all those others throughout Australia waiting for the minister to grant them reprieve from their death sentence. I appeal to the minister to move with the utmost urgency to approve this drug for John Beauchamp and others like him before it is too late. Lowe Electorate: Sydney Airport",182
207,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I speak again about aircraft noise and the aviation white paper, Flight path to the future, released in December last year by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the Hon. Anthony Albanese. Mr Speaker, as you know, I have raised on many occasions the concerns of my constituents about the impact of aircraft noise in Sydney's inner west. The constituents of Lowe suffered for many years under the Howard government's indifference to the effects of the aviation industry and activity at Sydney Airport. As I have mentioned previously in this House, and as you know, the Howard government sold Sydney Airport without any community consultation or real concern to properly and fairly address aircraft noise. Further, the Howard government concealed during the last federal election campaign its negotiations with Sydney Airport to close the east-west runway for upgrades. The people I represent were affected by the safety upgrade of the runway and I note that several constituents contacted me to convey their displeasure about the level of noise and the quency of flights over their homes during the period of the closure. Once elected, the Rudd government moved to immediately impose 22 stringent conditions on the project to minimise the impact on our communities. I am pleased to note that the east-west runway is now fully operational following the completion of the Runway End Safety Area project. All three runways are now compliant with international safety standards and Airservices Australia must now ensure fair noise sharing. Only yesterday I spoke with a constituent who lives in Drummoyne in my electorate who is very concerned about very noisy aircraft flying over her home up to 20 minutes before the expiration of the morning curfew. She expressed to me her concerns that the curfew was at risk. However, I was able to reassure her that the government has reaffirmed its commitment to maintain the existing curfew and the 80 movements per hour cap on flights. In fact, in May 2009, Jetstar was fined $148,500 for breaching the curfew at Sydney Airport for a flight that departed 11.30 pm after its application for curfew pensation was refused. Jetstar was the first Australian airline to be prosecuted and fined for breaching the curfew-and so it should have been. It is imperative that residents fected by aircraft noise are provided respite through the curfew. Noncompliance with the curfew by airlines, unless under exceptional circumstances, is unacceptable and the government remains committed to maintaining the existing curfew for the benefit of all communities. Further to the commitment to maintain the curfew and cap on flights, our government announced several measures to improve community consultation and planning in the aviation white paper. Flight path to the future is Australia's first national aviation policy fre- white paper and outlines the long-term framework for all aspects of aviation in Australia, including economic development, safety and security, future airport planning and sustainability. I applaud the minister for his vision and for undertaking the extensive consultation to develop the white paper. The white paper makes clear commitments to the millions of people using the airports and, very importantly, to the communities affected by aviation activity. Measures include establishing an aircraft noise ombudsman to improve the dissemination of information to affected communities and conduct an independent review of noise complaints handling. I note that my local community campaigned for an aircraft ombudsman and collected hundreds of signatures. I am extremely pleased that the minister is listening and responding to the calls of our constituents, and I certainly know he understands the issue because his electorate, like mine, is affected severely. Further, the minister will phase out older and noisier aircraft flying over residential at areas. In addition, the minister has outlined dis- our government's commitment to find a site for a second Sydney Airport to meet additional aviation capacity. The minister has established a planning task force with the af- New South Wales government to identify strategies and locations for the second airport. I am heartened by available Airservices Australia reports that show a very gradual decline in aircraft noise over my electorate for the year to date. This is not to say that the current levels are acceptable-they are not acceptable. Indeed, I will be monitoring closely the reports of Airservices Australia, the reasons for any breaches of the curfew as well as the long-term operating plan targets for each month, to ensure we minimise the impact of aircraft noise on affected residents in my electorate of Lowe. Mr Speaker, as you know, my constituents have suffered enough. Boothby Electorate: Bushfires",183
208,Dr SOUTHCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to speak about one of the top priorities for real action in the electorate of Boothby. Over the last 13 years, residents of Belair in the electorate of Boothby have faced two major bushfires, posing a real threat to lives and homes. Woody weeds, in particular feral olives, which are widespread in the Mitcham Hills, have been identified as a major fire hazard, with olives being highly flammable. As a key bushfire prevention strategy, the local country fire service and Mitcham Council are committed to olive tree eradication. They are to be commended for their efforts in reducing fuel loads through the clearing of olives, with Mitcham Council investing approximately $300,000 per annum to this cause. Last week, the Leader of the Opposition and I met with the Mayor of Mitcham, Ivan Brooks, the local country fire service and local residents at a site in Belair which was partially cleared of olive trees. We heard and saw first hand the difficulties facing the local community, firefighters and council workers. We observed the work involved in removing an olive tree. The Mediterranean climate, with its mild winter temperatures and hot summers, of the Mitcham Hills makes the area prone to olive infestation. Controlling and minimising the spread of these weeds is a difficult task and it is too big a job for the local council and the local community to manage. As a result direct action is required. What is required is more funding and support if we are to have any hope of improving the situation for the local community and preserving the natural environment for our children in the future. There is a twofold priority here: revegetation of bushland but also reduction of the fire risk. Intensive labour is required if we are to make an impact on areas of major environmental degradation and ensure the preservation of wilderness areas. Earlier this year, in January, the Leader of the Opposition announced that, if a coalition government were elected, a strong environmental workforce would be established-a standing green army. This green army would comprise 15,000 members. It would be available on an ongoing basis and supplemented by volunteers to tackle the local and regional environmental priorities that most urgently need a sustained application of labour. In my electorate, the council, working with about six workers, has made a real impact in Brown Hill Creek. They have made an impact starting from the top of the hill's face and working down in restoring bushland to its original state and reducing these very hardy olives. But there is much more that needs to be done, and a green army of 15,000 members spread across 150 electorates would mean 100 people in each electorate being available to work on local environmental projects. So if a Liberal-National Party government is elected then I will be pushing hard to see that one of the first weed eradication projects for the green army will be in the bushland of the Mitcham Hills. The Mitcham council is making a good fist of this, but they need reinforcements, and that is where I see the green army coming in. Superannuation  We had an indication this week from the Leader of the Opposition, ‘the member for Manly', the Hon. Tony Abbott, that he was going to betray his Jesuit roots when he indicated that he was going to block our attempts to change the superannuation guarantee increase from nine per cent to 12 per cent. In a religious upbringing that talked about fairness for all and giving people opportunities, this would be one of the greatest sins that the ‘member for Manly' could commit, if he were in fact to cut off our chances to increase the SGC. As a member of the Howard government, Mr Abbott neglected infrastructure for nearly 12 years. He has shown time and time again that he does not take economics seriously and, in that, I could perhaps understand why he fundamentally does not get it about superannuation and how important it is for ordinary Australians. Not those people on a defined benefit scheme or a pension scheme like members elected to the federal parliament before 2004Mr Coulton interjecting from the member for Parkes. It is not that sort of thing, but for ordinary Australians superannuation is incredibly important. I am talking about ordinary Australians, not those on federal MPs wages. I did note that the ‘member for Manly' complained about that. When the world was tightening its belt, he said that we too should tighten our belts. It would be a bit hypocritical for politicians to talk about belt tightening if we did not actually do something ourselves. Mr Abbott was saying: ‘Oh no, we shouldn't do that. MPs are just like ordinary Australians.' The reality is that our wages are much higher than most Australians. Superannuation is incredibly important. I know the battles that went on way back in the nineties with the Hawke government and with Paul Keating as Treasurer. When we brought in this superannuation there was the trade-off for the three per cent wage increase. But since then the superannuation industry has taken off and the latest figures I have, from June 2007, show that Australia's superannuation assets back in June 2007 were $1,153.3 billion-that is, about $1 trillion or 119 per cent of the GDP as it was back in June 2007. Obviously it would have increased since then. The Labor government gets superannuation. We understand superannuation. We understand how important it is. So, for the coalition to stand against this government's reforms to increase the superannuation guarantee and the incentives for lower income earners and those nearing retirement age would be reprehensible. Maybe those opposite just do not get it? Maybe they just do not understand compulsory superannuation? Because it would be Australians on lower incomes who would miss out, the people who have been given a great opportunity to save and invest for their own retirement. So that means the coalition is now the greatest risk to Australia's national superannuation savings. I will give you a couple of examples. If you are an 18-year-old-I know that is not that long ago for you, Mr SPEAKER - who entered the workforce today on average earnings, you would be $200,000 worse off when you retired. So, young people, the people voting for the first time at the next election, cannot risk their future savings on the coalition-on the Leader of the Opposition. Or, if you are an employee aged 30 today-which is closer to the age of the member for Rankin-on the average full-time weekly earnings, you would retire with $108,000 less in superannuation. If you are a female aged 30 today on average weekly earnings with an interrupted work pattern, you would retire with nearly $80,000 less in your superannuation kit. Young families cannot afford to risk their future savings on the coalition. If the coalition blocks this reform package, it will mean that 3.5 million Australians on lower incomes will continue to receive little or no concession on their compulsory superannuation contributions. If they take this reckless approach and block these reforms, it will mean 8.4 million Australians will not receive an increase in their retirement incomes. The 275,000 individuals who would benefit from a higher concessional contributions cap will not be able to make additional savings for their retirement when they are most able. And the 33,000 employees aged 70 to 74 will continue to miss out on superannuation guarantee contributions while they are working. I will not say who in the House would be closer to those ages, Mr Speaker. (Time expired) Question agreed to.

If you look at the history susceptible to the variations of climate-temperature, Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders were able they were fisherpeople, hunter-gatherers or from 1788 on, they came with European sensibilities sonably advanced compared to the rest of Europe, crops at the wrong time.

I will move this amendment. I will read it, people in the Second World War but people over 70. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a porting the Bill, the House is of the opinion that amended so that the full repatriation benefit, including tralian veterans who are aged 70 years or over, irrespective ger from hostile forces of the enemy as the current It is essentially to recognise those people who the orders of their superiors and to go wherever used a moment ago, of my father being in the Australian forces in New Guinea, for instance, absolutely useless in defending Australia. ceive qualifying service-and receive health would have defended the nation they represented. ously, the powers that be at the time would troops they needed to leave in Australia just come to the Australian continent.

Three particular issues are raised indexation of military superannuation and an issue certain counterterrorism special operations decision to remove the remaining level of erosion nor to adjust them in line with the increase I want to go through some of those issues, Paterson. On the military superannuation issue gestion appears to be that the government has when it was in opposition. At that time-and bilities in this area of military superannuation made. One was a commitment to have a review Matthews report. There is no doubt that many with the results of that report, but the commitment view and the government accepted the review's vice community to be happy with that-far honoured. The second one related to the Podger review view was commissioned by the previous government ment in July 2007.

So who were very concerned about this issue, were opposition we committed to publicly release what recommendations were included in that cember 2007 and we committed to a consultation military community about the recommendations then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, the first few months of 2008. The very clear response to that review-and ex-service organisations just several weeks recommendations included in the Podger slowly around the question of this and they for Paterson wants me to do is to implement want and does not want, I wish he would come to understand and I want the ex-service community and their views around the Podger review, the should happen with respect to that review. On the issue of reclassification of the service operations undertaken by the SAS personnel, facts and the background. This came out of as' entitlements undertaken by the previous significant number of recommendations, many Howard government. But you know what? There cepted. One of the recommendations that were reclassify the service of the certain counterterrorism So the member for Paterson has raised a criticism ernment, of which he was a member-and he is time. I looked-actually accepted the recommendation he raised in the chamber today. The third issue relates to the question of veterans' value of those pensions. This was subject to ex-service community and in the parliament in ing on from a decision taken by the then budget, to put forward a proposal to index disability system to the male total average weekly earnings, posal and extended that proposal in some areas National RSL Congress. Legislation then went bipartisan support. That system has been in place payments have maintained their value with reference There is no question about that. Since that time we have had the Harmer payments and led, as the chamber knows, to significant income support payments-many of which are nity. In fact, the Harmer review resulted in the Australian community, the veteran community, unable to find out what the report said. In that report in order for a debate to ensue about report. We released that report publicly in Deprocess with the broader ex-service and included in that report. My colleague the Warren Snowdon, conducted that review in it was reiterated to me again by a number of ago-was that they were deeply unhappy with the review and they wanted government to go very did not want it implemented. If what the member a report that the ex-service community did not out and say that very clearly.

I am very concerned that this set of exemptions for work up until their children turn 19. That the workforce-from when their children are for Workforce Participation in the former government, enabled single parents to remain on parenting rather than 16. At that time, single parents skill, to be taught literacy or numeracy or to could rejoin the workforce when their children many single parents-both men and women, tunity and the increased resources we put into When you have been out of the workforce for look upon you with much enthusiasm, particularly skills are downgraded to just ‘housework' or ness to say that you cannot do up to 15 hours up to 19 years of age.

Let me now move on to foster carers. I am that further exemptions should be extended to allowance while they provide emergency or respite concerned, foster carers are the unsung heroes have so many at-risk children who cannot care. But when the authorities in those different a rapidly diminishing number of individuals. carer numbers have collapsed by over 50 per lapsing? It is because foster carers are not lated to foster caring is not adequate. When foster for a child for much longer than just a few weeks, care are best served by a longer placement, they dren churn through their care, knowing they and distress and perhaps will be permanently them long-term, permanent care and love. This bill refers to extending exemptions for period of time afterwards to support their availability their care. I am saying that this is not the way right now. Foster carers need a whole new set by state. In fact, I would very strongly urge significantly at-risk children and the care options simply have an extension of the system and away. We are also told that ‘parents will be able work-or a combination of these activities-towards requirements' in order to continue to receive minister under the Howard government, we purpose this describes. We found that too often, working at the tuck shop,' or ‘I've been helping on the part of the not-for-profit organisation work or level of commitment to that volunteering work. the grandmother is concerned for the safety of the grandmother some financial support for carthe voluntary stepping forward of the daughter then we are going to continue to see the and struggling in poverty to raise their grandparenting payments while their daughter, or is often spent on sustaining a drug or alcohol help to support the children. This is a very serithat the government thinks that by taklegislation the job is done. No, it does not advery concerned that we could still be imagining foster carers to receive, for example, Newstart foster care for children. As far as I am of all of our states and territories where we remain with their own families and need foster states look for foster carers they find they are In the state of Victoria, for example, the foster cent. Why are those foster carer numbers colbeing adequately remunerated. The legislation recarers ask, for example, to remain as carers knowing the interests of the child in their are not listened to. So foster carers see chilwill then suffer serious emotional disadvantage affected by the failure of our system to give carers while they are providing care and for a for subsequent placement of children into handle the crisis in foster care in our country of understandings and changed regulations state that we have a national response to the needs of for them. It concerns me that in this bill we the hope that the problem will perhaps then go to count their study, voluntary work, part-time meeting their part-time participation the various welfare payments.

That shows that there are things that can ment in this area.
