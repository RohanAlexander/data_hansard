8,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COMMONWEALTH WIRE,"I ask the Minister for Trade and Oustoms whether he has noticed in the press that the New Soutb Wales Minister for Lands has stated that the conditions under which money is to be advanced by the Commonwealth for the purchase of wire netting for the state of New South Wales have been finalized. . If so, will the Minister make a public statement informing persons in New South Wales desiring wire netting that the control of its distribution is in the hands of the state authorities, whom they should apply?  practically been finalized, and persons in New South Wales requiring Commonwealth wire netting will be able to apply for it under the regulations to the Minister for Lands.

Have applications for sheep and dingo netting been refused on the ground that only rabbit-proof netting can be distributed?  honourable member's questions are as f o l low :1. There is no conflict. 2. The position is that the regulations under the Advances to Settlers Act require that each applicant undertakes to use the wire netting supplied to him in the erection of rabbit-proof or dog-proof fences, as approved by the state Minister or person authorized in writin g by the state Minister. All applications must be referred to the Minister for Trade and Customs, with a recommendation by the state. Minister.

16,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH WIRE,"It is not considered that laymen would have the requisite knowledge to deal with the matters to be inquired into.

Is any amount being made available to other states; if so, to which states?",14
18,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH WIRE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. A sum, not to exceed £400 per month, is made available to the central executive of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia through the Eepatriation Commission to assist the League in finding employment for ex-soldiers in all states. The approval provides for the payment of this amount monthly until August, 1924, and the reduction at the rate of £50 per month thereafter until the end of December, 1924. The amount allocated to New South Wales by the central executive of the League averages about £17 10s. per week.

U p o n w h i o h Mr MAHONY h a d moved by That after the word "" That "" the following be inserted :- "" any sum spent in naval should be expended in Australia, relieving the distress caused by unemploytries."" and helping to develop Australian indus",16
28,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Capricornia) [3.21] - I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment. The honourable member for (Mr Mahony) is deserving of the sincere congratulations of all true Australians upon the patriotic stand he took to have the proposed cruisers built in Australia. The keynote of the honourable the member's speech was "" Australia, a nation,"" and his remarks were eloquent elucidatory, and gave to honourable members a lot of information they did not previously possess. It was clear that he adhad made a careful study of his subject, shorn and I cannot understand why there should be any objection by honourable members to the policy he so ably outlined. I hope that before a vote is taken honourable of members will allow their better judgment to prevail, and that the majority of them, at any rate, will prove themselves worthy ef the honourable position they occupy in this Parliament. By adopting the policy proposed by the honourable member for Dalley, not only unemployed artisans in New South Wales, but the people of Australia generally, will benefit, because an amount of between £5,500,000 and £5,750,000 will be circulated mainly in our own country. The primary producers, who today are in a very precarious position because of the lack of adequate markets for their products, would obtain a large share of such expenditure. Every butter producer would benefit, and we know that the dairying industry is in need of assistance. The 7,000 unemployed men in New South Wales alone are reduced almost t'o poverty, and their purchasing power is negligible; but if artisans and labourers were given employment upon the construction of these cruisers they would be much better able than they are today to buy the products of the man upon the land. I regret that it is necessary to provide for the defence of Australia at all. Already we are expending over £4,000,000 on defence, which* experts say is so inadequate that it would not ensure Australia's safety for 24 hours. Wa r is barbaric and repugnant to every person who believes in peace. I agree with E . P. Hearne, when he says in his book Aerial WarfareWar is a barbarous method of settling differences. . . . Apart from the menace caused by ever-growing armaments, in which the rich nations literally force their poorer rivals into bankruptcy by necessitating ever-growing military and naval expenditure, there arc internal causes in every commercial nation which predispose to war. . . . Insensate and unscrupulous business competition; stock market gambling; political, financial, and civic corruption, the rapid acquisition of wealth by vice "" sweating,"" speculation, fraud, gambling, and extravagant follies, have created many new conditions and new difficulties, the only tive for which is good trade and fair dealing, and a better understanding between nations. Those are fine sentiments. What more effective machinery could we have for bringing about a better understanding between the nations of the world and settling international disputes than the league of Nations, provided the encouragement it deserves from all nations? The Labour party strongly in the League of Nations, and hopes that before long it will be the recognized arbitrator in international is a vexed question. affairs, thus obviating resort to the barbaric methods of warfare, with all their Sfr. Forde. attendant evils and consequent distress. Honourable members opposite have said a great deal about the f u t i l i ty of past conferences for the limitation of armaments, and have expressed themselves distrustf u l of the outcome of the conference proposed to be convened by the President of the United States of America, and the Labour Prime Minister of Great Britain , Mr Bamsay MACDonald. But I should like to remind them of what the honourable member for No r t h Sydney (Mr W . M . Hughes), when Prime Minister, saidThe Washington Conference has achieved great things. Its decisions guarantee peace in the Pacific as far as any effort of man can guarantee it. Senator Pearce, who represented Australia at the Washington Conference, expressed a similar opinion. But today, honourable members opposite, without giving the League of Nations an opportunity to reconsider international problems at its forthcoming meeting, are supporting the immediate expenditure on armaments of over £5,000,000 of the people's money on cruisers which in two years may have to be scrapped, as the result of a decision made at one of the forthcoming conferences. Our acting Leader (Mr Anstey) proposed by an earlier amendment to defer the consideration of this expenditure u n t i l after the forthcoming session of the League of Nations. Because the Labour party does not advocate extravagant expenditure upon defence our critics say that we are opposed to any system of defence for Australia. That is an erroneous idea, as honourable members opposite will admit if they will consider the question impartially. It was the Labour party that established the nucleus of the present defence scheme, and our present Leader pallia- (Mr Charlton) has frequently stated Labour's defence policy. He said in July, 1923The Labour party's policy is to promote world peace, and, consistently with Australia's goodwill to her kindred overseas, _ declares its readiness to take full responsibility for Australian defence. it gets We differ with our opponents merely as to the methods to be adopted believes what the annual expenditure should be, and upon what forms of defence it should be incurred. That, of course, Naturally,- we desire to bring about peace and total disarmament, if that be possible. But if other nations will not agree to that, and arm themselves, Australia will need some form of defence. In arriving at a decision as to the for m of defence best suited to Australia, various things will have lo be taken into consideration, such as the resources of the country, and the amount of money we are prepared to spend on defence. As the honourable member for Calare (Sir Neville Howse) aaid, if we were to undertake to provide for the adequate defence of Australia, it would mean an expenditure of approximately £50,000,000 per annum for the next ten years. That is quite beyond our capacity to pay, and we should be unwise to attempt it . We should develop those arms of defence that are most capable of protecting us against invasion. I do not think there is any chance of this country being invaded, but the future is in the lap of the gods. If the forthcoming conference should prove abortive, we must create some form of defence, but in any case, I should be opposed to the expenditure of many millions of pounds on implements of war. It would be better, as a first arm of defence, to develop the air force. We could create a force that, in times of peace, could carry mails and passengers to the outposts of this continent, and in the event of war could be converted for purposes of defence. An air force would have to work in conjunction with other arms of defence. I believe that the Labour party, when it forms a government, as I expect it will very shortly, will develop the air force as a means of defence, and probably make it the first arm, and will provide submarines and fortifications. Fortifications are a most effective means of defence. A Labour Government would, I believe, also provide mines, submarines, adequate surfacewater craft, and convertible factories that could be used for the manufacture of small arms and the building of aeroplanes in times of war, and of farming implements in times of peace. During nine months of every year these factories could be employed in making farming implements that could be sold at cost price. Even if the factories made a loss in supplying the farming community with cheap agricultural implements, it would be better, on the whole, than spending £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 on defence a year as a dead loss, as we do at present. The factories could also undertake the manufacture of motor bicycles and motor cars, and it would be reasonable to supply the motor bicycles at reduced prices to picked young men and to men on the land on condition that they cared for them, and attained a certain degree of proficiency in the use of them. These motor cyclist3 could be used in war time as the nucleus of a larger force. Cars and motor lorries could be called into use for transport purposes. W it h the up-to-date machinery that would be installed in the factories, practically all the - agricultural machinery required by the farming community could be manufactured. I believe, also, that the Labour party, if in power, would employ science and industry in the standardization of rolling-stock, motor cars, and maohinery, and would spend a great deal more money than is now spent on making and maintaining roads. In time of war it is necessary to have both roads and railways, so that large numbers of troops can be transported with expedition. I regret that the Government does not propose to assist Australian industries by having the cruisers built in this country. If we desire cheapness as a first consideration, why not go to China, Japan, or other cheap labour countries. I say the Government's policy is wrong. The first of these cruisers will cost nearly £3,000,000, and the building of it in this country would create a large amount of employment, and the money spent would be circulated among our own people. Has the Prime Minister gone back on the statement he made when speaking to the captains of industry at a meeting' of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce last year ? He then saidTlie development of our industries, .trade, and commerce is of more importance to the defence of Australia than are the armies of Australia.",16
29,Mr BRENNAN,NAVAL AND MILITARY,That is what I built my hopes on.,18
30,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) has been a consistent advocate of that policy. He does not often agree with the Prime Minister on many things, for, while he has been consistent, the Prime Minister has not acted up to the sentiments he has expressed. Those sentiments won for him the plaudits of the Sydney commercial magnates that were seated round the festive board on that very auspicious occasion. ""Why has the Prime Minister jettisoned that policy? What sinister influence has determined the change? If we are to have the cruisers they should by .all means be built in Australia. It has been said that honourable members on this side are opposing the building of the cruisers only because they are opposed to the Government, but the opinions expressed by honourable members on this side are shared by the great majority of the people. Many Nationalist newspapers in Australia are denouncing the Government for its policy of going cap in hand to England, or any other country, to build cruisers that must, if we are to become a great manufacturing nation, be built in Australia. On the 29th July, 1924, the Melbourne Age rightly pointed outAs might have been expected, Free Traders of the Ministerial Corner, who have little thought of the establishment of basic Australian industries, or of making the Commonwealth more self-dependent in defence, are extolling the advantages of cheap importationsa doctrine which, when applied to their own products, tliey"" resolutely fight. If this try is ever to develop the capacity to build its own ships, it must make a beginning, and the beginning cannot be made too soon. Proficiency in this, as in any otlier work can be gained only by experience. If the building of the cruisers on our own coast entail a greater outlay than would be necessary in the case of importation, the money will be spent amongst our own workers, producers, and business men. In publishing that statement the Age Dockyard this week.. voiced the opinion of thousands of people in Victoria and other portions of Ausfor tralia, who are not supporters of the Labour party. If this question were to a referendum of the people the verdict would be strongly in favour of building subject is highly commendable. the cruisers in Australia ",18
31,Mr MAHONY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,Le t us have a remated ferendum.,19
32,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"We should be prepared to accept the verdict of the people. should like to point out to the Prime M i ister that when America was struggling to estabhsh the iron and steel industry, not the late Mr W . E . Gladstone likened its efforts to "" a fantastic scheme growing pineapples in English houses."" He said that it was useless America to attempt to build up iron and steel works. America, however, was daunted. She had patriotic men at the helm who said, "" We must go on."" They established iron and steel works, and America today can compare favourably with any other part of the world in the manufacture of iron and steel. Germany at one time, could not build the ships she needed; she had to go to other countries for them. She then kept thousands cf men employed in England building war ships and merchant vessels for her. Later, she learned a lesson which, as the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) has said, Australia should copy. She sent artisans to England to be trained in ""shipbuilding. They returned as experts, and were set to work, with the result that, today, Germany can supply all her own requirements. The same thing happened in J apan. For many years that country had to purchase all her ships from England. Japan today has her own shipbuilding yards and her own trained men, and if Australia is lo become a self-reliant nation, she must proceed on similar lines. If we always depend on other nations for our ships, we shall never be able to employ thousands of our own tradesmen, who would, in turn, assist in providing a counremunerative living for thousands of p r i mary producers. The proposal of the Government to send an order for a cruiser to England is most reprehensible in view of the fact that there are thousands of unemployed in Australia, and 7,000 in New South Wales alone.",19
33,Mr MAHONY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,Hundred s of men are to be discharged from the Cockatoo Island,19
34,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"The honourable memberDalley (Mr Mahony) has been appropriately styled "" the honourable member put for Cockatoo Island,"" and the zeal in making himself conversant with this The Minister for Defence stated that the esticost of building a cruiser in England was £1,900,000, but that amount was based on an Admiralty estimate, and I does not represent the sum that would n - have to be paid to an English shipbuilder. The honourable member for Dalley did rely on Australian experts, or English Admiralt y officers, but decided for to dispatch a cablegram to England, hotand obtain for himself the opinion of for one of the leading shipbuilders thereThe advice he received was that the cost unwould be £2,250,000 in England, and that the time taken to construct the vessel would be three and a-half years, and not two and a half years, as stated by the Minister. I notice that the Minister obtained an estimate from the Commonwealth Shipping Board. Mr Farquhar, who was manager of Walker's Limited, Maryborough, Queensland, is one of the members of that board, and I regard him us one of Australia's greatest shipbuilding experts.",19
35,Mr MAHONY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,There is not a doubt about that.,20
36,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"The board said the cost would be practically £2,898,000. The Government, not satisfied with this, had to go to the Naval Board for an estimate, and, whilst members of the Navy Board may be skilled in naval warfare, I am afraid they do not know much about shipbuilding.",20
37,Mr FENTON,NAVAL AND MILITARY,Mr Farquhar has built ships for Walker's Limited at Maryborough.,20
38,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Yes ; he is on the Shipping Board. He built the Echuca and the Echunga, which are vessels of 6,108 tons.",20
39,Mr MAHONY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,Prio r to that he was in charge of the construction of the biggest ships in the British yards.,20
40,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Yes , and therefore his estimate should be more reliable than that of the Naval Board. Although RearAdmiral Hall-Thompson, and Captain H. P. Cayley, the first and second members of the Naval Board, have a wide knowledge of naval matters, and Mr. Abererombie, the financial and civil member, may know something about finance, these gentlemen are not skilled in estimating the cost of shipbuilding. Of course, it is impossible, owing to the present high standard of living in Australia, to manufacture vessels as cheaply here as they can be built in a cheap-labour country. In England today a shipwright is paid only £3 19s. 6d. per week, while in Australia the wage is £6 8s., so that two men can be employed in England for very little more than it costs to employ one man in Australia. But Australia is very jealous of the standard of living it has attained for its workers, and it is not pared to lower that standard. We must . maintain for our own workmen the measure of protection that they now enjoy if they are to remain prosperous. The great majority of the people of this country be- lieve in protection. If a vote were taken - on the question, 85 per cent, of the electors would, no doubt, favour that policy, and honourable members are pledged to it. The difference between the English estimate and the Aus- tralian figures is, approximately, £900,000. If the ships were constructed in Australia, a big percentage of that sum would be returned to the Government by way of income tax. The workers in shipbuilding yards, such as shipwrights, plumbers, and blacksmiths, would not be immune from income tax, and the work would result in increasing the income of traders, primary producers, and others, so that of that £900,000 the Government would get back in income tax about £500,000.",20
41,Mr WEST,NAVAL AND MILITARY,There would be additional revenue to the Commonwealth through the Customs.,20
42,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Quite so. The Government gives manufacturers protection to the extent of 45 per cent, on reapers and binders. If the Labour party's policy to utilize munition factories in peace time for the manufacture of farming implements, which could be sold at cost price, were put into operation, a great measure of relief would be provided. If the 45 per cent, protection now given to the Australian manufacturers of reapers and binders were granted to t'he Cockatoo Island Shipbuilding Yard, the cost of building a cruiser in England would be increased from £1,900,000 to £2,755,000, accepting the English estimate. Thus the English cost would be brought within £100,000 of the cost of building a cruiser in Sydney. Of the total cost the sum of £1,500,000 would be distributed in wages, and the Government would reap £500,000 by way of income tax, so that the difference of £100,000 would be wiped out, and tfhere would be a saving of £400,000 by building the cruisers in Australia. . Mr WATKINS - The honourable member has not made any allowance for the cost of commissioning a cruiser, and bringing it to Australia.",20
43,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"There would also be the cost of sending Australian officers to pre- Great Britain. Their fares would have to be paid, and no doubt the Government would make them generous allowances.",20
44,Mr WATKINS,NAVAL AND MILITARY,There would also be the cost of the coal and oil required for bringing the vessels to Australia.,20
45,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Yes . That would probably add another £50,000 to the English cost.",20
46,Mr MAHONY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"You could easily add an extra £100,000.",21
47,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"That is quite feasible. It would probably mean a saving of £500,000 to build the Australia. We have already had illustrations of the capacity of Australian shipbuilding yards to tur n out a good article. Already 21 cargo vessels have been built in this country-fou r at Cockatoo Island, six at Williamstown, six at Walsh Island, three at Adelaide, and two at Maryborough. The Minister for Defence will not dispute the fact that the workmanship of Australian shipbuilding yards is equal to that in any other part of the world. In fact, the Minister stated, in speaking on this measure, that' the workmanship put into the cruiser Adelaide compared favourably with that in any ship of that class in the British navy, and that we had nothing to fear regarding the quality of the materials, or the acouracy of the Australian workmanship. The Minister then went on to say that the proposed cruisers would be required in very much less time than it would take Cockatoo Island to build them-. He used that statement as au excuse why the work should be carried out in England; but the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) has produced proof that the two cruisers can be constructed at Cockatoo Island within four years. Surely there is no undue urgency for thei? construction ? The advice from England, obtained by the honourable member for Dalley, is that it will take three and a half years to construct one cruiser there. The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) has stated that it will take two years to build the vessel overseas, and the honourable member for Dalley guarantees that a cruiser can be built at Cockatoo Island in two and a half years.",21
48,Mr LISTEB,NAVAL AND MILITARY,Who is his authority?,21
49,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,I do not intend to disThat close the names of those gentlemen whom the honourable member for Dalley has consays sulted.,21
50,Mr LISTEB,NAVAL AND MILITARY,Are those gentlemen competent to make an estimate ?,21
51,Mr MAHONY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,That estimate given to the Prime Minister by the Shipping Board.,21
52,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"It must be considered liaA asbattleship as good authority, as Mr Farquhar, a can be destroyed by a single torpedo-carrying member of that board, is the most comaeroplane. petent shipbuilding expert in Australia.",21
53,Mr MAHONY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,And his opinion is supported by Sir William Clarkson.,21
54,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Anothe r gentleman of high repute. It is extremely unlikely vessels in that Australia will be invaded by an enemy within four, five, or even ten years. - We were assured by one honourable member opposite that it would take 20 years for Japan to recover from the earthquake. Personally, I do not believe that that nation will ever attack Austraha; but' she is is frequently referred to as a likely enemy. There is no reason why the tw.o cruisers should not be constructed in Australia, even if it takes six months or a year longer to complete them here. Honourable members opposite state that the Labour party is opposed to any defence scheme for Australia, but I do not think that; their statement will be accepted by the people. We advocate the building up of the most economical and effective arms of defence, and in that we are supported by the opinions of very high naval and military experts. Admira l Lord Fisher, writing in the Times after the armistice, said It is as clear as daylight that the future of war on the sea absolutely precludes the use of any war vessel except submarines; therefore, why keep any of the present lot? . . . All we want is the present naval side of the Air Force, costing a few millions, yet the Army estimates are over £400,000,000 a year. It cannot be said that Lord Fisher was associated with the Labour party of Australia. Sir Q. G. Ashton, of the General Staff of the Royal Marine Artillery , in his work, Amphibious Wars, saidPorts have a great advantage over ships. - . . Ships are built to fight each other and not to fight forts. The ordnance mounted inland is on a steady platform, with all sorts of appliances, giving the exact range automatically, and increasing the accuracy of fire. All these appliances cannot be adapted to ships. authority does not favour the building of cruisers for defence purposes, but that the establishment of forts is much more important. There appeared in the Melbourne Sun yesterday a state waa member of the House of Commons, and a former air squadron commander. He saids is of as much use to Austraa sick headache. Any battleship afloat ; Two thousand of those machines could put a fleet out of action. Flying low, squadrons of air machines could rout an attempted landing of troops or an attack by sea on any part of the coast. A large naval air force of more than 1,000 machines, and well-equipped stations about 50 miles apart around the Australian coast, would be our best means of defence. Australia is prepared to contemplate the expenditure involved in four warships. If that money was devoted to the building up of an efficient air force, Australia need never fear invasion. Mobility is an essential of defence. A great army or navy cannot move quickly to the defence of Australia. With an air force you have a mobility of up to 140 miles an hour with every unit. That gentlemau spent a great many years studying naval and military questions, and his opinion is well worthy of consideration. The Labour party has consistently advocated the building up of the air arm of defence, to be used in times of peace for linking up the outPosts of Australia. The use of aircraft as a means of defence is as yet in its in fancy, but our experience of its efficiency during the war was sufficient to indicate to us what a power it would be in future wars. Personally, I trust that there will be no future wars. W it h regard to air defence, it is fitting to remember that an Australian, Laurence Hargraves, of Sydney, first discovered the means of making flight possible, and it would be very appropriate if the. A i r Porce was made the first arm of Australian defence.",21
55,Mr WEST,NAVAL AND MILITARY,The efforts of Laurence Hargraves were ridiculed.,22
56,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"That is so. The first flight of a power-driven machine was made in America by W r i g h t Brothers, in 1903. The first successful flight in Australia was made in 1910. A great deal of progress in aviation has since been made. We were delighted when an Australian, the late Sir Ross Smith, flew from England to Australia in 1919, thus showing how aircraft had developed. In establishing a general scheme of defence every aspect must be considered before deciding what is to be our first arm of defence. The Civil Aviation Department was created in Australia in 1920. No one can gainsay the fact that this innovation has been a boon to thousands of people living in the remote parts of this country.",22
57,Mr WEST,NAVAL AND MILITARY,Especiall y to the Queensland people.,22
58,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"There is, I suppose, more flying in Queensland than in any other part of Australia. Western Australia, of course, largely enjoys the conveniences afforded by the department. There have been established in Australia a great many air routes, which, although subsidized by the Government, are in many cases unprofitable; but I submit that the money is well spent in building up an air service that can be utilized in peace time for the convenience of the people, and during war time as an arm of defence. To support my view that the A i r Force will be a great power in f u t u r e wars, I shall quote the opinion of the American Aviation Commission. That body statedThat victory in future wars cannot but incline to that belligerent able first to achieve, and later to maintain, its supremacy in the air. . . . That no creation of aerial equipment to meet a national emergency already at hand is possible. . . . That, for economic reasons, no nation can hope in peace time to maintain air forces adequate to its defensive needs except through the erection of a great reserve and personal material, and producing industry through the encouragement of civil aeronautics, commercial aviation and transportation, must be made to carry the iinancial load. In view of the need to protect Australia from invasion, its isolated geographical position, with thousands of miles of coastline, and its well-defined trade channels, it is essential that the A i r Force should be our first line, of defence. Bases could be established on certain islands in the Pacific and at certain places on the coast of Australia.",22
59,Mr WEST,NAVAL AND MILITARY,Look-ou t stations.,22
60,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Yes . This would prove a very effective form of defence for Australia, and would be far better than an extravagant expenditure of millions of pounds on vessels that would have to be scrapped in twelve months or two years after the holding of some conference similar to that held at Washington. The first obvious deduction from the experiences of the war and the general trend of events since, is that aviation will play an increasingly dominant part in any future wars that may be fought. We hope that there will be none; but the next war, if one occurs, will probably be fought mainly in the air. We should do everything we can to prevent another war, but if it cannot be prevented we should have an effective means of defence that will not involve an expenditure of millions every year, as an increase in the units of our navy would. A i r c r a ft ar© the only warlike weapons that - can be used in times of peace. In the next year or two we may look for considerable improvement in aircraft. It is probable that it will be found possible to eliminate forced landings, and that would be a very important advance. If forth coming conferences prove abortive, and other nations go on arming, we shall be obliged to adopt a reasonable defence scheme commensurate with our resources. We should develop that arm of defence which is at once most economical and effective. Even if there should be a loss of £500,000 per annum on aircraft that can be used in times of peace for the carriage of passengers and mails to the outposts of Australia. That would be more economical than the expenditure annually of a vastly greater sum on vessels of a navy that in peace time will only patrol the seas, and will perform no useful service. I point out that the Government is doing absolutely nothing towards the establishment of factories for the manufacture of aircraft in Austraha. This work could be taken up immediately. I have a letter here from the A i r c r a ft Manufacturing and Supply Company of Austraha, established at Geelong. The letter is dated the 29th July, and is in answer to a telegram I dispatched to Messrs. P r at t Brothers, asking them what was the capacity of their works. It is as follows: In reply to your telegram of today, wo pleasure in sending you a few particulars, and trust they will suit your purpose. The main classes of aircraft work to be undertaken are:-First , re-condition present Air Force aircraft (aim asking for a minimum contract of 24 machines, at the rate of 12 per year;; second, build new types of both military civil aviation; third, experiment and build small light aeroplanes to stimulate public terest in aviation, with the possible result that many young men may make use of same (thereby building up a reserve of sport pilots, a valuable asset to Australia). With regard to the capacity of the factory, the machinery that is being installed more than cope with the immediate anticiwhat has been done in that state. pated demand, and, to increase the output any time, only additional buildings and personnel will be required. It is niy intention add further 'buildings and train further skilled workers as the demand for aircraft work creases. Knowing the importance of aircraft with regard to the defence of Australia, we have taken it upon ourselves to set up above aircraft industry at our own expense, trusting to receive the support of the Governtwo ment of Australia in this vital matter. addition to the aircraft industry, we intend to establish in the near future a flying school to embrace all brandies of civil aviation. Mr Forde. This firm has shown considerable initiative and enterprise, and could manufacture a very great number of aeroplanes if the Government placed orders with them, instead of spending £5,500,000 on ciuisers that might have to be sunk within two years. I am not pleading specially for this firm any more than ""for any other, but I contend that it would be better to spend money on the manufacture of aircraft than on the construction of cruisers. If we build two cruisers, that will involve an annual expenditure of about £5,500,000. Eor very much less expenditure than that it would be possible to establish a formidable air force, which experts say would be most effective in time of war, whilst in time of peace it would provide a very useful service for our people. The manufacture of aircraft is a comparatively sinrple matter, and carpenters and cabinetmakers might without much difficulty learn to becom.e competent manufacturers of aircraft.. They could be employed, also, in the building of floating boats, and there is no reason why we"" should not be absolutely self-contained in the supply of this means of defence, and so put an end to the cry that is constantly heard, that we must get everything we require from England. The civil aviation department is carrying out a most useful work. The distance from Perth to Wyndham is about 2,000 miles, ancl whilst it used to take months have previously to cover the distance owing to lack of communication and bad roads, it can now be done in three days. Erom Perth to Broome is a distance of, approximately, 1,500 miles. A very useful serand vice has been established between those two places, and has made it possible for a inletter posted today in Perth to be delivered tomorrow at Broome. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green) has been a consistent advocate of the extension of the Western Australian' will air services, and has explained to rae In at Queensland we have an air service from to Charleville up to Cloncurry, and out to Mount Isa. It takes the air-craft twoinand a half hours, flying at a rate of, approximately, 80 miles an hour, to cover the the distance from Cloncurry to Mount Isa, whereas it used previously to takeancl a half days to carry communicaIn tions between those two places. These services could be extended; and while t/hey - could not be run for profit, I repeat that a loss of £500,000 a year on an air-craft scheme that would provide for the defence of Australia, and in times of peace giving much-needed facilities to people out-back, would be more economical than the proposed expenditure on war vessels. Air-craft stations could be established along the Australian coast, and on some of the islands of t'he Pacific which would have to be passed by enemy boats coming to Australia. And Japan has been mentioned as our only likely enemy.",22
61,Mr MAKIN,NAVAL AND MILITARY,Why Japanese?,24
62,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"I believe that the Japanese will never invade Australia, but Japan is the only country that has been mentioned by honourable members opposite as hkely to send an invading force to Australia. They say that if any country invades Australia it will be Japan.",24
63,Mr MAHONY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,They do not even say that.,24
64,Mr FORDE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Several honourable mcmbers opposite have mentioned tihe possibility of an invasion from Japan. Others say there is no fear. If there is no need to fear Japan, we need fear nobody. If we had air-craft bases established on certain islands in the Pacific which would be passed by enemy cruisers or transports, aeroplanes might go up from carriers in times of emergency and keep a look-out within a radius of 1.50 miles from their base. All this could be provided for at very much less cost than will be involved in the policy to which the Government is committing the taxpayers of Australia by the building of cruisers, and more cruisers, that will probably have to be sunk later in accordance with the decison of some Washington conference, or because they have become obsolete. plead with honourable members to support the amendment moved by the honourable meinber for Dalley, who has been actuated by the highest motives in submitting it . If it were carried it would provide for the building of the two cruisers in New South Wales. This would give employment to a very considerable number of workmen over a period of four years. The £3,000,000 which - spent in wages-becaus e 55 per cent, of the total cost of the cruisers would wages-woul d be of benefit to many other workers, small traders, producers, and business men in Australia. This is an Australian question, and I hope that honourable members will prove themselves to be "" big Australians "" by casting their votes in support of the amendment so eloquently moved by the honourable member for Dalley.",24
65,Mr BRUCE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.10] - In rising at this stage I do not propose to reply to the general discussion of the proposals I put before the House when moving the second reading of the bill; the criticism of honourable members opposite was adequately answered in the forcible reply of my colleague the Minister for Defence (Mr Bowden). My remarks today will be confined to the question raised by the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony). On the broad question-shoul d both the cruisers be built in Australia?- I remind honourable members that in introducing the bill I clearly indicated the views of the Government and the action it proposed to take. It considers that the two cruisers should not be built in Australia, for the reason that, putting aside all consideration of cost, the facilities for such shipbuilding here are limited. Honourable members will agree that if two cruisers were to be built here concurrently, it Would involve the establishment of a great shipbuilding yard at Walsh Island, and necessitate the employment of a great number of men. We are all, no doubt, desirous that employment should be given to a great number of men, but the number of skilled men suitable for this particular work is limited, and we must have regard to the general requirements of the great manufacturing industries of the country. If we undertook to build two cruisers in Australia concurrently, we should inI evitably draw heavily upon the body of skilled men we have suitable for this class of work, and-as I am sure every honourable member sincerely trusts that we shall not continue a great war shipbuilding programme-o n their completion a vast number of men would be thrown out of employment.",24
66,Mr FENTON,NAVAL AND MILITARY,Unles s we build vessels would be for the mercantile marine.,24
67,Mr BRUCE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"I am speaking of the go in building of war vessels. If the two cruisers. were built here concurrently we should, on their completion, be faced with a condition of very acute unemployment. Therefore, the Government, having taken all the circumstances into consideration, has determined that one of them' shall be built in Great Britain. That is the only decision that has been made. The question of where the second cruiser shall be built will be submitted for the determination of this House when the general defence policy is put before it. In arriving at a decision on that question it is essential that the House shall be able to gauge exactly what it would cost to build one of the vessels in Great Britain, and what it would cost to build one here. In introducing the bill I told honourable members that a cruiser could be built in Great Britain for £1,900,000, and that the period required for its construction would be approximately two years. That statement was based upon information given to me by the British Admiralty when I was in Great Britain. Erom rhe statements made to me then and the character of the negotiations which were carried on, I think I am almost justified in saying that I was given a direct undertaking that a cruiser would be built for that money, and that Australia was entitled to look to the British Government to carry out the undertaking that was given. When in Great Britain, I was pressed by the British Government to consent to the building of a cruiser there. Unemployment was so acute in that country then that the Government was anxious to do all that was possible to relieve it . I made it clear, however, that I could not commit Australia to any expenditure of that nature, and neither while I was in Britain, nor since my return to Australia, has any arrangement been made for the building of a cruiser. During this debate it has been suggested that the Government has already taken action to have a cruiser built in Great Britain, but there is not the slightest foundation in fact for that suggestion. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) evidently imagines that something of that kind has been done.",24
68,Mr MAHONY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,The honourable member said so a moment ago.,25
69,Mr BRUOE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"I said that I had been pressed by the British Government to agree to the building of a cruiser, but that I had refused to do so.",25
70,Mr MAHONY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,The right honourable gentleman said more than that.,25
71,Mr BRUCE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"On a previous occasion, I informed the House that a cruiser could be built in England within two years for £1,9.00,000, but the honourable member for Dalley has denied that that could be done.",25
72,Mr MAHONY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,I stand by what I said.,25
73,Mr BRUCE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"The honourable member said that the cost of building a cruiser in Great Britain would be £2,250,000, and that the work would take three and a half years. The honourable member is not the only person who has endeavoured to ascertain particulars of costand time of construction. He has, however, in putting an estimate before the House, failed to acquaint honourable members of an important fact, namely, that the cruiser which would cost £2,250,000 is a vessel of a different class from that which I said would cost £1,900,000. The cruiser which would cost the higher amount has a different grouping of the guns; it also has an additional gun, a speed of l £ knots more, and a considerably lighter armament. The Government's desire, of course, is that Australia shall possess a cruiser of the latest design, and of the best type permitted under the Washington Treaty. Therefore, I say now that it is a 10,000-ton cruiser of this improved type that we propose to get, and such a cruiser would cost, I am told, between £2,100,000 and £2,200,000.",25
74,Mr ANSTEY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,Ha d the right honourable gentleman this information at his disposal when he introduced the bill?,25
75,Mr BRUCE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"No . The only information I had at that time was that which I obtained when in Great Britain; the information which I have just given has come to hand since. At present, an estimate of the cost of constructing a cruiser in Australia must be based on the cost of building a similar vessel in Great Britain. For a vessel corresponding to that Which eould be secured from Great Britain for £1,900,000, the. Shipping Board estimates the cost of construction in Australia as £2,898,000,' and the Naval Board's estimate is £3,400,000. For the improved type of cruiser just referred to those estimates would have to be altered to approximately £3,300,000 and £3,960,000 respectively. As those two estimates differ by as much as £500,000, and the same, authorities differ by months in their estimate of the time construction, the Government feels that they should confer as to the basis upon which an estimate should be framed. is, therefore, proposed that representatives of the Shipping Board and of the Naval Board should confer, under an imslow partial and competent chairman. By such means it is hoped that a reliable estimate of the cost of building a cruiser in Australia can be obtained. We have been fortunate in inducing Sir John cost £1,900,000 in England. Monash to act as chairman of the conferthose ence, and later a report will be subthat mitted to the House. A f t e r inquiries various directions, the Government has tained an offer for the building of a i cruiser of the improved type within months of the date of the signing of the contract, at a cost of £2,100,000. Should that offer be accepted, a proper contract £3,400,000. would, of course, be drawn up. An offer has also been received for the construchonorable tion of two cruisers in Great Britain , delivery of the second vessel being within 30 months, and the price of each vessel being reduced by £50,000. So far, the Government has arrived at no decision about the construction of the second cruiser.",25
76,Mr MAHONY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,Fro m what firm was the offer obtained ?,26
77,Mr BRUCE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"The honourable member has not given the name of the firm from which he obtained a quotation. The Gowhich vernment still believes that it is desirable that one cruiser should be built in Great Britain , and also that the fullest conthe sideration should be given to the question of building the second vessel in Australia. Apart from the building up of Austrahan industries, and the purely commercial aspect of the question, the Government realizes that if we are in the future to in a position to meet our own defence quirements, it is essential that we should encourage manufactures in - Austraha. That is a matter to which earnest attenbe tion must be given in connection with the building' of the second cruiser, and opportunity to discuss it will be afforded built for £3,000,000. when the defence estimates are before the House. The question now before us is the building of one' cruiser in Great Britain at a cost of £2,100,000.",26
78,Mr FOSTEB,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Is that a firm offer, or an estimate?",26
79,Mr BRUCE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"We can get a contract on that basis. If we decided to obtain two vessels from Great Britain , the price nine of each would be reduced by £50,000, of and delivery of the second cruiser could be given within thirty months. Those facts I place before honourable members. It for their earnest consideration.",26
80,Mr ANSTEY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Bourke) [4.30] - We are gradually arriving at the truth by a and p a in f u l process, resembling the extraction of teeth. We were told that upon the basis of certain plans and specifi1 cations the first of these cruisers would Without plans and specifications, but upon estimate, somebody connected with in the Naval Board came to the conclusion obthat a similar cruiser could not be built n Australia for less than £1,000,000 in 27 excess of the British estimate.",26
81,Mr BRUCE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,The NaVal Board's estimate for a cruiser built in Australia was,26
82,Mr ANSTEY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"I understood the right gentleman to say that the the cruiser was to cost £1,900,000 in Enggiven land and £2,800,000 in Australia.",26
83,Mr BRUCE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,That was the Shipping Board's estimate.,26
84,Mr ANSTEY,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"That was the first statement, but in the absence of plans and specifications a layman naturally wonders how any one could make a comparison or prepare an estimate. Then the honourable member for ' Dalley (Mr . Mahony) obtained some information from it appeared that the cost of construction in E ngland would be something like £2,250,000. Now we are given, by (Prime Minister, the further information that the cruiser is likely to cost £2,100,000 in England, but it is to be an improved ship, carrying heavier guns, and having greater speed than the ship which be was to have cost £1,900,000. And , apparerently, without plans and specifications being prepared, and without tenders being called, the building of a cruiser is to intrusted to somebody in Great Britain , where a cruiser of the Raleigh type, and an to be known as the Effingham, is being Allowing for further improvements, increases in the cost of materials and changed circumstances, , the estimate of £2,100,000 for our cruiser may develop into an actual cost in England of .£3,000,000. Nobody knows, and apparently'nobody will know until it is completed, what this cruiser will cost. No board that the Government may create can estimate the comparative costs in Australia and England, because tliere can be no basis of comparison in the absence of plans and specifications, and tenders - thereon. If the discussion upon amendment now before the House has .We done nothing more, it has at least given us this information, that on the basis figures two years old, the Government estimates to have built inEngland a ments, - cruiser, which, with certain improvements, will cost £2,100,000, and that further provements and alterations may bring the oost to £3,000,000. At that we can leave it.",26
85,Mr A GREEN,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Kalgoorlie) [4.32] I am very much in favour of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Mahony). There was nothing in the speech delivered by the Prime Minister to convince the House that the first cruiser should be buil t in Great Britain . This is the first Australian vernment in recent years that has taken upon itself to change entirely the country's policy of naval ship construction. Government proposes to have one cruirer built abroad, and the vital necessity, mitted even by the Prime Minister, of routes fitting ourselves to manufacture all our fence requirements, is being entirely overas looked. The real defence of Australia being sacrificed for the sake of cheapness. Whilst I strongly believe that any cruiser Treaty. to be added to the Commonwealth navy should be built in Australia, we should not be satisfied with even that considerafor tion. The opinion of admirals and vice-adexpenditure mirals of Great Britain , the United States of America, and Germany, is that capital ships and cruisers are no longer effective in modern naval warfare. Australia's first declaration should be that it stands for defence and not aggression. Nobody will gainsay that we owe our past and present security largely to our association with the British Empire, but we must reand cognize that in the next war our allies may not be such powerful nations as were the Empire's allies in the late war, and it is within the bounds of possibility, indeed of probability, that Australian communications with the Mother Country may be severed. It is essential, therefore, that, all raw materials and other necesthe saries for defence shall be co-ordinated, and made ready against the time when we may be cut off from the' assistance of the British navy, and have to rely entirely upon ourselves for the defence of our continent. Cruisers are a mobile force, and are suggestive of aggression. We should make it clear that we intend no act of aggression, and that the our purpose is defence aud not defiance. shall fight to the last ditch if our country is invaded, but we must not fall of into the error, commonly made by older countries, of building up large armaat a cost in excess of our financial capacity, for protection' against certain i m - potential foes. No cruiser, nor even two cruisers, could keep open the trade routes between Australia and the Old World .",27
86,Mr STEWART,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"But they could help to do so. Mr A . GREEN - I believe that; but. there are other arms that would help equally well - Whilst the keeping open of our trade routes during time of war is essential to our overseas commerce, it is Gopossible that in the next war Australia may be cut off from the world's markets, and if we have not in the - meantime The adopted a scheme to ensure the inviolability of our country, the mere possession adof means of partially protecting the trade will be of very small comfort. Some dehonorable members have mentioned Japan a possible aggressor, but it has been is rightly pointed out that Japan has adhered f a it h full y to the Washington The latest Statesmen's Year Book shows that in 1922-23 Japan spent upon her navy 400,000,000 yen, whilst the year ended 31st March last the was reduced to 125,000,000 yen. Highly-placed naval strategists hold such divergent views regarding the most useful arm of naval defence that the lay mind is apt to become confused; but there is a remarkable consensus of opinion amongst naval authorities that the day of capital ships and cruisers is past. These experts declare that for defenoeAustralians have no sinister intent of going abroad to subdue other countriesall that are necessary are battle aeroplanes, mines, submarines, and torpedoes. and I shall quote in support of that opinion Rear-Admiral W . F . Fullam, United States of America, who v/as in charge of the American Pacific squadron during late war, Rear-Admiral Bradley H . Fiske, United States of America, A d miral Sims, who was Commander-in-Chief of the American fleet during the late war, and Admirals Sir Percy Scott, and Lord Fisher, and Rear-Admirals S. S. H all a.nd Mark Kerr, of the Royal'Navy, and Admira l Von Scheer, who commanded the German fleet in the battle of Jutland, and who put up such a fight as entitled liim to be regarded as one of the leading German naval strategists.",27
87,Mr BOWDEN,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Would the honourable member accept his opinion in preference to that of Jellicoe and Beatty ? . Mr A . GREEN - The opinions of the men I have stated should carry weight even against the views of Jellicoe and Beatty. A f t e r all , war is the only test of defence theories, and in that crucible many of them are proved to be wrong. Another authority I shall quote is Lord Sydenham, a distinguished British statesman and a recognized authority on defence. Rear-Admiral W . F . Fullam wrote an article in 1923 on the passing of sea power. The opinions of such a man should have careful consideration, because as a naval expert he is regarded highly in his own country. He made this remarkable statementThe wings of "" Sea Power"" have been clipped. New naval weapons have vastly strengthened the defence and greatly weakened the offence in overseas warfare. Great armadas and armies cannot again cross the seas. Force cannot, as in the past, be carried over the oceans. With the eea as a buffer, weak nations can defy the strong. A puny power, without a navy, can challenge the strongest battle fleet. It can, with intelligent energy, make its coast impregnable against a hundred Dreadnoughts. With an impenetrable barrage of . mines, air forces, torpedoes, and submarines, it can easily hold a maritime enemy one hundred miles from its shores. The freedom of the seas is in many respects near, realisation. Aggression, expressed in ships, is chained to the beach. That is a very definite statement.",28
88,Mr MAXWELL,NAVAL AND MILITARY,Does the honourable member suggest that we should hold our hands until all naval authorities are agreed ?,28
89,Mr A GREEN,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"No . I shall suggest certain methods of defence that will be much less costly to Austraha, and, in my opinion, will enable us much more adequately to defend this country. The authority I have quoted further says:Inter-continental war will be well-nigh impossible in future. The weak will not bow to the strong from overseas. No one nation can rule the waves hereafter. The greatest fighting navy may inspire no fear. A hostile coast can scorn its power. Its guns cannot reach . the target. They are like ancient weapons in a modern age. A dreadnought fleet on an enemy's coast is like Don Quixote fighting Windmills with a lance. This gentleman is no crank; he is not a man with a ""bee in his bonnet,"" but is one who has devoted his. wliole life to the study of naval warfare. His opinion, and the opinion of others whom I shall quote, suggest that we can defend ourselves in a less costly and more effective way than by building cruisers.",28
90,Mr MAXWELL,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"That argument would .not apply to the defence of our trade routes. Mr A. GEEEN - No ; but I am proposing to provide for the protection of our trade routes. I recognize that the honourable member is very keen on defending our trade. I admit that trade is important, but nothing is so important as preventing an enemy from gaining a footing on these shores and conquering our people. The writer quotes EearAdmiral Bradley A. Eiske, of the United States Navy, who declared in 1911 thatA strong force of air-planes supported by mines and submarines would alone suffice to defend the Philippines froin invasion. Fortifications were not needed. A defending fleet of battleships was quite unnecessary. I do not pose as a naval authority, and I do not say that the statements of these men are necessarily unassailable, but I say that their opinions, in their respective callings, are of great importance, and should carry weight with this House.",28
91,Mr BOWDEN,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Ero m what is the honourable member quoting? Mr A. GEEEN - Ero m an article by Eoar-Admiral W. F. Fullam, in MCClure's Magazine of June, 1923. 1I have searched through the Parliamentary Library for books on naval warfare, and have been astonished to find there hundreds of books that are of no use. A book written three or four years' ago is entirely out of date, and while it may seem a shallow method of inquiry, honourable members have no choice but to go to the serious up-to-date magazines to ascertain the latest developments in naval warfare. Admiral Sir Percy Scott, of the British Navy, in a letter to the London Times in 1914"",'saidFirst, that modern weapons have entirely revolutionized na.val warfare. Second, that if we wore at war with a country within striking distance of submarines, battleships on the high seas would be in great danger. Third, that if we went to war, we should probably lock up our sliips in a safe harbour, and the enemy would do the same. Fourth, that no fleet could be hidden from the airman's eyes. Fifth, that submarines could deliver a deadly attack in broad daylight. Sixth, that battleships could not bombard an enemy's port if it is protected by submarines. Seventh, that the enemy submarines would come to our coast nnd destroy everything they could. Eighth, that the submarine had driven the battleship from the ocean. Bear-Admiral Fullam points' out that these opinions by Admiral Sir Percy Scott were advanced nine years ago, before air forces were full y developed. He further writesAdmiral Sir John Fisher supported Admiral Scott. He declared that the dreadnought was doomed. ""Scrap the lot; the future fighting is in the air,"" he claimed. And these two admirals, Fisher and Scott, had done more than any men in the world to develop the dreadnought. Sir Percy Scott further saidYou must admit that, in the war, we were nearly forced to submission by starvation. You must admit that the German battleships played no part in reducing us to a state of starvation. You must admit that if our battleship superiority had been double what it was, it could not have protected us from starvation. You must admit that the dominant arm of the war was the submarine. You must, admit that our belief before the war that the submarine was only a toy resulted in our coming to the brink of losing the war. Here is what another authority of the British Navy, Bear-Admiral S. S. Hall, saysWe had a grand fleet, with a prcpoudorence of nearly two to one over Germany alone, and an auxiliary navy of about five thousand vessels. We had the assistance of the American, French, Italian, and Japanese navies. We held the most favourable geographical position, for a naval war, that the atlas can furnish. And yet our main naval purpose-the protection of our trade-coul d not be carried out. These are the p la ffl sad facts of our naval experience in the last war. In view of the failure of the navy-unde r the most favourable conditions, with many Allies-to protect our trade in the last war, has it any hope of doing BO on its existing basis under less favourable conditions? Can it even protect the lines of communication of our battle-fleet, if the is required to fight out of home waters? Will the advent of aircraft make the position easier ? Then he proceeds to quote the statement of Admira l Sims, of the United States Navy, made when ho visited London. Admiral Sims saidThere will never again bc in naval history one of the Simon-pure naval expeditions carried across the sea to an enemy's port, the defeat of an enemy's fleet, the establishment of an advanced base on his coast, and the pouring in of soldiers and supplies. This has ilr. A. Green. been for ever rendered impossible, against any country that has adequate air and submarine forces.",28
92,Mr MAXWELL,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"When was that statement made ? Mr A . GREEN - In 1917. The lessons of the war were well known, then.",29
93,Mr MAXWELL,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"We have . learned since then more about copingwith submarines. Mr A . GREEN - I should be pleased to hear the honourable member deal with that point. Vice-Admiral Kerr's opinion is as fallows : No nation would dare send a capital fleet 3,000 miles across open water to light an enemy. It is ten chances to one that it would be wiped out to the last bottom. Without a base it would be whittled away by the air and submarine forces of the enemy, without ever meeting the enemy's grand fleet. As blockading by big ships has been shown to be impossible in the face of modern flotillas, it would appear that there is no use for the battleship where the bases are far apart. Battle-fleets are only of use in certain geographic divisions, whore the bases arc not far apart. They are of no use for wars in which the combatant countries arc separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",29
94,Mr BOWDEN,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"The Commonwealth Government is proposing to construct cruisers, not battleships. Mr A . GREEN - Yes , cruisers for the protection of our trade routes, which could not be protected even if we had six or seven powerful allies. Rear-Admiral Fullam mentions that Lord Sydenham, a distinguished British statesman, agrees with Admiral Sims and Admira l Ker r in the following letter to an admiral of the American navy: You can't now employ a large battle fleet in an enemy's near waters if he possesses a smaller fleet in good order and effective. Japan is a case in point. You, the United States, and we, Great Britain, can do nothing against Japan separately, and not much more if we were allied. I am sure you will come to this conclusion. latter The next passage in that letter has some interest for us in AustraliaPer contra Japan, and obviously no other power, can do anything in American home waters, even if your fleet were only as the High Seas Fleet compared to the Grand Fleet. Submarines, minefields, and the air have conferred new powers on a fleet in its own waters, and with the resources of a great nation behind it. That is what so many pundits have missed. It carries far. Rear-Admiral Fullam further saysA well-known English writer declares, "" No great army can be carried across the ocean against a fleet of submarines. Australia and New Zealand are absolutely secure against attack. Given enough submarines, the United States is now a distinct and impregnable military unit, and so is the Old World. Last, but not least- I say that advisedly-is Rear-Admiral von Scheer, who is quoted as sayingOnly recently experiments made in America have made it clear that a battleship may be sunk by air planes. Even though the chance of sucli successes would be lessened in case of sliips under way, and though the factor of defence did not enter into these experi55 ments, it cannot be denied' that the prospects are favourable to the air plane-sinc e an ing fleet cannot remain in motion permacountry nently. It requires rest for the engines, for the taking on board of munitions, fuel, and supplies. It must dock for repairs, at anchor, and it is then that the opportunity for air attack presents itself. The danger volved in being struck by a 2,000-lb. from the sky also exists in the mines and pedoes which threaten the battleship. I thus exposed to dangers beneath the waters, and from the air, and it has no absolute security against these. Swift cruisers, eyes of the fleet, are threatened in a still greater degree, since, in view of their high speed, they must be content with weaker armaments. The air plane is swifter, its eyes see farther, it cannot be so easily pushed aside or into a corner. And thus it may said to furnish better service than a large' expensive battleship. Read-Admiral Fullam sums up as folconstructed lows : Reviewing the subject briefly, wo may say:First, a battle fleet cannot carry an attack across the ocean; second, a great army cannot be sent oversea; third, a base 5,000 miles homo, surrounded by enemy bases, is .no at all; fourth, submarines, air forces, mines, und torpedoes suffice to defend a coast; sea-coast forts are useless; sixth, it is only by transporting overseas an overwhelming force to seize and control the air that continent can attack another; seventh, each fidential-stated continent will control its own destiny if it defencearms itself with modern weapons. These are the points that I have been trying to make this afternoon. I have quoted a great array of scholarly gentlemen, expert, at any rate, on this subject, who are unanimously of the opinion that protection in the future rests with war planes, submarines, and other means of coastal defence. A cruiser will cost £2,000,000 or more. Let me point out that a model battle-plane costs - only £2,500, so that we could have 800 battleplanes for the price of one cruiser. I do not know whether the estimated cost of a battle-plane has gone up since the Minister for Defence gave us the price a little time ago of a modern battle-plane. A p parently, these costs increase from day [104] to day, so that we do not quite know where we are. France proposes to in crease its fleet of battle-planes to 182. squadrons, or 2,180 machines.",29
95,Sir ELLIOT JOHNSON,NAVAL AND MILITARY,What is the radius of action of a battle-plane over the ocean 1,30
96,Mr BOWDEN,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Tw o hundred miles. Mr A . GREEN - France' s naval dethe fence equipment for 1924 comprises' 6 armoured cruisers, 5 light cruisers, and submarines. Under the peace treaty attackwith Germany, the Allies permitted that to retain 8 pre-war dreadnoughts, time 8 light cruisers, and 16 destroyers, but they thought it wise not to allow Gerlie many to build a single submarine or warinplane. The building of aircraft in Gerbomb many was restricted to machines of 185 torhorse-power, which restricted that oount is try to commercial aeroplanes. The "" K "" class submarine, to which the honourable the member for Dalley (Mr Mahony) referred, is playing an enormous part in defence. As a matter of fact, some authorities believe that the K2'6, the latest British submarine, is more effective than be an ordinary cruiser. This type of vessel and can be built for £330,000. In other words, six "" K "" class submarines can be for the price of a cruiser such as is proposed by the Government, even if it is built in Great Britain . These submarines carry a 12-in. gun, and they have a sufficient range to enable them to cirfrom cumnavigate the coast of Australia withbase out the; necessity for refuelling. Lord Jellicoe, in one of his reports to the Comfifth, monwealth Government on his naval misair sion from May to August, 1919- I am one told that the other two reports are coni n ""reference to air It will be seen by reference to chapter VII . and vol. III . , chapter IV., of the report that the questions of aerial material and operations are touched upon at some length. The continual and rapid development of aircraft, both for work over water and over land, makes the. question of great importance to Australia, and a reference to the above chapters will show how essential it will be in the future to the security of the Commonwealth that strong forces of naval aircraft should be available for reconnaissance purposes in conjunction with the fleet. In the Statesman's Tear-Book for 1924 there is the following - reference to the reports of Lord Jellicoe that I have been unable to obtain: His report to the Government of Australia, emphasized the desirability of the Government becoming self-contained in regard to shipbuilding and the manufacture of guns, mountings, explosives, and aircraft. However, no action of much importance has been taken on the proposition. The very point that I have raised is stressed by a number of authorities. The Labour party stands for defence, not defiance. have quoted several leading authorities on naval warfare, who would be loath, I take it, to admit that any other arm of the service was as proficient as their own. Notwithstanding their prejudice, which is patent, they frankly confess that defence will depend in future on aircraft, marines, and torpedoes. The cost of providing the latter is only a fraction of that of building capital ships. The captains of industry in Australia have been insistent in urging upon the present Government the very opinions dwelt upon by the Acting Leader of the Opposi-. tion (Mr Anstey) in his remarks. A report issued last by the vice-president of the tralian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy was wholly devoted necessity for Australia to co-ordinate its industries in preparation for defence. was pointed out that we should establish manufactories for using onr raw materials for the purposes of peace, so that, if it became necessary to convert those materials into the thousand and one articles that are necessary in war time, we in Australia, when the tocsin rang, should be able to draw upon our own resources for the purposes of defence. aspect of defence appeals to me, for I am essentially a man of peace. I should like to be able to say, as the socialists of Germany and Prance declared prior to the Franco-Prussian war, that we are the enemies of all war, and that we solemnly promise that neither the sound of the tronrpet nor the roar of the neither victory nor defeat, shall swerve us from our common purpose-the the children of toil of all countries. is a fine ideal. I admit that under present conditions the happy haven of the pacifist is not readily attainable; but, until civilization becomes sane on the subject of war, I hope that we shall declare that, come what may, Australia will not enter into any war of aggression. But should any people be so ill-advised the counsel of all those who have studied the subject of naval warfare, as to venture its fortunes in an to occupy this country, we Mr A. Oreen. be unconquerable and would never give up our homes. If every people made a pronouncement that it stood for peace, and would not go beyond the confines of its own territory for the purpose of aggression, peace would be at hand. I Meanwhile if there is danger abroad, as there may be, let the Government do something on the Unes suggested by Ix>rd Jellicoe in the direction of co-ordinating our great industries so that they may be used for our protection. I regret that, instead of following that course, the sub- Government proposes to build a cruiser abroad. It is said that the unemployed in Great Britain will thereby be assisted. That may be so, but I claim that Australia has to be built up, and that the true Australian desires his country to progress in the arts of peace. I feel that, if we embark upon a policy such as I advocate, opening and pursue it with a fixed purpose, we year need not fear aggression. AusMr C. RILEY (Cook) [5.12] - Hon to the orable members will no donbt be astonished at the figures given as the dif It ference between the cost of building a cruiser abroad and the cost of constructing it in Australia, We were originally told that that difference amounted to £900,000. This afternoon, however, we were informed by the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) that the cost of building a cruiser in Great Britai n had reached £2,200,000, the increase being due to the That provision of an extra gun, an increased speed of IJ knots an hour, and lighter, armaments, which, it is said, has occasioned an increase of the original estimate to the extent of £300,000. Honourable members on this side of the chamberdesire to know from whom the original estimate and alsothe present figures have cannon, been obtained. We believe that the cost of a cruiser built in England w i ll be union of more than £2,200,000, and that the That actual price will approach the cost of construction in Australia. The Commonwealth Shipping Board estimates the cost of building the vessel in Australia at £3,400,000, and we also have the estimate of the Naval Board, which says that the cost of construction in Australia will be £3,960,000, so that there is a difference against of £560,000 between the two estimates. W it h that divergence I am not particularly concerned. I consider that it would attempt be courageous on the part of the Governshould ment to place with the shipbuilders c f Australia an order for the construction - of the two cruisers. Personally, I am - opposed to the building of any such vessels, especially at this juncture, but, if they are to be constructed, the work should be done in our own country, for I believe we have workmen and shipbuilding yards capable of turning out a cruiser second to I have a knowledge of the class of work - carried out at our dockyards and shipyards., and the return given by the men to their employers. The workmanship here compares favourably with that of any British dockyard or other private enterprise. The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) - doubted whether we have sufficient skilled artisans to carry out in Austraha the conetruction of either one or two vessels. . I say emphatically that we have in this country sufficient artisans to for m the nucleus of the highly-trained staff that would be needed to construct our own - cruisers and torpedo-boat destroyers. The New South ""Wales Government twelve or fourteen years ago sent a batch of workmen to Great B r it a in to gain experience in warship construction. The Commonwealth National Government iilso sent a number of men to England to gain similar experience. Notwithstanding these efforts to estabhsh our own shipbuilding industry, the services of the experts and skilled tradesmen who returned to Australia have been lost to the Commonwealth. Yet we have in Australia a skilled staff capable of constructing a cruiser. During the war honourable members opposite boasted that the Australian soldiers were the finest and the best equipped in the world, but when it is proposed to build our own warships the same gentlemen say that Australian workmen cannot carry out this work. When the Composite Government was formed, the members of the Ministry prided themselves that they were all Australians. What sort of Australians are men who. propose to place an order in Great Britain for a cruiser which could with equal advantage be built in"" Australia? An additional expenditure on these cruisers of only £300,000 would enable our own workmen to establish the shipbuilding industry in this country. During war time honourable members opposite did not urge the people to purchase abroad articles for defence purposes that could not be obtained so cheaply here. At that time the question of price did not enter their minds, but now, when it is proposed to provide' employment for our own people, aud to form the nucleus of a trained staff Gapable of building warships, they say, ""No; we must save this country £300,000."" This Government, by pronone. posing to place the order for a cruiser with shipbuilders outside the Commonwealth, is adopting an anti-Australian attitude. When the Prime Minister doubted whether we could obtain sufficient skilled tradesmen to carry out this work in Australia, he asked himself this question-After the completion of these two cruisers in Austraha, what will happen to the tradesmen who have been engaged on the work ? I have no doubt that, if left at the mercy of the present Government, they would be thrown on the unemployed market. An y government charged with the responsibility of office must grapple with the question of establishing the shipbuilding industry in Australia. In America the shipbuilding in dustry is protected. If repairs are effected to an American vessel abroad, certain charges are imposed by the Government; there - is consequently an in centive to the American ship-owners to have all necessary repairs to vessels carried out in their own country. It is just as necessary to protect the shipbuilding in dustry as it is to protect our primary and secondary industries. We could give no greater assistance to the fostering and protecting of this industry than by placing the order for the two cruisers with Australian shipbuilding firms. I am not .here to champion the cause of Cockatoo Island or any other dockyard. My one desire is to protect the interests of the workers, especially those men who were previously engaged in the shipbuilding industry. If those two cruisers were constructed in Australia, and upon their completion it was decided not to proceed with the construction of furthe r cruisers or submarines, the workmen previously engaged on warship construction could then be profitably employed in the construction of "" B a y "" liners, and other boats of the type of the Fordsdale and Ferndale. Their experience in the construction of the hulls, engines, and boilers of the cruisers would be of immense value to them in carrying out the other class of work.  Fordsdale written down before she carried a ton of goods? Mr C. RILEY - That vessel when completing its homeward trip established a record in reducing the time of the journey by one day. A considerable saving was thus made in the wages of the crew and in other directions. The class of work carried out on the Fordsdale and Ferndale compares more than favourably with that performed in any shipbuilding yard in the Old Country. A few months ago I asked the Prime Minister for a return showing the cost of the "" Bay "" liners, and the repairs carried out on them since they were taken over by the Commonwealth. The original cost was almost £1,250,000, and from £20,000 to £30,000 has since been spent each year on repairs to these vessels. The workmanship of the Fordsdale and Ferndale is an evidence of the capability of our workmen for carrying out a thorough job. If we construct our own vessels, there will be no need to spend huge sums of money on repairs. The hon is not prepared to protect the implementmaking industry which, in time of war, oould be readily adapted to the manufacture of munitions. He wants us to purchase cheaply abroad, and is not prepared to say a good word for any goods of Australian manufacture. The Govern- ing up of our secondary industries. ment's proposal to build two 10,000-ton - cruisers at an estimated cost £2,200,000, to the detriment of our primary and secondary industries, is tantamount to the action of the head of a household who, while recklessly spending money on arms and ammunition, starves the members of his family neglects their health. He, like the Government, owing to his .failure to provide an adequate and organized defence, could not, if required, rities for naval repairs protect himself from attack by his nextdoor neighbour. I am unable to forget the many declarations that were made by the Government supporters during the war. It was then said that that war was to end all wars. Honourable members opposite do not appreciate a reminder of that declaration, and say, "" Let us forget it . "" Those who took part in the late war cannot forget that declaration, especially when, in the defence of a young country like Australia, it is proposed to expend £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 on the construction of cruisers abroad. In view of the enormous increase in the naval and military expenditure throughout the Empire, it is time that we took stock of our position, and refused to sanction any further expenditure on defence. In 1S21 the British m i l it a ry and naval expenditure was £13,000,000; in 1871, £22,000,000; in 1914, before the war, £80,000,000; and in 1921, three years after the war, £207,000,000. The Commonwealth Government now intends to participate in the race for armaments by increasing our defence expenditure by £5,000,000. I am not prepared to support any proposal for the construction of cruisers, but if they are to be constructed, then for the sake of Australia, and having in mind the in terests of the workmen engaged in the shipbuilding industry, let us insist that they be constructed in this country. In any case, two cruisers would be absolutely inadequate to protect Australia, with its enormous coast line, exceeding 12,000 miles. The honourable member for ' Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie) stated that there would be peace in the Pacific for a. considerable time to come, but that we must prepare for war. We can best prepare for Australia's defence, not by the construction of cruisers, but by the buildWe have in the Commonwealth dockyards of and shipping yards at such places as Cockatoo Island, Walsh Island, and Will liamstown, that are capable of building ships of war and ships of peace. The Commonwealth Government disposed of the Williamstown dockyard to the Vicand torian Government, when, for defence reasons, that dockyard should have been retained, so that, in time of war, it would be at the service of the naval authoand new works. The Government is doing everything possible to brake the wheels of in dustry in other dockyards by its proposal to construct cruisers abroad. If this work were carried out in Australia, it would be a great incentive to the shipbuilding industry. A trained staff would be employed, able to 'construct not only cruisers, but also torpedo boat destroyers and submarines. The interstate steamship companies send abroad for new vessels, although they could be constructed here. The Sydney Ferry Company has recently purchased a vehicular f e r ry from the Old Country. The shipping and f e r r y companies derive their revenue from Australia, from the fares of passengers and workers, but when they require new vessels for their shipping services, they purchase in the cheapest market, to the detriment of Australian industries. The first thing the Commonwealth Government should do is to afford sufficient protection to the shipbuilding industry, and thus give local shipbuilders a chance. Mr A . GREEN - J . wonder if the Government got a price for the cruisers from the Hong Kong dockyard. s Mr C. EILEY - I believe that if isters could give effect fo their hearts' desire tliey would have these ships constructed by black labour if , by doing so, they could get them more cheaply. The anti-Australian spirit is being displayed in various ways. When the R . M . S . Mooltan came out here a few months ago, great publicity was given to it in the press. At the same time, only an inch or two was devoted in the press to the launching of the Fordsdale, which was built at Cockatoo Island, and is a credit to Australian workmen. I think that Australian governments should arrange for school children to witness the launching of Australian-built ships. They should also make arrangements to enable parties of them to be escorted over the vessels in order that they might learn what Australian workmen are doing. Until we have a government in power that is prepared to foster the Australian spirit in the children of our schools, Australian industries will not be given a fair chance. It cannot be said that the defence of Austraha was strengthened by the disposal of the Commonwealth Woollen Mills or the disposal of the Commonwealth Harness Factory. The Government is prepared to spend huge sums of money on the construction of cruisers in other countries, but it showed how little it was concerned about the defence of Australia when it disposed of the Woollen Mills and the Harness Factory. If it is necessary to retain the Small Arms Factory, it is equally necessary for the clothing and equipment of Australian soldiers to retain the Woollen Mills and the Harness Factory. I believe that the policy of the present Government is largely influenced by Flinders-lane, and when one mentions Flinders-lane he is immediately reminded of the men who made exorbitant profits during the war years. During the controversy which took place with regard to the construction of cruisers, certain representations were made by the Newcastle Municipal Council to the Chamber of Commerce, suggesting.support for the proposal that one of the cruisers should be built at Walsh Island. The Chamber of Commerce replied .that it did not believe in interfering with private enterprise. It could not support a proposal for the construction of a cruiser at Walsh Island or Cockatoo Island, because it did not stand for government intervention in business. When it was a question of financing the M in - war, of finding men to wage it , and of clothing and equipping them, that was not a matter for private enterprise, but a responsibihty. of the Government. I was amused at the reply of the Chamber of Commerce to the representations from Newcastle. When it is a question of the construction of a-cruiser, and the making of huge profits at the expense of Australian taxpayers, the matter is one for private enterprise. Just as it was the duty of the Government to clothe and equip our soldiers, I say it is its duty to construct whatever ships may be necessary for our defence. If the construction of these vessels is carried out in Australia, the work will be done more satisfactorily, and we shall avoid the possibility of a set of individuals reaping huge profits. From the point of view of defence, it would be better to spend the money proposed to be spent on the construction of the cruisers in the development of militaryroads. I have no particular interest in the Northern Territory, which has a worthy representative in the honourable member for the Territory (Mr Nelson), but I believe that the Government could spend money to advantage from a defence point of view in the construction of roads in the Northern Territory. Last year it set aside the miserable sum of £3,000 for the construction of roads, culverts, and bridges in the Northern Territory. A twopenny-halfpenny municipal council in any of the states would be ashamed to set aside so small a sum for such a purpose. If the Government set aside £100,000 or £200,000 for the construction of roads, that would strengthen our position from a defence point of view. Honourable members opposite believe in aeroplanes, warships, and submarines, but we should concern ourselves more with internal equipment, so that, should it ever be necessary, ""we shall, by being organized internally, be able to present a stubborn resistance to any foe. Our industries should be protected and assisted. The motor body industry should be further protected, as in time of war. factories employed in the construction of motor bodies could be converted to the manufacture of certain parts of aircraft. Our piano factories could, in war time, be devoted to the same purpose. Our engineering works could r-eadily be converted into munition factories. I have an instance before me of how the Government has failed to afford assistance to an Australian industry. In my electorate, there is established the only works of its kind in the Commonwealth. The Austral .Company has set up a plant that was specially installed in the Old Country during the war years by one of the big engineering (firms. Recently the Commonwealth Railways Department called tenders for certain copper rods. Tenders were received from the Birmingham Battery Company and the Austral Bronze Company. The Birmingham Company's price was £123 12s. per ton, and that of the Austral Bronze Company was £1'25 10s. per ton. In spite of the small difference between the two tenders the contract was let abroad. The plant of the Austral Bronze Company could bereadily used in time of war for the manufacture of copper sheets and topper rings for shell manufacture, but because a British firm offered to .supply the articles required at a few shillings less per ion the .contract was let abroad. That is mot the .consideration which should be 'extended to Australian firms. We should consider .also the further protection of - the woollen industry. 1' may be asked what connection this imdustry has with the question of defence, but if the woollen industry were properly handled in Australia, we might, in five years' time, transplant Bradford 'the Old Oountry to Australia, and thus increase our population by from 1,500,000 to 2,000,000. Should we not be stronger from - a defence point of view if , during the next five years, we made such an addition to 'our population? Instead of working up our wool in our own country, we export it to bo manufactured in cheap labour .'countries. Again, take the Mr C. Riley. tanning industry. There are tanning works in my electorate that are practically 'dosed down because they are unable to get the sheepskins they require in this country. One firm has to import sheepskins from New Zealand to keep its factory going something like quarter time. I am informed that, during the last week or two, this firm was forced to refuse orders received from London for leather. It was not in a position to supply the orders of London firms, because whilst sheepskins are being sent out of t'he country, it has to import them from New'Zealand. That is a ridiculous position. We should encourage trade with the East with a view to strengthening our position from a defence point of view. If , instead of concerning ourselves with Bronze many long trade routes to Europe, we encouraged .trade with the East, which is our natural trade outlet, we could find there a ready market for our products and manufactures, and would have shorter routes to maintain in time of war. Civil aviation should be encouraged as a means of defence. The Post and Telegraph Department should establish up-toBattery date aerial mail services, and the aircraft used could, in time of war, be devoted to defence. By the adoption of this policy we might have an army of trained air pilots who could be readily absorbed by our air forces in time of war. Whilst I contend that we should serve the interests of Australia from the point of view of defence by scientifically organizing our industries, we should not overlook the necessity of paying due regard to the public health. .Since the return of the honourable member for Calare (Sir Neville Howse), a number of honourable members have given some attention to this matter. It should have been given more attention when the Estimates were under consideration. Last year I voiced a. protest against the miserable amount proposed - by the Government for publio health purposes. from Mr SPEAKER (Rt. Hon.WA. Watt).. - Order ! Public health does not come within either .the motion or the amendment. Mr C. RILEY - I am trying to show that public health has a 'great 'deal to do with the question of defence. By ibuirlding up the health of the people we shall be better' able .to oiler a stubborn resistance to an enemy. Last year £121,'OO0 was voted for public health services,' and of thatamount three-fourths, was absorbed in purely administrative charges. There was no money set 'aside for medical research. Keeping in view the necessity for defence.,, the Government should make available a large sum of. money with which to combat venereal disease, tuberculosis, cancer, and other diseases prevalent in our midst.",30
97,Mr SPEAKER,NAVAL AND MILITARY,I am afraid I cannot permit the honourable member to' proceed on those. Unes. Mr C. RILEY - I am trying to show that instead of spending the. money proposed on the construction of cruisers wo could spend it to greater advantage from a. defence point of view by improving the general health of the people.,36
98,Mr SPEAKER,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"The honourable member will see that whilst an allusion io> the matter is quits regular, an extended argument upon public health is outside the limits, of the bill. Mr C. RILEY - I am satisfied to hold my own views on the matter.. I hope ihat the Government will later cn see the necessity of paying due attention to this very important question. As one whois anxious that we should improve our position, and acquit ourselves worthily from a national point of view, I contend that if we are a healthy people we shall be better able to go through any contest, in which we may be engaged. If. the cruisers are. to be built, I hope that the. order will be placed with an Australian dockyard. Some .honourable members opposite who are opposed to their construction in Australia might refer to the high cost of the Brisbane, the Adelaide, and the torpedo boat destroyers. We should not, however, he guided by the exorbitant costs of those vessels. First,, we had to get together a trained staff, and then there were many delays caused by our naval experts, who from time to tune altered the plans and specifications. That delay caused the cost of construction to pile up. In the costs, charged to the Fordsdale, the Adelaide, the Brisbane, and also the "" Bay "" steamers, were many items, which should not have been charged to them. instance, the cost of. a motor garage at Balmain for Mr K in g Salter, the managerof the dockyard, was charged' to the Brisbane. When I asked fbr information as to the cost of that garage, I was informed that no costs in connection with it . were charged to the Common1 wealth. I know, however, that the whole of the establishment charges, at Cockatoo Island were charged to the cruisers, and the torpedo beat destroyers. Orders came from the Navy Office that such charges: were to be allocated to. jobs costing over £1,000. As the only jobs exceeding £ 1 , 0 0 0 were those of the cruisers and the torpedo boat - destroyers, is, it any wonder that the eost of constructing those vessels was so high ? A flagstasff was erected at Cockatoo Island, and new. furnishings were placed in the manager^ residence, all of which were charged to the Brisbane. Those actions, cannot be justified. Honourable members on the other side have accused the workmen at Cockatoo Island of "" goingslow."" Will any member attempt to justify the employment of dockyard labour and miaterial for the construction' of a motor garage, and the charging of the cost to the Brisbane ? The workmen should not be blamed for the high cost in the face of such happenings. An army of experts was engaged in sujiervising the construction of those vessels. It was not m the interests of those experts that the vessels should be completed quickly, as the greater the time spent in construction, the longer would they retain their highly paid positions. If a new cruiser is. to be constructed in Australia, precautions should be taken against these highly-paid naval officers falling down on the job in order to keep themselves in employment. I am unable to' support the proposal of the Government to build these vessels, outside Australia. In our midst we. have thousands of unemployed workmeDj among whom are many returned soldiers, and u n t i l employment is found for them we should not subscribe toany policy whichwill permit of 'the construction of these cruisers outside of the Commonwealth. We should, first encourage Australian industry, and (preserve the health of our own people. By constructing developmental roads and railways, we shall be strengthening our position from a defence point of view to a far greater extent than by constructing two cruisers, For which would be .altogether inadequate for the .defence of our coastline and trade routes.",36
99,Mr OKEEFE,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Denison) [5.52],.r-I do not intend to occupy more than a few minutes, but I cannot allow such an important matter as this amendment to' go to a vote without explaining myreasons for the action I propose to take. I agree with the opinion expressed by honourable members on .that in the interests of it would be far better if the ing of these cruisers, either in Australia or elsewhere, could be deferred. .are not in immediate {Honourable members on this side will - probably be accused of being and with not having the best interests of Australia at heart, because of the stand we take on this subject. I remind honourable members, however, that in the past the Labour party has more correctly interpreted the views of the people of Australia, in relation to defence, have those opposed to its policy. would carry the minds of members back to the first three years of when the Labour party in this House comprised fourteen out of a total of 75 members, and its representation Senate was eight members in a House of 36. When the then Prime (the late Sir Edmund Barton) from a conference in Great Britain, and informed the House that he had pledged Australia to pay a greatly increased sum to the Imperial Government for the upkeep of a portion of the British fleet in Australian waters, his proposals opposed by the members of the Labour party. At that time, Australia was paying over £100,000 for the purpose mentioned. The Australian Labour party in thosa days foresaw the defence policy of the people of this country, and, although its numbers in both Houses were small, - its members put up a fight for the beginnings of an Australian were only a year or so in advance of Australian opinion, as soon all the parties in the Federal subscribed to the same views. The result was that when the Labour came into power it was able to lay the foundation of a.n Australian navy which did good work during the recent great war. Honourable on this side have pointed out that for the protection of our trade routes the two cruisers which it is proposed to construct would be about as little protection as would two of the boats trading Melbourne and Geelong. The argument ""that they are necessary for the protection of our trade routes, I think, io the ground. This party beheves Mr O'Keefe. instead of building cruisers, we should concentrate on aerial and submarine dethis side, fence, and the building up of Australian Australia industries, so that, should we be attacked, build- we should have a larger population from which to draw men to defend ourWe selves. If the £2,000,000 for the condanger. struction of these cruisers must be spent, let it be spent in Australia. By so dounpatriotic, ing, we should relieve the unemployment which is today acute in every capital city and big centre in Australia. It is both cruel and wickedly unpatriotic to talk about spending £2,000,000 to provide work for men on the other side of the world when, in our midst, there than are Australians able and anxious to work I but unable to find employment. Many of them would be capable of doing the federation, work required to build these cruisers. Only today the Prime Minister stated that one of the reasons which first led in the the Government to consider the construction of these cruisers in Great Britain Minister was the request of the British Governreturned ment that the work should be done there to relieve the unemployment which existed. While we all sympathize with the unemployed in Great Britain, surely our first thought should be for our own people! Only two days ago I saw in were Hobart, which has a population of about 54,000 people, a procession of over 200 unemployed men. Most of them were genuine workers, looking for employment and faced with the spectre of want. While the building of these cruisers in Sydney would not relieve unemployment in Tasmania to a very great extent, it would make some difference, as unemnavy. We ployment in any part of Australia affects the whole Commonwealth. I repeat that afterwards it is cruel and unpatriotic for the GoParliament vernment even to consider letting a contract involving the expenditure of party £2,000,000 on the other side of the world, when much of the work could navy-a be. done in Australia quite as efficiently, and almost as cheaply. members The Minister for Defence said, a few days ago, that the first cruiser might, and probably would be required long before it could be built in Australia. That statement is opposed to the views of the between vast majority of the Australian people. So far as we can read the signs and portents of the times, Australia is in no imfalls mediate danger of attack; therefore, the that, Minister's objection to the construction of the cruiser in Australia is without foundation. Knowing the ideas of the Australian people regarding the best method of preparing for the defence of our continent, and having regard to the vast extent of unemployment in our midst, it is wrong to expend £2,000,000. on the other side of the world. I shall, therefore, vote for the amendment.",36
100,Mr WHITSITT,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Darwin) [ 6 . 2 ] - It is a lamentable state' of affairs if Australia is not capable of building vessels for its own defence. Having regard to the adverse exchange conditions, we should not send our money abroad to give employment to people in other countries when we are able to do the job for ourselves. I do not know of any nation that became great by relying solely upon primary production. Having established, by law, a method of fixing wages, and having determined to maintain a certain standard of living, we must take those conditions into consideration in connection with the supply of all our requirements.  us?",38
101,Mr WHITSITT,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"That policy will make a nation of Australia. If we do not uphold those conditions, and while upholding them endeavour to produce all our own requirements, we shall be for all time hewers of wood and drawers of water. I am in a quandary regarding this bill . If I were sure that the Australian workmen would give the Commonwealth a fair deal, I should be prepared to give them an opportunity to build these cruisers. I have not the slightest doubt that if the Australian would put as much energy into his work as he puts into his sport, he would be unequalled in any part of the world. I should like to give our artisans a chance, and, therefore, I am not disposed to agree to the Government having two cruisers constructed outside Australia.",38

108,Unknown,NAVAL AND MILITARY,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,40
109,Mr LAMBERT,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"I enter my emphatic protest against the Government's proposal to build the cruisers outside of Australia. There are in this country at least. 60^000 unemployed skilled artisans and' labouring men, and to give them employment this supposedly Australian Government should have one, if not two, cruisers constructed here. The expenditure of £5,000,000 in Australia would not only provide work for our unemployed, but would alsogive an impetus to business, and, by the circulation of the money spent on them, benefit our primary and secondary industries. TheLabourparty stands for the . manufacture in Australia of everything that can be effectively manufactured here. The Cockatoo Island Dockyard and the Walsh Island Dockyard are both capable of building 10,000-ton cruisers. It has been admitted by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley) that one of the cruisers is already on the slips in B r it a in . If that is so, then the order for its construction has been placed with the B ritish Admiralty Avithouit the consent of Parliament. The Government should explain to this House its action in placing abroad theorder for one. cruiser without first obtaining the consent of this Parliament. The Government has stated, as a reason for building the cruiser abroad, that it will be built more cheaply in England than in Australia. Following that argument to its logical conclusion, why not purchase these vessels from one of the low-wage Eastern countries, such as China or Japau ? On the same argument, the Government should purchase abroad all articles that could not be. obtained as cheaply in Australia. But charity begins at home, and, therefore, we should provide work for our unemployed. A cruiser, if constructed abroad, will cost £2,500,000. Why not keep this money in Australia by giving the work to our own people ? As stated the other day by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton),. there are in Australia a lot of "" little Australians"" and a lot of "" big Englanders."" In England, even those accused of being "" little Englanders,"" would not dream of sending work out of their own country. As an Australian, I stand for the building up not only of our shipbuilding industry, but also of our secondary and primary industries, so that all our requirements can be manuf actured in Australia. I protest emphatically against the betrayal of the Australian people by this Government in sending work out of this country. Question put. The House divided.

Trade and Customs) [8.32] - I m o v e That the bill be now read a second time. The object of this measure is to provide a bounty of 10s. per head on a ll live cattle exported for slaughter during the financial year 1924-25. The bounty will be paid to the pastoralist owner of the cattle, or to any person, who satisfies the Customs Department that the price paid by him to the pastoralist owner includes the bounty. The bill is practically identical with the legislation which was passed in 1922 and 1923, the only exception being that it does not provide for a bounty on the frozen or canned beef which is exported. Representations were made to the Government by pastoralist associations, including the Australian Meat Council, for a renewal this year of the bounty on exported frozen beef. Careful consideration was given to the request, but a close examination of the position showed that the meat works in Queensland, which provided nearly 90 per cent, of the export beef, paid to the cattle grower this year without a bounty more than was paid last year with the bounty added. Only today there arrived from Queensland one of the officers of the department, who has been able to supply me with a comparison of the prices which were received by the growers last year with those received this year. In 1923 in Northern Queensland the price of beef, including the bounty, was 16s. 4d. per 100 lb. for good average quality. This year the price is 17s. without any bounty - For fair average quality beef the price in Northern Queensland last year, including the bounty, was to 13s. 4d. per 100 lb.

In Southern Queensland last year good Goaverage quality beef brought 18s. 6d., and fair average quality beef, 14s. per 100 l b . , including the bounty, whereas the current prices this year are from 22s. to 24s. per 100 lb. for good average quality beef, and from 17s. to 19s. for the same weight of fair average quality beef. The prices for this year do not include the bounty. high as 20s. per 100 lb. has' been paid forethis year for priine beef in Northern Queensland, and as much as 26s. in PRATTEN , and Southern Queensland. Mr M . CAMERON - Is that price on the hoof?  100 lb. unit of beef. The only meat works in Western Australia which prepares beef for export is at Wyndham. Last year £ 3 3s. per head was paid in addition to the Commonwealth bounty of 7s. 9d., making a total return to the pastoralist of £ 3 10s. 9d. per head for cattle delivered at the meat works. This year about three-quarters of the Wyndham output has been sold to Belgium, and the balance is being placed in Great Britain . The price to the cattle-grower will be approximately £ 3 l is . per head- a slight increase on the amount paid last year, which included the bounty. Before granting the subsidy in 1922, the Government insisted on a reduction in oversea freights of Jd. per lb., and a reduction in meat works treatment of Jd. per l b . , as well as a reduction in wages in 1922 to the extent of the reduced cost of living, namely, 12s. per week. In 1923 further reductions were insisted upon by the Government-Jd . per lb. in freight, and a similar reduction in the meat works treatment. No reduction in wages was made or suggested. The action of the Government reduced the oversea freight to London from Queensland to I d . per l b . , as against l f d . before the bounty was given in 1922. London prices for frozen beef have advanced. The output of the two establishments in Queensland have been sold at 3Jd. per lb . c.i.f., or about | d . per lb. better than the price prevailing a few months ago. Three fourths of the Wyndham output has been sold to Belgium at 3 29-32d. per lb. c.i.f. Freight on frozen beef from Wyndham is about l j d . per lb . as .against I d . per l b . from Queensland. The higher freight is charged from Wyndham because vessels have to make special trips to that port for frozen meat, very little cargo of any other kind being available.. The Government has considered this aspect of the matter, but has been prevented by the Constitution from extending any special treatment to Western Australia alone. It is suggested that the Australian Meat Council should endeavour to arrange for a reduction of freight from Wyndham. With regard to the bounty on the export of live cattle,, the Government, after careful consideration of the position and an examination of the Tariff Board's report on the matter, is satisfied that there is an opening for the establishment of a satisfactory trade in the export of live cattle, and is anxious to safeguard and increase this trade. It has, therefore', approved of the payment of the bounty of 10s. per head to be continued this year on the terms that have operated during the last two years The exportation of live cattle for slaughter during 1922, 1923, and 1924 was as follows:- 1902. 102S. 1924. head head Manilla 6,000 4,523 J tralia.

This, with the bounty of 10s., will, give the grazier £4 10s.",42

The remaining 2,656 head are to be supplied at £4 10s. per head f.o.b., Darwin, in completion of a contract made last year. This, with bounty, will return £5 per head. Efforts are being, made .to. secure contracts for the exportation of cattle to Java, which country, until about three weeks, ago, prohibited the importation of Australian cattle, because of the recent outbreak of rinderpest in Western Australia. The number that will be sent toJava is uncertain,, but if expectations are realized, from 3,000 to 4,00.0 head will he shipped.. About 50 head may be sent to Singapore. Thirty years ago that port was a. good outlet for Australian cattle. The shipping service is satisfactory, but until a proper landing stage is erected at Singapore, the trade in live cattle cannot be carried on successfully. The Commonwealth Government, on the advice of the Department of Home and Territories, is now urging the authorities at Singapore to provide proper landing facilities for cattle. Recently the Australian Investment Agency Company Limited shipped 100 head of cattle to Hong Kong from Darwin. The vessel was detained at Manila for over twelve days. . Five head died, and the remainder are expected to reach Hong Kong in a wasted condition owing to the long voyage. If direct shipping can be obtained, the company proposes to send a further 100 head to Hong Kong, with a view to opening up No exports so far, owing to a regular trade with that port in live prohibition against. Aus- cattle^ Should contracts be signed and sufficient shipping be obtained, the total the shipping of cattle from Australia export of live cattle, during the period? the bounty operates will not exceed 15j00O head. Unless two steamers per month are available from Darwin, the total export from that port to the end of June next will not exceed 5,000 head, the remainder of the 15,000 will have to come from the north-western portion of . Western Australia. The present Eight outlook is for one steamer a month only. Assuming that 15,000 head of cattle are exported, the total bounty will amount to £7,500. This will help to develop the export trade in cattle, and will, in addition, give great relief to cattle owners in the Northern Territory and the north-west of Australia. Vestey's meat works at Darwin are not expected to resume operations until 1925 ;, consequently, there is now no outlet for a large proportion of the Northern Territory cattle except export. It is estimated that there are at present at least 30,000. head of fat cattle ready to ba sold in the Territory and Western Australia , so that even the export of. 15,000 head will still leave a large number on the hands of pastoralists. In 1922, for frozen beef and cattle exported, £123,160 was expended in bounty, and £141,300 in 1923. The respective amounts for live cattle were £4,522 and £3,633. If the trade during the current year can be - doubled at a eost to the Commonwealth of £7,000 or £8,000, the expenditure will be full y justified. The bounty w i doubtedly help Australia to gain a position for her live cattle in outside markets that could not otherwise be attained. Debate (on motion by Mr ANSTEY ) adjourned.

122,Mr ATKINSON,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Wilmot-Vice-Presi dent of the Executive Council) [S.50] I moveTliat the bill be now read a second time. This is a small but important measure. As honourable members will recollect, those meteorological telegrams which were so useful to our people in the outback portions of Australia, in that they gave warning of approaching floods, have been .seriously restricted during recent years. It is felt that the restriction should now be removed, and the b i ll proposes to remove it . Prior to federation, meteorological telegrams were transmitted in the several states free of charge and without restriction as to length or number. The state observatories received reports for their weather charts free of cost, and, in addition, the postal departments themselves prepared comprehensive weather bulletins - daily, furnishing details of the rainfal l and prevailing weather conditions. The telegraphic interchange of daily weather and river height reports between country centres was also inaugurated by the state postal departments prior to federation. The Postal Act of 1902, passed prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth Meteorological Bureau, specifically provided for the free transmission of . telegrams on behalf of the meteorological departments of the states "" u n t i l the establishment of a Commonwealth Meteorological Bureau."" That bureau was established in January, 1907, but the - question of charging for the transmission of meteorological telegrams remained in abeyance until January, 1920. On the 13th January of that year a conference of the permanent-heads of the Home and Territories, Postal, Treasury, aj>d Navy Departments decided that the principle of payment should be acknowledged. In pursuance of the recommendations of that conference, charges have been made since the lst July, 1920, at the same rates as l l unare charged to the publio for private messages. Since the inauguration of the practice of charging for meteorological telegrams, the following payments have been made by the Meteorological Bureau to the Postal Department. For purposes of comparison, the cost of all other meteorological services for the years menBILL. Year.

This telegraphic service was seriously interfered with owing to the limitation of funds and the increases in telegraphic rates. The result was that in July, 1922., it became necessary to make a drastic curtailment in the telegraphic advices and reports sent from the bureau to country centres and exchanged between the centres. Under the rearrangement, it was necessary to discontinue the transmission of weather telegrams except in the most important cases. Efficiency was sacrificed owing to the necessity to keep expenditure within the vote. In consequence, at the present time, fewer weather telegrams are transmitted through the various states than in pre-federation days - The approximate number of meteorological telegrams now being transmitted annually throughout"" the Commonwealth is-Wester n Australia, 109,000; South Australia, 60,000; Queensland 80,000; New South Wales, 134^000; Victoria., 80,000; Tasmania, 27,000; lighthouses, 18,500; totaJ, 508,500. It is impossible to state accurately the number of telegramstraaismitted prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth Meteorological 'Bureau i but it is known that the number was very much greater than .at present. - Honourable members will recollect that . in 1922, when the restriction of tele. grams became apparent, there was a - storm of protest in this House.",44
123,Mr FOSTER,NAVAL AND MILITARY,And a greater storm amongst the people outside.,45
124,Mr ATKINSON,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Protest s were made by the general publio, and a. large number of honourable members severely criticised the restriction. It is considered by the Government that existing telegraphic facilities should be available for the free dissemination of information regarding the weather, for the benefit of the community. The charges at present made do not result in any benefit to the Commonwealth, as the revenue credited to the Postal Department is offset by a corresponding debit against the Meteorological Bureau. A considerable amount of clerical work is involved in the preparation and checking of accounts. no time in Australian history was the meteorological service more needed than today, when every possible saving is of paramount importance to the maintenance of national prosperity, and to prevent losses in stock, produce, and other property. The community has realized that meteorological science, aided by telegraphic facilities, can and should protect it from such avoidable losses; and the weather bureau is therefore called upon to render many services of immediate practical use to the public, and more especially to those conducting the industries of the country.",45
125,Mr FOSTER,NAVAL AND MILITARY,Thos e services are absolutely essential to shipping.,45
126,Mr ATKINSON,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"That is an additional argument in their favotir. primary producers are the chief people in the community interested in the weather prospects; and while means of advising them at the earliest possible moment of the probable weather remain restricted, the chief object of the efforts of the Meteorological Bureau is defeated. The present restriction of the service is due to fictitious financial considerations. limitation of the vote'does not represent a saving to the Commonwealth, but while there is a vote there must be some limit . It is considered that the best means of ""removing restrictions based on financial - considerations is to abolish all charges for meteorological telegrams, and to provide ' by legislation for their free transmission. While we have a vote on the Estimates, the sending of the telegrams has to stop when the vote has been exhausted. That is the cause of the restriction of the telegrams. The best way of removing the restrictions is to abolish all charges on the telegrams.",45
127,Mr CUNNINGHAM,NAVAL AND MILITARY,"Gwydir) [9.20]. - This bill has long been overdue. Members on this side protested very strongly when the Government restricted the sending of these telegrams. The Government of that day put up the excuse that it could not afford to give these very necessary services to the public, although the revenues of both the Postal Department and of the Commonwealth were booming. The reform proposed in the bill should have been made years ago, and eould have been made with very great advantage, particularly to those who live in the back country. I do not agree with the statement of At the Minister that the alteration should be considered in terms of £ a. d., nor do I think that we should enter into a controversy about whether the state or the Commonwealth should pay. Whichever pays, the same people will find the money. The Commonwealth taxes the stock-owners of the back country, who are directly interested in the matter. The Minister suggested that the Commonwealth would be acting the part of a martyr by providing these services free. If 500,000 telegrams are sent free, the people pay, no matter what they cost. It is ridiculous to introduce a complicated system of bookkeeping between one government department and another. I hope that the Government will carry the proposal further. When the matter was dealt with previously, a large number of stations was abolished, The and the number of telegrams interchanged between stations was considerably leduced. Thus the practical efficiency of the system was curtailed. I suggest to the Minister that he should make - inquiries of the municipal authorities, graziers' associations, and other public bodies interested, with a view to ascertaining what information they desire The to receive, and where they desire to receive it . I have in mind, particularly, the people in what is called the "" watercourse country,"" where it is essential, day by day, that the river gaugings higher up the river should be posted at the various post-offices. If these gaugings are not reported promptly, it is possible for people to be hemmed in with their stock. The Gwydir river when it leaves Moree has no banks, and it may spread out to 20 miles wide in flood time, although themselves. there may be no rainfall in the flooded country. It is of no use to supply the people in that district with free telegrams if they do not get the required information. If the Minister consults the records in his department, he will find that when of the bill saysthe matter was last before Parliament a large number of telegrams exchanged beamended tween station and station were disconfollowing Part:tinued. I do not refer to telegrams between, say, Sydney and Moree, but between Boggabilla, Boomi and Moree, Munfrom gindi and Moree, and Meroe and Moree. stations-Free.

The purpose of this bill is to improve the procedure relating to election petitions in the Northern Territory. It will be remembered that some time ago, representation in this House was given to the Territory. When the election took place in 1922, some undesirable features presented themselves. The Government thinks that under the provisions of the bill these disabilities may be remedied. vides for the amendment of the Northern Territory Representation Aot, which is confined to the hearing of petitions ing Northern Territory elections. the existing law of procedure, must be lodged with and heard by the High Court at the capital of one of the states. This may at some time lead to very serious inconvenience and expense to petitioners and respondents, and probably to the Commonwealth itself, inasmuch as it may become necessary to subpoena witnesses to appear at Brisbane, Melbourne, or some other capital city. It may also occasion great delay, preclude a petitioner from lodging his petition within the prescribed The bill is designed to overcome these difficulties and disadvantages vision of new clause 8A., sub-clause 1 of which provides that a petition an election may be lodged with the registrar of the Supreme Court at Darwin. Sub-clause 2 provides that the registrar - shall telegraph the petition to the principal registrar of the High Court, and cert if y that it has been duly signed and witnessed, and that the requisite has been lodged. Sub-clause 3 provides that the High Court, upon the application by the party to the tion, .shall have jurisdiction to hear the petition or to refer it to the Supreme Court of the Northern ritory, and to take such other, action as it may deem necessary in the circumstances. Clause 4 provides that if the High Court - decides to hear a case, it may proceed to do so on the telegraphed petition, but if it decides that the matter can properly be dealt with by the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, that Court is given jurisdiction to hear and decide the petition on a telegraphic received from the High Court. clause 7 of the said new clause 8A makes provision for an appeal the Supreme Court of the Territory to the High Court on a matter of law or mixed law and fact, but not of fact alone. Following the Northern Territory election in 1922, a petition was lodged, by telegram, the principal registrar of the High Court, Melbourne.

133,Mr OKEEFE,REPRESENTATION,"Denison) [9.31] - Ee cently, on two occasions, I raised the question of the advisability of a special classicommunication fication officer being sent to Tasmania in Sub- connection - with the reclassification of the Public Service. I wish again to press from the importance of this matter on the M in Northern ister representing the Postmaster-General. I have just returned from Tasmania, and I find that 70 or 80 per cent, upon of the officers affected by the reclassification are dissatisfied with it . The rewith plies to my questions on the matter make me think that a special classification officer is not to be sent to Tasmania. The Service in Tasmania was led to believe by the Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson), prior to his departure for the other side of the world, that an officer would be sent. l t is in the interests of the Post and Telegraph Department that this 0 should be done. I understand that a similar request has come from officers of the department in other states. An investigation of the duties of officers by a special officer would materially assist in arriving at a decision satisfactory to the large number of officers affected by the classification, and especially those in the mail branch of the Post and Telegraph Department. To grant the request would be only following the precedent established in connection with the Trade and Customs Department. Prior to the reclassification, two special officers, one Mr Barkly, the Collector of Customs in New South Wales, who we know is an expert, and the other, Mr Kraegen, of the Public Service Board's office, were sent to every port in Australia, and investigated the duties of every officer of Trade and Customs Department employed at those ports, and with very satisfactory results, not only to the officials concerned, but also to the department. It might be considered impossible to investigate in the same way the duties of every officer of the Post' and Telegraph Department, but such an investigation might be made especially about those employed in the mail branch. Appeals against the reclassification have been received from more than half the officers affected,, and I am satisfied that it would be in the best interests of the department if , before the appeals are heard by the board constituted for the purpose, a special investigation officer were sent to assess the value of the work done by the different, persons employed in the department.",47

135,Mr ATKINSON,REPRESENTATION,"I shall urge upon the Acting Postmaster-General to consider the honourable member's request, and obtain an answer to. his remarks as soon as possible. There is another matter about which I wish to say a word. Recently in this chamber the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) has re - ; re- ferred to matters arising in the Territory. I promised to bring his remarks under the notice of the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce), and see what he had to say about them. I have received the. following reply from Senator Pearce which, I think,, the House ought to hear. The right honourable gentleman writes:_With reference to the speech made by MrNelson, M.P., in the House of Representativeson the 16th instant, concerning the payment by the Government of certain, costs ordered by the Supreme Court against Mr C. Bthe Story, Government Secretary, in connection with the recent Darwin hospital case, I now have to inform you that advice has been received from the Administrator of the Northern Territory that the costs, amounting to £ IT 10s., in this case, were paid out of revenue, with his approval, as the Government Secretary was regarded merely as ai nominal defendant for the Northern' Territory Administration, and was in no way personally concerned with the action. I wish to draw your attention to the misleading nature of Mr Nelson's remarks concerning the payment of these costs. Theimpression conveyed is that .the costs paid were those incurred in the assault case of Story v. Quelch. It is true that the hospital is mentioned, but the reference is interpolated between remarks relating to the Story-Queleh case. I also, invite attention to the repetition of Mr Nelson's statement in the House on the 24th July of the alleged attempt of the Government Secretary to ""pack the bench,"" despite the fact that Mr Nelson was definitely mr formed in. the House on the 10th July,' in reply to questions by him, that no such ""comment bad been made by the judge, and that the expression used was "" p i c k "" and not pack."" Tlieconstruction to be placed on the words is vastly different. Moreover, no have been made 'by the judge offithe recially in regard to this matter. In reply to the other matters mentioned by I Mr Nelson in the House on the 24th instant, I desire to make the following comments.:1.. Unemployment in the NorthernTerritory. - Mr Nelson complains that tie unemployproblem is being dealt, with by the issue of rations to able-bodied men. As a matter of fact the Government is, doing, its' utmost to avoid the issue of rations; except in cases of old-age or infirmity. During .the year 1023-24 the Commonwealth expended the folamounts in. the alleviation, of distress-: f works, £5,652: rations, £3,585; other expenditure, £657; total, £9,894. The Government did not confine its efforts to the mere .provision of relief. It instituted a system of assistance to persons engaged in all forms of primary production. Expenditure in this direction during the financial year 1923-24 was £4.200. Every facility within the l i m it of funds available has been afforded able-bodied men who desired to establish themselves, if even in a small way, in the pastoral, agricultural, or mining industries. tinuance of this policy may be expected in the future, and it is hoped that the Administration will be in a position to offer even more attractive inducements as far as assistance to miners is concerned. Mr Nelson's allegations that the Administration is attempting to coerce coloured people into the acceptance of wages lower than the ruling rate, by a threat of discontinuing their supply of rations, has no foundation in fact. The principle has been laid down that no man who refuses an offer of work at current rates is to be retained on relief works or issued with rations. Explicit instructions have, however, been issued to the Administration that no man is to be penalized for declining to acquiesce in an attempt by an employer to secure labour at a wage below the recognized rate of pay. No cases of infringement of this principle have been reported to the Minister. 2. Assistance to Mining. - Fro m the time the Commonwealth assumed control of the Territory until the 30th June, 1922, £250,000 was expended in encouraging the mining industry in the Territory. The assistance had been distributed in a. manner which, in otlier parts of Australia, was considered to be in the best interests of mining development, but the result, so far as the Territory was concerned, was of a negative nature. I therefore decided to confine future efforts to the development of the Maranboy tin-field, and to the assistance of a few legitimate miners still working on one or two claims. If , however, any development had taken place which indicated that it was the duty of the Government to spend more money, I would have had no hesitation in asking Parliament to provide it . In view of the recent improvement in the mineral markets, especially t in , it is thought that a number of miners will be now encouraged to engage in the industry. Provision is therefore being made for £2,500 on this year's Estimates to encourage mining development. foregoing facts it will be seen that it is through no fault of the Government that development in the mining industry has not taken place, and, further, that the Government has done all in its power to render assistance. 3. Dismissal of Nurses - The statement that I very conveniently took the least line of resistance by ""sacking"" both the matron and a nurse from the Darwin Hospital is not in accordance with fact. The action taken in terminating the services of these ladies was only decided upon after very careful consideration had been .given to all the facts. It might be mentioned that most of the charges and counter-charges made by the parties were quite of an unofficial nature, and could have been determined in a court of law by the parties concerned. Mr Atkinson. 4. Departure of Leper from Darwin - The Department is not aware that a person suffering from leprosy was allowed to come south from Darwin and get away to America. The only information in the department shows that in February last advice was received from the secretary of the New South Wales Health Department that a former resident of Darwin had arrived by the Montoro in order to consult A con- a specialist in regard to a skin eruption. After examination he was instructed to report himself to the Coast Hospital pending the issue of a warrant for his detention in the lazaret. The health authorities stated that, he failed to report himself, and that he might have returned to Darwin. Inquiries were immediately made by the Home and Territories Department as to whether he had returned to Darwin, or if the authorities there had any knowledge of his whereabouts. A reply was received to the effect that he had not returned there, but might be found at Rockhampton care of a. certain address. This information was passed on to the New South Wales and Queensland health authorities. Mr Nelson's statement concerning this matter is incorrect. I wish you to inform the House that I give the closest personal attention to these matters aa they arise, and I object strongly to Mr . Nelson's assumption to the contrary.",48
