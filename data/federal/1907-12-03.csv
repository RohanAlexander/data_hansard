1,Mr MCDOUGA LL,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. What was the total cost of the telephone line erected between Melbourne and Sydney? a. How much has it cost the Department to maintain and operate the said line to date; and what is the average weekly revenue earned by it? 3. Were the prospective subscribers in the cities mentioned asked for a guarantee before the work was undertaken?",14
2,Mr MAUGER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The answer* to trie honourable member's questions are as follow1. The total cost of the telegraph and telehone line (the line is used for both - purposes etween Melbourne and Sydney), was ^46,686. a. For maintenance,' £07 5s. 2d.; for operat' Si j£ 97 - 5<i.

Whether he issued instructions that the practice of working ""broken shifts"" in the Mail Branch of the C.P.O. was to be discontinued? 2. Is he aware that the practice of working .""broken shifts"" still continues and is a source of much dissatisfaction to the omcers affected thereby ? 3. Will extra pay be allowed to officers of the G.P.O-, Sydney, for overtime worked to keep pace with the extra rush and volume of business during the Christmas and New Year season ?",14
4,Mr MAUGER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow1. When in Sydney I received a deputation of omcers on the subject of "" broken shifts,"" and instructed the Deputy Postmaster-General thut the practice was to be discontinued as far as possible. I may add that that officer pointed out that in no post office was it possible, in connection with the mail branch, to so arrange work that there would be no broken time. 2. Yes, to a certain extent; but it is reported to be impracticable in view of the very irregular character of the work in the Mail Branch to altogether do away with broken time. 3. Extra pay for overtime in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Act and RePETITION. gulations will be allowed. TARIFF..

5,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Hume-Trea surer) [11.8],-Before we proceed to deal with this item, I wish to make a short statement in regard to item 252, concerning which I know there is some feeling that the duties proposed are not exactly what is desirable. Very strong representations having been made to me on the subject, I desire to infonn honourable members that when the item is reached, I shall propose that it be negatived so that the goods covered by it will f all into item 253, an'd be subjected to a lower duty. The specific duty was imposed on the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, but I find that, as it stands, it represents a very high percentage. I thought it well to give the Committee notice of what I intend to do. ' Item agreed to. Item 241. China, p.irian, and porcelain ware and mosaic flooring, ad. val. (General Tariff), 35 case. per cent.; (United Kingdom), 25 per cent.",14
6,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Parramatta) [11.9] - No china has yet been made in Australia, notwithstanding that there has been in operation for the last five or six years a duty of 20 per cent. Why then should the duties have been increased? Has the Treasurer proof that chinaware is being made in Australia?",15
7,Mr COON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,It can be made.,15
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Anythin g can be made in Australia at a figure. So far no one in Australia has entered upon the manufacture of china, although a 20 per cent, duty, with ' an importing cost equal to at least another 25 per cent., should J% a fair temptation to begin it. TJptil some effort is made to manufacture china in Australia we are, by the imposition of these duties, unnecessarily taxing those who wish to buy china. In the circumstances I am prepared to move that the duty should be 20 per cent., as under the old Tariff.",15
9,Mr TUCOR,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Twent y per cent, all round ?",15
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Yes ; because this is purely a revenue duty. If there is anything in the suggestion that there might be a preference in this case, the duties might be 20 per cent, and 15 per cent.",15
11,Mr FAIRBAIRN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Fawkner) [11.12]. - I think the duty proposed by the Government is a little high. China is not made here at all. I hope that some day clay suitable for its manufacture will be discovered' in Australia; but, so far as I know, no clay has been found here from which china could be made.",15
12,Mr LIVINGSTON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,We can get all kinds of clay in Australia.,15
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"We have suitable clay, but the manufacture of china has not vet been begun.",15
14,Mr FAIRBAIRN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"In deciding what the duties on these articles should be should not be forgotten that the cost of freight, including breakages, amounts to anything from 50 to 100 per cent. Anchinaware, other point of importance is that even the experts have great difficulty in discriminatin ing between china and earthenware. Under the old Victorian Tariff they were dutiable at different rates, but that was-found to unworkable, and they had to be classed together. As honourable members are, no doubt, aware, we can command the earthenware trade with local manufactures. In all the circumstances I think that duties of 25 and 20 per cent, would meet the",15
15,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Hume-Trea surer) [11.15] - I admit that the duties proposed on this item seem somewhat high. The one intention, of course, is to encourage the manufacture of china in Australia, and, in my opinion, it is scandalous that it has not yet been made here. The officers of the Department are very anxious that the duties on items 241 ancl 243 should be the same; but in. connection with some of the articles included in item 243 I do not care to reduce the items to as low a rate as the honourable member for Fawkner suggests.",15
16,Mr TUDOR,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"We might separate earthenwareand stoneware from the other, items, and impose a higher duty on them.",15
17,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Mak e the duties 25 and 20 per cent, all - round.",15
18,Sir JOHN QUICK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Once the Minister makes concessions the whole thing will tumble down.,15
19,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,We cannot discuss item 243 at present; but it includes some items on which the duties suggested would not be sufficiently high. It may be necessary to take some articles out of that item and deal with them separately. On this particular item I accept the suggestion 'that the duties should be 25 and 20 per cent.,15
20,Mr KNOX,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Kooyong) [xt. 17] - China, parian, and porcelain ware are not made in Australia, and it is not likely that they ever will be made here. But I wish to point out that mosaic flooring must be regarded as in quite a different category. With the approval of the Minister I should like to see mosaic flooring removed to item 244.",15
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I have no obiec-' tion; I was going to propose that myself.  Treasurer has not given what I regard as it a sound reason for agreeing to the pro1 posed reduction-of these duties. I have before me a circular fro m a firm dealing in in which the statement is made that not a single piece of chinaware is made Australia. I claim the vote of the honourable member for South Sydney on this item, because the honourable member has be time and again assured the Committee that he is opposed to revenue duties, and this is neither more nor less than a revenue duty. I shall not detain the Committee. I move That after the words "" 35 per cent."" -"" 25 per cent."" the words "" and on and 4th December, 1907, f r e e "" be inserted.",15
22,Sir JOHN QUICK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY," I am inclined to think that it would be well to reduce the duties on this item 25 per cent, and 20 per cent., but I should not like honourable members to run away with the impression that it is not likely that china will never be produced in Ausages tralia. To suggest such a thing would be to do an injustice to a budding industry South Australia, which, I hope and believe, has a very good future before it , although its present prospects are not very bright. Mr Joseph Provis, mining engineer and chemist, and general manager of the Kan> garoo Island Chinastone and Clay Comis .pany, informed the Tariff Commission that they had discovered vast deposits china clay, composed of the finest felspar and silica, and offering reasonable condicent  asked with reference to this item, ""China, parian and porcelain ware, and mosaic flooring, ad valorem 20 per cent.,"" and gave the following evidence56299. What have you to say about that?would like to see an increased duty of 10 cent, on that. 56300. Raising it to 30 per cent. ?-Yes would make it 30. 56301. What articles would be included that?-That would include the whole porcelain ware, and the whole of the mosaic flooring. A large quantity of that is introduced into this country, and we can manufacture here. Samples which I have seen manufactured in the State are equally as good as the imported article. We have the materials here and the ability for doing it ; and the work, as far as I have seen it , and as far as I am a judge of these things, is equally as good as the best imported article. 56302. What does china include?-That would be cbina cups and saucers, dinner sets, and tea set ware, and vases, and so on. While my colleagues and myself were convinced that these fine deposits existed there, we recognised that they were in a crude state of development, - and that it would take a large amount of capital' and skilled labour to bring them up' to working, pitch. In the meantime we do not feel justified in recommending a high duty, which might for years operate as a revenue duty, but we think that in time those important deposits will come into' prominence. them now to bring them under the attention of the House, and of the country, .in the hope that capitalists and others will give a little attention to the in. Probably in a few years it will be quite justifiable nnd to impose the duty now proposed by the after Minister, but at present I see no reason for imposing a duty which will operate [11.19]. only as a revenue duty.",16
23,Mr BOWDEN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Nepean) [11.22] - The to transport expenses are very heavy in the case of these articles, owing to the great bulk of the packages, the care necessary to be taken in the packing, and the breakthat are constantly taking place. All those considerations pile up the cost trein mendously, especially of the finer class of china and porcelain. At the very lowest, the freight and breakage expenses must be put at from 33^ to 50 per cent. 33^ per cent, is the allowance made for freight and breakage in the Doulton. warehouse - That for good quality material, which, of coyrse would be very liable to fracture. of The cheaper and heavier stuff is not so liable to be broken. That cost of 33J per is in itself a very heavy protection for was the local manufacture, if it can be undertaken, but there is practically nothing being made here at present of the higher class of these articles, although a little of the delf ware is being made. This is, therefore, a purely revenue duty, and. rates I of 15 and 20 per cent, are quite sufficient. per We do not want to keep the higher class of , that china and porcelain out of the homes of the poorer people. If the honourable memin ber for Parramatta persists in his amend of the ment, I will support him.",16
24,Mr COON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Batman) [11.25] - Honor able members have said, that cups such as the one which I hold in my hand are not made here. They are not likely to be made here when a cup like this, made of chinaware, can be bought today retail at is"". 66. per doz. in Melbourne.",16
25,Mr FAIRBAIRN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,It is earthenware.,16
26,Mr COON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"It is chinaware, and costs only i j d . per cup retail.",16
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"It is earthenware, an'd not china.",16
28,Mr COON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The honourable member is wrong for the. second time. It is china, and was sold to me as such. It is marked china. How is it possible to establish an industry here when the imported article is sold at so low a price? I do not know why the Minister has agreed to reduce the duty so much. If that is done it will be I mention impossible to establish the industry. The honourable member for Nepean spoke of the cost of the freight, but the freight from Germany to Australia is only 5s. for 36 cubic feet.",16
29,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Not so.,17
30,Mr COON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Then I will refer the hongood orable member to the Blue Book containing a report presented to the. House of Commember mons on the decline of trade between Great Britain and Australia. The reason given to the Commission who investigated that question was that goods were being shipped from Germany to Sydney at that low protection. freightage.,17
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"That statement is not more ridiculous than many of the stateTariff, ments made here every day.",17
32,Mr COON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,It is a statement made a Commission of the House of Commons o the Mother Country that the honourable occasion member talks so much about..,17
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,It is only a stateproduced ment.,17
34,Mr COON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,It is also true. The ister has announced his intention to accept duties of 25 and 20 per cent.,17
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I am (proposing those rates because I am informed that to distinguish. the article is not made here.,17
36,Mr COON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"It is impossible it here without a protective duty. The cup which I exhibited was not made here. I Speaker's gallery. never said that it was. It is an imported cup, but I bought it in Melbourne. They cannot be made here when they are sent out at a wholesale price of is . 4d. per dozen. They could be made in Sydney and at Brunswick, but it is necessary first to imber. pose a protective duty.",17
37,Mr LIVINGSTON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Barker) [11.28]. - - If any business can stand a little tion, this one might, as it is well known that in Australia we can obtain any kind clay that js to be found on the face of earth. It is only a question of getting experts to deal with it. If we give the dustry a little protection, we shall get experts. The other day when I went into a shop to buy a small article, I said by the Committee. "" This is not up to the proper standard. It is imported."" The man. replied "" I want anything good you have to import You have not got in Australia the experts - to deal with this class of.work."" I asked, "" Do you mean that we have nothing good in Australia""? And he replied, "" Y o cannot make anything good in Australia cept the people, and tfiey are all good."" I urge the Committee to give this little protection, because it will not hurt the poor people. The duty proposed prejudicially affect poor or working people, who use very little china, and, in fact, do 'not want it . The sample cup produced by the honourable member for Batman is quite enough for all practical purposes; and I am just reminded by the honourable for Fremantle that there was a time when most of us were glad to get a pannikin. A duty on china will be borne by the rich; and I hope that the Minister will not back down, but will afford proper",17
38,Mr STORRER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Bass) [11.31] - When speaking in the general discussion on the I referred to the difficulty there is in distinguishing between china and earthento ware, and the events of this morning have f shown that the statements I made on that were perfectly correct. Several honourable members have asserted that the cup by the honourable member for Batman is not china, but it has been proMinnounced by an expert in the House to be china. This only shows how the public may be imposed on, and how extremely difficult it must be for the Customs officers",17
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,What expert says to make that this cup is china ?,17
40,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,A gentleman in the,17
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Then that gentleman, if he be an expert, knows better.",17
42,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,No doubt the gentleman knows better than does the honourable mem,17
43,Mr STORRER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I will take the woid of the expert before that of any honourable taxamember in the House. I myself thought the cup was not china, until it was prq^ of nounced to be so. We ought to impose a the duty on those commodities we desire to the have produced here; and there is nothing to inprevent china being made in Australia ""in the the future. I hope that the compromise accepted by the Treasurer will be endorsed 'Mr Webster (Gwydir) [11.33] - If you cannot understand the frame of mind of it. honourable members this morning. The Treasurer has indicated that fee is prepared lo accept the suggested compromise; and yet honourable members continue the discusu sion on the item. I suggest that we get exon as quickly as possible with the business, instead of "" flogging a dead horse."" Legitimate discussion on some items is absolutely necessary, but the present waste of would not time is unjustifiable.",17
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Parramatta) next [11.34] - Notwithstandin g the opinion of the expert in the gallery, who ought to know better if he does not, the cup duced is no more china than I am a Dutchincluded man. I happen to know a little of this subject, seeing that I spent my early days in the "" potteries "" of the Old Country.",18
45,Mr SALMON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The honourable member - expressed the opinion before he had seen the cup.,18
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Quite so; I know perfectly well that a china cup, from any part of the world, cannot be bought i j d . I suppose, however, that honourable members opposite will say that this is case of dumping. I desire to emphasize my determination! not to vote for any venue duty of 25 per cent. Let those believe - they can make china in Australia get to work. Personally I see no reason the why china should not be made here, but otherindustry the fact remains that the industry has .never been begun. In the meantime, there is a duty of 20 per cent., plus a protection, consisting of the charges of importation, of at least 50 per cent. I per cent, is not sufficient inducement people to undertake the manufacture, there must be some other reason why the incompany dustry has never been started. Amendment negatived.

48,Mr FRAZER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Kalgoorlie) [11.42] - I trust that the Treasurer will consent to the insertion after the word ""crucibles"" which, of the words "" scorifiers and muffles,"" - being with a view to eliminating them from the item. These articles were previously upon the free list, and the roasting dishes, assay furnaces, and cupels which are used proin association with them are at present in that categoty under item 248. Those who have'any knowledge of assaying work know that the heat'which has to be generated in assaying furnaces, and to which these crucibles are subjected, is terrific. As a matter of fact, the best crucibles cannot be used often, and many of them not more, than once. In laboratory work it is of the highest importance for that the assayer shall have absolute confidence in his materials, because, in the a event of his crucible giving way in the furnace, the whole of the assay is lost. reIt has been stated that in South Australia who three men are employed in making these cruciblies. ' I \gather ifflom the evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission that State/ has not been started in any",18
49,Sir JOHN QUICK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The best crucibles in natural the world are made in Victoria.,18
50,Mr FRAZER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I will read for the f 70 honourable member's information his own to report upon this matter. He saysIn Adelaide the manager of the local pottery asked for a duty of 25 - per cent, on crucibles, muffles, scorifiers, & c , imported from England, and a higher duty when imported from foreign countries, particularly japan, COOK) where labour is so cheap. These articles are at present free of duty. The company has been carrying on business for six years, merely struggling to live. Unless the industry receives some inprotection, they_ were much afraidthat they would have to ""give into the competition of goods. His company has been benefiting the mining companies, whichwere the chief customers, as the prices of imported crucibles would have been higher but for local competition. . . . The company would employ from twelve to fifteen hands if they had the duty asked for, but at present -(November, 1905), employed only three - The business had been started prior to Federation without a duty, but never prospered. Plumbago - crucibles were preferred to those made from fire clay, but the they were very much more expensive. If the crucible of local production were "" and equally suitable for the purpose for which such articles are used, is it likely that assayers would prefer to use a very much more expensive crucible? In this connection, I desire to quote the opinion of a mining man who says^On account of crucibles being of bulky nature, and freight charged by measurement, they cost from 30 per cent, to 40 per cent, to import, in itself is a substantial protection. Local crucibles vary in quality on account of the clay unsuitable, and being unreliable they are little used. Battersea (Morgan's) crucibles are .imported and used almost exclusively by the mines, the Government laboratories, mints, universities, schools of mines, chief mines, and assayers throughout the Commonwealth and New Zealand; and in Western Australia crucibles of German manufacture are largely used. These crucibles are also in general use throughout India, China, America, Germany, France, &c. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company and other leading mines specify in their tender sheets "" Battersea crucibles."" As there are only three men engaged in production of these crucibles, I contend that we are not justified in scientific research by imposing a duty of 35 per cent, upon them.",18
51,Mr GYLNN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Angas) [11.50] - I agree with the honourable, member for Kalgoorlie that there ought to be a considerable duction in the duty on articles to which he has referred. According mation which I have obtained their local manufacture gives very little employment. of? Some clay crucibles have been manufactured in South Australia, but there are, it is only a few men employed at the works. is estimated that the increased employlocal ment which the duty would give at the Stafford manufactory-at Alberton, I - woul d range from a few hands to about twelve. The quality of the crucibles most important matter in mining, because experts state that they must be so made as to withstand extreme changes of temperature. It is most inexpedient, merely with a view to providing a little more employment, day. to impose a severe tax on one of the tific necessaries of a mining company. . have very apt information on. the subject. It is stated that the cost of importing clay crucibles and scorifiers is 40 per Therefore, there is a natural protection of 40 per cent, for the local product before a single penny of duty is imposed. thirty or forty years the best classes of English crucibles have been imported, have been used not only by mining ister. companies, but also by State Governments fbr their testing work. In the circumstances I hope that the Minister will consent to a substantial reduction in the duty upon them. My idea is that the in the general Tariff should be reduced from 35 to 15 per cent., and that British . imports should be made free.",19
52,Mr FRAZER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Why not free altogether?,19
53,Mr GLYNN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I do not think that there is any justification, for imposing a severe duty. If a suggestion is made to divide tain processes. up the articles embraced in theitem, a view to making some of them free and Others subject to a duty of 15 per cent., as recommended by the B section of the Tariff Commission, I will support it . . I do not like to attempt to make a classification, but if a proposal of that kind is made by the Minister , or by any honourable 1 member who has looked into the matter more closely than I have done, it will receive my support.",19
54,Mr COON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Batman)' [11.54] - I hope the that the Minister will not consent to take crucibles out of the next item, because penalizing they are being made here.",19
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I have not said that I would.,19
56,Mr COON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"If they are taken out of the item who will be penalized? It will repenalize, not the wealthy companies which have been spoken of, but thepoor miners to the inforwho have small plants.",19

59,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Unde r the old is a Tariff there was no duty on crucibles.,19
60,Mr COON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Because there was no duty on the article previously, that is no reason why there should not be a duty imposed toBecause Japan is not exporting to scienAustralia a number of things this year, I that is no reason for believing that she will not export them to us next year. In framing this Tariff we are making provision not cent. only for today, but also for the future.",19
61,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,But the honourable member said that the local manufacFor turers wanted the old duty retained.,19
62,Mr COON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I meant that they wanted and the duty retained, as proposed by the Min",19
63,Mr FOWLER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Perth) [11.55] - There is no doubt that in Australia a crucible is made in which probably the honourable duty member for Batman has smelted gold, but the difficulty, arises in connection with the refractory ores, which require a verygreat amount of heat. There are practically only a few places in the world that supply the materials necessary to make crucibles which will withstand the intense heat.to which they are subjected under cerThe ordinary crucible with spoken of by the honourable member for Batman will always find a local market for the simpler and more easily smelted metals. The. price of the others is so prohibitive that they are not used unless absolutely required. I trust that the Minister who has hit pretty hard industries longing to other States will for once be generous in this small matter, and concede to those who require to use imported crucibles the opportunity of obtaining them at the lowest possible rates.",19
64,Mr KNOX,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Kooyong) [11.57] - The honourable member for Perth has stated the facts. For highly scientific work is absolutely necessary to have these particular crucibles, which, so far as I am aware, are not made in Australia. derstand that the item before the Committee is item 242, but the discussion is really on the next item. I suggest to the Minister that crucibles, tubes, pressure filters, and evaporating dishes for laboratory use, should be made free, and that crucibles, scorifiers, and muffles, which are used for a reduction which does not require very great heat, should be dealt with separately in item 242. Certainly they should not be retained in item 243, which includes "" earthenware, brownware, and .stoneware, n.e.i."" on which, of course, a high duty will have to be imposed.",20
65,Mr FRAZER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Le t us put those articles under item 248 instead of under item 242.,20
66,Mr KNOX,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I do not care what item the Minister puts the articles under, but they certainly should be taken out of item 243. If my suggestion is not adopted our discussion of that item must be confused. ""Unquestionably the articles embraced in item 242 ought to be free.",20
67,Mr HUME COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,They are free now.,20
68,Mr KNOX,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Then what has all thetalk been about? Mr HUTCHISON . (Hindmarsh) [11.59] - I believe that the item before the Committee includes skittle pots. This description of crucible is used in glassbottle factories. I hold in my hand some invoices which have been given to me by a sound protectionist - manufacturer, who believes in getting everything he possibly can in Australia, but who cannot get here crucibles, which will do his work.",20
69,Mr STORRER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,All the articles mentioned in item 242 are free.,20
70,Mr HUTCHISON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I want to get Stoneware, these particular, crucibles made free. This manufacturer imported six skittle - pots, measuring 36 inches by 16 inches, and which cost 14s. each, or . in all, four guineas. By the time they had reached Port Adelaide, with the importing charges added, the cost had run up to £ 1 6 7s. 2d., without the duty of 30 per cent. This manufacturer, whose word can be relied beon absolutely, has stated that he was not likely to pay £ 1 6 7s. 2d. for six pots, which cost abroad only four guineas, if he could have obtained them in Australia. They are very unwieldy and awkward things to carry, and therefore the freight is very high. Again, he imported four skittle pots, which cost n s . each, or in it all 44s.

These crucibles are as much tools of trade which cannot be made here as are bottle moulds which can be made in Australia. But, strange to say, bottle moulds are allowed in free as tools of trade, whilst crucibles are taxed. I would rather see a duty placed on bottle moulds than on crucibles. I think it is clear that these goods would be made in Australia if practicable. Mf. KING O ' MALLEY (Darwm) [12.1] - I hope that the Treasurer will not surrender on the question. If we shut up the local factories the result will simply be that the importers will put up their prices. I ask the Treasurer not to give way to the supporters of foreign institutions at the expense of the institutions of their own country. It is strange to me how eagerly honourable members opposite will fight for the interests of the big men. They seem to believe in the survival of the fattest, not in the survival of the fittest. Crucibles better than any that can be made elsewhere are made in Australia.",20
71,Mr FOWLER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Canno t they be made better in America?,20
72,Mr KING OMALLEY,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I am fighting for Australia just now. When I have occasion to fight for America, I will do so just as strongly as I now fight in the interests of this country. At present the small tributers throughout Australia cannot get crucibles at reasonable prices. I again ask the Treasurer to stand firm, and help the local manufacturer to prevent the importers from raising their prices. Item agreed to. Item 243.

But I am informed that they can be made just as well in Australia as elsewhere. That statement has been made by the honourable member for Bendigo. I am also informed that crucibles are being made in Sydney and Melbourne which are better than those imported to Western Australia.",21
75,Mr GLYNN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Plumbag o crucibles are not made here.,21
76,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Why is there such a desire to have goods that can be made in Australia imported from abroad? There appears to be a wish to deprive Australian manufacturers of the opportunitv of competing in these directions. I can quite understand large companies in Western Australia, having business connexions entirely outside Australia-owne d largely in Germany and France-fightin g to be enabled to import their supplies from abroad. But I cannot understand an Australian assisting them.",21
77,Mr HEDGES,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Nam e one mine of that kind.,21

84,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I do not say that it is not.,21
85,Mr FOWLER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Will not the Minister think of the men who are working on the field?,21
86,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I am thinking of the men; but the honourable member is thinking of the wealthy owners,21
87,Mr FOWLER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The Minister would make Western Australia, a desert by means of these duties if he could.",21
88,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I would make it a pleasant country to live in- a better country than it is now-and not allow it to remain as it is, under the domination of outside influences which are to a large extent anti-Australian.",21
89,Mr FOWLER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,There are better Australians in Western Australia than some of those whom the Minister has round about him.,21
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I do not find them returned here. I am informed that these goods are made in Australia as good as it is possible to make them. Mr Glynn. - They are not.,21
91,Mr HEDGES,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Not plumbago crucibles.,21
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"My desire is to help the industries concerned as much as I can. The goods mentioned by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie have been included in this item for a special purpose They were formerly included in another item, but representations have been made from very large centres in the eastern parts of Australia that the goods are being made here. Furthermore, the Tariff Commission has recommended a duty as high as 30 Der cent. That - recommendation was made after evidence had been taken and weighed. I have been guided in: most of. these cases largely by the report of the A division of the Tariff Commission - But I am blamed for taking it as a guide.",21
93,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The Minister does not allow himself to be guided by it always.,21
94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"W it h very few exceptions, I d'o.",21
95,Mr FOWLER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,They frequently made recommendations irrespective of the evidence.,21
96,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I am not going to accuse them of doing such a thing. I dare say that the free-trade section of the Commission made just as many recommendations in favour of goods being placed on the free list in the absence of evidence to support such a proposal. If one section resorted to such tactics, no doubt the other section did so. Even if honourable members do not agree to the duty proposed, I think that a substantial duty should be carried. Surely we are not to put aside evidence that crucibles can be made in Australia. I have given way on a good many small items, but I hope that in this case honourable members will be prepared to give Australia a show.",21
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"There are three men involved'in this industry. Sit WILLIAM LYNE - I know of a place in New South Wales where far more men are employed. 1I have had a personal report in reference to it, and although I have not seen the works, I am told that they. turn out a good article, which is used in many of the mines in the eastern States. If the Committee decides against me, I cannot help it, but I shall certainly have a division.",21
98,Mr GLYNN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Angas) [12.12] - I am sorry to have to speak a second time, but since the Treasurer has asked why crucibles should be free, I think it necessary to mention that plumbago crucibles are not made in the Commonwealth. The necessary plumbago is not to be obtained here.",22
99,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,It is found in South Australia.,22
100,Mr GLYNN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Then why do they not .make plumbago crucibles there? manufacture of clay crucibles has been carried on on Kargaroo Island for the last five years, but the industry does not appear to increase very rapidly.",22
101,Mr BOWDEN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Are those the works at which only three men are employed?,22
102,Mr GLYNN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"No , according to a statement. I have seen they are employed at the Alberton works. I believe that there is a plant at Kangaroo Island. Clav crucibles may be used four or five times, but those made of plumbago can be used from thirty .to fifty, and in some cases a hundred times. The English crucibles that we import are used there in public departments like the Mint, and also in many of the States of Europe. In the circumstances, while wishing the local industry success, I feel that there is ample justification for the request that these articles should be on the free list",22
103,Mr FRAZER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Kalgoorlie) [12.14] - I resent the attitude adopted by the Treasurer, who nearly always insinuates that the stand taken up by an honourable member in regard to any item is due either to his having a personal interest in it, or to the influence of some one who is affected by it .",22
104,Mr GLYNN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,It is not to my interest to advocate the placing of crucibles on the free list; it is rather to the contrary.,22
105,Mr FRAZER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I daresay that that is the position of honourable members in manv cases; but the Treasurer insists upon making such assertions in matters relating to Western Australia.,22
106,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,And I am justified in making them.,22
107,Mr FRAZER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"That is an insult to honourable members, and, so far as I am concerned, it is a deliberate untruth.",22
108,The CHAIRMAN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,22
109,Mr FRAZER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I withdraw it, sir, and will say that the attitude of the Minister is a most disgusting one. He has been hurling insinuations all round the chamber.",22
110,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I have not.,22
111,Mr FOWLER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,He has said that representatives of Western Australia are anti-Australian.,22
112,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,That is not an insinuation; it is a fact.,22
113,Mr FRAZER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"It appears to me that the Treasurer is incapable of giving impartial consideration to arguments that are advanced in reference to any of these items. The As a matter of fact, although he has said that Australian-made crucibles are used in the eastern States, and that Western Australia alone asks for the imported article, I have just had handed to me a letter from the Victorian Chamber of Mines",22
114,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I do not pay much attention to its representations.,22
115,Mr FRAZER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"If a deputation from the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures waited on the Treasurer, he would take it into the Ministerial room so that he might obtain a full and clear explanation of what was wanted, and then, like a gramophone, would repeat in the House what was said. The Victorian Chamber of Mines ought ;to be just as competent to express an opinion' on' a question of this description as is any institution. It knows more about mining and the points at issue in connection with this matter than does any other institution. Its members find it to their interests to secure the best appliances. In a letter from the Chamber, it is stated thatOn account of crucibles being of bulky nature and freight charged by measurement, they cost from 30 to 40 per cent, to import, which in itself is a substantial protection. They also state thatLocal crucibles vary in quality on account of the clay being unsuitable, and, being unreliable, they are little used.",22
116,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,We have many tons of good clay in Australia.,22
117,Mr FRAZER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The Chamber of Mines states that Morgan's Battersea crucibles are imported, and used almost exclusively on the mines.",22
118,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,No one takes any notice of them.,22
119,Mr FRAZER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I admit that the honourable member takes no notice of opinions with which he disagrees.,23
120,Mr KNOX,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,That is due to his ignorance.,23
121,Mr FRAZER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The fact that he is incapable of giving proper consideration to the arguments of others does not say much for his intellectual capacity. It is stated in this letter thatBattersea (Morgan's) crucibles are imported and used almost exclusively by the mines, the Government laboratories, mints, universities, schools of mines, chief mines, and assayers throughout the Commonwealth arid New Zealand. If that be so, how shall we benefit Australia by imposing this duty? Will the desire to give employment to three men in the making of an inferior class of crucible be sufficient to justify us in placing a heavy impost on scientific institutions that are doing much to encourage research, and to improve mining propositions that may be - of immense benefit to the people of Australia ? .",23
122,Mr HEDGES,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Fremantle) [12.19] - It was not my intention to speak to this question until the Treasurer urged that we ought, in this case,, to give Australia a show. If we desire to do so we certainly ought not to include in this item crucibles made of plumbago, or partly of plumbago, and high-grade assay crucibles. If we do, instead of helping Australia, we shall blight it. As to the remarks made by the Treasurer regarding the Golden Horseshoe mine, I point out that he visited Western Australia during certain festivities, and he had to listen to practically everything that was said.",23
123,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I received my information from the manager. - Mr HEDGES - The honourable member was told a lot of things that disagreed with what many of us knew.,23
124,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I received my information from the manager, Mr Sutherland, who had just returned from a visit to France to meet the directors.",23
125,Mr HEDGES,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The Golden Horseshoe mine is owned by a company having its head office in England, and is managed by an Australian, who was educated at the Ballarat School of Mines. As to the statement that some of the shares in the company are held in France",23
126,The CHAIRMAN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The. honourable member must not make more than an incidental reference to that phase of the question. [244 ],23
127,Mr HEDGES,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The broad statement made by the Treasurer that French-owned mines are being run in Western Australia is incorrect, and that remark will apply also to the' statement that crucibles can be, and are being, made in the Commonwealth.",23

I understand from makers of tiles in that val. State that there is no necessity for an increase of duty. The article is a cheap one, and the importing charges represent a veryhigh percentage of its value. The duties and I suggest would really mean an increase per of 10 per cent, on the old Tariff, since the bulk of the roofing tiles are imported from and we should not add more the than that, to the cost of building.",24

195,Mr GLYNN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"At all events, as classes vary, people want them made duty free. Within the last few months an ornamental church window was imported for the Church of England, in Adelaide, at a cost of ^260, and the duty thereon amounted to no less than £ 9 0 . Surely, in the interests of art, the Minister is not going tq impose a tax on an ornamental church window, which really contributes to the beautifying of a city, to the tune of ^90 ? That, in my opinion, is merely protection run mad. Anything which improves public LYNE) edifices, apart from the fact that they are churches, is a matter in which the community is largely interested. We ought to encourage the use of the highest forms of art, and the only way in which to achieve that object is by having a moderate duty, or no duty. I think that if we omit the word "" heraldic"" it will cover the case of ornamental church windows. It may also be necessary to strike out the words "" or engraved,"" and to insert the word ""plain"" before the words ""panes, prisms, and all glass framed with metal,"" because, otherwise, ornamental church windows might fall under the latter words. I believe it is the custom of the Department, whenever doubtful construction gives them a chance, to put a tax on any article, however beautiful it mav be.",29
196,Mr MAUGER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,As the churches look to the people here for their money they ought to have their work done here.,29

I understand that the words ""panes, prisms, and all glass framed with m e t a l "" in this item refer to cellar lights which are used in pavements, and which, I am informed, are not made in Australia. That being so, I think that the duty upon them is excessive. With the exception of those lights the item relates to glass worked up. I ad ; mit that such work is carried on in the Commonwealth, but whilst the silverers and bevellers may ask for a high protective duty, those engaged in all branches of the inI t goes dustrv do not. To illustrate the fallacy of high protective duties, I would point out Fair wages that under free-trade in New South Wales, in 1900 no less than 183 hands were employed in this industry, whilst in Victoria, notwithstanding its thirty years of protection, only eighty-seven hands were so engaged.",31

231,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I hope not. - Mr Glynn - I wish honourable members would not be so hasty. The Treasurer has suggested that we might afterwards exempt windows for churches and public institutions, as being works of art, imported under departmental by-laws. In the Tariff of 1902, there is a line which supplies an answer to the heated remarks of the Chairman of the Tariff Commission. I refer to the special exemptionWorks of art being statuary, and paintings framed or unframed, also windows for churches or public institutions under departmental by-laws. In view of that provision, can it be said that there is anything extreme in my suggestion ?",33
232,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,There is a great deal of complaint.,33
233,Mr GLYNN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"But there is nothing to justify the extraordinary protest made by the honourable member for Bendigo. Ornamental glasses for church purposes vary greatly in quality.

239,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The matter is one on which the officers of the Department can advise the honourable gentleman; but I still think that the word "" o r "" is necessary. I rose principally to object to the proposal to put heraldic glass and stained glass for windows on the free list. There are men engaged in the industry in Sydney and Melbourne, and, I think, also in the capitals of the other States, and it would be most unfair to call upon them to pay duty on the paints and pigments and other materials they use without giving them protection to at least the same extent in respect of the finished article. I suppose that we all desire to see our churches beautified,, but a slight increase in the cost of stained-glass windows, due to a duty for the protection of the local industry, would not prevent people interested in church decoration from purchasing beautiful windows.",33
240,Mr GLYNN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Angas) [3.18] - I wish to withdraw the amendment, but I wish it to be understood that I do so because of a promise given by the Treasurer that, without binding himself in any way, he would favourably consider the inclusion of these articles in a list similar to the exemption list in the Tariff of 1902.",33
241,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"South Sydney) [3.19] I should like the Treasurer to] declare what his policy is going to be on this item. If he is prepared to exempt the article referred to by the honourable member for Angas, it would be better that the whole of the articles included in this item should are inter- be admitted free. The honourable gentleman's decision on the question'may affect my vote upon the whole item.",33
242,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Hume--Treasurer) [3.20] - The matter is one for the Committee to deal with ; but, personally, I may. say at once that I believe that works of art should be admitted free. I do not care 1 should for what purpose they are imported, if they are real works of art, and not simply replicas, I do not see why they should not be admitted free, as they have been heretofore. What I told the honourable member for Angas was that I did not think this r "" was the place in which to deal with the Previously these articles have been included amongst those exempt under as departmental by-laws, and I think that is and the proper place for them. I have not said that they will be included amongst those exemptions, but I admit that my feeling is in that direction.",33
243,Mr JOHNSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Lang) [3.21] - I wish to point out that if the honourable member for Angas withdraws his amendment he will not accomplish the purpose he desires. The best way would be to take these articles out of this item and subsequently include them in the list of exemptions. It is quite true, as the honourable member for South Sydney has said, that there_are a number of people engaged in the stained-glass industry in the Commonwealth; but I never yet heard of any artist in Australia asking for protective duties with the object of keeping out works of art.",34
244,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Thos e engaged in the stained-glass window industry are asking fbr a duty. I had a protest only a short time ago from a manufacturer in Sydney against their free admission.,34
245,Mr JOHNSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"There is a difference between a manufacturer and an artist. If the person referred to was an artist, he must be an exception to the general rule. Artists the world over are only too glad to add to their knowledge by the study of works of art produced in all parts of the world.",34
246,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Can the honourable mem' ber define what a work of art is?,34
247,Mr JOHNSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,To do that might take me the whole afternoon; but I have no doubt that the works of art mentioned in this item should be included in the free list.,34
248,Mr HUTCHISON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Hindmarsh) [3.23]. - I remind the Committee that stainedglass windows must be considered as in a . different category from paintings or sculpture. A great painting, or a fine piece of sculpture, imported, cannot be produced in Australia; but I will undertake to find in Victoria, New South Wales, or South Australia, artists who will produce any kind of stainedrglass window honourable members are willing to pay for.",34
249,Mr WILSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"-Bunku m ! Mr 'HUTCHISON - I challenge the honourable member to point to any stainedglass window in Australia at the present time a replica of which cannot be made in the Commonwealth. It must not be forgotten that in the stained-glass window industry the artists are not the only persons employed. The industry gives a great deal of employment to ordinary workmen. I am astonished at the Treasurer giving in this matter a promise which would have the effect of destroying a flourishing in-dustrv giving considerable employment,' and which would also prevent the development in the Commonwealth of the higher class of art in this line.",34
250,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Parkes) [3.25]. - I hope the honourable member for Hindmarsh will permit me to tell him that he is entirely wrong when he speaks in the way he has done about stained-glass windows. Some of the greatest antists in England are employed today upon ecclesiastical glass work for which we have no parallel in this country.,34
251,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"There is very fine work in this line done here. Mf. BRUCE SMITH - That may be so. Very fine oil and water-colour painting and very fine sculptors' work are done here. There is also very fine literature produced in Australia. I saw a magazine the other day, in which if. was roundly asserted that no magazines from abroad should be allowedinto Australia, because all the magazine work required in the Commonwealth could be produced here.",34
252,Mr HUTCHISON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I do not think so.,34
253,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I am - aware that the honourable member does not think so, but the statement, appearing in the magazine to which I have referred, discloses the same spirit as that just displayed by the honourable member, and which is very often found in people who are not sufficiently informed artistically to discriminate in these matters. I can inform the honourable member that the best stained glass ecclesiastical window work is looked upon in Great Britain, and on the Continent, as involving as high a knowledge of art as does oil or water-colour painting.",34
254,Mr HUTCHISON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The honourable member cannot point to a stained glass window in Australia which could not be duplicated here.' Mr ""BRUCE SMITH - The honourable member is talking about replicas, but he must know that we could get a first-rate Australian artist to make a replica of the ""The Bent Tree"" tomorrow, and while ""The Bent Tree"" cost about ^5,600, the copy of the picture would not be worth ^5. To make a replica of any man's painting and consider that a work of art is very much like a man transcribing another man's book and then claiming to have proproduced literature.",34
255,Mr HUTCHISON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I claim that those engaged in the local industry of stained: glass window making can produce windowsof original design equal to' any at present, in Australia ",34
256,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Then I join issue with the honourable member. Any one withdrawn. who knows muchi about the subject will endorse what I say, when I tell the honoragreed toable member that he makes a very great mistake-if he supposes that we have artists in this country at the present time who turn out the ecclesiastical or heraldic glass work which is at present being produced in the Old Country. The heraldic glass work might not be so difficult, since it is generally designed from stead coats-of-arms, and is more in the nature of a copy, but there is no doubt that the highest class of ecclesiastical glass work could not be produced here.",35
257,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Sorri e of the men engaged in the work in the Old Country come out here.,35
258,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The best men engaged in the work would not come here, materials. because.it would not pay them to do so.",35
259,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I suppose that younger and aspiring artists might be induced to come here.,35
260,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Youn g artists in oil and water-colour painting come here from the Old Country in the same way, but we could not get a Leigbton, a Millais, or an Alma Tadema, or men of that rank to come out to Australia, because they can secure prices for their work in Great Britain which Australian people would not dream ot giving. It is very difficult for an artist in Australia to obtain ^ 5 0 for a painting. Yet we find that a man like Corot for his ""Bent Tree,"" of which there is a copy in Europe, gets .£5,600.",35
261,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Coro t did not get the,35
262,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY, The honourable member is getting away from the question.,35
263,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"-1 submit, sir, that there is a very close analogy from the artistic point of view between literature,"" sculpture, painting, and stained-glass work of the kind with which we are dealing. I invite the honourable member for Hindmarsh to inquiVe into the matter. He will find literature on the subject in our L i b a r y to convince him of the truth of what I have said. Some of the greatest artists engaeed in this work in England obtain' hundreds of guineas for a set of glass windows'. To say that we could do such work here is to claim that we have a Millais, an Alma Tadema, or a Leighton amongst Australian artists. Amendment (Mr Glynn'S) , by leave, Amendment (by Sir WILLIAM LYNE ) That after the word "" silvered"" the word "" and"" be left out, with a view to insert in can lieu thereof the words "" or brilliant.""",35
264,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"South Sydney) [3.29] I should like to suggest to die Treasurer that if we ate to give special consideration to stained glass windows for churches inof putting them on the free list, it would be better to include them in a. special line at a lower rate of duty.' What I want to urge is that our local artists who are ambitious to do good work of this kind should al least be given a protection equivalent to the extra price they are called upon to pay on the materials they use as a result of the duties imposed on those The matter should be dealt with in a way which would not prejudice the local artists in this line.",35
265,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,What does the honourable member suggest?,35
266,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,At least 15 per cent.,35
267,Mr TUDOR,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The duty on the raw material-glass , n.e.i - is 15 per cent.",35
268,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,That is true.,35
269,Mr BRUCE SMITH,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"It would not be necessary to put a duty of 15 per cent, on the window. It should be only on'the proportion of the window that represents the raw material.",35
270,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"That is so, but the paint and other materials used must be considered.",35
271,Mr FOWLER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Perth) [3.31] - I agree in a large measure with the honourable member for South Sydney, that if there is any virtue in a protective policy the artists engaged on this kind of work are entitled to some benefit from it, but I would urge very strongly that as the disadvantages of the protective policy undoubtedly apply to them to a certain degree steps should be taken to insure that they are not ipenalized. There is no doubt that they have to pay to some extent on their raw material. It maybe a comparatively small amount, but still the fact remains, and I take it that even free-traders would be willing tb level up that difference. The object of the free trade section of the Tariff Commission has always been to level up any disadvantages that may exist iri connection with an industry in this country carried on by importa-' tions of materials from abroad.",35
272,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The free-trade section of the Tariff Commission recommend 15 per cent.,36
273,Mr FOWLER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I was going to suggest that 15 per cent, would be a fair thing. The honourable member for Parkes was little too dogmatic in saying that there were cerned. no artists in Australia capable of turning out the high quality of work of this that is produced in other parts of the world. I know one artist in stained glass work who had to come to Australia for benefit of his health. He previously occuthe pied a very high position in a firm that has a world-wide reputation for this work. That is only one instance. I am sure there are a good many other artists who are prepared to turn out good work if they are only given the opportunity. The Minister would be well advised to adopt 15 per as a fair compromise in existing circumdiscussion stances. Mr. JOSEPH <COOK (Parramatta) [3-34]--The honourable member for Perth, rather than the honourable member for Parkes, has stretched matters. He cites tries. the case of a sick artist who has come out here and who once was employed in produced ducing these windows at Home. But does the honourable member base any serious gument on an incident of that kind? The fact remains that we have not the same high quality of skill- I am speaking only of the highest and best work-as can found in the rest of the world - I do think that any Australian, unless a very presumptuous one, would claim that we have. We may hope in the course of time to acquire it.",36
274,Mr THOMAS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,We have given protection to the engineer. Why should not the artist be protected as well ?,36
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Does the honorat able member suggest that we should protect our artist because he is paid higher rates for his work than are the pauper artists' the Old Country? I am afraid the paralfoi lel does not apply. The value of these works of art is the value of the skill ability which the artist puts into them. Therefore the cost of the raw material would not come to even a quarter or a half per cent. The value of works of art this kind is what'is known economically the value arising from the cost of producmade tion. The duty on the raw material is not worth considering, and it is absurd to urge it as a. reason for imposing a duty of 15 per cent, on works of art of this kind.",36
276,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"A stained glass window may be a work of art, but it also contains a lot of mechanical work. Mr. JOSEPH ,COOK - And the mechanical skill does not necessarily cost a much, so far as the raw material is con",36
277,Mr HUME COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"At least 10 per cent, kind of the raw material is cut to waste.",36
278,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Not at all. I am willing to vofe any reasonable counterthe vailing duty which will cover the duty on raw material, but at the outside 5 per cent, would be a very handsome allowance to make for any raw material ""used in these that very costly works of skill and art.",36
279,Mr STORRER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Bass) [3.38] - I thought that when the honourable member cent, for Angas withdrew his amendment, the on stained glass windows would end, and that we should deal with bevelled glass and other articles included in this item. I hope that the Minister will not reduce any proposed duty with reference'to glass. We want protection for all indusWe hear the argument time after time that certain things are not being proin Australi^.. Anything can be produced in Australia that is produced in any arother part of the world if we only hold out inducements for those skilled in particular industries to come here and estabbe lish them. That is how America has made not herself great in a short time. Surely we in Australia have confidence enough in our country to believe that the same thing can be done here. I hope the Minister will stand firm on this question, and that there will not be this paring ""away of proposed duties in order to satisfy a few individuals who badger honourable members about their own particular industries, and do nof look the good of the Whole country. That is one of the evils in connection with people coming here, and canvassing for particular of 'industries.' Some people want protection cordials, and free-trade in bottles and corks. If we in this Parliament are to do and justice to the interests of the Commonwealth, we must, look to the good of the whole of Australia, and not of particular industries only. That is the way in which of I regard the question of the duties on as glass. As good church' windows can be in Australia as any that .we have here at present. Of course, there may be better ones in other parts of the world, but I have not been there to see them - So far as concerns works of art, it might be a good thing ior Australia if such, productions as "" The Bent Tree,"" for which over . £ 5 , 0 0 0 was paid, were shut out altogether.",36
280,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"North Sydney) [3.41] - I rise, not to extend, but to curtail the debate, by asking whether the Minister is going to allow this question to stand over in order that it may be dealt with under the exemptions, or whether he intends to propose the duty of 15 per cent, suggested ? If the question of stained glass t windows is to be postponed, it is not necessary to debate it further now.",37
281,Mr CROUCH,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I am going to debate it until we get a duty of 30 per cent.,37
282,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"This . is not a vitally important item, however we view it, but considerable time has been spent in debating it , and we on the Opposition side are expected to curtail our speeches on really important items.",37
283,Mr SALMON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The reason why it has been debated is the uncertainty which exists. We do not know what is going to be done.,37
284,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I want the Treasurer to sav whether lie will adhere to his promise given to the honourable member for Angas.,37
285,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I did not exactly make a promise. I did not say that it would be done. I said that I was not certain whether it could be done, but 1 gave the honourable member my opinion.",37
286,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The Minister made a suggestion to the honourable member for Angas, who thereupon withdrew his amendment and went away satisfied with the Minister's assurance that the item would be postponed until the Committee reached the exemptions. Minister will state that he intends to adhere to that promise or suggestion, the debate need not continue.",37
287,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Hume-Trea surer) [3.43] - I feel that this matter is causing two debates instead of one. It was the amendment of the honourable member for Angas that began the debate. If the article is to be made free it should be included in the list of exemptions, as it was in the last Tariff. I do not feel at all disposed to propose a duty of 15 per cent. The article should either be free or be dutiable at 30 per cent.",37
288,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"What about the men who are doing the work here? Does the Treasurer, propose to make them pay the duty on the raw material?",37
289,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"If the Committee says that the duty is to be 30 per cent., well and good. I am quite prepared to take the responsibility of testing the feeling of the Committee. I was astonished that debate should arise at this stage.",37
290,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,It is the honourable member's fault that it did arise.,37
291,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I did not start the debate.,37
292,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The honourable member gave a promise to exempt an article which is made in Australia.,37
293,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Thei e is a strong feeling throughout the Commonwealth that works of art which cannot be produced here should be admitted duty free.,37
294,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Thes e works of art are produced here.,37
295,Sir JOHN QUICK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,A number of these windows are not works of art.,37
296,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"If they are not works of art they should not be admitted free. I will not support a proposal to admit free anything, but works of art. I shall move nothing in regard to this particular class of work, but will give the Committee an opportunity to decide regarding it in. considering the exemptions. That seems to me to be the best course to take.",37
297,Mr CROUCH,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Corio) [3.45] - The Committee looks for guidance to the Treasurer, but fails to ""get it. He does not know whether the duty is to be 15 per cent., or the 30 per cent, proposed by himself, or whether the article is to be free. My desire is to have a duty of 30 per cent., because I think these'ecclesiastical windows can be made in Australia, and made well. At Melton, in Victoria, there If the is a little church, the erection of which has been largely assisted by the Staughton family, and where only ' Australian stained glass is used in the windows. The honourable member for Laanecoorie will bear me out when I say that the windows in that church are really artistic, and a credit to the country. Australian men are being trained in this art, and they make studies of the great paintings bf the Old World. Although we may not have an Alma Tadema or a Millais amongst us, we have some very thoughtful and gifted students. The work of sucb men as Alma Tadema and Millais never reaches Australia; but is devoted to the cathedrals of the Old Countrv which are supported largely by awealthv leisured class. There is not the slightest doubt, however, that Australian art in ecclesiastical windows can hold its place, and I am pleased to say that the artists are beginning to study Australian flora 'and fauna as a means of decoration. We have all heard of Corot's "" Bent Tree "" ; but that is a French tree. What would Corot have done with an Australian - gumtree ? The great majority of our people are not so fortunate .as the honourable member for North Sydney, who may take a trip to the Old Country, occasionally-the y have to study their art in the Australian fields and the bush. What is the good of a picture of a bent tree from .France? It is our duty to encourage our own artists to paint works from Australian nature, so that people can compare the artist's genius with their knowledge of the living tree. As to ecclesiastical windows, we are producing no saints in Australia, although I am reminded we have amongst us a ""Holy Joe,"" and though not our own St. George and the Dragon, we have Johnson and the Alligator.

307,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"North Sydney) [4.11] - I do not suggest that there is no foundation for the complaints I preadmit that they appear to be unduly penalized in regard to their raw material. We must recollect that they chiefly use the sizes of glass, the freight upon which is as high as if not higher than the freight charged upon the larger sizes. They have also, to cut away portions of the glass, and to sell those portions at a ridiculously small price. .There is some reason therefore why their raw material should be admitted free. But the proposal of the honourable member for Yarra appears to go beyond what is asked by the Victorian bevellers and glass-workers. They say that they desire polished and patent plate up to 12 superficial feet to be admitted free. They further requesi that a duty shall be levied upon all glass in furniture. Whilst I am prepared to exempt their raw material from duty up to a reasonable size, I think that their other request is not a desirable one to grant. If the Customs authorities have to open up all furniture imported, and to measure the area of glass which it contains, ""the task will be a constant source of trouble alike to the officials and importers. Moreover, it will frequently cause injury to the articles imported.",39

310,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The request I have seen is to admit free glass up to 25 superficial feet.,40
311,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I am not absolutely sure that this communication commits the glass-cutters to the exemption of glass beyond 12 superficial feet. What they spoke of was the omission of the items under 12 superficial feet, and I concluded that it was their raw material up to that measurement which they wanted made free. If the honourable member for Yarra can say that it is up to 25 superficial feet that they want their raw material made free, I shall accept his statement.",40

Connolly, a Sydney manufacturer, made a special appeal for increased duties on flint glassware, such as lamp chimneys, confectioners' show cases, and railwayPAIKS. glassware as used in carriage lamps and telegraph glassware as used for electrical cells. He claimed just those concessions which the Minister abandoned under this heading. Now, however, the ad valorem duty has also been reduced from 35 to 25 per cent. Not content with that, the free-trade party, assisted by a few so-called protectionists, are endeavouring to reduce the duty to a still lower standard on goods imported from Great Britain.",41
328,Mr ATKINSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Twenty-fiv e per cent, is the recommendation of the honourable member's section of the. Commission.",42
329,Sir JOHN QUICK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"But what is proposed now is a duty of 20 per cent. The whole scheme, in fact, has been smashed up. I strongly object to any further ductionj even in favour of British goods. I should have been prepared to agree to a concession, provided flint glassware had been maintained upon the higher standard, with fixed measurement duties. But as all the duties are absorbed under this heading now, I think it would be a great mistake to make a further reduction. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [4.35] - I do not know what this splenetic outburst from the honourable member for Bendigo means. We have been voting for the honourable member's recommendation. Why is he bolting away from his own recomendation in this fashion? Why must the protectionists be designated "" so-called protectionists ""- a most insulting term to apply to anyman, I think.",42
330,Mr STORRER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"It does not apply to the honourable member, anyhow.",42
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"But it does apply to the honourable member who made use of the phrase just now, as much as to any member of this Committee, because he has departed frequently from his own recommendations, and has repeatedly ignored them. Sir' JOHN QUICK - No .",42
332,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I say yes, and the honourable member will find out that what I say is true if he looks through the record of his own votes: The honourable member overlooks the fact that four-fifths of these goods come from foreign countries.",42
333,Sir JOHN QUICK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"My section of Commission recomended a duty of 25 per cent., and the honourable member's party now propose to reduce it to 20 per cent.",42
334,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"But it has been pointed out that four-fifths of the importations would come in under the 25 per cent, vote, and that only a very small proportion would come in under the 20 per cent, duty-which , by the way, is not carried yet.",42
335,Sir JOHN QUICK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,This item covers all flint glassware now.,42
336,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I should hope so. Again the reply is that the bulk of these goods come from foreign countriesI mean the cheaper sorts.,42
337,Mr SALMON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The honourable member says that the A section of the Tariff Commission recommended 25 per cent. They did not. They recommended a measurement duty, as the honourable member will resee if he turns to their report.",42
338,Mr WILKS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Then the honourable member for Bendigo is to blame for allowing the item to be altered. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I see on turn- ing to the report, that the honourable member for Laanecoorie is quite right. I want to add that any man or set of men who would deliberately propose duties on glassware amounting to over 200 per cent, must have been beside themselves. Such recommendations are only worthy to be scouted, not to be followed. «",42
339,Mr FOWLER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Perth) [4.40] - The honourable member for Bendigo has referred to the elaborate report of the A section of the Tariff Commission on glassware. The B section on account of lack of time did not furnish anything in the nature of a report. Nevertheless, our recommendations are based on a fair analysis of the evidence. I make bold to say that the recommendations of the A section are not based on the evidence as a whole. Emphasis has been laid on a certain portion of it, and other phases of the evidence, equally important in my opinion, have been altogether ignored. There is no doubt about the high duties proposed by the A section in this respect. Added to the high cost of importing these goods into Australia, those duties would,' in my opinion, exceed evert the necessities of prohibition. I hold in my hand documents which show that in the case of typical instances in glassware the cost of importation is as high as 165 per cent. With the duties as proposed the the total would be 355 ner cent. Surely that is protection absolutely run mad. If the honourable member for Bendigo is not a prohibitionist, I take it that he must come down very considerably from those high duties in order to reach that level of moderation which he claims he always had before him in framing his recommendations. I have before me the cost book of an importing firm. .1I have been sufficiently in touch with evidence on fiscal matters to be very incredulous unless I have absolute proof, and when statements with regard to the cost of importing glassware were put before me, I wanted proof. The firm in question has supplied me with its cost book. I have taken the trouble to verify the facts contained in the papers that have been supplied to honourable members by entries in the cost book. I find that the facts are identical in every respect. There can be no question that a gross and unnecessaryduty is being added to the high charges of importation, which will make the carrying on of this industry only possible at enormous disadvantage. If there is any vitality in the Australian glassware industry at all, it ought to be able to carry on without any duty, the cost of importation being so high. There is another cost which has not been included in these amounts. I allude to breakages, which, I believe, run up to about 10 per cent. That percentage has to be added on to the 355 per cent, to find the total charges under the existing scheme of the Government. I am satisfied that these duties are so unnecessarily high that reasonable protectionists cannot in dorse them. I feel sure that they can be reduced with considerable advantage to the community as a whole, and without any disadvantage to the glassware industry in Australia if it is being conducted on anything like a commercial basis.",42
340,Mr WILKS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Dalley) [4.45] - The trouble that has occurred over this matter has arisen from the transfer of the articles formerly under item 252-whic h provided for a measurement duty - to item 253, which provides for an ad valorem duty. The honourable member for Bendigo did not object to the transfer, though he was in the Chamber at the time.",43
341,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The honourable member thought that the Committee would dustry. be reasonable, and not reduce the duty. That was my opinion also, or I should have objected to the transfer.",43
342,Mr WILKS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"As a matter of fact, the honourable member for Bendigo did not object. Now, he tells us that he himself would have objectecTto the transfer that he thought that the proposed duty of 35 per cent, was going to be carried. The Treasurer's real reason ""for the transfer of cient. the articles from one item to another was that he was absolutely ashamed of the item as it stood. The measurement duty was users of glassware? at an exorbitant rate. Neither' the honorwhich able member for Bendigo nor the TreaTreasurer surer could have defended it . The impost was placed upon the cheapest class of articles.",43
343,Mr SALMON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"As item 252 has been negatived, surely the honourable member is not in order in discussing it .",43
344,The CHAIRMAN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The honourable member must not discuss it ; but he may make an incidental reference to it.,43
345,Mr WILKS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The honourable member for Bendigo informed the Committee that the biggest glassworks in the Commonwealth are those at Leichhardt, which is in my electorate; but I regard the local manufacturers of glassware as so heavily protected by their natural advantages that I intend to vote for the lowest rate of duty. As the honourable member for Perth has shown, the charges connected with the importation of glassware are peculiarly heavy, giving the local manufacturers a protection of 165 per cent.",43
346,Mr FOWLER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,That estimate is correct. I obtained it from official documents.,43
347,Mr WILKS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Assumin g the natural protection to be only 80 per cent., or half of what it really is, the additional 25 per cent, which the Committee has allowed gives the local manufacturer a very fair protection. I intend to vote for a duty of 20 per cent, against British importations, because I do not think that the Treasurer should go back on his avowed policy of preference to Great Britain: So far as the honourable member for Bendigo is concerned, as he did not object to the removal of the measurement duties, he has only got himself to blame for the position in which he finds himself. The Committee has voted the 25 per cent, ad valorem duty recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission.",43
348,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I blame protectionists for having thrown over this in ,43
349,Mr WILKS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I am answerable only for myself, and while I desire that the glass-making industry shall flourish here, I think that, in addition to the natural protection, a rate of 25 per cent, on foreign importations and 26 per cent, on British except importations will be sufficient. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The past has shown that those rates will not be suffi",43
350,Mr WILKS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"If heavier rates were imposed, what would be the position of the That is a subject concerns me as a free-trader. The considers that he has been sold heaviest by his protectionist friends.",43
351,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I have. .,44
352,Mr WILKS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Apar t from his views, I have more than ordinarily kindly feelings for the Treasurer, and if he thinks that he has been sold by his friends, the proper thing for him to do is not to utter complaints, but to make a crisis.  to point out to the Committee that, while we have negatived item 252, the glassware therein specified is now dutiable as ware, n.e.i.,"" under item 253. The honno orable member for Bendigo has spoken making about the need for high protection, but, a matter of fact, the natural protection the local makers is very heavy. The cost of importing ruby and coloured lamp globes, which are not made here, comes 107 per. cent. The cost of importing lamp cost ? chimneys is 165 per cent. The cost of importing the clear crimped-top lamp chimney is 204 per cent., and the cost of porting frosted crimped-top lamp chimthe better article. neys 170 per cent. These are the charges in addition to the duty.",44
353,Mr FOWLER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"And the loss by breakcost ages is not taken into account.  out earlier in the debate, it is shown invoices that the average loss on glassware landed at Port Adelaide is about 10 per that statemenft? cent. In addition to a natural protection, which ranges frOm 107 per .cent, to 204 per sworn evidence. cent., the Committee has imposed a duty 25 per cent, on foreign importations, and it is now proposed to make the duty British importations 20 per cent. The honourable member for Bendigo must think that he is talking to children when he says that this protection is not sufficient. much does he want? The measurement mous duties which were knocked out were equiof valent to over 500 per cent. The local manufacturers of glassware are being treated very liberally.",44
354,Mr COON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Batman) [4.55] - Honor able members have a lot to say about the natural protection enjoyed by the local manufacturers of glassware, but it does not prevent imported tumblers from being retailed in Victoria at i j d . each, or is. a dozen. These goods are being dumped here, notwithstanding the supposed proDecember, tection of 165 per cent. Their original cost cannot be more than 5d. or 6d. dozen.

400,Mr EDWARDS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I resent such a statement.,47
401,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I am exceedingly sorry that such a vote should have been given. I marvel that the honourable member and other representatives of Queensland on the Opposition side get anything through this House, because other honourable members have become tired of the practice they have followed, of voting to suit their own purposes, instead of in the interests of the other States.",47
402,The CHAIRMAN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Order !,47
403,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"South Sydney) [5.21]. - The attitude assumed by the honourable member for Oxley in making this request borders on the humourous. For weeks past the honourable member has consistently voted for the lowest possible duty, except where the interests of a Queensland industry have been at stake. He now asks, again in respect of a Queensland industry, that it should be given every consideration in this Tariff. Whenever a Queensland industry is in question, the honourable member desires that something should be done for it , and every other part of Australia, so far as he is concerned, can go hang. I say that, so far as my knowledge of the people of Queensland goes, they do not desire any such discrimination in their favour. They are content that duties should be so imposed as to benefit industries in all the States alike.",47
404,Mr EDWARDS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,That is so.,47
405,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I am sure that they would repudiate the selfish attitude the honourable member has consistently adopted,47

I merely direct attention to some little inconsistencies on the part of the orable member, which are probably quite accidental. There is, however, a pecusoon liarity about them, as they always seem be in the one direction. Where a Queenssays, land industry is involved, the honourable tralia. member suddenly becomes a protectionist, and on evervthing else he is a free-trader.",48
410,The CHAIRMAN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The honourable ' member must not pursue that line of ment.,48
411,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Despit e the attitude adopted by the honourable member for ley, I do not think that we should ignore a Queensland industry. I am quite pared to. give every consideration to dustries established in Queensland, even .though representatives of that State should be so selfish as to refuse to give considerahonorable tion to industries .established in the States. I trust that the Treasurer look into the matter referred to, and see whether anything has been overlooked. I am glad to be able to say that at the Women's Work Exhibition recently held here I saw some Queensland glass proof ducts from Rockhampton that were equal to anything I have seen imported the Old Country, or anything of the kind that has ever been placed on the market in Australia. I regret that owing to the last vote, carried with the assistance the honourable member for Oxley and other honourable members opposite, such produchonorable tions are likely to receive so small a sure of protection in the future that doubtful whether the industry manufacture can continue to be carried on.",48
412,The CHAIRMAN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Order !,48
413,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I think the Treasurer should look into this matter, in which the Brisbane industry referred to is cerned, and endeavour to make good deficiency in the Tariff.",48
414,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"It is not worthwhile.  debate which has taken place since the upon honourable member for Oxley brought this Commatter before the Committee, and from general remarks on the Tariff to which I have listened, I am disposed to think that the honourable member made the possible mistake in not. first consulting the Treasurer's understudy, the sure honourable member for Batman. If he had only told that honourable member that he of wanted a duty for the benefit of this Brisbane industry, I am satisfied that the Treasurer would have acceded at once to hon- .his request. This is the Lyne-Coon Tariff. There is no doubt at all about that. As as any article is mentioned, the honto orable member for Batman gets up, and "" The thing can be made in AusI have it here in my pocket."" The honourable member went so far the other night as to say that he had a sheepshearing machine and a wool-scouring maarguchine in his pocket. He may know something about a good many things, but the honourable member does not know much Oxabout wool, or he would not have brought forward the sample he exhibited in this preChamber. The trouble is that this is a inQueensland industry, and so did not happen to have the ear of the Treasurer, the Minister of Trade and Customs, or the member for Batman. The honother orable member for Oxley was returned as will an independent member of this Parliament, and is free to vote as he likes. We all claim to do that. If one or two, or the whole of the representatives of Queensland, happen to be opposed to the policy the Government, that is no reason why the industries of that State should not from be given a square deal.",48

The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is , a one-eyed protectionist, and cannot cavil if the honourable member for Oxley is the same.

418,Mr SOLMON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Laanecoorie) [5.28] - I was somewhat astonished to hear the honourable member for Oxley making a proposition,49
419,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Why cannot honourable members let the honourable member for Oxley alone? They are pecking at him like a lot of political crows.,49
420,Mr SALMON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Surely it is not befitting a deliberate assembly that when one rises to throw some light on a discussion,49
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The honourable member is doing nothing of the kind. He is rising for the purpose of savagely atsistent. tacking another honourable member.,49

423,Mr SALMON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The honourable member ought to know that I never savagely attack any one. No member of the Committee is more meek, and mild in his criticism others than I am. I express my surprise that, when the Committee has declined place any duty upon scientific appliances, the honourable member for Oxley should have asked us to go out of our order to assist an industry in the State from which he comes. The honourable member did not indicate the articles which he desired to have protected, or the duty the whole thing. he wished to have placed upon them.

The Government have studiously avoided the imposition upon material used for scientific purposes. The honourable member must be aware that is not treating me fairly. gas analysis apparatus is not very largely used, and I feel sure that he would not desire that an impost should be placed upon instruments used to prevent disaster to - the community. Arsenic testing apparatus and tubes should be treated in the same way.",49
426,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The honourable member should not decry an Australian industry.,49

I am glad to say that they are already on the free list. I can only express my regret that the new-born zeal of the honourable member for Oxley for protectionist principles had not been exhibited in a worthier cause.",49
434,Mr EDWARDS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Oxlev) [5.34] - I much regret that the Minister should have lost his temper this afternoon.,50
435,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I never lose my temper.,50
436,Mr EDWARDS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I spoke this morning in admiration of the way in which the Minister has controlled himself during the whole Tariff discussion. I was honest and sincere in what I said then; but I am afraid that it had a bad effect upon him. Apparently he likes to be scolded better than to be praised. I ask him to take 'this matter into consideration with the view of giving some measure of protection to the industry which I have mentioned. I ' do not care whether it is established in Brisbane or in any other part of the Commonwealth. I take it that the industry is established to some extent in other parts of the Commonwealth. I know - that I cannot move for an increase of duty, but the particular articles which Messrs. J. and W. Wilson manufacture are to be found in items 255, 256, and 442.",50
437,Mr SALMON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Which of the articles enumerated in item 255 do they manufacture?,50
438,Mr EDWARDS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The honourable member can read, I presume. He has the Tariff in front of him. I gave him the numbers of the items. Surely he does not want any more?",50
439,Mr SALMON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The honourable member is misleading the Committee, because they do not make all the articles included in item 255.",50
440,Mr EDWARDS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The honourable member is very troublesome. He takes up a 'good deal of time himself. He should know that we want to get the Tariff through before Christmas. I ask the Minister to take the matter into his serious consideration, with a view to giving protection not only to this firm, but to others throughout the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Laanecoorie knows that I am not speaking only on behalf of the people of my own State. It has 'been alleged I vote only for those things which will benefit Queensland, but I can say .that Queensland has nothing to thank the Federal Parliament for. It is always thrown in our faces that we do nothing except for the benefit of Queensland. I deny and resent the imputation. I hope the Treasurer will see his way clear to impose a duty of 15 ' or 20 per cent. I think I am moderate in my request. I term myself a moderate protectionist. I am not an extremist. I regard high duties as being just as bad as are top low duties. The self-reliance of men and masters is weakened when they have to depend on duties, and on such assistance as they may be able to get from a Government.'  the Minister will take the request of the honourable member for Oxley into serious consideration. We want only a square deal. The honourable member for Oxley does not ask the Treasurer to impose a duty on the whole of the item.",50

Instead of the honourable member for Laanecoorie helping the honourable member for Oxley, knowing full well, as a professional man, the names of these scientific instruments, he tried to cloud the issue by saying that they are not included in this item. If the honourable member for Laanecoorie were fair to the honourable member for Oxley, to the Committee, and to Queensland, he would say whether these articles can be made in Australia or not. Will he say, as a professional man, whether this is a fair industry to be protected? If it were carried on in Victoria, I am satisfied that every Victorian in the House, including the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, would be barracking hard for it. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports interjected something about free-traders being strong on protection. I may tell the honourable member that I was not returned at the last election as a free-trader. I announced on the platform what I intended to do with regard to protection. I said that if that .the Government introduced scientific protection, and would protect the workers, I would give them the help that they needed. 1 hope the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will not throw that taunt at me again. I am as good - a man as he is, in any way he likes to take me. No good end is served by saying that honourable members are agents for this or that man. Each of us has a constituency to represent, and is amenable to his electors. Let them deal with us, instead of our attempting to 'judge one another on the floor of this chamber. The honourable member for Oxley has only asked for a fair thing for our State. He wants the same fair and square treatment for Queensland as I and other Queensland members have given to the other States in regard to their manufacturing industries. I ask the Treasurer, - in all seriousness, to see if something cannot be done to protect this i ndustry. Messrs. J. and W. Wilson claim to be the sole Australian manufacturers of accurate scientific glassware. factory and warehouse is situated in Wharf-street, Brisbane. I do not know them, but as the instruments which they advertise are made in Brisbane,, which after all is in the Commonwealth, those honourable members who are so strong on protection for industries in other States which have more numerous representation than Queensland has should accord this industry the same fair, square treatment as other States are getting. I ask the Treasurer to give this matter consideration, not on account of the honourable member for Oxley, who does not care a snap of the lingers personally, but in the i nterests of Queensland and of the Commonwealth.",50
443,Mr SALMON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Laanecoorie) [5.42] The honourable member for Oxley has .been good enough to suggest that I have chattered a good deal on this Tarift. I have spoken very little upon it . My constituency is vitally interested in it in many ways, but in the interests of the despatch of business I have kept silent on many occasions in the face of great provocation. When I asked the honourable member for Oxley a civil question as to what articles included in item 255 were made by the Brisbane firm mentioned, he replied in a fashion' which I am sorry to say he has apparently acquired from those with whom he is sitting.",51
444,Mr EDWARDS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I gave the honourable member the number of the item. - Mr SALMON - I asked the honourable member a question with regard to the articles in the item, but he resented it , and was somewhat rude. At any rate, he was querulous.",51

From a cursory glance, I should say that the manufactures of this firm do not come under the item we are discussing at all.

447,Mr SALMON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I cannot find in the catalogue any article that is included 'in item 255. There are only three articles included in that item, one of which I know Their from personal knowledge is not manufactured in the Commonwealth. When the honourable"" member asserted that all the articles in item 255 .were manufactured in the Commonwealth, he made an assertion that is not borne out by the catalogue itself. I hope the Treasurer will decide not to place a duty on apparatus used purely for scientific purposes. If the Minister refuses to impose a duty he will be doing only what has been the consistent policy of the protectionist party for many years past. Of course, we desire to see these articles manufactured here, if possuble; but if they are not manufactured here-and even if they are-w e decline to make them subject to taxation.",51

484,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"North Sydney) [6.14] - In respect of this item we have one of the most severe increases of duty that has been levied under thisTariff. The impost upon bottles of more than 10 ozs. of fluid capacity, has been raised from zo per cent, under the old Tariff, and from 10 per cent, in the case of wine and beer bottles, to at least' 100 and 150 per cent, in certain instances. These are most extraordinary increases. Yet we know that under the operation of the old Tariff the bottle-making industry was flourishing and expanding. The rate which formerly obtained, added to freight and other charges, represented a natural protection to the industry of from 60 to 80 per cent. Let me point out to the Committee the effect of freight and charges. The New South Wales Wine and Spirit Association has furnished some figures showing that the Home cost of black wine bottles ios. per gross, and that, under the preit sent duty, the landed cqst with all in charges, in Sydney is 35s. per gross, being an increase of 250 per cent, The landed cost of the same description of bottles at Fremantle is 38s. per gross, being an increase of 280 per cent, on the Home cost; while Hobart it is 40s. per gross, being an increase of 300 per cent, on the Home cost.",54

493,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I think that the landed cost runs from 18s. to £ 1 per gross.,54
494,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The honourable member for Grampians has interjected that n o per cent, is the cost of bringing out the bottles, and if we take the Home cost at ios. per gross, the landed cost will be about 21s. Under the old Tariff, including all charges, a. protection including charges of from 60 to 100 per cent., according to the class of the bottle, was given to the bottlemakers But under the new Tariff the protection is increased by three times on some items, and by more than three times on some items. Surely that is not a reasonable duty ! No one else has ever claimed such gigantic protection. No has ever claimed a duty of 100 per on the Home cost, when the article was a cent. small one which would not occupy much space. In the case of bulky goods like tralia, too. bottles it costs an enormous amount in proportion to cost to protect them from age and to import them.

I shall deal with the subject on general lines, from the point of view of what I consider to be the interests of Australia and Australian industries. I think that a heavy tax upon bottles is oppressive both to the primary producer and the consumer. The old duties of 10 and 20 per cent., when freight and charges were taken into consideration, amounted to a protection of n o per cent. I have documentary evidence in my possession which I - am prepared to submit to the Treasurer for his perusal, and which will show that my statement is correct.",56
520,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Has the honourable I admit member original invoices with him?,56
521,Mr HANS IRVINE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Yes . I think that duties of 30 per cent, and 25per cent, would afford a large measure of protection to .the bottle trade.",56
522,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"All round ? Mr HA NS IRVINE - Yes ; I think that those duties should be applied .all round. Quantities of goods which are put into small phials are sold at 3d., 4d., and 6d. per bottle retail. Those who use them are largely country people, who ought not to be taxed excessively for the benefit of industries in the large capitals, and to the detriment of the primary producer and consumer all over Australia. Mr .WATSON - Would the honourable member allow full bottles to come in free? MT . HANS IRVINE - Certainly , considering that the products which they contain are heavily taxed. I have before me invoices which I think should be sufficient to convince the late leader of the Labour Party that my contention is correct.",57
523,The CHAIRMAN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I remind the honourable member that the question of dealing with full bottles will be dealt with under the next item.,57
524,Mr HANS IRVINE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"A case inpoint came under my notice within the last two or three weeks. I will.quote the figures. Fifteen cases of Burke's stout, pints, each case containing 8 dozen, were imported. Stout, as honourable members know, is only made in qualities which are in great repute at one place, namely, Dublin. The duty and charges paid under the old Tariff would' have been £ 8 7s. The extra duty collected under the new Tariff was £ 4 ios. That is to say, £ 1 2 17s. was paid on fifteen cases of pints. knows as well as I do that stout is. especially recommended by the medical faculty for the use of sick people, and it is a necessary article of consumption in many such cases. He will surely recognise that an extra charge of £ 4 ios. on fifteen cases of pints is not fair.",57
525,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The bottles are quite good for use after they are washed out.,57
526,Mr HANS IRVINE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"And they should be used. I have here an invoice from one of the largest firms in Great Britain, Jorgensen and Jorgensen Limited. Swedish firm, having establishments in several places; its London headquarters are situated inSt. Mary's Axe, London, E . C I have another statement before me for 578 gross and 3 dozen bottles, including pints and quarts, clarets and black wines. The cost f.o.b. London was ,£299 19s. 8d.

On the top of that have to be added freight and other charges, bringing the total cost up to £ 5 6 5 os. 3d., which is 215 per cent. I do not think that any one wants the people of this country to pay 215 per cent, on bottles. I want as much as any one can do to secure effective protection, because I believe in the establishment of Australian industries throughout the length and breadth of Australia. But I do not wish to penalize the primary producer or consumer to such an extent as is now proposed. Our policy should be rather to induce people to settle in the country instead of attracting them into the; large centres.",57
527,Mr MATHEWS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,^People cannot get on to the land if they want to.,57
528,Mr HANS IRVINE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The honourable member talks without sufficient information. He can get land anywhere if he is prepared to pay for it. I am prepared to indicate where land is to be obtained if people want it . but not if they want it for nothing. Some people want to get land but do not want to work for it. I am quite willing to submit the documents from which I have quoted to the Treasurer, in order that he may see for himself that what I have stated is reasonable. I consider that duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent. The Treasurer ad valorem all round ought to be quite sufficient. No one can challenge the figures which I have quoted, and which show a protection of 215 per cent: on a shipment of bottles landed here. I believe in the Australians making their own bottles, but a protection of 215 per cent, is altogether too high. If we impose duties of 30 and 25 per cent., giving the British manufacturers a preference of 5 per cent., we shall deal very liberally with the local industry.",57
529,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Would the honorI t is a able member impose those rates of duty on both full and empty bottles? Mr HA NS IRVINE - I think that full bottles should be admitted free, because, although it is said that our manufacturers can make any kind of bottle, it is not so. On the Continent of Europe, and in the United Kingdom, large factories confine themselves to the making of special bottles. One factory will make flagons, another black wine or black beer bottles, another .amber glass bottles, another medicine bottles, another patent bottles, and so on. 'We have a great deal to learn in connection with bottle making. There are secrets which have been handed down from generation to generation of makers in Germany, France, and England. France is the only country in the world where' they cam make a first-class champagne bottle, capable of standing high pressure. They make a good bottle in Germany, but the German bottle will not compare with the French bottle. Neither will the English bottle. French champagne pint bottle will stand a pressure of frtom 160 to 170 lbs. to the square inch. The art of making such bottles is not to be learned in a year or two. Only years of experimenting will produce bottles like those. The best French champagne quart bottles will stand a pressure of from 120 to 1 30. lbs. to the square inch, whilst most other bottles will not stand a pressure of more than about 40 lbs. to the square inch. While I would giveencouragement to the local bottle-making industry, I shall not vote for the prohibition of importations, which is practically what the Government proposal means, the duties proposed being in some instances equivalent to ad valorem rates of nearly 400 per cent, on some kinds of bottles. I could deal with this matter at greater length, but I shall not do so, unless I find it to be necessary to make a second speech, because we all want to make progress with the Tariff.",57

531,Mr GLYNN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The honourable member for usGrampians was not speaking only on his own behalf.,58
532,Sir JOHN QUICK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"He admitted that he is interested in this matter. sides were heard, honourable members would and take a broader and more sympathetic of the industry. Probably they found time to read the evidence taken the Commission, because it is very voluan minous, and the work of going through is very tedious. Had they read it , would not deal with these proposals in a .cavalier spirit, and, to save time, agree to wholesale reductions of duties. Something like ,£156,000 is invested in bottle works in Australia, upwards of ,£60,000 being sunk in the Melbourne bottle works, while £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 is sunk in bottle works in New South Wales, and there are other bottle works in South Australia. It was from South Australia that the request for a substantial increase of the duty on bottles came. Mr Hughes, The the pioneer bottle manufacturer 'of that State, pointed out that, under the old Tariff, his output was reduced, and he was not able to keep his hands fully employed, so that some of his men were without work for a considerable part of the year. He and other manufacturers strongly advocated fixed rates; first, because these had operated very successfully in Victoria, and, secondly, because they make it impossible for importers to deceive the Customs authorities by presenting incorrect invoices. We were informed that the Customs authorities prefer the measurement system to a duty of so much_ for a certain number of bottles. Notwithstanding the up-to-date equipment of the Melbourne Bottle Works, the proprietors cannot, compete against many of the imported bottles. Their present machinery has enabled them to reduce prices; but now further reductions are impossible, and Mr MCNeilage informed the Tariff. Commission that, even if the higher rates of duty which he suggested were agreed to it would take some years for the be company to get back its outlay. In New South - Wales we learned of the market. I am sorry being swamped by the importation of cheap more bottles - made in China, Japan, and Germany. I would like honourable membersthose belonging to the Labour beParty- to listen to this pathetic story of speak on a Sydney glassblower. : It is given on page 559 of the reports and recommendaMr. Scott, the glassblower in question, told The reason I have been sent before you is to explain what effect the foreign competition has had upon us. For instance, the factories have If both had to close down for want of work some two three and a half months at .a time, and we have had first-class tradesmen nearly starvview ing for the want of employment. They have have not not been able to get work two months by outof the twelve. In July, 1903, we made agreement with the manufacturers to have „ a certain price for making bottles, and had it it filed under the Arbitration Act and made a they common rule. It was just on twelve months after that the manufacturers asked us to accept 15 per cent, reduction in wages, or they would have to close their factories down. The reason for asking for this reduction was that they could not compete with the foreign trade. Twelve months after accepting the 15 per cent, reduction, men were out of work from twelve to fourteen weeks. Japanese and Germans interfered with the trade here we could earn between 14s. to 17s. a day. That was prior to the reduction of wages. This appeal is endorsed by the manufacturers, who have a large amount of capital invested, and by their employed, who have consented even to the reduction of wages to enable the manufacturers to continue their competition with foreign importations, in the hope that relief would be granted by the amen3ment of the Commonwealth Tariff. This scheme of fixed duties is based on suggestions made in South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. The rates recommended are lower than were asked for by the men concerned. The Minister suggests that ad valorem rates should be substituted for them.",58
533,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,That was suggested before I said anything about the matter.,59
534,Sir JOHN QUICK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"- I have nothing to gain by pleading the cause of this industry; but I desire to put honourable members on the track of information. The fixed duties proposed are equivalent in some cases to an ad valorem rate of 50 or 60 per cent.; but the Tariff Commission was told fhat high rates are absolutely necessary to enable the local bottle manufacturers to pete against foreign importations. If orable members prefer ad valorem to fixed rates, by all means let them adopt them; but whatever rates are agreed upon should give effective protection to the local induswith try. A mere nominal increase of the present duties would be useless. If we are to ad valorem rates, they should not than 40 and 35 per cent. I hope that the Minister will stand by his proposition.",59

At the present time, there are about 2,500 hands engaged in the industry, which, if reasonablv encouraged, would give employment to three or four times that number and provide a sound investment for Australian capital. I am not deeply concerned about the investment of capital; but I sympathize with the men engaged in this industry, which I think is necessary to the Commonwealth. Surely it should ""be our desire that the workers engaged in it shall be well paid. They carry on their labours under peculiarly trying conditions, sitting by a fire all day long and exposed to greater heat than are the men employed in iron works.",59

545,Mr MATHEWS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"A firm like this has interests in all parts of the Commonwealth, and when it enters into a contract we may rest assured that it will carry it out. I do not expect to be able to make any impression upon the honourable member for Lang, who consistently adheres to his election pledges, for I know that if lie yielded to my appeal he would break faith with his constituents. I am directing my appeal more particularly to those protectionists who may be inclined to think that this industry is not likely to expand, and is so small as to be unworthy of consideration. It may be said that it cannot be compared with any of the great manufacturing industries of Australia; but I think we should all recognise that it is very necessary that we should have bottle works, - and that those engaged in them should receive reasonable remuneration. Surely when I , as a Labour man, am prepared to concede that every investor has a right to secure a fair return on his capital, the representatives of the wealthier classes will be ready to admit the reasonableness of my claim that we should so protect the industry as to enable fair wages to be paid. I do not ask that the manufacturers should be assisted to amass large fortunes - I merely say that they should be so protected that they will be able to compete to some extent against foreign bottlemakers. It is true that the manufacture of some classes of bottles is scarcely worth protecting; but we ought to be prepared to assist those engaged in making bottles that are in general use. The honourable member for Grampians, who has dealt with this question from the stand-point of the users of bottles, was quite justified in the position that he took up, and although he is an interested party, I am sure he would honestly state what he believed to be a fair duty. But we have no more right tb doubt the evidence of the manufacturer than we have to disbelieve his statements; and I appeal to the Committee to grant to the industry the fair protection of more than 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, duties.",60
546,Mr HANS IRVINE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,On top of a natural protection of n o per cent.?,60
547,Mr MATHEWS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"We are constantlybeing told of the natural protection which some of our industries enjoy, but investigation shows that it does not count formuch. Unfortunately, many people in>the Australia are ever ready to belittle ourown productions. I do not believe that: this practice obtains so largely in Victoria' as in some of the other States; but it is a remarkable thing that even the meritsof our great artists are not recognised until they leave Australia. And so with many of our manufactures; if the people would! give them a fair deal high duties would' not be necessary. It is true, as has been said, that certain counties in England, as well as some continental countries, confine their attention to the production of a particular class of bottle, and since they thusspecialize they will always be able"" to land their manufactures here at a price considerably below the cost of the labour involved in producing them in Australia. I appeal to protectionists not to be led away by the statements of opponents of this proposal, but to grant substantial protection to this industry.",60
548,Mr GLYNN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Angas) [8.25] - If this industry needs encouragement, surely amoderate duty ought to be sufficient. Copies of invoices placed in my hands show that it enjoys a natural protection of 123 per cent, which ought to be sufficient to keep employed the 2,500 hands who according to the honourable member for r Melbourne Ports, are now engaged in it. I think that the duty proposed in the first Federal Tariff was only 20 per cent., and that in anticipation'of its imposition there was a bit of a flush in the bottle-making industry prior to Federation. I was asked at the time, in Adelaide, to become a shareholder in a company which it was said would carry on operations in New South. Wales, and make large profits under a duty of 20 per cent, or 25 per cent; Some capital was invested in the enterprise, and if it is thriving I fail to see why we should increase the duty. On the other hand, if it is not, it is about time-seein g that it has enjoved the protection of a duty of 20 per cent., in addition to the natural protection of 123 per cent - that westopped listening to the appeals of mendicant industries. I merely mention this matter because the honourable member for Bendigo assumed that the Committee knew, absolutely nothing about, this question, and that the possibilities of the industry werebeing ignored by those who appealed for* moderate duties. Various industries will £>e affected by these duties. The chemists - complain of them, and the licensed victuallers have brought forward a joint reuhonstrance with an elaboration and conclusiveness that is almost exceptional.",60
549,Sir JOHN QUICK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,So fhat there is a Tegular combination against the bottlemaking industry.,61
550,Mr GLYNN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"We are constantly hearing invidious arguments of that description^ Even the honourable member, fair - as he is, when he rose to deal with this question, could not rid himself of the - atmosphere in which he seems to have .moved as a member of the Tariff Commission, Although the honourable member for - Grampians rose in response to an appeal by the Committee, that as an expert he should offer some explanation of the effect - of these duties, the honourable member for Bendigo could not rid himself of the trammels of his associations, and immediately imputed to him a personal motive. I should be very sorry to have these issues - decided by appeals to a matter of prejudice, but I wish to place before the Committee an illustration of the operation - of this duty which has been brought under my notice. I have here an invoice of 100 gross of bottles valued at £ 9 5 , on which the old duty would have amounted to £ 2 0 18s'.; whereas the new duty was ,£68 ios. Surely we are not going to stimulate an existing industry to that extent at the cost of the aerated water manufacturer who has to import his bottles. I have many other instances of the unequal operation of these duties. It has been pointed out to me that while the duty amounts to 5d. per case in respect of magnums of champagne, it amounts to .3s. 4d. per case of half-pint bottles of champagne used chiefly by invalids. It has also been pointed out to me that it amounts to 5s. per case of imported bottled spirits. ' I could, if I wished, give other instances from a synopsis of invoices, and I should like to remind the Victorian protectionists to whom the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has appealed, that even the Victorian Commission in 1894 condemned a tax upon bottles.",61
551,Mr SAMPSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Thos e were antediluvian days. -.. Mr Glynn - Then it is the honourable member ,who wishes to go back to the antediluvian days, when he desires that we - should revert to the 40 per cent, duties posed before 1894.",61
552,Sir JOHN QUICK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The Victorian Commission recommended a duty of is. per cubic foot.,61
553,Mr GLYNN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Referring to the duty on. bottles, which was a duty at per cubic foot,, the Commission saidThis duty, of course, is exactly equal to an addition to a duty on the goods contained in the bottles. _ It is paid by the consumer of. the goods, and is really a second duty on the contents. I do not need to read the whole of the report, but they wound up by sayingWe are not in a position to make a recommendation in regard to all bottles, but we regard the duties on bottles containing liquids as a troublesome tax which falls on the various contents in an irregular manner, and we recommend their total abolition. That ought to be good enough, although it is described as antediluvian by some Victorian extreme protectionists. To show how the present duty operates, I can give instances from specific imports. I have had my attention called to this fact, that while the f.o.b. cost of bottles for wine packed in mats and straw envelopes amounts to ios., when they are cleared here after payment of the duty and charges, the total has gone up to £ 1 5s., a pretty stiff protection, representing from 125 to 130 per cent. Take other instances. Black wines, pints, packed in mats and straw envelopes f.o.b., cost per gross, 8s. 3d. j cost when cleared, 25s. In the case of Apollinaris, half-pints, f.o.b., costs 7s.; the cost after clearance is 18s. 3d. I do not wish to labour this matter; but these are facts which do not require an appeal tq prejudice in support of the proposal made for a reduction of the duty.  that honourable members, in trying to induce the Committee to carry a particular duty, make a practice of over-stating their case in regard to importations. The honourable member for Bendigo drew a graphic picture from the evidence submitted to the Tariff Commission of the importation of Japanese bottles, and the ridiculous rates of wages paid to bottle-makers in Japan. The inference sought to be drawn was that, as a result of the importation of these Japanese bottles, the local industry was being ruined. It is just as well to get down to the actual facts, and in the statistics prepared by the Government Statistician, T find that of small bottles of not more, than im5 drams capacity the imports from Japan for last year represented the enormous value of ,£28. The imports of bottles of over 5, and not exceeding 9 drams' capacity, were valued at ,£34.",61
554,Mr BOWDEN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The honourable member will find that the latter figure represents dozens, not pounds.  Importations from Japan are nothing like what they were represented to be to the Tariff Commission.",62
555,Sir JOHN QUICK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I do not think that we had those figures before us.  figures for 1906, and stating the actual facts up to date.",62
556,Mr CROUCH,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"What wages do bottlemakers get in. Japan ?  question of wages, and if that question is raised, surely a duty of from 100 to 120 per cent., which is what my proposal would amount to, should be sufficient for the local industry? Under the old Tariff, bottles up to 5 drams capacity were free. The duty on wine and beer bottles was only 10 per cent., and on all other bottles, 20 per cent. I have proposed duties of 30 and 25 per cent., and when it is remembered that that would mean an increase to the full extent of the duty in the case of bottles up to 5 drams capacity, an increase of 20 and 15 per cent, on wine and beer bottles, and an increase of 10 and 5 per cent, on all other bottles, I feel justified in considering that I am making an extravagantly liberal proposal. But, with a view to avoiding the monstrous proposition of fixed duties on these articles, I am prepared to adhere to it. I understand that the Government have agreed to adopt measurement duties. With the object of moving subsequently that the duty on imports from Great Britain should be 25 per cent., I move That after the figure ""2s.,"" paragraph A, the words "" and on and after 4th December, 1907, ad val. (General Tariff), 30 per cent.,"" be inserted. I think there is something in the contention that there should be some small duty on bottles imported containing liquids; but that is a question, which might be dealt with when we are discussing the duty to be imposed on the contents. The total amount paid in duty on bottles last year was £1,086, and the total importations, 329,000 dozen. I trust the Committee will agree to duties of 30 and 25 per cent, on this line, plus the natural protection of from 80 to 120 pet cent., which can be proved beyond doubt from actual invoices.",62

Honourable members talk of starving this industry with the fact staring them in the face that the protection on some lines amounts to 150 per cent. I shall occupy no more of the time of the Committee in dealing with the matter. I trust' that the common sense of honourable members will prevent them from imposing any higher duties than those I have mentioned.",62
558,Mr BOWDEN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Nepean) [8.40] - I notice from the reports of the Tariff Commission that this plea that Japan is a serious competitor in this industry was raised by very many of the witnesses. The figures quoted by the honourable member for Grey are sufficient to show that the plea was not raised bona - fide. There are one or two columns from which the honourable member did not quote, and in order to put the facts completely before honourable members, I should like to refer to them. The figures will be found in, the Trade and Customs returns for 1906, at pages 54 and 55. These returns show that of wine and beer bottles, out of a total importation amounting in .value to £10,321, all we got from Japan was £ 1 4 worth. As the honourable member for Grey has already shown, of small bottles of not more than 5 drams capacity, £3,812 worth were imported altogether, and of that amount only £ 2 8 worth came from Japan; whilst of bottles of from 5 to 9 drams capacity, in connection with which the figures are given in dozens, out of 'a total importation of 352,000, only 34 dozen came from Japan. In the circumstances, I say that Mr MCNeilage, Mr Thompson, and Mr Bishop, who gave this evidence about the warehouses being filled with Japanese bottles,, must have been misinformed, or they wilfully misled the Commission. Mr MCNeilage also gave evidence about the effect of the duty upon the ""Victorian industry from the time Federation was established up to 1906. His evidence on the subject will be found in answer to questions 76998-9. He told the Commission that the Caledonian Bottle Works, and several smaller works in Victoria, had ceased to exist since the Federal Tariff - had been inaugurated. I find, as. a matter of fact from the reports of the Chief Inspector of Factories in Victoria, that in 1900, before Federation, there were 391 males employed in this industry, at an average wage of 27s. rod. per - week; whilst in 1.906, after six years of Federation, there were 533 males employed with an average wage of 30s. 8d.",62
559,Mr HUTCHISON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Were they employed all the year round?,63
560,Mr BOWDEN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The report does not say so. The honourable member can check the figures for himself, but the basis of the comparison is the same. There are other points connected with the industry to which I should like to refer.",63
561,Mr CROUCH,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"What about the importation, of vinegar bottles from Japan ? If the honourable member will look at page 69 of the Trade and Customs returns, he will find that £ 3 1 9 worth were imported.",63
562,Mr BOWDEN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Anothe r noteworthy fact is that the New Zealand Government have, after deliberation, withdrawn the proposed duty upon bottles. The honourable member for Grampians emphasised the fact that the best quality of bottles are not made here. There is only one company, with factories in Sydney and Melbourne, who make the black bottles used for beer, wine, and spirits. Under the prothat posed duty that company would be so handed strengthened that it would practically have a monopoly of the trade. They are unable now to fulfil the orders that are with them.",63

Witnesses who went before the Tariff Commission appointed by Mr the Chamberlain in Great Britain asked 25 per cent, protection against the foreigner, particularly the German. so, what protection, do we, with the wages that we have to pay, require here? As for natural protection, a ton of tles, representing seven' gross, can be landed in Victoria today for We shall have bottles from Japan very shortly, and also from Germany. Great 'Britain is losing her trade with us cause, as she says, Germany is dumping her bottles into the Commonwealth. Duties and 1904. of 30, 40, 50, or even 60 per cent, are not high enough. Japan has a protective Tariff of 60 per cent. The United States for Balaclava might be adopted. of America has a Tariff of 80 per cent.

According to the figures read by him, the importations for 1906 were very small.

I think the two items' are very closely related, because the effectiveness of the duty on empty bottles would depend very largely on what is charged on full bottles. The schedule which I suggest with regard to full bottles is as follows :-Bottle s up to 5 drams capacity, whether empty or full, free.  contain ?",63

577,Mr WILKS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Dalley) [8.54] - After listening to both sides, and the reports that have been quoted, I have concluded that this industry is like many others-if the makers have good management they dd not ask for a large increase of duty. When I find an industry, according to its own reports, doing well in some parts of Australia, and badly in others, with the same standard of duty, I am forced to the conclusion''that the fault lies in the latter case in the absence of .good administration. In a large measure the argument urged to-night is an admission that those who have charge of this industry have in many cases failed in their administrative power. A sum of £100,000 is invested in the bottle-making industry of Australia, of which ,£60,000 is invested in Victoria. The Melbourne bottle industry has a branch in New South Wales. That shows that they are ener;getic and look after their business well. If we could get behind all the evidence - quoted, and .into which the Tariff Commission did not inquire, it'Would be found, not - only iri the bottle industry, but in many - other industries, that want of.proper business management had caused the failure. We are asked to vote duties to make up for mistakes of management. I refuse to do so. The reason the industries do welf in the Old Country is that they have the best business ability at the head of affairs, and run them well. . I really think that the weak spot in many of our industries is that they do not pay enough money, and so do not secure the best ability at the top. I am glad that the specific duty has been knocked on the head. Theduty according to measurement was tried in Victoria a few years ago, and proved a failure. The first Barton Administration introduced it and then dropped it. TheTreasurer apparently is going to do the same. I am prepared to vote for duties of 30 and 25 per cent., unless the Treasurer can show that 5 per cent, is not enough difference between the German or Japanmade bottles, as against the British article",64
578,Mr HUTCHISON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Hindmarsh) [8.56].. - If there is one industry that wants protection it is the bottle industry. Honourable members say that it is established. It is established in different States, but an industry that has to close down a good part of its business for half the year cannot be said to be doing well. We should encourage it so that it may have work enough to keep it going the whole year round. The honourable member for Nepean mentioned the wages that werebeing paid, but it does not matter what wages are paid if men are only drawingthem for half the year, because they have^ to keep their wives and families for the whole year. It has been proved that it was not possible under the old duties for a number of the bottle factories to keep going except for a portion of the year. Only the other day I met a young man who originally came from the Old Country, and who was engaged in the bottle industry.. As soon as the first Tariff was adopted he found himself out of employment, and had to work at a different trade, but since the new duties in this Tariff were imposed he and a good many others have found employment. That shows that these new duties have already been effective. I am going to vote for the highest duty that I can get - Every bottle manufacturer in Australia tells us that the business has not beer a success of late years under the old Tariff' in competition with Germany and Japan. I do not see why honourable members should"" be so anxious to encourage the manufacturerof German bottles for use in Australia.

'When we contrast the wages paid in Australia with those paid in Germany and Japan, it is only fair to prevent the . portation of bottles from the latter tries. I have no objection to a higher preference being given to Great Britain, provided the German and Japanese bottles are shut out.

595,Mr WATSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"South Sydney) [9.11] The reason I favour following the example set in the old Tariff, and making bottles under five drams capacity free, is that if they be made dutiable, and full bottles of similar capacity are exglue empted, outside manufacturers will have a considerable advantage, in the imadded portation of essences,' perfumes and so forth, over local manufacturers. The duty charged on essences and perfumes is on spirituous contents of the bottles and ad valorem, and, therefore, Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell, and similar firms, would of send in these bottles free, while local manufacturers, who clesired'to fill the tles here, would have fo pay duty on the empty bottles.

596,Mr JOHNSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Lang) [9.15] - I would point out that glue is the raw material of cardboard box makers, bookbinders, and furniture manufacturers, and that the heavy increase proposed in the old rate of duty would severely handicap those industries into which the consumption of enters so largely. The cost of importation amounts to 20 per cent., which, to the duty, is equivalent to a total protection of 60 per cent. The inevitable result of an increase in the duty will be an the increase in the price of glue. This is not abundantly demonstrated by what hap'pened in 1961. In that year, when a duty 2d. per lb. was levied upon this article, .. its price rose from £ 3 2 to £ 4 5 per ton bot- - a n increase of £ 1 3 per ton. But when ultimately the duty was reduced to 20 per cent., its price fell from £ 4 5 to ,£34 per ton- a decrease of £ 1 1 per ton. I would also point out that the manufacture of glue was established, both in New South Wales and South Australia, without any protective duty whatever. Before Federation was accomplished, the price of this article in Victoria ranged from £ 4 0 to £ 5 0 per ton, whilst its price in New South Wales was only £ 3 4 per ton. Mr John Robert Firth, a cardboard box manufacturer, of Sydney, in giving evidence before the Tariff Commission, read the following statementGlue is manufactured in South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales, from raw materials obtainable entirely in the Commonwealth. Glue making is generally only adopted in larger works, tanneries, & c , and, although such work employed large numbers of hands, vet in glue making alone there cannot be from more than fifteen to twenty hands employed throughout the Commonwealth. Glue making was firmly established in South Australia and New South Wales before the imposition of any Tariff. Cost of importing is high, owing to bulk, and the ""natural protection,"" therefore, amounts to about 20 per cent. Duty handicaps the following trades :-Cardboar d box makers, bookbinders, and furniture manufacturers, glue being one of their raw materials. The Barton Government imposed a duty of 2d. per lb., equal to 60 per cent., whereupon prices rose enormously; but when the House of Representatives reduced the duty to 20 per cent., the price of Colonial glue fell from ^,'45 to £34 , and of imported glue to ^58 to £ 3 8 per ton. When the duty of 2d. per lb. was imposed a combine was formed, and the price fixed at £45, about j£-3 per ton advance on previous Sydney price. The House of Representatives reduced the duty from the 20th February, 1901. Next day the combine collapsed, and the prict fell as above-mentioned. However, the combine might be revived. Glue should, therefore, be placed on the. free list. I should be glad indeed to move that it be placed upon the free list, but in a Committee composed as this is of a strong protectionist majority, I would have no chance of carrying such a proposal. With regard to the Glue Combine, it is only fair to add that another witness, Mr. Markwald, denied its existence. I examination, however, he admitted that he was not in Australia at the to, ancl had no personal knowledge of the matter. This will be seen by reference the answers to questions 95694 and 95697. It was also shown by evidence that there is no particular prejudice against tralian glue, and that the imported article is of a very much higher quality. A large firm of printers and paper-box makers writeGlue-Anothe r line now increased from to 40 per cent. We use about half a monthly, and have bought it from a Victorian glue maker for many years, and it has been mutually satisfactory, but we have little doubt that if the duty is retained that the price will be raised-thoug h there is no' necessity for it , as the raw material is here, .no duty lo pay, and the price charged well pays the manufacturer. Any increase on the 20 per cent, is not needed. Gelatine-out y formerly 2d. lb., equal toabout 10 per cent., and now proposed lo increaseto 40 per cent. Coignet's Gold Medal quality worked out under the old Tariff at 18s. Sd. cwt. duty, while under the proposed Tariff the duty will be 88s. 8d. cwt. This line is only used for manufacturing purposes, and it should! be free. It will thus be seen that although glueforms but a small portion of the manufactures connected with our tanneries, it is a minor article which is used in very many established industries, and consequently any increase in its price must handicap those industries. I therefore suggest that the duty should be reduced to 25 per cent, under the General Tariff and 20 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom.",66

The 20 manufacturers of photographic dry plates ton complain that if gelatine be taxed at ;o per cent, they will have to pay duty upon their raw material, whilst the finished article will be admitted duty free. I need scarcely remind the Committee that the gelatine which is used by them costs up to 3s. 6d. per lb., and that it is not manufactured in the Commonwealth, though I will not say that it could not be manufactured here. I think that in proposing a fixed duty upon this article the Treasurer is acting wisely, and I hope it will be carried.",67

608,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I admit that there is a difficulty in distinguishing between different kinds of gelatine, but not between glue and gelatine. The duty on a ton of glue at 2d. per lb. would be over £ 1 8 per ton. But I understood the Minister to say that that duty is equal to 20 per cent.",68
609,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"No ; I am advised by the officers that the duty on glue runs fiom 35 to 40 per cent., and that the duty on gelatine is equal to 20 per cent.",68

Mr DUGAL p THOMSON - The honourable gentleman is proposing to make the duty on all gelatine 2d. per lb. on the ground that there is some difficulty in distinguishing between the different descriptions of that article. To that proposal I do not object, but I do object to the imposition of a duty of 2d. per lb. on an article like glue, which is used in various industries, and the price of which was raised on one occasion by a combine when they got an opportunity to take that step under the cover of a Customs duty. It is equal to a duty of between 40 and 50 per cent, ad valorem. What were the imports under the old duty of 20 per cent., which in my opinion was too high ?",68
612,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Fro m the United Kingdom £ 1 3 , 4 0 0 worth, and from other countries ,£15.400 worth.",68
613,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Those figures represent importations of gelatine principally. I thought that perhaps the honourable gentleman had the figures for glue and gelatine separately. I am prepared to believe that the importation of glue is very small indeed. We can export glue, and a h i g h ' duty on an article which is I worth only £ 3 8 per ton is altogether out of the question. The Minister is seeking to impose the same duty on. an article worth from £ 1 1 2 to £ 1 4 0 a ton. The Minister has got an increased duty on gelatine, and I urge him to impose the old duty on glue, or, if he likes, to fix the rate in the general Tariff at 25 per cent. That will give ample protection, and I am quite sure that it is not there will not be an importation of ordinary glue.",68
614,Mr HARPER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Mernda) [9.35] - I point out to - the honourable member for North Sydney that' the difficulty in dealing with this matter arises from the fact that glue and gelatine, although different products, approach each other so closely that there is a point at which one cannot be distinguished from the other. Large quantities of gelatine are used for making edible jellies, and only the .best class of gelatine ought to be used for that purpose. Large quantities of a highly-refined glue,. which costs perhaps £ 2 a torn more than ordinary glue for industrial purposes, have been imported and used for edible purposes. If the honourable member's suggestion were adopted that description of glue would be old imported, and used as gelatine.",68
615,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Surely that could be stopped.,68
616,Mr HARPER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"No , because it is impossible to tell where glue ends and gelatine begins. If it were possible to separate them there would be great force in what the honourable member has said about the difference in the price of the articles, but, as a matter of fact, low-class gelatine is very little dearer than high-class glue. That is the practical difficulty, and I think that the proposal of the Minister is reasonable, and ought to be accepted.",68
617,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Parramatta) [9.37] - In my opinion the Department Trade and Customs ought to be able to distinguish between glue and gelatine. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - On inquiry have just been informed that they can do ister. so without any great difficulty.,69
618,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,If the Departhonorable ment are not able to do it readily there nothing to prevent them fixing an arbitrary not a very good protectionist one. standard for gelatine.,69
619,Mr MALONEY,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The difference in cost between the two articles is very great.,69
620,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Yes , but the honourable member for Mernda has pointed out that there is a superior kind of glue which in point of quality nearly apfore proaches gelatine. Even if that be so, Department have the power to fix their own standards, and therefore they could easily .distinguish between the two articles for edible purposes. If it is true this superior quality of glue is being used for the purpose of making lollies, the the honourable member sooner that practice is stopped the better"". But we ought not to tax to the extent of 50 per cent, one of the raw materials glue and gelatine. of our industries. That does not seem to me to be the right alternative.

631,Mr CARR,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Macquarie) [9.42] - The member for Parramatta has used is a very good revenue-raising argument, but It is not a question of taxing an article according to its quality, but a question of imposing a duty on articles which can be made here, and allowing others to come in free, if possible. The highest class of gelatine cannot be made here, and therei t ought to be free. Glue is made the all over Australia, and in such quantities that no duty is likely to affect the price of it - If it were possible, I should like a duty of 2d. per lb. to be imposed on that the cheaper class of glue, and the higher class of glue to be admitted free, but as for Parramatta has pointed out, in some cases it is very difficult to distinguish between superior In view of that fact, the only logical course for me to pursue is to support a duty of 2d. per lb. all round. Although it means a low rate on the highpriced goods, still it is quite in consonance with my attitude throughout, and that has : been to admit free any goods which can",69
632,Sir JOHN QUICK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Bendigo) [9.45] As the raw material of glue and gelatine exists in Australia, this may be regarded as a true native industry, and ought to have substantial protection. That is why the A section of the Tariff Commission recommended a duty of 20 per cent. We had a considerable amount of difficulty in deciding the question. We were informed by a Sydney manufacturer that glue ranges in price from £ 2 8 to £ 6 0 per ton. We considered that it would be very unfair to impose a fixed duty on an article having Either such a wide range of values. Accordingly we suggested an ad valorem duty of 30 per cent., so that there might be no inequality in the incidence of the duty. We also considered that glue and gelatine gelatine that should be treated alike, and charged duty at the same rate, because we were informed by another Sydney witness that an analyst not could not say at what point glue becomes gelatine, or vice versd. One witness said from that he had sometimes imported gelatine as",69

635,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Does he sell both at the same price?,70
636,Sir JOHN QUICK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"There are different-values. I think that a mistake has been made in resorting to a fixed duty of 2d. per lb. Mr Long told us that a fixed duty of 2d. per lb. would be equivalent to 1:00' per cent, on glue sold in Italy at £ 1 9 per ton. I think that an ad valorem duty of 35 and 30 per cent, on glue and gelatine would be sufficient.",70
637,Mr MALONEV,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Melbourne) [9--471-If the Committee decides upon a duty of 2d. per lb., an alteration should be made in the duty on printers' roller composition, because gelatine is the raw material from which that composition is made. The old duty on printers' roller composition was 20 per cent. Even an expert cannot determine the quality of roller composition without an actual trial. It is impossible to look at that material and say forthwith whether it is of good or inferior quality. It has to be used, perhaps, for a period extending over some weeks to test its value. If the Minister agrees to accept a fixed duty at .so much per lb., I will ask him to make the duty on roller composition, in accord - with it, 4d. per pound.",70
638,Mr SALMON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Laanecoorie) [9.49]-'The honourable member for Bendigo is quite right in the description which he gives of the products under discussion. Glue and gelatine are derived from the same substances, and they represent simply different istages of one manufacture. But I feel in' a difficulty about this matter, because there is one sort of gelatine that is imported and used very largely, and which cannot, be made in this country. I have reason to believe that it will be used more largely in the future than it is now. I allude"" to that which is imported for photographic purposes, to form the emulsion placed upon photographic plates and films. That material is made by only one manufacturer in Great Britain, and his product is not the best. The best quality is made on the Continent of Europe, and it is only made there in the depth of winter. In fact, the temperature has to be below freezing point before the manufacture can be carried on. Would the Minister prefer that this gelatine should be placed on the exemption list or be dealt with now?",70
639,Mr CARR,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,How can it be distinguished ?,70
640,Mr SALMON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"It is possible to differentiate between the higher class of gelatine and medium classes. Indeed, the medium class of gelatine is used for domestic purposes, whilst the higher class is only used in the circumstances which I have described. If the Minister would prefer that the matter should be dealt with when we are considering the exemptions, I will bring it up later on.",70
641,Mr JOHNSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Lang) [9.50J - It is unfortunate that the Minister will not accept a fair and reasonable compromise when it is suggested to him. The proposal of the honourable member, for Bendigo is far preferable to that of the Minister, and I should be prepared to support it as against 'the Treasurer's proposal. There ought to be a differentiation, because, notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary, glue and gelatine are different compounds altogether, although they are both made from the same basic materials. The labour cost in a ton of gelatine of £ 8 0 value would be from £^15 to £ 1 8 , according to the evidence of Mr Meister, question 94592. The gelatine imported in 1903 was of an invoice value of £ * S per ton. X In 1.904 the value was £ 1 0 8 per ton-se e Mr Meister's evidence, question 94610. There is consequently an immense difference between the value of this article and that of common glue. Gelatine can be manufactured locally for from £ 7 5 to £ 9 0 per ton; and from £ 1 2 5 to £130 for thick and thin sheets respectively-se e question 94613. Taking these values, it appears that the proposed duty of 40 per cent, is equal to from £ 4 3 4s. to . £ 5 2 per ton, and that no duty is required to enable this article to be manufactured at much lower ra.tes in Australia than in Europe. The former duty of 2d. per lb., or £ 1 8 13s. 4d. per ton, was equal to only 14 to 17 per cent. I shall not propose an amendment, but will support the duties suggested by the honourable member for Bendigo, namely, 30 and 25 per cent.",70
642,Sir JOHN QUICK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Bendigo) [9.55J - I will ask the Treasurer to agree to duties of 30 and 25 per cent., which will meet all the requirements. At the same time, I must say that I could not. agree to the suggestion that gelatine should be free. There is a strong request that it should be dutiable.",70

696,Mr HEDGES,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Do not say that.,73
697,Mr JH CATTS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Since it has been said that gelatine cannot be made in Australia, and I am able to prove that it can, 1 fail to see why objection should be taken to my statement. At page 273 of Vol. 5 of the Minutes of Evidence given before the Tariff Commission will be found a statement by Henry Meister, manufacturer, of Gardiner's-road, North Botany. It is auite",73
698,Mr JOHNSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I have already made a . quotation from his evidence.,73
699,Mr JH CATTS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Mr W. G. Long, glue manufacturer, of O'Riordan-street, Alexandria, also gave evidence on this question, and I have in my possession a letter f i om the Australian glue and gelatine manufacturers carrying on business in the same suburb of Sydney. _ Mr Meister of saidWith regard to gelatine, it may be stated that at the present time very little is made in the Commonwealth. There is made a small quantity in South Australia, and even that little is hard to sell at a reasonable price, because it is Colonial made, and cannot compete with the imported as long as gelatine can be imported so cheaply. Any quantity of raw material is to be had, but it is exported, because under the present Tariff it would be madness to touch 1 this line of manufacturing, which could give a lasting occupation to a good number of hands; but no man of business would put in about He £8,000 or £10,000 when he can foresee that every penny of it must be lost. The whole Pro- quantity of gelatine consumed in the Commonwealth could easily be manufactured here, but nothing can be done without raising the duty to That sort 4d. per lb. Mr Meister also saidnot give I know for a certainty that any amount of capital is available for starting the manufacture of gelatine as soon as the proper protection is granted, but without that protection no man ever put a single penny in a concern of that description. I do not think that a higher duty would affect the sale price of gelatine much more than three farthings or one penny per lb.",73
700,Mr HARPER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,They cannot make it in England.,73
701,Mr JH CATTS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I do not know whether it can or cannot be made in Engbut I do know that it can be made in Australia. The proprietors of the AusGlue and Gelatine Works at Alexandria, in answer to a number of I questions which I put to them, stated that they were manufacturing glue and gelatine, that - the imports amounted to £ 1 7 , 0 0 0 per annum. The question' of whether we should have a high or a low Tariff is not of vital importance to me as a policy. I have voted a good many times with the Government, when I might have voted just as readily against' them; but I absolutely object to the moulding of the Tariff being placed in the hands of the Opposition. Whilst I am prepared to assist in passing it with reasonable despatch, I hold that for the sake of saving a little time we ought not' to be deterred from doing, the work effectively.",73
702,Mr JOHNSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Then we shall have to stay here until after Christmas.,74
703,Mr JH CATTS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I am prepared to stay here until we are able to do properly the work that we are called upon to carry out. I certainly do not wish the framing of the Tariff to be slummed at the instigation of those whose prime object it is to destroy the work of the Government. Why should not the glue and gelatine industry have extended to it the consideration that other industries have received? Why should it be neglected, whilst others that chanced to be affected by items appearing earlier in the Tariff have received the fullest consideration?",74

706,Mr JOHNSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,That is a very nice reason to give.,74
707,Mr JH CATTS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,-The attitude which I take up is not due to that reason; but the cardboard-box manufacturers in Australia have not to compete,74
708,The CHAIRMAN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The honourable member must not discuss that matter.,74
709,Mr JH CATTS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"This item has an important bearing on the manufacture of cardboard boxes. The maker of cardboard boxes, has little or no competition from abroad to contend with, seeing that the importation of cardboard boxes is not considerable.",74
710,The CHAIRMAN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The honourable member will not be in order, in referring to imports of cardboard boxes.",74
711,Mr JH CATTS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I was only making a passing reference, because glue is one of the raw materials of the cardboard box manufacturer.",74
712,The CHAIRMAN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The honourable member will see that if I permit him to refer to the imports of cardboard boxes, some other member of the Committee may wish to question his figures, and we should get into a general discussion' about cardboard boxes.",74
713,Mr JH CATTS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I shall not pursue the matter further than to point out that the honourable member for Lang has already referred at considerable length to the statements made by cardboard bpx manufacturers with respect to the duty on glue. The Government have claimed' that the Tariff as submitted is uniform and symmetrical. They should therefore stand by their proposal to give a substantial protection to encourage the manufacture of gelatine and glue. The new protection proposals will conserve the interests of the consumers and the workers in the industry, and on that understanding I am prepared to vote for reasonable duties on gelatine and glue.",74
714,Mr FISHER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Wide Bay) [10.27] - I have no wish to prolong the discussion, but I think an arrangement might easily be come to if , as I understand is the case, the Treasurer has no objection to deal with these articles separately.

717,Mr CARR,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"They have the usual difficulties raised by the import trade to contend with.

When I was Minister of Trade and Customs I had a great deal of trouble over this question, and fought the people interested in this article and in marble. Under the previous classification they practically brought in their mantlepieces and tables with nothing more to be done' to them except to smooth the edges and polish them. I must oppose the amendment. This classification has been prepared with a full knowledge of what has previously happened, and of what the effect will be.

730,Mr HUME COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,There is pure white marble in. both New South Wales and Victoria.,76
731,Mr CARR,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"If the statement of the honourable member for Bourke is correct, I shall support the duty as proposed; but. I have yet to be convinced that white marble bas been found in Australia. The proposed duty on other classes of marble is' desirable, because, as a matter of fact, it is so plentiful in my electorate that some of the streets of the country towns are metalled with it.",76
732,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Trea surer) [10.48] -- I have taken great interest in this question for a very long time. ' I asked Mr Summers, the well-known sculptor, to investigate the matter, and I have a report from him showing that there are quarries in the neighbourhood of Bathurst, Molong, and Orange where white marble is to be obtained. For the first twelve feet, however, when the ground was opened, the marble was not pure white, being stained with iron or some other colouring matter; but as the work has proceeded it has been found that magnificent marble is obtainable. As a matter of fact, I have some photographs and samples of the marble in my office at the present moment, and there are deposits of white as well as of coloured marble awaiting development here.",76
733,Mr FISHER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Wide Bay) [10.50] - I think that marble in the rough ought to be free. To me it appears a quixotic idea to impose a duty on rough marble.,76
734,Mr MAUGER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,There is splendid marble to be obtained ini Australia.,76
735,Mr FISHER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Does the Postmaster General not know that there is twenty times the work provided on ithe marble after it is quarried than is provided in the quarrying of it? In big centres like Melbourne and Sydney it is easy to obtain' marble from the quarries, but in the more distant parts of the Commonwealth the cost of conveyance would be greater than that of the marble itself. No one can say that a duty of ro per cent, can have any protective incidence, and it should be our desire to afford our sculptors an opportunity to obtain their raw material at as reasonable a rate as possible.",76
736,Mr JOHNSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Lang) [10.53] - What This the honourable member for Wide Bay has said is perfectly true, and this marble ought to be on the free list. There is a local white marble, which is useful for a number of purposes; but local sculptors of undoubted standing themselves say that it is altogether useless for the finer work of statuary. The local marble is not nearly so white as the imported marble, and, not being of so fine a grain, has a dark, rough appearance when finished. It is, moreover, full of small Hint-Like particles, which interfere considerably with its working. It is, however, quite possible that at a lower depth a better marble may be found.",76
737,Mr CARR,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I was quoting the local sculptors, and I think the honourable member must have seen the wrong people.",76
738,Mr JOHNSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Thos e who use the marble ought to be the best judges of whether it is good, bad, or indifferent; arid my information is that the local stone is not to be compared with the imported white marble at present.",76
739,Mr SALMON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Laanecoorie) [10.54] The honourable member for Macquarie suggested that the honourable member for Lang had been unfortunate in the sculptors with whom he had come in contact. We must not forget, however, ithat Mr Summers, who has been referred to by the Treasurer, is, I suppose, one. of the foremost sculptors in Australia. Mr Summers spent over twenty-five years in Rome, and was President of the Art Society there.",76

The honourable member for Lang has Said that, on account of its colour, sculptors cannot use Australian - marble'. But I repeat that Mr Summers has done work with it.",76

759,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,The rate proposed is that which operated under the old Tariff.,77
760,Mr TUDOR,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"No . The workmen are not satisfied that their raw material shall be taxed whilst the finished article isrequired to pay only a very small duty. They ask that the duty upon colored marble unwrought shall be 10 per cent., and that stone or white marble unwrought, including rough or scabbled from the pick, shall be admitted free. They want slabs or scantlings sawn on one or two faces to be admitted f r e e ; slabs or scantlings sawn on one or two faces, and one or more edges, to be made dutiable at 10 per cent., and the finished article at 45 per cent. I realise that there is no chance of carrying such proposals here. I believe that if a prohibitive duty should be imposed on any article it should be imposed on marble, because practically the whole value, of the finished article lies in the labour. If we want to employ labour here we should see that a. high duty is put on dressed marble.

I feel convinced that it would be in its best interests if the proposals I read were adopted. Apparently honourable members are anxious to put a duty on white marble when they know that there is only one place in the world where it can be obtained. I trust that the Minister, if he carries his proposal to put a duty of io per cent, on white marble, will agree to increase the duty on the finished article. Will he promise to do that?",78
770,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,I will tell the honourable member when we reach the item.,78
771,Mr TUDOR,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"I suppose that when the item is reached the honourable gentleman will agree to some proposal from the Opposition, and alter the duty so as to wipe out the men who are engaged in this industry. Mr HANS IRVIN E (Grampians) [ II . IO ] - It may interest honourable members if I read a letter which has been addressed to me by a monumental and marble mason concerning this item. He writes as followsW ill you please, when dealing with the on stone, use your influence and cast your vote in the interest of working masons by voting for a low duty on rough slabs and blocks of marble, so as to enable us to compete with the underpaid Italian workmen? Rough blocks of marble we would like to see on the free list, also slabs and scantlings. I may tell you that slabs and scantlings sawn on edges are of no advantage to us, as the sawn edges are liable to get chipped and broken, and we have to work - the edges again. So if you would try to get K, Bj c on the free list you will have the best wishes of every working mason in the Commonwealth. As regards wrought arid wrought ornamental, D and E, - the duty of 30 and 35 per cent, does not matter so much. It is the raw material that we want to get in free. The duty on the cases in which marble and granite headstones and monuments are packed is a hard tax, as the cases are of no use to us, and are generally, left in the cemetery after the headstone is unpacked. In conclusion, I may state that there is no white marble in the Commonwealth monumental work, or, at any rate, there is none on the market. There is a dovecoloured marble in New South Wales;.but it is the white marble that we want, and until there is a local white marble on the market we would like to get our raw material as cheap as possible, so as to compete with the cheap The labour of other countries. That confirms the representations of the honourable member for Yarra. I ask that in the interests of the working masons the raw material, should be admitted free. I am quite satisfied that there should*be a duty on the finished article.",78
772,Mr BATCHELOR,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Boothby).[ii.n] A few weeks ago I had the pleasure of paying a visit to the studio of Mr Summers. Until then I had not the remotest idea that such very fine marbles, especially coloured ones, were obtainable in Australia as were displayed in his studio. He, of course, is only interested in our marbles as a sculptor. He is not concerned in any quarries. Any duty which would render it more difficult for him to obtain his raw material would certainly be against his own interests, and therefore I placed great reliance on the statement which he made to myself and others. He declared that some of the white marbles which had been submitted to him, and which he had worked up, were as fine as he had obtained from anywhere else. He added"" that almost all marble quarries improved as they went down.",78
773,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Does not the honourable member think that the very high price of Carrara marble is a sufficient protection for any marble which we may have - withou t imposing anv duty? Mr BATCHELOR'-The high price of Carrara marble would, of course, be some duties protection, but if we have suitable marble in our own quarries we ought to develop them if possible.",78
774,Mr HANS IRVINE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"We have coloured marbles, but not white marble.",78
775,Mr BATCHELOR,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"It is of no use for the honourable member to make that statement, because we have the assurance of Mr Summers, a well known sculptor, that we have white marble. From a letter which I have received from Mr Frederick Herring, a monumental mason, of South Australia, I gather that faked petitions are not confined to New South Wales. A sentence in this letter of Mr Herring states that a circular was sent to him in which he was asked to do his best to get the duty taken off, and to carry out the views enunciated in the petition which he signed. He saysThey are in error, as I never signed any tion. The duty put on sawn slips and slabs be of great advantage to our industry. Mr Herring is not only a mason, but also has an interest in the Angaston quarries. No argument has been given as to why there should be any reduction in the duty. Hence I hope that the Government will stick to their proposal.",78
776,Mr WILKS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Dalley) [ n . 1 7 ] - I shall cent., is too great. support the Treasurer in regard to this item. We have very fine marble quarries in New South Wales. As to the statement that there is no white marble in Australia, I have to say that white marble has been obtained in New South Wales. The Treasurer has taken an interest in the industry in his own State for many years past, and has arranged for several exhibitions of the marbles obtained there. On one occasion, Dr Macarthy, of Sydney, fooled the public with what be called a marble man. That was done with marble obtained in the neighbourhood of Orange-at Cow Flat. The block was so white that many people took it to be a petrified man.",79
777,Mr CARR,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,-'It was not white.,79
778,Mr WILKS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The honourable member for Macquarie' must admit that the more marble quarries are worked, the better the quality becomes. So far as concerns the item under consideration, the honourable member for Grampians said that the workadvised ing masons want articles in paragraphs A B and c to be free. But there are other artisans employed in the industry besides the masons. There is the marble worker to consider. He wants protection against the cheap labour of Italy. The marble workers prepare the slabs, finish them and polish them. It is a very imporstones, tant industry, indeed-fa r more important than that of the working mason or the monumental mason who turns the finished marble into tombstones. As under the Tariff there was a duty of 10 per cent, on the rough marble, I shall vote for such duty in this T a r if f ; and I shall also for duties in connection with paragraphs B, c, and D, in order to give assistance to plain about. a class of very hard-working men, who have to compete against some of the cheapest labour in the world - I",79
779,Mr FISHER,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,How much labour is there in quarrying?,79
780,Mr WILKS,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"There is a great deal of labour in chiselling and polishing. The duty of 10 per cent, on unwrought marble is not in the interest of the marble worker, petibut of the marble quarries of Australia. will There are several quarries in New South Wales. Paragraphs B, C, and D are in the interests of the marble worker. The only paragraph to which I object is paragraph E, wrought ornamental marble, upon which the duty is 35 per cent. I snould like to see it reduced to 30 per cent. The difference between the duty in paragraph c, 20 per cent., and that in paragraph E, 35 per I shall vote for a duty of 30 per cent, in paragraph E .",79
781,Mr WILS ON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Corangamite) [11.21] I believe, with the honourable member for Yarra, that unwrought marble should be free. The marble quarries of Gippsland have been referred to. I believe that thefacts of the case are that the quarries cannot be conveniently worked because they are inaccessible.",79
782,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,They are not.,79
783,Mr WILSON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"There is absolutely no chance of getting that marble down to Melbourne until a railway has been built. That being the case, what the honourable member for Yarra says is quite correctthat a duty of 10 per cent, would simply be a tax on the raw material of men whose business it is to work up marble. I shall therefore vote with the honourable member in this case. I also believe that slabs or scantlings should be free. The marble has to be sawn before it can be used. I am by monumental masons that there , should be no duty on account of the material covered by paragraph c. The same remark applies to that specified in paragraph B. When these men work up the imported as marble, they have to take the edges off, because in coming out from Italy it gets chipped. Before 'it can be made into tombthe edges and faces have to be reworked. I shall therefore support the honourable member for Yarra as to the contents of paragraphs A, B, and C. As to paraold graph F, dealing with dust and chips, I shall vote to leave the Tariff as it stands. a I have seen the pay-sheets of these men, vote and can say that they are paid really splendid wages, and have nothing-to com",79
784,Mr MALONEY,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Melbourne) [11.25]. understand that the honourable member for Wide Bay is willing to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Yarra, and to allow white marble to be imported free. I have given some study to this question, and I should feel very proud as an Australian if a block of Australian white marble could be carved into a statue. I may remark that the statue of Queen Victoria standing in Queen's Hall is generally supposed to be carved from one piece of marble. But when I was in Europe I was told that the headpiece was simply let in, and that the statue was a fraud to that extent. When it was being shifted from one end of Queen's Hall to the other, I determined to get up and have a look at it, in order to verify that statement. An attempt was made to prevent me, but I was determined, and I found that the statement was true. With regard to what the honourable member for Laanecoorie has said. I think he is aware that when I was a member of the State Parliament I obtained justice for Mr Summers, who had been wronged for fourteen years in consequence of infamous treatment by the State Government. He was robbed' for some years of the money which he should have received for the four statues which stand in front of the Exhibition Building, and has not been paid even interest on it. Indeed, he was barely saved from the claw of the great Lansell, of Bendigo. Loving this country as every Australian does, I should be glad to learn of the discovery of a real white marble here. Attempts to find such marble have been made in every country in the world. I liave not heard of Mr Summers making a statue of Australian marble; at any rate, he has not honoured me with an invitation to see it. A much greater sculptor in our communitythe man who for the first time in the history of the English Academy won the prize for both painting and sculpture, and who modelled the monument above the Age newspaper-does not use Australian marble. How many statues are made in Australia? God knows that the sculptors have a hard time here. I have stood as a model to sculptors in London who I knew had scarcely bread to eat. Bates, whose head I lent to the National Gallery, and who has left perhaps the greatest name in England of late years, although he died prematurely, is one of. these. Australia, is not kind to its artists. Anvone Who knows anything about them knows how hard it is for them to make ends meet. If white marble is wanted for statues, the only place where it can be got is Carrara, in Italy. The nearest approach to such marble that I have seen in Australia Mr Moloney. has been cream coloured. I ask the Committee to allow real white marble to be imported free of duty. By all means, let us tax other marble.",79
785,Mr HUTCHISON,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Hindmarsh) [11.28]. - The honourable member for Melbourne says that he has stood as a model for the sculptors in the Old Country; but I hope that if ever an appreciative country does me the honour to raise a statue to my memory it will be made of Australian marble. We have in South Australia and in Gippsland white marble which is quite as good as is necessary. In South Australia there is a statue of my national poet, Burns, executed in Australian white marble ; and another of one of the greatest men who ever set foot on this country, John MCDouall Stuart, also made of Australian marble. If statues like that can be made of Australian marble, the local stone should be good enough for any one who wishes 10 have a monument erected to his memory. It is white enough for the whitest man who ever lived on Australian soil. Amendment (by Mr FISHER) proposed - That the amendment be amended by inserting the word "" W h it e "" before the word ""Marble.""",80
786,Mr HEDGES,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Fremantle) [11.32] Angaston marble is fit for all the purposes for which marble is required here, and I am very surprised to hear Victorian protectionists advocating the importation of tombstones free - The Angaston marble is very valuable, and the South Australian Government is proposing to build a railway to the locality where it' is found - There are some of the .finest marble quarries in the world there. The face is as high as the gallery, and slabs of very fine stone, 18 to 20 feet long, can be cut The deposit of marble starts at Second Valley, runs through Macclesfield and Angaston, and crosses the Broken Hill railway line at Paratoo. That belt is 170 miles long, and has been opened up in only two or three places, so that even better quarries than are now open may yet be discovered. The marble is good enough for all the. purposes for which we need such stone.",80
787,Mr BOWDEN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"Nepean) [11.34] - The Committee seems almost unanimous as to the advisability of admitting duty free unwrought white imarble. With the exception of the quarry-owners, most of the witnesses who appeared before the Tariff Commission suggested that this marble should be admitted dutyfree. As to coloured marble, the evidence is contradictory. The value of the monuments imported last year was only about ^ 8 3 8 , and if. forty masons had been employed in making them, they would not have earned more than £ 2 0 each. The weight and bulk of monuments protect local makers from competition. The best Italian marble costs ios. or 12s. per cubic f o o t ; that would be free of duty. hand, the Angaston marble can be delivered at Adelaide at a cost of about 4s. 6d. per cubic foot, so that no duty would cause the latter to be substituted for the Italian. The very fact that the price of Australian, marble is at the present time so much lower than is that of the imported marble shows that the duty is not likely to affect the choice. The petition circulated amongst honourable members praying that the old duty should not be increased was signed by more than 95 per cent, of the monumental, marble, and granite trade of Australia.",80
788,Mr TUDOR,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,That was a faked petition.,81
789,Mr BOWDEN,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"We have to consider "" W h it e "" the petition as sent to us. It sets the cost of importing marble and averages about 40 per cent, or 50 per cent., and that under the old duty the native marble enjoyed a protection of from 60 per cent, .to 70 per cent. In the face of these facts, I fail to see.why the duty should be increased. It seems to me that we should be disposed, on the contrary, to place this Bowden, E. K . marble on the free list.' - Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [11.37] - B y this time we should have heard all the pros arid 'cons of the marble industry; but I have not heard any honourable member prove conclusively that we have in Australia pure white marble.",81

791,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Has he investigated all the marble deposits of Australia? I think it is absurd to suggest that he has.,81
792,Mr HUME COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,Mr Cosmo 'Newbery said that the Gippsland marble was equal to that of Carrara.,81
793,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MELBOURNEAND SYDNEY,"The honourable member for Barrier suggests that it needs only a duty to turn:' Australian marble white, and I am beginning to think that there is something in the contention. have seen a good many marble deposits in Australia, but have never come across a deposit of pure white marble, and am afraid that I cannot hope to see in Australia a deposit equal to those of Carrara. I wish it were otherwise.",81

I think that the Minister. <ought to propose an adjournment to a later hour than n o'clock this morning, Or else the House ought to meet at half past io o'clock and get more work done within decent hours. I , for one, shall decline to sit these long hours,' and if he insists upon such sittings, the Minister must take the responsibility of what occurs. That is all that I have to say. I decline to be kept here for fourteen hours at a stretch when we could get through the business in much less time and with great advantage to all concerned. To-day, the Minister kept us for four hours ' which might have been saved to the conduct of public business. Time and again he has sat in his chair for a couple of hours at a stretch when there has only been a question of a paltry 5 per cent, dividing honourable members. It is unfair to keep the House sitting for fourteen or fifteen hours at a stretch in this way,, and I tell the Treasurer again that I do not intend to put up with it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Mr Mauger laid upon the table the following papersPublic Service Act-Regulation s AmendedNo. 104-Statutor v Rules 1907, No. 118; No. 66 - Sunda y Work - (Substituted Regulation) - Sta tutory Rules 1907, No 119.
