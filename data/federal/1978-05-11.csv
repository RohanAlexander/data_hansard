2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That Item 6469 of the standard Medical Benefits Table is the means by which payment is made for the slaughter of thousands of unborn babies every year. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government should ensure that Item 6469 is removed from the standard Medical Benefits Table. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Baillieu, Mr Bourchier, Mr Howe, Mr Macphee, Mr Nixon and Mr Yates. Petitions received. Pensioners: Home Maintenance Loans To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That it is necessary for the Commonwealth Government to renew for a further term of at least 3 years the States Grants (Dwellings for Pensioners) Act 1974-77, renewed for one year expiring on the 30 June 1978. The demand for dwellings has not slackened as the waiting list (all States) of 12,060 single the 30 June 1977 showeth. Your petitioners respectfully draw the attention of the Commonwealth Government to the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Aged Persons' Housing 1975 under the Chairmanship of the Rev. K. Seaman (now Governor of South Australia) which recommended additional funds to State housing authorities to meet the demand for low-rental accommodation in the proportion of $4 for $1 with the proviso that the States do not reduce their existing expenditure and That the Act include married plementary assistance and migrants as specified by the Seaman Report and that particular consideration be paid to the special needs and requirements of the prospective tenants in the locadon and design of such dwellings. Furthermore, your pedtioners desire to draw the Government's attendon to the hardship of many pensioner home owners caused by the high cost of maintenance. The Social Security Annual Report 1976-77 shows that 24.6 per cent, or 283,000 home owning pensioners, have a weekly income in excess of the pension of less than $6 per week. Your petitioners strongly urge the Commonwealth Government to establish a fund whereby loans can be made to means tested pensioners for the purpose of effecting necessary maintenance to their homes. Such a loan to be at minimal interest rates sufficient to cover administradve costs and to be repaid by the estate upon the death of a single pensioner before probate or upon the death of the surviving spouse in the case of married pensioners or where two pensioners jointly own the dwelling. Adrninistration to be carried out by local government bodies. And your peddoners as in duty bound will ever pray. PETITIONS by Mr Lynch, Mr James, Mr Les Johnson, Mr Lucock, Mr Morris and Mr West. Petitions received. German Pensioners Residing in Australia Medical Benefits To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Respresentatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of Gunter Alfred Wilhelm Rose, respectfully showeth: That since the introducuon of Medibank, on July 1 1975, the German Insurance Compames, have stopped paying their monthly contributions of DM 115 - to German pensioners residing in Australia. This money was provided, so that those people could privately insure themselves and pay for medical prescriptions - We note, that our Australian Healthfunds HBA ANA Manchester Unity etc. have to meet their liabilities. It is for this reason, that we protest, that a foreign Healthfund should be exempt, from meeting its liabilities at the expense of the Australian taxpayer. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that our gracious Government and the Government of West Germany, will reach an amicable agreement, which will justly foot the bill, to the Insurance Co. thatreceivedthe premiums. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Aldred. Petition received. Broadcasting and Television Programs To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully and 4,120 couples as at showeth: That because television and radio (a) affect our social and moral environment, (b) are family media watched and heard by many children at alltimes,and (c) present too much explicit violence and sex, they therefore need stronger control than other media and the existing standards need stricter enforcement in both national ABC, and commercial sectors. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: pensioners eligible for supThat the Australian Government will amend the Broadcasting and Television Act, in relation to both national and commercial broadcasters, to legislate (a) for adequate and comprehensive programs in the best interests of the general public, (b) for a 'Dual System of Regulations' enforced by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal by internal regulation and external control, (c) for an independent consumer body to represent the best interests of the general public, and (d) for immediate and effective penalties to be imposed for breaches of program and advertising standards.

Citizen Forces: Long Service and Good Conduct The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned members and ex-members of the Citizens Forces of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. On 14 February 197S, the then Australian Government deprived the officers and men of the Australian Citizen Naval Military and Air Forces of the distinctive and historic Decorations and Medals for long service and good conduct, namely the Reserve Decoration, the Efficiency Decoration, the Air Efficiency Award, the Efficiency Medal and Long Service and Good Conduct Medals, awarded for long and meritorious voluntary service in the Citizen forces: 2. The proposed substitution of the National Medal for these Decorations and Medals varies the principle of selective recognition of efficient voluntary service in the Citizen forces in that it recognises the braces also fulltimeservice as the police,firebrigade and ambulance services: 3. This deprivation caused and is continuing to cause serious discontent amongst personnel of the Citizens Forces who willingly and cheerfully give of their sparetimeoutside their normal full time civilian careers, to serve Her Majesty and Australia: 4. The Reserve Forces of Australia have been recognised by the present Government as a valuable-and costeffective-componen t of the Defence Forces. Anomalously, whilst the Government is actually supporting recruiting for these Forces it has imposed and conUnued this deprivation which as foresaid has depressed the morale of the Citizen Forces: 5. Her Majesty has not cancelled the said Decorations and Medals. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray Your honourable House take appropriate action to resume the award of the several distinctive and historic Reserve Forces Decorations and Medals to members of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Citizens Military Force (Army Reserve) and Citizens Air Force. by Mr Lynch. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showethThat the existence of a system sonal incomes whereby both the Australian Government and State Governments had the power to vary personal income taxes would mean that taxpayers who worked in more than one State in any year would(a) be faced with complicated variations in his or her personal income taxes between States; and (b) find that real after-tax wages for the same job would vary from State to State even when gross wages were advertised as being the same; and (c) require citizens to maintain records of income earned in each State. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that a system of double income tax on personal incomes be not introduced. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. Medals by Mr Morris. Petition received. National Family Policy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That 'The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entided to protection by society and the state'.

Petition received. Immigration: Dobbs Family To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of South Australia respectfully showeth: The Minister of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has refused entry to Australia of the Dobbs family of Nottingham England, because of the blindness of their 12 year old daughter, Catherine. Yet the same Government accepted Vietnamese hijackers, some with leprosy, a disease which could result in far greater cost to the Australian people than the support of one blind girl. We therefore call upon the Commonwealth Government to grant permission for the Dobbs family to migrate to Australia. Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled will take immediate Taxation steps to bring about the wishes expressed in our Petition; so that the Dobbs family may be re-united in Australia.

3,Mr HAYDEN,URANIUM SHARE TRADING,When did the Prime Minister first learn of the allegadons against the former Minister for Finance relating to advice uranium share trading?,16
4,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM SHARE TRADING,Certain affidavits later were put to me a matter of three or four days and I sought advice from the Attorney-General about the appropriate course to take. NA,16
5,Mr NA BROWN,INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE,"My question is directed the Treasurer. I preface it by reminding the Treasurer that on Monday of this week he said that the Government had under consideration the possibility of some re-examination of the phasing arrangements with respect to the investand ment allowance which were to commence on 30 June this year. I ask: Has he had the opportunity them. to make a further examination of this matter? Has the Government reached any conclusions with respect to the further operation of the investment allowance? If so, what conclusions has it reached about that matter?",16
6,Mr HOWARD,INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE,"I can tell the House that in recent days the Government has given very ful consideration to the conditions attaching payment of the investment allowance and has reached certain decisions on those conditions. point out to the House that the purpose of the vestment allowance when it was introduced by the Government was to provide in the shorter term a boost and a stimulus to investment acpropriate tivity. In view of the level of investment in Australia, particularly in the last six or nine months, there is no doubt that the investment allowance has made a major contribution. I cate to the House that the cost to revenue of the investment allowance in the current financial action. year is calculated to be $325m and for 1978-79-that is, the comingfinancialyear-it is estimated to be of the order of $400m. So by any measure this allowance has been a liberal one, a properly liberal one and a properly generous one. Nonetheless it must be said that it has represented a significant revenue concession and, in the Government's view, one that is totally jusTelecom tified in order to encourage investment. The Government has considered whether any alterations should be made to the arrangements ouhned last year by my predecessor which, as honourable members wtil know, involve what might be called a phasing arrangement to commence on 1 July of this year. As a result of that consideration the Government has decided that there will be no alterations at all to the arrangements that were outlined last year by my predecessor. So the arrangements detailed in that statement will stand. The 40 per cent rate will reon main apphcable to plant ordered between 1 January 1976 and 30 June 1978 andfirstused no than 30 June 1979. The 20 per cent rate will ago remain appUcable to plant ordered between 1 January 1976 and 30 June 1985 and first used between 1 July 1979 and 30 June 1986.1 point out in that context that those dates reflect a decision taken by the Government subsequent to the introduction of the investment allowance to to extend the 20 per cent phasing period by a further period of two years. The Government beUeves that this aUowance has been a generous one and that it has made a major contribution, but in all the circumstances it has reached a firm final decision that the existing arrangements wtil remain and there will be no extensions of NA",16
7,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DISCLOSURE OF CABINET DECISIONS,"I also direct a question to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Royal Commission inquiry relating to the Minister for Finance. Are we to take it from a recent ancarenouncement by the Prime Minister that he to always proposes to take appropriate action where prima facie evidence suggests that a I member of the Government has conveyed inforinmation on a Cabinet decision, or has anticipated a Cabinet decision, prior to official public announcement? Is it now his judgment that the apaction in such cases is an inquiry under activity the terms of the Royal Commissions Act?",16
8,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,DISCLOSURE OF CABINET DECISIONS,In the view of the indiAttorney-General and the Government the action taken in this instance was the appropriate NA,16
9,Mr SAINSBURY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE SERVICES,"My question is directed to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. I ask the Minister whether, under the Telecommunications Act 1975, he can give directions to Australia to vary its priorities for capital funding. I emphasise the word 'priorities'. Will the Minister use his influence to help to redress the imbalance seen by country people whereby telephone subscribers in large cities enjoy much greater opportunity to make local calls within zones of community interest and whereby those city subscribers enjoy continuous automatic service, which is a situation that certainly is not shared by many of their country cousins?",16
10,Mr STALEY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE SERVICES,"It is interesting to reflect upon the powers of the Minister under the Telecomcountry municadons Act, and the honourable member has caused me to do that. The Minister has power to give directions to the Australian Teleagainst communications Commission with respect to the performance of its functions and the exercise of its powers as appears necessary to the Minister the public interest. Ministers, of course, always fancy that they are very good defenders of pubhc interest. One would expect, therefore, if the matter came to the crunch a court might that lead? find it rather difficult to question the judgment of a government or a Minister as to what the Minister believes is necessary in the pubhc interest. Nevertheless, I would have to say that if it came to a question of taking action under the Act along the lines hinted at by the honourable member, would need to seek advice from the Governution ment's legal advisers as to the proposed course action. But putting that to one side for the mothink, ment, let me say to the honourable member that it is the view of the Government that there must be a continuing improvement in services availand able for country people in Australia. The present plans of Telecom Australia prowtil vide that virtually all manual services will come automatic within 10 years. In recent years, the position has been that in 1970 there were try 260,000 manual services in Austraha, there are about 110,000 now, and by 1979 it is expected that there will be about 85,000 manual services. should point out also that the Government at the last election made a commitment that the cost off-peak calls would be reduced substantially. Telecom has been working on this and I expect the Government to be able shortly to look at the plans that have been drawn up by Telecom for act the reduction in the price of alling and long distance calls. But I think it has to be said that it takes a good many months actually to effect any changes which are decided upon. The Government also attaches importance to its request to Telecom to study the local call zoning policy. I would hope that any pohcy change would ensure that, so far as possible, local call access to the nearest local service centre vided for the great majority of rural subscribers. NA NA",17
11,Mr HURFORD,CONFERENCE,"Is the Minister for Prothe ductivity aware that the South Australian tittle Government's Industrial Democracy Conference, scheduled for Adelaide in three weeks time, is a complete sell-out with 560 acceptances and more than 200 people already turned away? Does this not show an enormous desire in this to find a solution to the conflict that exists in some quarters between management and workers which itself, of course, works a growing standard of Uving? Is it not regrettable that the Australian national Government has not taken a lead in this area but has left in the void to be liUed by a State Labor Government? With such a large unsatisfied demand for the consultation and dialogue, will the Fraser that Government now do something about following",17
12,Mr MACPHEE,CONFERENCE,"I was not aware that the Conference was a sell-out but I am delighted that it is. I am not surprised because I believe that I people throughout Australia want to see a diminof confrontation and a great improvement of in labour-management relations as they do, 1 in every area of human relations. With regard to the Federal Government's attitude, I believe that our poUcy, which we have stated here which was stated in the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General, is a sensible one for a national government. If we are going to make progress in this area it will be at the grass roots. It be at every plant and at every office. It can be beguided by State governments much more easily than by the Federal Government. Our role is to to co-ordinate the activities and to try to make sure that in this very difficult area people do not go off with half-baked ideas but in fact underI stand the same terms in the same manner and try to achieve the moderating progress to which the of honourable member has referred. I believe we are well placed to do that but we certainly are not well placed, as a Federal Government, to impose things on people at the grass roots. Our role is to as a catalyst and to co-ordinate activities. We subscriber trunk diare doing that. COMMONWEALTH-STATE ROADS NA",17
13,Mr BAUME,AGREEMENT,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Is it possible for the spirit is proof the Commonwealth-State Roads Agreement to be broken by a State government's deliberately deferring the spending of aUocated funds until late in the financial year in order to transfer these funds to projects in other areas that do not have approval? Has this spirit been broken by New South Wales Government by making or no apparent progress in the Shoalhaven shire in my electorate on important road construction projects, totalling $1.7m, which the Minister approved in the 1977-78 rural arterial roads program. If approved Commonwealth funds are not spent within the next eight weeks on projects in the Shoalhaven shire, will the money be carried forward to the next financial year? If so, wtil this be at the expense of next year's projects in the shire?",17
14,Mr NIXON,AGREEMENT,"The procedure followed by the States in respect of roads expenditure programs is as follows: Before the commencement of financial year the States send to the wealth their programs of works for the ensuing financial year. During the course of the financialhard year the Department of Main Roads in New sider South Wales or the Country Roads Board in Viclarly toria may, for some reason or other, be delayed in carrying out the program submitted. The honourable member drew attention specifically to the Shoalhaven shire. It is true that there have been delays with the expenditure program as submitted to me for thisfinancialyear by the Department of Main Roads in New South Wales. do not think that the Department of Main Roads has any intention of breaking the spirit of the rangement between the Commonwealth and the State. There may have been fundamental on reasons for the delay such as weather, industrial trouble or a host of other reasons. The honourition, able member will be pleased to know that, as understand it, the contracts in the Shoalhaven shire either have just been signed or are about be signed for some of the works programs in which he is interested. As to whether the delay in this 12 months cause a further delay in the next 12 months, really depends on the programs submitted to for the nextfinancialyear by the New South Wales Minister. If, by chance, when I receive the program I notice that there is no continuation the program of road expenditure in the believe Shoalhaven shire the conclusion could be drawn that the Department of Main Roads ing any further development until the present program was completed. I shall keep my eye on the program when it comes to hand and keep the honourable member informed. NA",18
15,Mr LES JOHNSON,CITIZENSHIP APPLICATIONS,My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Is the Government considering the represent. introduction of a formal written test to determine citizenship applications? Would reintroduction of this test strengthen claims that the Government is operating a de facto White Australia pohcy?,18
16,Mr MACKELLAR,CITIZENSHIP APPLICATIONS,The Government is not considering the introduction of any written English test for citizenship applications. The rest of the question is too nonsensical to spend any time on it. NA,18
17,Mr MACKENZIE,BEEF INDUSTRY,"Can the Minister for Primary Industry advise the House of the total a amount paid to beef producers under the Beef CommonIndustry (Incentive Payments) Scheme introduced to provide some cash flow to very pressed cattlemen? Will the Minister conan extension of this type of scheme, particuin view of the desperate situation that has now developed in northern Australia where widespread drought and bluetongue disease have further aggravated the situation?",18
18,Mr SINCLAIR,BEEF INDUSTRY,"Unfortunately , the position of the cattle industry has not improved as we had I hoped. It is true that in much of southern Austraha the industry has been enjoying somearwhat better prices than in the Queensland area. However, it is equally true that the dependence export markets in Queensland is greater than it is elsewhere in Australia. The cash flow posthe level of indebtedness and the general I prospects for the industry in Queensland are therefore of very real concern to the Governto ment. Honourable members would be interested to know- I am grateful to the honourable gendeman for giving me the opportunity to explain this to the House-that under the Beef Industry (Incentive Payments) Scheme a total of $67.97m wtil has already been paid to the industry to 5 May that 1978. There have been 53,011 claims received, me of which 51,761 have been assessed; 45,039 have been paid; and 1,150 claims await assessment. This scheme is specifically of direct assistof ance to cattle producers throughout Austraha. I it has been of tremendous assistance in trying to overcome the serious cashflowdeficits was delaythat many of them face. The honourable gentleman also referred to the particular problems of those affected by bluetongue in northern Australia. The Government has taken decisions with respect to the applications made by a number of groups in the north. The position is particularly bad in what is known as the endemic area, that is, the area where the midge from which the virus affects cattle is The difficulty of course is that even if animals identified as reactors were to be killed the presence of the midge would not stop other animals from contracting the virus. I again state that there has still been no identification of disease from the virus, but the virus is present and in order to export live catde to other countries and of course to send them to sourthern parts of Austraha a number of restraints are imposed which are seriously affecting the incomes of cattle producers in that area. The Government has taken a number of decisions with respect to direct assistance to be made available to producers in the area. I am now in the process of contacting State governments and hope to have their responses shortly. I shall then be in a position to make an announcement of the character of that assistance. The intention is to provide some offset against the loss of markets and revenue that the identification of the bluetongue virus means. Of course, the reason for the prevention of the movement of the virus is that it is significantly to the advantage sheep producers throughout Australia. In that respect the cattlemen of the north are being called on to bear a burden that is not specifically in their interest, but is in the interest of all wool growers in other parts of Australia. For that reason the Government feels it is justified in providing this additional assistance to northern cattle producers. NA NA",18
19,Mr SCHOLES,COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM,"The Minister for Defence and will be aware that on Monday of this week a the question was asked of the Leader of the Governthat, ment in the Senate relating to a United States America communications satellite installation, and that on that occasion the Minister gave an incorrect answer which he corrected the followper ing day. In the corrected statement, which was considered statement from the Minister for Derecord fence, the Minister indicated that the station cerned was a replacement for a station closed 1973 and had in fact been constructed in 1977.I ask the Minister. Is that information correct or fact is the station concerned a station which propsed to be constructed in approximately months time as part of a 25-station project for the Pentagon's world command system? Have the contracts for this construction been let months? If that information is correct, why the Government indicated that the already constructed when in fact it is a proposed station, not yet constructed, for an entirely we do different purpose?",19
20,Mr KILLEN,COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM,My understanding of the position is as follows: In 1973 a satellite terminal at the station was removed. Pursuant to approval given by the Government in October 1977 it was replaced. I have been informed informally- I emphasise 'informally'-that the United States Government stands in contemplation of placing before the Australian Government a proposal to update that satellite terminal. That proposal relates to the period 1980 to 1981. I assure the honourable gentleman and the House that when a formal proposal has been received by the Austrahan Government it will be considered on its merits. NA NA,19
21,Dr EDWARDS,INDUSTRY,I ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce: How does the Government view the present outlook for investment in manufacturing industry? Is the current rate of capital investment in manufacturing appropriate as the of basis of an increasingly efficient and competitive industrial structure in Australia?,19
22,Mr LYNCH,INDUSTRY,"I thank the honourable member for Berowra for his question relating to investment in the manufacturing sector of the Austrahan economy. One of the principal successes of the Government's economic policy has been the very strong revival that has taken place in investment in the manufacturing sector of the economy. For example, manufacturing sector investment for the last half of 1977 exceeded a record $1 billion in seasonally adjusted terms was 13 per cent greater than it had been in first half of last year. I should also mention according to the most recent survey of of business intentions by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, manufacturing investment for the first half of the current year is expected to be some 20 cent greater than in the second half of last a year which, as I have just mentioned, was at a level. Thesefiguresreflect a new sense of conconfidence by the manufacturing sector- a conin fidence generated by the Government's economic policies and the specific measures that we in have taken to place the manufacturing sector of is the economy on a sound basis for future growth. 18 ECONOMIC POLICY: UNEMPLOYMENT",19
23,Mr HAYDEN,INDUSTRY,"I refer the Prime Minister to for 18 his recent discussions with Vice-President has Mondale, in which the American Vice-President station was reportedly said to him: Our commitment-and President Carter's as well-is that not intend to solve the problems of inflation by massive unemployment That is poor economics and social policy and I speak from the heart. In view of this rebuke and the International Monetary Fund's criticism of Australia's excessive deflationary economic policies, will the Prime Minister reconsider the need for carefully controlled expansionary economic measures as a replacement for pohcies that Vice-President Mondale has fairly described as 'poor economics and social pohcy'.",19
24,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INDUSTRY,The Treasurer will answer the quesdon.,20
25,Mr HOWARD,INDUSTRY,"I do not propose to speculate on what may or not have been said in exchanges between Vice-President Mondale and the Prime Minister or any other Ministers during the Vice President's visit to Austraha, but I will respond to the implication in the question of the Leader of the Opposition, that is, the oft-repeated implication that there is in Australia some trade-off which can be obtained between inflation and unemployment. It is a myth that the honourable gentleman has persisted with for a long period of time. It is a myth that the present Government rejects completely. The basis of our economic pohcy is to bring about a lasting reduction in inflation and thus provide the only sound basis for a sustained and lasting economic recovery. The honourable gentleman thrashes around trying to find justification in statements that are made by international economic bodies for the criticisms that he makes of Australia's economic pohcies, yet when a body with the credit of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development produces a report which endorses in very substantial terms the wisdom of the economic pohcies being followed by the Government he and his colleagues try to denigrate its integrity. This Government does not accept that one can trade-off unemployment and inflation. It is a cruel deception of those who are unemployed to pretend that one can. DRUG OFFENCES: SENTENCES",20
26,Mr BIRNEY,INDUSTRY,"I ask the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs whether the Crown has decided to lodge an appeal against the inadequacy of the sentence passed recently in the Northern Territory Supreme Court on a prisoner named Tait for offences against the Customs Act? Is it a fact that there was a substantial parity between that sentence and the sentences passed recendy on two American women for their part in the illegal importation of drugs into Australia? Were all of the defendants indicted under the Customs Act? If so, can he account for that disparity?",20
27,Mr FIFE,INDUSTRY,"In answering the honourable member's question I remind the House that, following the apprehension of two people as a result of the illegal importation of a large quantity of drugs into Australia on 21 January of this year, the two people concerned, Donald Roy Tait and Michael Leonard Bartley, were sentenced in the Darwin Supreme Court. Tait was sentenced to six years and eight months imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and nine months; Bartley was sentenced to three years and eight months with a non-parole period of one year and six months. When answering a question a week or so ago I indicated that I was concerned at the inadequacy of the sentences. I am able to inform the House that I have instructed my Department to seek leave to appeal against the inadequacy of both sentences. The honourable member also drew attention to the disparity between the sentences passed on these two men and the sentences passed in relation to offences committed by two American women. It will be recalled that the two women were sentenced to a term of 14 years imprisonment. I point out to the House that the two American women were sentenced under that part of the customs law that concerns the illegal importation of hard drugs-for importing hashish in resin form, which is described as a hard drug under the legislation. The maximum sentence for the illegal importation of hard drugs is 25 years. Tait and Bartley were sentenced in relation to the importation of cannabis in Buddha stick form and this offence carries a maximum sentence of only 10 years. That partly accounts for the disparity between the two sentences. I am able to inform the honourable member and the House that the maximum penalties are under consideration and I expect to discuss the matter on Monday next with State Ministers who have a responsibility in this field. It will be my intention at these discussions to obtain agreement with the States to increase the maximum penalties. NA",20
28,Mr FRY,DISPOSAL OF NUCLEAR WASTE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Trade and Resources and I refer him to submissions by the Philippines Atomic Energy Commission to the International Atomic Energy Agency that since the Philippines is in a volcanic disbelt and has no stable salt rock formations, the long-term storage and disposal of its nuclear waste will depend on the establishment of an international burial site. Will the Minister assure this House that his Government will not allow Australia to become an international burial ground for nuclear waste and will not allow nuclear waste derived from any Australian uranium used in the Philippines to be dumped in Australia? Can the Minister inform the House where the nuclear waste from the Philippines wtil be stored and by what means?",20
29,Mr ANTHONY,DISPOSAL OF NUCLEAR WASTE,That is a completely speculative question and I do not intend adding anything to it. There has been no request by the Philippines to store its waste material in Australia. NA,21
30,Mr IAN ROBINSON,DEVELOPMENT OF RANGER URANILJM,"I direct my question to the Minister for Trade and Resources. Can he form the House of the outcome of the discussions which he and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs had in Darwin yesterday with the Northern oil Land Council and the Northern Territory Execuof tive concerning uranium mining? Was the objecAugust tive that he mentioned in the House on Tuesday achieved, that is, an understanding between the various parties?",21
31,Mr ANTHONY,DEVELOPMENT OF RANGER URANILJM,"The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Australian Director of Parks and Wildlife and I , along with two Territory repSydney resentatives in the Parliament, the honourable member for the Northern Territory and Senator Kilgariff, went to Darwin and had lengthy and frank discussions with the Northern Territory Executive and the Northern Land Council to reducers solve the problems that had amendments that Senator Kilgariff had suggested for another place. I am happy to say that an acceptable understanding has been reached between the parties and that the bulk the amendments that have been proposed will be situation. submitted to the Senate for approval. I think it is a credit to all the parties concerned that they could sit down and resolve this matter in a way which was acceptable to them. The Northern Territory administration was conaware cerned about the role it would play in a national park and the Northern Land Council was very concerned that any role the Northern Territory administration played might impinge upon the rights of Aboriginal people. The Commonwealth made it very clear that therightsof the Aboriginal people would be preserved and that office, Commonwealth control would be maintained export over this great national park. I believe that the comments of Mr Yunupingu, the Chairman of the Northern Land Council, made after our meeting yesterday, to the effect that a closer understanding and a greater degree of co-operation than ever before has now been achieved amongst the parties involved are an cellent omen for future negotiations and lations towards the development of uranium in the area. I believe it is important that all parties look at this project which involves ment of uranium, and of the national park, as being a co-operative one.

The then Treasurer was referring to a levy on crude production. Does he also recall the statement the then Minister for National Resources in 1977 that the Government was considering the application of a resources tax on profits to oil producers as a result of world parity pricing? In view of the statement by the Secretary of the Department of National Development in an address last week to an American Conference in that 'No in-principle decision to apply such a tax has yet been taken', can the Treasurer give an assurance that a resources tax will be introduced so that part of the windfall profits of $109m to Esso-BHP and $41m to other oil proin Australia is returned to the Australian arisen as a result of community?",21

34,Mr BURNS,ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT,"I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister is no doubt of the assertions by the Opposition that the Government is lacking a policy on arms control and disarmament matters. Will the Minister inform the House of the initiatives the Australian Government has taken in order to achieve wider international agreement on these matters?  and particularly since its decision on the of uranium, Australia's activity on arms control and disarmament has increased markedly. I have read with some interest the views of honourable members opposite that the Government has done nothing on the question of disarmament. There is a touch of irony, apart from mystery, in reading the speech of the Deputy exLeader of the Opposition who in one sentence resaid the Government was doing nothing in New York and, remarkably, in the next sentence said that apart from posturing greatly in New York the developnothing was being done here.",21
35,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT,"On human rights.  any initiatives on human rights. It knows that since the early 1950s Australia had not served on the Human Rights Commission. She now is a member and as a consequence our policies are being pursued there. At the last General Assembly meeting we co-sponsored resolutions on the comprehensive nuclear test ban, on the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks negotiations and on nuclear non-proliferation. All three resolutions were adopted with wide support. In fact the resolution on the comprehensive nuclear test ban was supported for thefirsttimeever by both the United States and the Soviet Union. Of course even to the most bereft minds opposite it ought to be obvious that one cannot achieve a successful nuclear test ban unless one has the support of both super powers. In this instance for the first time, as a consequence directly of Australia's initiative, they supported the resolution. We have also been active in the preparations for the United Nations Special General Assembly Session on Disarmament. I have heard that we have done nothing on that. In fact, we are a vice-president of the organising committee. The special session can potentially give new stimulus and focus to the whole range of arms control efforts. We have emphasised the need for a set of basic principles and for a realistic program of action as a contribution to a new international consensus on priorities for future negotiations. the last two General Assembly meetings I have spoken extensively on disarmament. Finally, our decision to allow the export of uranium under stringent safeguards was taken in the context of our support for nuclear arms control objectives. As regards all these issues put to the House, Australia is not only continuing to exert as much influence as possible but is doing so effectively, as can be seen by the results obtained in the United Nations.

36,Mr MORRIS,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,Is the Minister for Transport aware that the Australian Wool Corporation proposes to ship substantial quantities of wool to Tacoma in the United States at rates considerably below the prevailing conference freight rates? I ask the Minister: Did the Australian Wool Corporation consult the Minister on its proposals? Has the Minister sought an assessment of the effects of the Corporation's actions on the Northbound Conference shipping services in view of the expectation that the wool shipped to Tacoma will later be on-forwarded to Asian and Japanese destinations? Is the Minister able to say whether such on-forwarding will in any way affect the operations of the Australian Northbound Conference services on which the Australian beef and dairy industries are so dependent for their exports? Can the Minister give an assurance that the transport arrangements for Australian beef and dairy exports to the United States will not be disadvantaged in any way as a result of these Australian Wool Corporation shipping proposals?,22
37,Mr NIXON,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"I was advised that the Australian Wool Corporation had negotiated freight rates, as stated by the honourable member. I was also given an assessment of the effect of those freight rates on other commodity trades. I was assured by the advice given to me that the freight rates negotiated were proper and in accordance with the principles applied to freight negotiations. I am also advised that the effects on other freight rate negotiations will be nil. Therefore the whole negotiation is completely proper and in accordance with Government policy. NA CO. LTD",22

It is not a report that deals specifically and only with the Mt Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd, but obviously the operations of that company are covered by the report.

That is a body of senior government officials from the departments dealing with industry matters. A recommendation on that report is prepared for the consideration of the Minister who has responsibility for industry matters, in this case the Minister for Trade and Resources.

At the same time it is perfectly plain from all those measures that have been supported from the South Australian Budget over the past couple of years that the South Australian Government has sufficient funds to do all those things that it wishes to do. If its own priorities it is perfectly entitled to do so. I think the honourable gentleman's question pays too tittle regard to the training and retraining programs run by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations which at any one time are assisting and supporting tens of thousands of Australians, many of them young Australians, and under which 200,000 people or more have been assisted over the last couple of years. As the honourable gentleman knows, at the time of the last Budget we announced that there would be no financial limit on those retraining, training and job assistance programs because we did not want anyone to be denied an opportunity as a result of an arbitrary limit on funds. Those programs are remarkably successful. They have been expanded. One of the matters put to us by trade unionists just a couple of nights ago was that there should be assistance with training or retraining We put it to the unions that they in turn might be able to make that easier by supporting a move for adult qualifications for tradesmen, which is something anthat the trade union movement has not always ingrasped with a great degree of enthusiasm.

47,Mr UREN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I want to restrict my remarks this morning to the reporting in the national Press and the reporting by the ParUamentary Press GaUery of the uranium debate. It is a sorry and sad situation in this Parliament to witness the recent so-called parUamentary debate here when six BiUs and a ministerial statement were pushed through this House in approximately 10 hours and although these Bills have critical consequences for not only the whole of this nation but also for our relationships with the rest of the world the newspaper reporting of the debate was abysmal. It was so poor that one had much difficulty in finding it in the newspapers. This was particularly so on 4 May when one had to look hard to find the reports of that debate. The Melbourne Age reported the debate on page 12. The Sydney Morning Herald reported in on page 18 and Melbourne Sun reported it on page 32. There was no report in the Australian nor in the Australian Financial Review. This was a disgrace when it is considered we were, in fact, taking a decision on the mous implications involved in mining in newspaper Australia nearly 20 per cent of the known view uranium deposits in the western world. One only has to look at the third report of the First Royal Commission to reatise the grave importgoing ance of this decision. That report said that the nuclear power industry is unintentionally conis tributing to an increasedriskof nuclear war and that this is the most serious hazard associated with the industry. At the time these important BiUs were being pushed through this Parliament there was very Uttle reporting in the Press of what the Parliawhere ment was debating and what honourable clude members said. A prime example of the shallowerate ness of the reporting is a special article written Peter Bowers in the Sydney Morning Herald. He talked about the uranium debate and a shift from morals to doUars. How shallow is such reporting. What is the situation involving the Aboriginal people? One has only to look at the second Fox Commission report to see clearly set out at page 9 that the Aboriginal people gave clear evidence to the inquiry that they are opposed to any mining of their land by Pancontinental Mining Ltd or Ranger. There was no mention of that in the Bower's article. The Aboriginals are opposed to mirting at Jabiluka or Jabiru but because they feel they cannot stop the Government from going ahead with the mining project obviously these people have a right to try to negotiate and try to get some money as compensation for spoiling their environment and their traditional way of life. In fact, the Aboriginal people are very fearful of mining. Again, we have to ask why Mr Bowers did not refer to the Aboriginal position which was expressed in the Ranger report. This is just one example of reporting by members of the Press Gallery. I have referred to examples of poor Press reporting. The fact is that the reports have been slanted. One only has to look at the poor reports in the Press during the last Federal elections. This subject was hardly reported except in the last few days of the campaign. The debate did not get off the ground. Perhaps the Press Gallery reporters are frustrated in their attempts to report. Perhaps their attitude is that it is not worth them reporting these issues because it is newspaper poticy to keep out those reports and not to initiate major discussion. We know that the newspapers have been playing down the debate on uranium particularly the anti-mining aspect. Recently in the Sydney Morning Herald, that a former member of this House, W. C. enorWentworth, was given wide coverage. That has failed to put the other point of in this matter. The sad aspect of this matter is that the Press Gallery as a whole does not seem Fox to make any real in-depth analysis of what is on. One could say that the shallowness of the writings of the members of the Press Gallery appalling. I suppose that there is only one exception. I want to make it quite clear that I believe that Mr Tony Thomas of the Melbourne Age has tried to make an in-depth analysis of a broad aspect of the uranium debate. I know that he has travelled widely in the uranium area the uranium is proposed to be mined. I exhim from my remarks. That does not exonthe Melbourne Age. The reporting of the by Melbourne Age on the uranium debate has fallen off. In the last six months, that newspaper has presented a very poor report indeed. I ask: What journalist in the Press Gallery has made an anaylsis of the Australian Government's claim that the problem of nuclear waste disposal has been solved? For instance, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made a statement indicating that the whole quesdon of nuclear waste had been solved? He made that comment early in the uranium debate, prior to the elections. He over-simplified the situation. He said that the problems had been overcome and that laboratory tests had been carried out. But, at the same time, he put forward the proposition that Australia, in its nuclear safeguards proposal, would not allow the reprocessing of nuclear waste. If one wanted to proceed further on this subject and if one believed that the waste disposal problem was solved by a process called vitrification, one could not be in favour of not having a reprocessing program. If we want to use the vitrification process, reprocessing first has to take place. Even in the United States of America reprocessing is not permitted. I have asked questions in the House on the matter. In the United States there are 74,000 million gallons of liquid toxic waste. The Americans do not know what to do with it. America is therichestcountry in the world and it has not followed through this process. What journalist in the Gallery has written or examined the nuclear waste dilemma or examined in Press articles the government's false claim. Has the Press made a deep analysis of the Atomic Energy Act which is one of the most oppressive Acts with relation to civil liberties ever known in this country? It was introduced at the time of the Cold War. What articles have been written by members of the Press Gallery? Where are the articles referring to reports on this subject and to debates that have taken place in the Parliament? Where have Australian journalists made a study of the safeguards of proliferation either on the so-called bilateral agreements between the Australian Government and other governments or on the so-called safeguards under the International Atomic Energy Agency? Have members of the Press Gallery made any real analyses of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and the parts that they play in the whole matter of nuclear power? Has there been any real analysis of the economic aspects of this question? I asked in this House whether the Treasury had made any short term or long term analyses of the consequences of the outcome of uranium mining exports. The answer was a negative one. What follow up has been made by the Press? What of our negotiations with Iran, governed by the Shah, or with the Philippines, governed by President Marcos? We know that both of these leaders are thugs. We know how their people are oppressed. We know the use to which they will put our uranium if they are able to get it. The third recommendation of the first Fox report stated that the nuclear power industry is connected with the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In what way did the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) answer a question this morning from the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) about the nuclear waste from the volcanic island in the Philippines? He gave a negative reply. It will be interesting to see whether there is any follow up by the Press Gallery.",24
48,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,25
49,Mr SAINSBURY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Eden-Monaro) (11.1)Before commencing my grievance this morning I shall make one comment on the speech by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren). In sharp contradistinction to his scare tactics in relation to Australia's very responsible policy on uranium he has never once in this House condemned those countries which are flat out in going ahead with uranium ntining and development. I refer especially to countries such as Russia. This morning I shall talk about the Australian Telecommunications Commission. I addressed a question to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Staley) during question time this morning on one aspect of Telecom. It is a question that is often raised by honourable members from country electorates. Telecom plays a very big part in the lives of people in the bush. It is a giant enterprise. The most recent annual report notes that its total value is now over $6 billion. It is a giant enterprise involved in a very important public utility which provides a service from which, of course, it has to make a profit. It makes a good profit. In addition, it is a great tool of decentralisation in this countiy. It also provides a very important welfare function especially for people who live outside the capital cities. People need to communicate. Communication in cities and large towns can be brought about quite easily by word of mouth or by travelling from one place to another. That is often impossible in more isolated areas. That is the reason I raise this matter today. Telecom is a commission. That is good. It was brought about by the previous Government following a wide-ranging report. I am not arguing against that. Nor am I arguing about the fact that Telecom makes a profit. It think that is good. Its present level of profit of about $160m is often denigrated by people in country areas. I fully support that profit and I do not mind going on record as saying that. I realise that the massive capital works program which at present is $900m a year has to be prosecuted especially if people in country areas are to get better services in shorter dme. I am not arguing against the profit level. I am certainly not arguing against some of the policies of Telecom in recent dmes that have assisted people in the country. Connection fees have been lowered. There has been an extension of Subscriber Trunk Dialling concessional arrangements on Sundays. Telephone call charges have not been raised in the past 2V4 years. At the sametimeinflation has accounted for a reasonable rise in the cost of living so that by not raising fees Telecom has, in fact, discounted them. I am not criticising any of these things. They are all good. What I have to criticise is the fact that the archy in Telecom at State and national level not giving enough help to people in the country in terms of capital works. The 1976-77 annual port indicates that in country areas Wales there were still 43,435 manual services at the end of June last year. Some of those are continuous manual services but even they have drawbacks. However, there are a large number of services that are not continuous. They do not operate for large parts of the weekends or most of the night. These services are the ones to which I address myself. Many of them are in my area. They deserve a much higher priority in capital spending than they are receiving at present. note almost cynically that there is not a single manual service in a metropolitan or an outer metropolitan area. All these areas have continume. ous automatic services. Almost all of them access to STD. The present rate of supply of services within New South Wales is 130,000 a year. If there were a complete concentration on converting manual services to automatic services it would take months at the rate of 130,000 a year. I appreciate that that is not possible. I appreciate that a the new services have to go into metropolitan areas. So let me be a little more reasonable and suggest that it would take fifteen times as long. should then take five years to convert all those manual services to automatic services. The ister said this morning that it should take years. He said that within that period there would probably be about 1.3 million new services. Therefore I do not think that in 10 years it is unreasonable to expect that 43,000 services in the country will be transferred to automatic services. I fear that at the present rate of installation of automatic exchanges in the country the target of 10 years will not be met by any stretch of the imagination. At present there are 1,630 manual exchanges in Austraha. I have nofigureson this because it is not mentioned in the annual report but I would estimate that about 500 of those exchanges still remain in New South Wales. That estimate would seem reasonable when considering the large number that still remain in my electorate of Eden-Monaro. At the present rate within New South Wales, only 15 manual exchanges per annum are being converted to automatic exchanges out of a total of500. At that rate it will take 35 years for all the people in the country to have automatic services. The Minister said this morning that it would take 10 years. At the present rate of installation it will take 35 years. That is why I have raised this point in the hiergrievance debate today. I believe that the hieris archy in Telecom at State and Commonwealth level does not realise that the conversion to autorematic exchanges will not be achieved in 10 years. in New South It will take 35 years. I want that policy changed. Out of the $900m being spent on capital works I want a much higher priority for the upgrading of country services. I am bound to say that within my electorate there is tremendous co-operation at the district telephone office level. I imagine that that occurs throughout the country. The Telecom officials in my electorate try very hard to obtain I funds and priorities for the people under their service. I have the strongest admiration for the work they are doing and the help they are giving Nevertheless, they are bound by State and have Commonwealth policies within Telecom. For that reason they are not able to expand their services quickly enough. I note that in the annual accounts of Telecom there is no breakdown of profits between four different areas, especially between city and country areas. One of the official reasons norlot of mally given by Telecom for not being able to expand country services quickly enough is that there is very little profit in it. They have to put It money into areas which are more profitable. How profitable is the country? How profitable is Minthe city? The annual reports do not give any 10 indication of that. I wonder whether Telecom has a proper breakdown and whether it can justify the oft-repeated statement that the provision of these services is not profitable in many country areas. If Telecom does know, why does it not put the information in its annual reports so that we can scrutinise those facts? If Telecom does not know, why does it keep saying that the country areas are not profitable? I wonder whether a better and more concerted effort by Telecom in country areas would increase its profits by wiping off many of the labour intensive manual exchanges and creating conditions in which people in the country will more often use their telephones. I should like Telecom-the Minister for Post and Telecommunications knows what I think about this matter-to give a much higher priority to country areas. I certainly hope it can do that because unless it does we will not have automatic exchanges throughout Australia in anywhere near the next 10 years.",25
50,Mr HOWE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I refer to a recent debate in the Parliament on the subject of health care costs. I have been thinking about the suggestion made by Dr Sax in the report on health costs that prevention of illness and disability, accompanied by effective health education, has the greatest long-term potential for containing a general inflation of health expenditure. That is, the approach which is likely to be the most productive is that of prevention in the longer term. Whilst the Government has expressed concern about rising health care costs, in terms of its strategy it seems to be moving towards deterring people from using services by raising the direct private sector costs so that people are made more aware of the real costs of medical care. It is by no means clear that the Government is right in following this strategy. It may be that all that will be achieved by the Government will be the movement of more costs from the pubhc sector to the private sector. That is certainly what has been happening. In my view the real basis of rising health care costs is related, as I have suggested before in house, to the underlying philosophy and interests of those groups of people who have an interest in the expansion of health care empties and systems. In a previous speech I identified such groups as doctors, hospital boards, administrators, health insurance funds, private hospital systems and so on. It is clear, as someone was just saying to me in the lobby, that when one looks into the heart of the services in Australia which are supposed to be serving ordinary people and on which thousands of millions of dollars of the taxpayers' money are being spent onefindsthat the money is being transferred from the ordinary taxpayers into the hands of people who are able to engage in a kind of rip-off. That is what has been happening in relation to health care. A giant rip-off has been occurring and ordinary people and pensioners who have paid tax all their lives are now seeing that tax being paid to enable the exploitation of people through these escalating costs. But it is not that argument with which I want to deal today. I want to follow through what I was suggesting about prevention. As a new member of this House, I have been trying to do a bit of research. It is interesting in doing that research how quickly I found myself to be frustrated by the lack of information available. Firstly, it is very hard to get any kind of estimate of what proportion of the total health care expenditure is actually spent on preventive approaches. But if one examines the view of a conservative body- a body that certainly is not hkely to be friendly to the Australian Labor Party-that is, that of the Institute of Public Affairs, onefindsthat its estimate, not the Labor Party's estimate, is that of the $3,000m of public money spent on health care in the last year something like $9m was specificaUy ear-marked for preventive programs. That is incredible. Only $9m of that $3,000m was for preventive programs. If, in the view of Dr Sax and his committee, preventive programs represent the greatest opportunity for long-term savings, that is an extraordinary contrast. Something of the scale of the problem, particularly in the area of industrial health, which is the area on which I want to focus attention, can be seen by comparing the costs associated with industrial disputes and those associated with people involved in industrial accidents. During 1976 something Uke 3.7 million man days were lost through industrial disputes, at a cost of $114m in wages. Estimates of the cost of industrial accidents, as compiled from the claims under employers' liability, show that in 1974-75 this the cost amounted to $499m and in 1975-76 to more than $577m. In terms of the man days lost in the various states it is apparently difficult to get comparable data. It is extremely difficult to get on a national basis data which actually tells one how many days people have lost from work in relation to industrial accidents. One can get figures for various States. In Victoria in 1974-75, 145,234 weeks were lost. For New South Wales there is no comparable data. For Queensland the figure was more than one mtilion days lost. The figure for South Australia was 96,000 weeks and for Western Australia over 100,000 weeks. The figure for Tasmania was more than 23,000 weeks. Those figures are not comparable. It is difficult to get any kind of nationalfigure.The Minister for Productivity (Mr Macphee) has estimated that five million man days were lost during one year due to industrial accidents. One should think in terms of average wages and what that would represent in costs to people apan from the whole question of the loss of productivity. The National Committee of Inquiry into Compensation and RehabUitation, although directed to examine compensation and rehabUitation, also looked at the question of accident prevention with the aim of reducing costs incurred through industrial accidents. One of the main grievances in its report was about the lack of adequate data on which to assess the number and nature of industrial accidents and diseases. Page 210 of the report states: Adequate statistical informadon is an essential ingredient of any accident prevention program which is both comprehensive and scientific. Existing data in Australia fell meeting the most modest tests of adequacy. It is extraordinary, some would say reprehensible, that we simply do not have the figures necessary even to assess the scale and dimensions of the problems associated with industrial health. The reason for that is clearly that every State that is coUectingfiguresis something of a law unto itself. It is not possible to persuade the States to do so and apparently so far it has not been possible for the national Government to estabUsh its own system for the collection of statistics so that we know, particularly on the basis of days lost, exactly what is the scale of the problem in Australia. If we do not know the scale and dimensions and, in particular, if we do not know where the problem arises it is nonsense to talk about the Government having preventive programs and it is nonsense for the Government to talk about having a priority in relation to the reduction of health care costs. It can be demonstrated- I think I have demonstrated it-that the dimensions of this problem alone are considerable in one year let alone spread over a period of five or six years. In other countries it has been possible for national governments to legislate to do someloyal thing about this problem. In Britain, after port by Lord Robins in 1972, health and safety work legislation was passed which provided for comprehensive and integrated system of statistius cal collection and the creation of a health and safety commission responsible to the Minister for administering the legislation and providing focus and initiative for health and safety matters. The legislation also placed concerned at the work place to observe safety regulations. Similarly, in the United States of America the Occupation and Health Safety Act was passed in 1970. Under this Act there is an obligation on the Secretary of Labor to develop and maintain the compilation, collection and analysis of data and statistics. There is provision to provide loans to small business to enable, where there are economic difficulties, compliance with the provisions under the legislation. It is possible for employers to request inspections, and an Institute of Occupational Safety and Health has been established to develop appropriate standards and conduct research. In Australia we have an absurd situation where there exists simply a multitude of governmental and semi-governmental bodies, with no overall co-ordination. The result is that we do not have statistics on the problem as a whole and have not been able to develop a national approach. If we are going to talk in this House short of about reduction of health costs we ought to be talking, as at least sections of that report talk, about prevention. If we are going to be equitable and just in relation to the whole question of health, we are going to have to take industrial health much more seriously. If the Federal Government is to exercise a role, the first task seems to be to at least analyse the position and see that the statistics on the problem are available. Even that first step is presently beyond us and I understand that a national conference which was proposed to look at just these kinds of problems has been delayed because the Government will not provide the funds with which to man it.",27
51,Mr HODGMAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is a rarity in political Ufe for a humble back-bencher to be able to participate in what could be the making of history. Equally it is rare indeed for a back-bench member of this House to be in a position to announce a development which may be of considerable significance. All members of this Parliament wtil be fully aware of my long standing concern for the welfare of the people of East Timor, not merely because of Australia's debt of gratitude to them for their stalwart and support in the dark days of World War II, a rebut because I believe, and all Australians beheve, in the sanctity of basic humanrights,in a cluding self-determination and, of course, all of would be concerned about the threat to Australia's integrity and national security posed by the continuation of major military action in a volving all forms of conventional warfare in an area that is less than half an hour flying time duties upon everyone from Darwin. My views on East Timor have for over two years been made known to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), to the Government, to the Parliament and to the nation.

I do not wish to retrace history. What I want to say today to the Parhament is that I believe we may now be approaching the possibility of a negotiated peace setdement in East Timor. After bitter and intense fighting East Timor, extending over two and a half years, and involving, in fact, the loss of up to 100,000 lives, a situation of stalemate-no t dissimilar that which occurred with the Timorese resistence to the Japanese in World War II-ha s now conflict developed. A number of reports which have come to hand indicate that Indonesia's position with respect to East Timor may, in fact, be weaker today than it was three months ago, and the failure of Indonesia to capture such vital areas as the coffee growing area of Fatubesse and, in fact, losing other territory captured, seems to confirm reports coming in that a stalemate has definitely set in. I do not want to breach any confidence, or to reveal details of conversations and information which have come to me over the past few weeks. Suffice it to say that the situation may well be as described in a recent issue of the International Bulletin, pubhshed at Berkeley, California. I shall quote from a report which was submitted by Mr Banning Garrett. Referring to the war, he said: The war appears to be a stalemate. Fretilin cannot force Indonesia out of East Timor militarily, while Indonesia apparently cannot defeat Fretilin-at least not in the near future and not without an even greater commitment of troops and resources. And such a commitment would have to be made by Indonesia without any firm assurance of success. The next words are very important: Top Indonesian generals are known to be concerned about the costs of continuing the war and are discouraged about the prospects of winning. Repons suggest that some of the generals may be willing to pursue a negotiated settlement of the war. And talks with knowledgeable diplomats suggest that Fretilin is also interested in negotiations. These say that Fretilin is apparently Indonesia to secure withdrawal of Indonesian forces from East Timor and self-determination. to recognise that East Timor is located in an isolated pan of the world between two powerful non-communist nationsIndonesia and Australia-and that the East Timorese must ultimately live and work with their neighbours. Fretilin is thought to be willing to consider licensed exploitation by Indonesia of its natural resources, including offshore serves. Fretilin may also be omic ties with Indonesia, and to abstain from supporting separatist movements in the vast Indonesian archipelago. I believe it to be a fact that on 15 April of this year in New York it was intended that there would be a meeting between an Indonesian General and Jose Ramos Horta, who is the representative of the Democratic Republic ofEast Timor at the United Nations. I believe that, because of beyond the control of both parties, that meeting did not take place. I also believe that there is a real probability that the meeting will, within the next week or so, take place on neutral territory. If there is a possibility of a in negotiated peace settlement, I believe that Austraha has a major role to play in it. I wish to propose an eight-point plan contingent upon the to willingness of the parties to negotiate a settlement rather than to permit the continuing to go on year after year, as it undoubtedly will, with no end in sight. (1) 1 would suggest that the obvious place, if negotiations are to occur, would be in Australia. (2) The obvious chairman-mediator of those negotiation discussions should be our Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Honourable Andrew Peacock who, I respectfully submit, is a statesman of world eminence and a person who is highly qualified to chair such discussions. (3) It is imperative that there should be an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of both sides to proclaimed areas. (4) In respect of those proclaimed areas the United Nations should send into East Timor, with the consent of both parties, a peace-keeping force to ensure that the military forces of each side are in fact contained therein. I suggest that the immediate admission of International Red Cross may now be very close to reality. I need merely refer to the fact that whilst Australia has repeatedly requested the admission of International Red Cross to East Timor, until today there has not been a positive response. It is indeed heartening to read a report today that following discussions between President Suharto and Vice-President Mondale, International Red Cross may now be admitted to East Timor. If that can be confirmed it is a step that I am sure sources honourable members on both sides of the House willing to make concessions to will welcome warmly. Fretilin leaders are said (6) A situation could now be reached in which, if negotiations could be brought about, there should be a renewal of the requests by Australian members of Parhament to make not an unofficial oil revisit but, in fact, an official visit, to East Timor. willing to agree to close econ(7) I beheve it would be the wish of all parties, if there is to be a negotiated settlement, that there should be a proper act of selfdetennination in accordance with intemauonal law, to let the people of East Timor decide for themselves. I have not the slightest doubt that if the vote were to go in favour of integration of East Timor with Indonesia, and the vote were properly conducted, it would be accepted by the representatives of Fretilin. (8)1 want further to submit that in the term future integrity of the Democratic Republic ofEast Timor could be well safe-guarded by the making of treaties between the Republic, Indonesia, Australia and Papua New Guinea. We three nations, Australia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, virtually surround East Timor. We believe it to be the wish of people good intent in those three countries-and I inters. clude President Suharto in these remarks-tha the integrity ofEast Timor could be maintained. It is indeed heartening to believe-and I do lieve it to be the fact-that we could in this and age sit down around a conference table reach a situation where bloodshed would be ended, death would cease and destruction devastation be brought to a conclusion. I do not wish to raise hopes unjustifiably. fully aware that there have been discussions on both sides of the fence on possible negotiations for a peaceful settlement. I am also aware that there has been argument whether a settlement negotiated by the representatives of Fretilin outside East Timor would be accepted by the Fretilin forces inside East Timor. I believe President Nicholau Lobato is now in a situation where he would be prepared to consider entering into negotiations. In my view, it is obvious that negotiations are to take place Australia has major role to play. I say with the utmost conWolfram's fidence that Australia's integrity in this matter, notwithstanding heartburnings about the deheaded cision of 20 January, is high. The status and standing of the Minister for Foreign Affairs high within the Pacific area, indeed the world. Concrete slab (4 in) as deck Inadequate stiffening in boxes I ask the Australian Government to watch closely the developments over the next few weeks and to be prepared to come forward to assist. Please God, Mr Deputy Speaker, if the situation does develop where negotiations can take place, I hope that Australia wtil stand ready to play a vital role in ending a war which has been a matter of great concern and distress to every Australian, regardless of his party political longpersuasion. I trust that the Government will watch the matter closely and act with speed and impartiality if the call is made to our nation to mediate in this most important matter.",28

Followday ing the adverse report of the Royal Commission and on the West Gate Bridge, Dr W. A. Fairhurst, CBE., an eminent Scottish bridge engineer was and brought in as Director of Engineering. He produced an essentially conservative new design with the assistance of Mr Harold Richards and I am Dr George Deutsch. This involved building four additional piers and four additional cables fixed to each of two central towers. This was designed to reduce the greatest areas of stress in the side spans between piers 10-11 and 14-15. However, on 22 December 1971, without conthat sulting Fairhurst, the Technical Committee of the West Gate Bridge Authority rejected Fairhurst's plan and substituted an alternative if hypothesis by Professor Karlheinz Roik and Mr a Hans Wolfram, less than 24 hours after Mr return from an overseas trip.

Construcuon costs have escalated from an estimated $42m to $150m by March 1978, and a possible total of $ 175m by 1979 when it is hoped that the Bridge will open. These figures do not include interest charges which amount to more than $10m per annum. The Wolfram-Roik design was a catastrophic tively blunder which has added about $80m in cost, In not counting additional interest charges, and four, perhaps five, years delay bridge. I examined the files of the Authority and greatest found that: 1. No technical documentation was subopinion mitted in support of the hasty decision abandon the Fairhurst scheme and adopt the Wolfram-Roik proposal. In fact, at thetimeof the change there was no detailed plan actually in existence; it was merely an untested hypothesis. 2. No reasons for the change were provided by the Technical Committee. 3. Dr Fairhurst, as Director of Engineering, was not consulted. 4. The Authority Chairman, Mr Oscar Meyer, claimed in the Melbourne Herald 30 July 1977 that Fairhurst's plan was rejected because it was estimated to cost more than Wolfram-Roik scheme. However the minutes of the 19th Report of the Directorate of eering, a document dated 20 January 1972, estimated that the Fairhurst scheme would cost an extra $1.5m and the Wolfram-Roik plan an extra $2m, that is $500,000 more the Fairhurst scheme. To lay opinion it might appear Fairhurst scheme would cost more because it meant erecting 4 extra piers and 8 extra cables. However, these costs were far outweighed by the unanticipated extra labor cost of the Wolframthe Roik plan. Fairhurst's scheme provided for rect external support at the two greatest areas (Original) (Proposed (Adopted) Freeman Fox Fairhurst-Richards- Wolfram-Roik and Partners ' Deutsch No external support at spans 10-11 and 14-15 10-11 and 14-15 Different external Same external appearance as appearance- 4 extra piers in Freeman Fox and and 4 extra cables Partners Areas of addidonal expense: Areas of addidonal expense: thickened deck + external welding and bolting supports further stiffening for boxes that is, between piers 10-11 and piers is 14-15. The Wolfram-Roik scheme provided that these two areas should not have direct external support, but should depend on a highly sophisticated, intricate and expensive stiffening by welding andrivettinginside the box girders. This substituted additional horizontal strengthening at enormous labour cost for the simple and relacheap external support of piers and cables. addition, a half inch metal 'battle deck'-it is hke an aircraft carrier's deck-woul d replace a in opening the concrete deck. Again, to lay opinion it might seem that the stress point in the bridge would be in the middle of the long central span. Once more, lay would be wrong. As the two volumes of to diagrams produced by the firm of Hardcastle and Richards Pty Ltd, consulting engineers of Melbourne, demonstrated-especiall y the one labelled 71/107/15-the 'bending moments' of the central span amounts to minus 55,000 tons/ feet. Between piers 10-11 and 14-15 thefigureis minus 120,000 tons/feet on each side. The West Gate Bridge Authority was, at all relevant times, under the chairmanship of Mr Oscar Meyer, OBE., Chairman of Australian Carbon Black Pty Ltd and a Commissioner of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The Deputy Chairman was Mr B. J., now Sir Bernard, on Callinan, CBE., D.S.O., M.C., Chairman and Managing Director of Gutteridge Haskins and the Davey Pty Ltd, Consulting Engineers, a Commissioner of the State Electricity Commission of EnginVictoria, a Commissioner of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and a Director of BP Australia Ltd. Below the West Gate Bridge Board was a Technical Committee of three than Board members comprising Sir Bernard Calhnan as Chairman, Mr Meyer and Mr J. R. Duggan of that the Colonial Gas Holdings Ltd. Below the Technical Committee in 1971-72 was a three man Directorate of Engineering. At relevant time in 1971 Dr W. A. Fairhurst was dithe Director of Engineering, Mr Hans Wolfram of was Deputy Director, and the third member was Mr Harold Richards of Hardcastle and Richards Pty Ltd, consulting engineers. Mr Wolfram was then, and still is, a Director of Gutteridge, Haskins and Davey, Sir Bernard Callinan's Richards was a strong supporter of Fairhurst his scheme. Wolfram, as soon appeared, was a secret opponent. In September 1971 Fairhurst's scheme was adopted by the West Gate Bridge Board after lengthy scrutiny by the Technical Committee. Despite that, Sir Bernard Callinan was quoted in the Age of 11 September 1971 as saying, with engineering. uncanny foresight, that 'the general appearance technological of the bridge would not change, but there would politicians be many internal modifications '-in other words accepted exactly the reverse of the Fairhurst scheme. Mr nologists-tha Wolfram was then sent abroad, ostensibly cruit new contractors and technicians to carry out the Fairhurst scheme, but in reahty to sabotage it. Fairhurst resigned in disgust and Sir Bernard Callinan became engineer for the steel span self from the end of 1971 until August 1973. fessor Roik came out from Germany and on 15 February 1972 Mr Meyer told the Age that he had completed the alternative design for day completing the bridge 'within. 40 hours of arrivquestion ing in Australia'. At all materialtimesthe 'responsible' Minister was the Hon. R. J. Hamer, M.L.C, then Minister for Local Government. It is clear that he never understood the significance of the major design changes and even told the Victorian Parhament that the new plans, the Wolfram-Roik plans, that problem. rested on Dr Fairhurst's international reputation. In fact, Fairhurst was bitterly opposed to the plans adopted. Subsequent Ministers in sufficient charge, the Hon. R. J. Hunt and the Hon. J. Rafferty who went to the Ministry of Transport in 1973, have not understood the issues either. The West Gate Bridge came under the Ministry of Transport from 1973. The story of Fairhurst's elimination has aU classic elements of a conspiracy. The very comrecognise plexity of the issues involved was a trump card the hands of the conspirators. The most alarming aspect of this horror story is the complete ignorcoining ance of the Victorian Government and its willbecause ingness to leave all technical decisions to the caUed experts. The so-called Professorial Technicepted. cal Advisory Group quoted by the Victorian Government in support of the Wolfram-Roik are scheme literally never met and its members were individually conned into signing a statement support prepared by International Public Reondly, lations Ltd. Worst of aU, vital information has been suppressed, particularly the fact that greatest stress areas in the bridge have no external support. Every newspaper in Australia ought to demand the right to publish diagram firm. 71/107/15. Unfortunately the West Gate and promotors have been able to assume that the very complexity of the issues will protect them from exposure because exposure rests on an understanding of the facts. In my letter to the publication Engineers Australia on 27 January 1978,1 wrote: The worrying question posed by West Gate is not about It is about decision-making. In an increasingly age, who makes the decisions? Should it be the or the technologists? I draw the line at the often argument that technology is best left to the techt somewhere there is a man in a white coat who understands complexities and that we should leave decisionto remaking in his hands (or claws).",31
54,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS,"The matter I raise today is one of growing concern to himmany Australians. The closer that Australians ProUve to the point of entry to Australia of Vietnamese boat people, as they are described, the greater is the concern of those people. On Tuesof this week I raised this problem by way of to ascertain whether the Government's policies and procedures are sufficient to cope with the anticipated escalation in the numbers of these refugees coming to this country by boat. The answer I received reflected an appreciation by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) that there is a problem and that procedures were changing to cope with I question whether these changes will prove to head off a potentially dangerous situA. ation. The National Times this week devoted a full page article to this subject. In July 1977 I warned that the first boat load was only the beginning of a flood of these refugees from Vietnam. Unfortunately the prediction has proved to be only too true. At thattimeI suggested that we the should toughen our attitudes from the outset, a change in the ground rules and upin date our procedures to cope with the absolute certainty of an increasing quantity of refugees to our shores. The numbers wtil increase of the initial and basic attitudes that we soadopted on that occasion. First, they were acOnce a foot is placed on Australian soil it is difficult to have it removed even when there others who seek to enter this country through the authorised door of normal immigration proin cedure and should have a higher priority. Secwelfare relief offered for a week's subsistence, which amounts to probably ten times more the than the average monthly income of people in Vietnam, can only be an encouragement and not a disincentive. The communication channel back to South East Asia was established by the first arrival of these boat refugees and by sympathetic and emotional Press comment. Probably this was only natural but it was not realistic as the circumstances have since proved. Good news travels fast, particularly to South East Asia. This news was received and welcomed in that area and particularly in Vietnam as evidenced by the ever increasing flow of boat people who are now arriving on our shores. At each port of contact on the way to Australia the boats receive directions and instructions on how to proceed. Singapore and Indonesia do not want them but at the end of the line ties Austraha which is known to be favourably disposed towards the refugees. An article from Darwin headed 'More refugees', which appears in today's Australian Financial Review, states: Vietnamese refugees landed at Melville Island, north Darwin, yesterday to ask a surprised local policeman the way to Darwin. A police spokesman in Darwin said day that there were two refugee boats anchored off Island. Navy sources said that the boats carried 42 Perhaps the policeman should have directed these boats and future refugees to a port of entry at either Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane. This may be the only way in which a real appreciation of the problem can be given to the majority of Australians living in the security of the southern and eastern coastline. Darwin and northern Austraha should not be deserted and let bear the refugees. burden of this problem alone. Austraha security, Australian jobs and to an extent Austrahan risks are as great and as important as health problems in respect of the exotic and other disI eases associated with the boat people. In all areas of defence, security, health, immigration, foreign affairs and drug trafficking we should be alert the dangers and change accordingly. In Mackay on the eastern seaboard we have afirsthand witAustraUa. ness to poaching by Taiwanesefishermenon our Barrier Reef and the plunder they cause. On the occasion an arrest is effected-and that is not often-w e realise only too well the gaps in our present pohcies that leave us open to the dangers that I have mentioned. I do not talk out of a lack of sympathy for genuine refugee. All Australians would have genuine sympathy for refugees who arefleeingin the face of spreading communism and the alternative with which many of them must be faced. But how do we determine a genuine from a non-genuine refugee? How do we set the guidelines of acceptance or rejection? How do keep these guidelinesfluid?How do we have this concern shared by other nations that are not necessarily affected? The Minister assured the House the other day that co-operation to effect delays was being sought by nations and governments which are on the route taken by the refugees. But can these delays be effected? This is not the first time that the Australian Government has had to deal with the problem of refugees. I remind the House of the refugee problem between West Irian, a province of Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea while that country was still a territory of Australia. Many hundreds of Papuan refugees came across the Papua New Guinea border into the West Sepik district and the western district of that country. In the West Sepik refugees were immediately interned in a refugee camp where they were held in quarantine and seclusion from the outside world until their application for temporary residential status was either granted or rejected. Upon rejection they were returned to their own country, of although in many cases they were in fact granted yestertemporary residence in Papua New Guinea. In Melville many cases people who came into Papua New people. Guinea were treated as illegal immigrants and consequently were held under the relevant sections of the Immigration Act until their residential status could be determined. This allowed the Australian and Papua New Guinea governments to screen carefully all entries to ensure that only the desirables were allowed into the country and that exotic diseases were not brought in by the Although there was some criticism of the drug administration of the Papua New Guinea refugee problem it was extremely successful and beheve that a similar system should be applied to Vietnamese entering Austraha. I am sure that such a system would placate a lot of the antito Vietnamese pubUc opinion and feeling that is commencing to spread throughout the north of I submit these comments to the House because I am concerned that this refugee problem can only escalate, just as I was concerned in too July of last year when I first raised this matter and predicted the possibility of what has now in as Australians fact become the truth. There is a feeling of isolation in our north the which deepens when evidence becomes available through these incursions on to our shore. Lack of proper defence and a positive attitude towards these refugees is concerning many now northern people. Many people who are prevented from bringing to Australia close friends or relatives because of the job aspects of we our immigration policy complain bitterly about our open-handed pohcy towards these Vietnamese refugees. I would imagine that most honourable members have had that comment made to them over the last six months. I suggest that Austraha estabhsh some offvice shore base on an island on which all the necessencumbrance ary security and health checks that are required could be conducted before these people arrive Austraha. The refugees on the base could be processed by officers of the Department of Immiannounced gration and Ethnic Affairs for acceptance patriation, depending on the circumstances each individual. But time must be given for that inspection process to be carried out. Our defence surveillance should be brought to a level to able the boat people to be intercepted and companied to such a base. It would be easier internationalise the problem from an off-shore base than from an Austrahan base because once it becomes an Austrahan base it is a national problem and not an international problem. I do not doubt that 20 years hence will see great change in the characteristics of the typical Austrahan and that the Vietnamese and East Asian cultures will play a part in the change that we see reflected at the moment. These people will add their own culture to our way life. However, for the present, we face a difficult position in which northern Australians have very definite views on this subject. So I ask in Grievance Debate that the Government treat this matter as a problem, both nationally and ternationally, which requires urgent attention. trust that the Government will give urgent tion to the whole refugee problem, particularly the boat refugee problem.",32
55,Mr SCHOLES,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS," I wish to talk about a matter which is closely related, but directly related to that which has been raised the honourable member for Dawson (Mr in Braithwaite), that is, the manner in which the surveillance of Australia's coastline and rerangements. sources zones is to be undertaken and the posthe criterion. ition of the defence forces in that undertaking. I am concerned- I have expressed this concern in this House on a previous occasion-abou t the continual statements of the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) in which he has made it quite clear that he is seeking to remove surveillance of the nature mentioned by the honourable member for Dawson, that is, coastal surveillance of territorial integrity, from the function of the Defence Force, despite the fact that in the Government's White Paper on defence that function is clearly set out in a number of places as being an accepted function of the Defence Force. My concern is that the defence forces, through the professional advisers to the Minister, are seeking to protect their budgetary arrangements by the deof shedding what could become a growing on their funds unless other financial arrangements are made. It is a serious situin ation and one which I think is regrettable. On 24 January of this year, the Government that it was setting up a committee of or repermanent heads to examine and make recof ommendations on the means of increasing the level of Australia's coastal surveillance. It was imphed in that statement that the Government enconsidered that a greater degree of coastal suracveillance was required and that the Government to would fund the necessary increases. If that was not meant, such an explanation should have been included in the statement. The fact that the defence planners feel it necessary to oppose this proposition because they see it as a threat to the funds available to them for what they see as proper defence functions indicates the necessity a for the Government not only to make a decision but also to make clear the funding arrangements South and the sources of those funds. There has been considerable discussion about of this matter and a number of proposals concerning it have been put forward. I understand that at least one which is under consideration by the this Government- a news sheet which circulates in Canberra has said that the decision has already inbeen made in this regard, but I should hope that I that is not true-suggest s the setting up of an attenindependent coastguard. There are arrangements already for co-operation between departments, under the chairmanship of the Department of Transport, for the collection and collation of information on civil surveillance matters and the use of that information. Cernot tainly no one could suggest that the defence by forces would be carrying out civilian pohce roles this area. That is a matter which could be fairly simply disposed of by adntinistrative arI think it important that that not be The setting up of a separate coastguard service is an attractive but certainly a misinterpreted proposal. If we were to set up a separate coastguard operation in Australia to provide separate surveillance for what are basically civtiian'roles, although I should have thought not, a fairly substantial organisation would have to be set up. It would have to be a much more substantial organisation than most people tend to think. The United States coastguard regularly appears in various forms on our television screens, but most people do not realise the extent of that organisation. The United States coastguard has a strength of some 35,000 men. It has a number of small ships and large ships, far in excess of the total number of Australian Defence Force ships. The United States coastguard has substantial numbers of aircraft and helicopters and a substantial quantity of other specialised equipment. That coastguard would not be comparable, even though the United States and Australian coastlines are, with any force that may be envisaged as a separate operation in Australia. It should also be pointed out that if the Dehas fence Force, which has the technical capacity communications and logistics command expand. arrangements, does not undertake the actual physical surveillance tasks, new arrangements will have to be implemented. New command authorities, new lines of command and a totally new bureaucracy will have to be established in order to carry out a function which is being ried out at the moment substantially by the Dement fence Force although without the necessary functions: equipment or funding. We cannot, as was peting suggested by the Minister in answer to a questhink tion, wait for or depend on the development of over-the-horizon radar. We certainly cannot to expand the highly technical military surveilnationally lance equipment which is in fact purchased for and should be utilised mainly for military puruse poses. Thus additional equipment will be required and obviously, additional funding will be required. I suggest to the House that in either the short term or long term it would be cheaper to fund a special unit of the Services to cany this function. It would also be more efficient a national point of view, remembering that our budget availability for any given purpose is stricted and is certainly not comparable with that of the United States, to which a lot of the tion about a coastguard allude. I repeat that I am concerned that practical cussion about how this function can be carried out does not appear to be taking place, certainly not at the defence level. I should have thought that in any budgetary discussions where funding for defence was going to be a serious problem if low threat situation were to continue over period of years an actual functional operation would be of assistance to the budgetary claims of the Department of Defence. I think it is bad polion tics for the Department of Defence to be seen be shedding a role which most Australians, especially those in northern Australia, see as of its functions and as a responsibility which ought to be undertaken. Recently Mr foot Everingham, who is the Majority Leader in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, made the point that northern Australians are part of Australia and, as such, are entitled to expect that they would be defended by the Australian Defence Force. This statement was repudiated by the Minister for Defence. But I think it sets out the concern of people in northern Australia, who feel that they are the ones who are at risk and that they are the ones who are vulnerable. If the Government opts for a separate coastguard, within a few years we will have the situation where a quasi-Service organisation which access to pubticity on the grounds of what it in is doing on a regular basis will be seeking to That, I am sure everyone accepts, is a certainty. That organisation will be seeking to expand on the basis that it has functions to perform, functions which must be performed and functions which the Australian people consider they are entitled to expect to be performed. The carpressure on budgets will be back on the Departof Defence because it will not be one of its It will be a function which will be comwith its military surveillance operations. I it politically unwise of the Minister for Defence and of his advisers to seek to have the Deseek partment opt out of this role. It would be unwise for the Government to come to a conclusion whereby another force seeking to funds and establish a second bureaucracy in an almost parallel field would be formed.",34
56,Mr GILES,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS," I thought both the honourable member for Corio (Mr out Scholes) and the honourable member for Dawfrom son (Mr Braithwaite) made thoughtful speeches with thoughtful suggestions. If I could pick up rethe theme running through both speeches in relation to the arrival of Vietnamese refugees the suggesone thing I would say as Chairman of the Government Parties' Rural Committee is that if rumours are correct that these vessels are today dislined up in Darwin harbour then the Government is probably not doing as much as it should do to achieve safety for the human and livestock populations of Australia by leaving them lined up in that way. If they are wooden boats they a should be burnt. If they are steel vessels they a should be isolated and sprayed according to technical advice. It may well be that they are subject to that treatment. If that is so, I fall back my first position and say that obviously they to should be destroyed by burning if they are wooden and capable of being destroyed. Already one we have had more than implications of certainly a type of blue tongue in Australia. We could get and mouth disease from those countries through which these vessels pass. There is a full range of human diseases against which the nadon must be safeguarded. Parhament is about to pass Bills proclaiming the elimination of death duty and gift duty. This, of course, is the biggest single action it could have taken on behalf of rural properties and farmers in general. I have always felt that for too long the small businessmen and small farmers of Austraha have been bearing the brunt in this field of taxation for the bigger farmers and corporate firms that can arrange theirfinancesand theirfinancialstructures. In both cases they quite logically wish to see their business perpetuated beyond a generation. It is important for the country that they should be perpetuated beyond one generation. However, for too long the small elements of the business and farming communities have borne the brunt. The Government's legislation is the biggest single action it could have taken in the rural area to help those sorely pressed farmers who are currendy experiencing costs rising well ahead of demand for their produce. In many cases they are currendy affected by drought: In many cases for the duration of three years. There are other hopeful signs.

I seek leave of the House to have it incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted.

57,Mr GILES,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS,"I thank the House. The implication of the chart that the honourable member for Port Adelaide has been kind enough to allow me to incorporate in Hansard is that it deals with production in the three major wheat exporting countries-the United States of America, the European Economic Community and Canadawhere production is down, as will be seen from the table. It deals with trade where the world estimated projected use of wheat and flour in the coming year is up significandy on estimations. It deals with stocks held in the seven major wheat producing nations of the world. I tliink that will be of interest to and a hopeful sign for those farmers involved in wheat production whose income is very largely dictated by world export prices. I want to spend the remaining five minutes available to me in discussing the wine grape growing industry. Honourable members wtil be well aware by now that during the 1978 harvest there has been a very large surplus of grapes in Austraha. About three-quarters of the surplus of grapes for which a home has not been found for the produce of many of the 6,000-plus grape growers throughout Austraha comes from the State of South Australia. South Australian members of Parliament, and perhaps the honourable member for Wakefield in particular, have a very grave responsibihty. Much of the wine and brandy industry of Australia is centred OUTLOOK in the Barossa Valley, the Riverland area and more recently in the Clare area of my electorate. The honourable member for Wakefield has a grave responsibihty to keep putting forward the views of, on the one hand, the many grape growers, and on the other hand the tremendous number of South Austrahans involved in the processing and distillation processes of the wine and brandy industry. Because the four minutes remaining to me is not sufficient for me to go into this area in depth, in brief terms the current situation is that the majority of the grape surplus in Australia is of red grapes-sruraz , cabernet, grenache and other varieties. That is the area in which demand has fallen off quite alarmingly in the past few years. If I might mix my metaphors, it is not all beer and skittles on the white wine scene. Some of the surplus today in South Australia is also of white grape varieties. The reason for this is that the for five increasing demand for white wine is levelling off. The only third ingredient which allows grape growers an outlet for their production is in the field of brandy. Without being politically nasty in any way might I remind the House that the Whitlam Government virtually taxed brandy off the market. In three separate steps it increased the excise on brandy, not by 20 per cent, 30 per cent or 80 per cent, but by 231 per cent in a 10-month period. I must be fair and say that due to the budgetary problems of the Fraser Government it has not done anything to try to correct that situation. It is my hope that as the Federal Government comes towards the current Budget it will have a very close look at the enormous amount of money taken from the wine grape growing areas by the Federal Government. Without being precise, about $29m has been taken from that industry. In other industries this charging by the Government can be borne by processors and by companies andfirmsinvolved in distillation and processing. In the case of the wine grape growing industry, its vertical integration is quite acute. Anything that happens at the top end of the industry is visited back through the consumer directly to the producer. I hope the House would support me in mainting taining that any industry that the Government takes from today should be at least an economic industry, a viable industry. One can think of many, many cases in this countiy where the opwere posite position pertains and the Government has in one form or another helped by protection, subsidies, grants and in many other ways. I the Government that it cannot continue to bleed an industry that is self-sufficient. Surely a purpose of any government action is to keep industry that is viable in that situation so that not a sock on the taxpayer. I am hopeful that Federal Government will decrease the excise brandy in the coming Budget. If it does, that represent the only remaining outlet for surplus grapes. In 1954 the government of the day did preanswer cisely this. There was then a surplus of grapes and the surplus disappeared within a matter of two or three years. Those honourable opposite who remember the Coombs report wtil recall his suggestion to the Whitlam Government that excise advantage to brandy should be moved. Being wise in hindsight-althoug h fought it at the time. I say that it was logical. There was a big and heavy demand for grapes. There is not now. The Coombs' argument logic can be reversed accurately and entirely and the advantage of the wine grape grower as Parliament brandy represents the only possible growth area with a decrease of excise over the next few years, until once again grape growing and consumer demand gets into balance.",36
58,Mr ARMITAGE,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS," I wish to grieve about two matters today. The first one concerns the very important issue of Question Time when questions are asked in this Parliament without notice. I refer to the long period that Ministers take in answering questions and the contempt by the Executive, particularly by some Ministers, for the Parliament itself-and I make that point very clearly-in that they ignore repeated requests from the Chair to shorten their answers. I do not say that with disrespect to the Chair. As I am one of the Deputy Chairmen of Committees I have the greatest respect for the Chair. However, I have noticed that successive Speakers have appealed to Ministers to shorten the length of answers to questions and I have seen, despite frequent requests from successive Speakers, those appeals completely ignored. For that reason I think it is important that we ought to have a look at what has been happening. In 1968, the Parliament sat for 66 days. In 1968 the average number of questions each sitday was 20.2. In 1977 the Parliament sat for 68 days, two days more than it sat in 1968. In 1977, the average number of questions a day was 15. Thosefiguresdo not include questions which ruled out of order. Quite a number of questions have been ruled out of order in recent times not because of the attitude adopted by the warn Speaker but because of the inexperience of members. The reason that so few questions are prime able to be asked during Question Time is that an Question Time is being utilised by Ministers to it is make statements in respect of which leave should the be asked after Question Time to make a stateon ment to the House. Virtually on every occasion will leave would be granted for a Minister to make such a statement. Lengthy answers by Ministers are a method which is used to stifle honourable members asking questions which may be embarrassing to the Government so that the longer the given by a Minister the less likelihood there is of embarrassing questions being directed to the Minister who is making a lengthy reply or members to one ofhis colleagues. I submit that this Parliament steadily is berecoming an instrument of the Executive which of I course means that the Executive is no longer under effective scrutiny of the back bench. I again state that there is a growing practice of contempt on the part of the Executive here in this to Parhament and outside it for the processes of itself. I think this is a very serious situation because, after all, Question Time is the only opportunity for backbenchers on both sides of this Parliament to scratinise the activities of the Executive. The only other way is to put something in writing. Usually we get back the typical Public Service reply which dodges the basic issues which have been raised. It is here in this forum through the cut and thrust of debate that the greatest opportunity exists for us to obtain answers and informadon. I do not say that this problem is peculiar to this Government. I want to be quite honest about this. This also occurred when we were in office. I was concerned then at the fact that a steady deterioration in Question Time was occurring so far as the number of questions which were being asked. Of course the fact is that today Ministers instead of addressing themselves to the question that has been asked tend by using the thimble and pea trick to turn the question onto a different issue altogether and answer, if you like, a different question even though they may claim it has some relevance to the question that was originally asked. Mr John Brown-They do it all the time.",37
59,Mr ARMITAGE,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS,"As the honourable member for Parramatta says, they do it all the time. I believe that it is well and trulytimethat the Standing Orders in regard to the relevance of answers to questions in this Parliament were updated in order to avoid this use of a Standing Order in a way that attimesis quite disgraceful. I do grieve about this matter. I think it is very important indeed that we should face up to it as a Parliament otherwise this Parliament wtil no longer be an effective check on the Executive and what is occurring behind the scenes. The other matter I wish to deal with is the question of Norfolk Island. I have been shocked to read reports that Norfolk Island is to stay as a tax haven at a time when the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has been announcing that he is going to close all tax loopholes. He has announcedand I give him full credit for this- a number of instances of loopholes that are to be closed, including the Curran scheme. There was some minor disagreement so far as the Labor Party was concerned in that we wanted the tax avoidance legislation made retrospective to an earlier date than the Government proposed, but the Treasurer did not agree with that. Nevertheless we applaud the fact that at least some schemes are to be closed. However, there are at least 14 other loopholes which have not been closed. Norfolk Island is a recognised tax haven. I first raised this in 1970.1 raised in 1971 and in 1972 the fact that Norfolk Island and the New Hebrides were being used as tax havens by the wealthy in this country. People have come down here from Norfolk Island-peopl e with a conscience-to point this out to honourable members. Yet in the new arrangements which apparently the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott) has announced in Norfolk Island the Island still will be a tax haven for Australians. It will have a different taxation system from all other Australian territories. It will have a taxation system under which a much smaller rate of tax will be levied. It really is quite extraordinary when one considers that the Treasurer, having announced that he is going to close all these tax loopholes, in reply to a question asked the other day by my colleague from Western Australia, the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins), said that he would not agree to closing that extraordinary rank of the tax loophole of family trusts. The reason was that very prominent people-peopl e in the establishment in this countiy-ar e involved in family trusts. Mr John Brown - Member s of the Government.",38
60,Mr ARMITAGE,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS,"Not only members of this Government but also the Premier of Victoria. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), and the former Treasurer are all on record as being involved in family trusts, which is one of the most effective ways to avoid tax. The Treasurer used a new phrase the other day in reply to a question asked in this House. He did not say 'tax avoidance'. I cannot recall his exact words but he said something to the effect that this is a way of cutting down your tax.",38
61,Mr YOUNG,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS,Minimising .,38
62,Mr ARMITAGE,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS,"' Mimmising '-that was the word. It is called minimising tax. It is not tax avoidance; it is a minimising of taxation. The facts of life are that all the wage and salary earners in this country cannot minimise their taxes. They all have to pay tax on their full incomes. If they fail to declare one tiny bit of income a tax inspector will go out, bring them into the Taxation Office and put them under investigation and interrogation because they may have tried to reduce their tax by $10, $20 or $30 in a year. Apparently when a Prime Minister, a Premier of Victoria, a Deputy Prime Minister of this country and a former Treasurer who is at present a Minister are involved it is no longer tax avoidance; it is tax minimising. For that reason, I ask that this Parliament itself, and in particular the Treasurer, should give serious consideration to this question.",38
63,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS,Mr Drummond) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,39
64,Mr NEIL,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS,"I rise to express concern about a number of actions of the New South Wales Government, particularly as they relate to the federal sphere. The first one is the New South Wales Government's actions that are inconsistent, to say the least, with a strong policy directed towards the elimination of terrorism. That Government has left itself open to clear charges that it is soft on terrorism in two main areas. Firsdy, it is apparently determined to close a block in a prison in Sydney which is the only block suitable for the incarceration of the most dangerous class of criminal. I make it plain- I have made it clear in this House beforethat terrorists should not be glamourised by the community. Those persons are criminals. There is no point in talking about executions when we are talking about plain, simple-althoug h in many cases digusting-murders . These criminals need to be contained. If it is not possible to contain them, escapes or the practice of trading in prisoners can develop. The Katingal block in Sydney was built especially to contain the most dangerous form criminal, the person who is often in the class ferred to as the terrorist. It had a special set curity arrangements. It was also designed to prevent the type of action that occurred in Belfast some years ago when a helicopter flew into prison and a number of persons escaped by means. Even though it has been so specially designed there has already been one escape from this prison which is supposed to be security proof. To my knowledge, the person who amongst escaped has not since been found. What is the community to expect? Is it to expect protection is it to expect a permissive attitude towards type of criminal? We know the prison officers' attitude. The prison officers have found that since the Government made its announcement that it will close the prison there has been a upsurge of activity in the prisons by way of ings of warders, riots and undisciplined behaviour. Only a few weeks ago, a riot occurred during the time that prison warders- I do not excuse them for this-were adhering to strict rules of work and were operating with a staff. During this period a riot occurred. It was said that within 20 minutes large numbers of the most dangerous criminals in Sydney would have been outside the major blocks and would have had only the walls to scale, if an alert had been sent out. Prison officers came from their homes-som e came from their local clubs and other places they had gone whilst they were off duty and the riot was quelled. Since that time,the New South Wales Government has asked the police to go in. But the police are not specialised in these matters, and have in some cases refused, for example, to do the cooking for prisoners. So the situation is in turmoil because of this decision of the New South Wales Government to close the only maximum security block in New South Wales and, according to my advice, the only maximum security block in Australia considered capable of dealing with the maximum criminal element known as the terrorist. The New South Wales Government has said that it will close this block without having another block ready to take these people. It has made vague statements about where it will build another block or where it will disperse the prisoners. There is no proposal available that would have another maximum security block in operation within the one month that the New South Wales Premier said it would take him to close Katingal. Of course, since then because of the political difficulties that have arisen he has had to have some further inquiries made into the matter. He has had to back-track. His great words ""of about 'one month or else' are starting to look resick, but he still appears determined to go ahead of seand close the Katingal block as soon as possible. What is going to happen to these prisoners? a There are persons in that block at the present that time who have committed the most heinous crimes, persons who would be in the company of terrorists if they were sent there. The proposal is to close the block and to disperse these prisoners prisoners in other gaols. Not only is this dangerous but it also flies in the face of sensible or and reasonable penal attitudes. What is the point this of taking the most hardened criminals and dispersing them amongst other prisoners, particularly youthful prisoners who, in society's interest, should be rehabilitated. The New South great Wales Government will take these men, many of bashwhom are in prison for 15 or 20 year terms for the most vicious crimes, and disperse them through the prisons and allow other prisoners, particularly younger persons to come into contact with them. It is not only offensive to all reasonable ideas of protection of the community, but also it is offensive to sensible proposals for reduction in prison reform itself. I call on the community at large to write letters and to contact their State representatives because it is the State Government that has power over not this prison. If there should be-and we hope not-incident s of an international nature of a type of terrorist activity that comes near our shores, which are matters that the Federal Government obviously has an interest in and which might have to be dealt with under federal law, then surely we in this Parliament want to know that any persons convicted will subsequently be held in the appropriate maximum security prison. Even if the conditions in such a prison were considered in some cases to be severe and excessive, surely a reasonable review could have been conducted without the necessity to abolish the whole block, without the necessity to getridof it. The second area in which the New South potential Wales Government appears to be soft on terrorthe ism is that of special branches. Let me make it clear at the outset that I believe strongly organs of the States, such as special branches, must ultimately be under the elected government, ultimately under the control of the people. There are, of course, security arrangements that have to be kept and there are necessary measures of secrecy that have to be expired. complied with. However, I do not believe that special branches can become a law unto their own, that they can adopt practices and proterrorism-th cedures that are unknown to the appropriate Minister. But having said that, we now find the New South Wales Attorney-General and the South Australian Attorney-General have comto bined to consider at least the limitation of roles of special branches. By implication, there appears to be a policy developing of the comconfronted. plete restriction or even abolition of special branches. In New South Wales the Special Branch has the best of my knowledge acted responsibly and reasonably in the past few years. The New South Wales Premier recently said that he thought the Special Branch had acted reasonably. Files have been found that are ancient and those matters presently are under consideration. The position does not appear to be comparable to that which arose in South Australia. But if, as has been stated, the Labor Caucus in New South Wales is seriously considering the abolition of the Special Branch or placing strict restrictions on its ties, it is going about it in entirely the wrong It is necessary to have strong, sensible special branches with officers who are trained properly. believe there is something to be said for more them going overseas for proper training in multidisciplines, including the proper provision of civil liberty facilities to persons with whom come into contact and including a full underyoung standing of their responsibilities to the elected government. If the States abolished special branches it would be a very serious state of affairs because the Federal Government's supervision in these areas runs constitutionally only to a certain degree. In my own practice at the Bar previously and since I have been in politics, I have found that matters come to the notice of members of Parliament that cannot be raised in the public arena but which require the attention of the authorities. Often no real problem exists when the matters are looked at. Special branches operating properly and sensibly are the first arm of intelligence gathering for the purpose of understanding terrorist activity. Without intelligence community is blind. Without an understanding of what terrorists are up to, we are incapable that of proper reaction. The New South Wales Government is embarking upon a very dangercontrol of the ous course indeed.",39
65,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS,"Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has Mr JOHN BROW N (Parramatta) (12.30)-My grievance also concerns a form of e terrorism practised on the young unemployed. Perhaps the most disheartening that aspect of mass unemployment is the length to which some unscrupulous people will go in order exploit the young unemployed. Unemploythe ment, particularly youth unemployment, is the greatest national problem with which we are Youth unemployment in the western suburbs of Sydney is so high that it now ranks with the economically depressed ghetto areas of the United States of America. We are facing the to prospect that many young people will not in the foreseeable future find employment or, at best, will be employed only for a very short duration. In order to alleviate these problems, the Government initiated a scheme called the special youth employment and training program, which provided an incentive for employers to employ young people who had been unemployed for a period of up to four months. Under the scheme they were granted a subsidy of $67 per week for every young person they employed. Most of the activipeople who have been taken on under this way. scheme have been between the ages of 15 years and 19 years. Nearly 40,000 people have been I affected by this program. Over $50m was spent of during thefinancialyear 1977-78 in sustaining it. Sadly, there is evidence that the scheme has they been disgracefully abused and the lives of the people involved have been cynically exploited. According to a survey conducted by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations in December of last year, only 35 per cent of those people taken on under the scheme and completing it have been given permanent jobs by their employers. Obviously, many employers are retrenching young people at the end or shortly before the end of the six months training period. The conclusion to be drawn from this informadon is that many employers are making use of this scheme merely to reduce their operating costs rather than as a means of training personnel-the sole reason for its implementauon. All those people eUgible under the special youth employment and training program have endured periods of employment for at least four months and often for many months longer. It seems to me that employers who practise the cruel deception of promising a young unemployed worker a permanent job under the pretext of this program and then sacking such a person after receiving, in effect, six months cheap labour should be compeUed to refund that subsidy to the Federal Government. It would appear that only through such means can we prevent the type of exploitation I have described. I suspect that there have been several stances in my electorate of the scenario I described becoming a horrible reality. Spurious, or at least very suspect, reasons are advanced the dismissal of these young people near the end of their six months training period. I urge Government to review this scheme, which I Ueve was commenced as a band-aid and a sop for the great mass of unemployed kids. Some scrupulous employers are cynically exploiting scheme and, in the final analysis, breaking the hearts of kids who optimisticaUy think that they are on the threshold of a career only to be thrust back into the limbo of the unemployment want wilderness. There is another related matter regarding the Commonwealth Employment Service which I find incomprehensible. It seems to me to be very strange that many employers- I know that this happens in my electorate-fai l to take advantage of the employment opportunities that are offered to them tofiUvacancies with the number of kids registered for employment with the CES. In my area about 4,500 young people are registered employment. It seems very strange that only per cent of the vacancies that occur in the electorthis ate are filled through the CES. I think that employers generally have Ustened to the theories that are put about by lots of people, in lots cases Government supporters, that aU the young people who are unemployed are long-haired dole bludgers. That is not the case in my electorraised ate. Most of the kids registered at the CES, which I visit quite regularly, are well educated, well brought up, decent young kids looking for a job. They reaUy and diligently want to work. I find it quite sad that employers fail to take the opportunity of this great reservoir of people looking for jobs and instead use the private employment agencies. The kids who are unemployed at the moment represent the best educated group of young people we have ever turned out. Education in the last generation in Australia has seen a revolution. The type of child leaving school at the end of fourth or sixth form is the best educated young kid we have ever turned out. It is very sad that 4,500 of them in my electorate are unemployed, yet vacancies are being filled from other sources. I urge aU employers, particularly those in the Parramatta area, to look to their CES when they have a vacancy tofiU.There is a great mass of kids there who want to work. As an alderman of the local council, I was very pleased that the council saw fit to advertise for ten apprentices infivetrades-plumbing , carpenintry, painting, gardening and mechanics. The have number of kids who came along to apply for these jobs was sickening. Six hundred children for appUed for ten vacancies as apprentices. This proves the point I am making that the bulk of the the young people who are unemployed genuinely bewant to work. They do not want the dole. They want the dignity of employment. They are preunpared to take on apprenticeships, which means the five years on low wages and going to a technical coUege in their own time, which indicates to me that they are kids who genuinely want to work. They do not want to fill in time. They do not the dole in order to go to the beach or the movies or to do the other things of which they are accused. They want work. In my electorate there is a great mass of kids registered with the CES for work. I urge all employers to think about going to the CES and using it as an employment agency. It is not there just to hand out the dole. It is there to find jobs for people. The type of young person I know of who is registered at the CES is the best type. He is for a person I would be very pleased to employ. I 40 hope that employers in Parramatta take note of next time they are trying to fill a vacancy.",40
66,Mr YOUNG,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS," I want of to introduce a subject which is rarely raised in this House. In doing so I do not wish to denigrate in any way the serious subjects which have been this morning. No one in this country enjoys the wintertime more than I do in as much as I am a keen follower of both of the major football codes played in this country, rugby league and Australian rules. I have a friend at Coolangatta, John Cunningham, who had a saying: 'When the going gets tough, the tough get going'. I was reminded of that saying last Sunday night when I viewed a television replay of a football match between Western Suburbs and Manly-Warringah. It seemed to be more of a batdefield than a football field. It raised serious questions about the code as it is being played. respective of the arguments that take place as to which is the best code, football seems to be part of our national make-up. Having been born at Manly and having shifted to South Australia I can enjoy both codes equally. I do not take part in the arguments about the merits of the respective codes but I enjoy the wintertime in as much as I am a very keen follower of ManlyWarringah and a very keen follower of Port Adelaide. Both are magnificent football teams in their respective codes. Many of the mothers who watched the game between Manly-Warringah and Western Subenjoyed urbs must have shuddered at the thought that there was a chance that their sons would play sport. It seemed to denigrate the game of rugby league to an extent to which many people would not be interested in watching it any further or promoting the sport. It also raised the question the extent to which a referee can scrutinise game. Many of the offences were quite clear to those of us who observed the game on television and obviously to the rugby league authorities who watched it subsequently because they have taken action against certain players. This action sometimes cannot be taken during the game. To a large extent this problem has been overWestern come by the two-umpire rule in Australian rules whereby the game comes under closer scrutiny. The viciousness with which the game was played sport. last Sunday has been eradicated to a large extent from Australian rules. It will have to be eradicated from rugby league major sport in this country, which I hope it will do. It is a fine spectacle andfirstclass teams pete but no one in their wildest dreams could describe the match last Sunday as being a fine game of rugby. It seemed that a number of the people who were participating in that game were intent on seeing that their opposite numbers did not play again this season. I think that up to something Uke five people from that match have been suspended for a number of weeks. Action will have to be taken on the day of the match. This matter raises the question of whether codes might have to sink their differences- I now not only about rugby league and Australian rules authorities but also the soccer authorities-to see what can be done in a uniform manner to see that violence is taken off the field of footbaU. It is not in the interests of those people participating to spend all the summer months getting fit to take part in a sport when in their first game they can be put out for the rest of the season. It is rather ironic that a person who is put out by virtue of some action that is taken against Ir- him by another player can be injured for the rest of the season while the person who took the action perhaps is suspended for two matches. Any person who takes an action on a football field that puts another player out for the rest of the season should also be out for the rest of the season. In this way perhaps the football field can be cleaned up. Both sports have had some fine representatives. I recall having watched Manly-Warringah as a youth and seeing people the late Bert CoUins, Mackie Campbell, Roy Bull and Ken Arthurson who were great footballers and I watching the sport immensely. Today in watching the best footbaUers in Australian rules this one sees that they are subjected to enormous attention. I notice from the newspapers that Keith Greig of North Melbourne said that he will have to take greater care to protect himself. of He is a bloke who has won two medals, but obvithe ously when people go out to play against him they feel that some action has to be taken to reduce his effect and his influence on the game. The same can be said for many other players. I noticed that the half-back for Manly-Warringah last Sunday came in for some special treatment. He is five or six stone lighter than some of the players who were playing in the forwards for Suburbs. Action has to be taken. Obviously we would support the authorities taking action to see that violence is eradicated from the Mr Groom-They have been saying this for if it is to remain a 100 years.",41
67,Mr YOUNG,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS,"The Minister said that they comhave been saying this for 100 years. I do not know whether he came in for any special attention when he was playing-whethe r his brilliance warranted it. But I recognise the fact that he was a league player and knows a bit about the game. Most of the brilliant footballers of course are date able to take care of themselves merely through their brilUance in the sport. But some of them are subjected to very special attention which is not warranted and which is not part of the game. the One can only guess at the feeling between the talk two clubs involved and the crowd that watched the game last Sunday and what will be the attitude next time Manly and Wests play. Some people may go along to see whether the match will turn out to be the blood sport that they anticipate and some may go along in the expectation that the two teams, which are top teams in the Sydney code this year, are able to play the game in a manner that their expertise demands. As a keen follower I sincerely hope so.",42
68,Mr CHAPMAN,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS,"G o for Aussie rules, Mick.",43
69,Mr YOUNG,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS,"The honourable member for Kingston intervenes. I notice that his team has been relegated in the last couple of weeks, as has his reputation on motor cars. I raise this subject because it has been the subject of some discussion on our side of the House. We have a lot of members from the western suburbs of Sydney. I tfiink the right honourable member for Lowe (Sir William MCMahon) is the representative of the Western Suburbs area. I ask him to go to the Western Suburbs club and to see that the next game between Western Suburbs and Manly is played fairly so that those of us who have a litde enjoyment from the sport between parliamentary sittings can continue to enjoy these two codes.",43
70,Mr SPEAKER,COMPARISON OF THE PLANS,I am not sure what relevance that grievance has to ministerial responsibility but this was an occasion on which the Chair showed indulgence. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA NA Ministerial Statement,43
71,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ORGANISATION,"by leave-This statement concerns the Government's decisions on the recommendations of the report of the independent inquiry into the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation. In 1976 a comprehensive review was initiated to see whether government programs for the development and co-ordination of Australia's science and technology effort were as effective as they might be. One inquiry estabUshed at thattimeconcerned the role of a permanent Australian Science and Technology Council, and as a result of that review, I introduced Bill last month to establish ASTEC as a permanent and independent statutory authority. Honourable members will be aware that in 1976 in independent committee of inquiry was also established to review the objectives, structure and programs of the Commonweath Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. The members of the inquiry were: Professor Arthur Birch, Professor of Organic Chemistry at the Austrahan National University; Sir Cecil Looker, former President of the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges; and Mr Russell Madigan, OBE., Chairman of Hammersley Holdings Limited. The inquiry's report was presented on 25 August last year and was tabled on 6 October 1977. The inquiry's report included 122 recommendations. In considering these, the Government has been mindful of the important contribution which CSIRO has made to science and technology in Australia over the past fifty years. The Committee of Inquiry observed that 'the world reputation of CSIRO is a source of pride and morale to its scientists, and to Australia'. If any reminder were needed of the great contribution which CSIRO has made, it is sufficient to refer to the decision last month of the International Civil Aviation Organisation All Weather Operations Division to adopt internationally the INTERSCAN microwave aircraft landing system developed by CSIRO in collaboration with the Department of Transport. The structure of great CSIRO was last reviewed and reorganised in 1949. At that time CSIRO was employing 2,500 persons in 12 divisions. It now employs 7,000 persons in 37 divisions. In the light of the findings of the inquiry and other advice available to the Government, it has been decided that CSIRO should again be substantially reorganised. CSIRO will remain a single multi-disciplinary research entity responsible to the Minister for Science but much of the day to day management of CSIRO activities at present undertaken by the executive, will be devolved to directors of new functional groupings of divisions, to be called institutes. Under the new arrangements, the Executive will concentrate on policy issues including the determination of research strategy and priorities. The Executive will be assisted in this task through revitalised advisory and consultative arrangements which I will outline shortly. The executive of CSIRO will comprise a slightly smaller governing body than at present. There wtil be a chairman, who will also be chief executive, and two other full-time members together with between three and five part-time members. a The full-time members may or may not be drawn from within CSIRO. The part-time members wtil all be drawn from outside the organisation. The Government has agreed with the committee of inquiry that there be up to six institutes created from within CSIRO, each headed by a very senior scientist as director. Each director will be appointed by the executive for terms of up to five years, with provision for reappointment. Although the main role of the institute directors will be managerial, they will be actively consulted by the executive in matters of policy. The committee of inquiry favoured institute directors being appointed by the executive and holding office on the executive in an ex-officio capacity, thereby providing a direct link between the work points of the Organisation and the executive. The Government, however, after fully considering all aspects of this matter including advice received from ASTEC on the issue, has decided that institute directors should not be members of the executive but should have only an advisory role. For the information of honourable members. I table the advice dated 28 September 1977 which I received from ASTEC. The committee of inquiry recognised that much of the success of CSIRO in the past can be attributed to a policy of leaving scientific decisions in the hands of scientists. The Government agrees with the inquiry that this policy should remain unchanged, and accordingly, the basic research unit in CSIRO will continue to be the division headed by a chief of division. The inquiry drew attention in its report to the importance of consultative machinery which could help the executive to incorporate pohcy advice and the advice of users of research results in its deterresearch mination of strategy and program priorities for CSIRO. Accordingly, the advisory council will be strengthened to enable it to act effectively as the major source of advice to the executive. Its membership will be reorganised along the lines proposed by the inquiry and will include representatives from a wide range of interests. It will be completely independent of the executive of CSIRO, have its own secretariat and members of the CSIRO executive will not be members of the council. It is envisaged that the advisory council will set up ad hoc work groups to investigate particular areas related to CSIRO activities. Advisory council advise and initiatives will be incorporated in the CSIRO annual report. The Advisory Council will be linked with reconstituted State committees, which wtil be the main source of advice to the Advisory Council. The State committees will provide grass roots contact with industry, centres of education and the community generally. Each of them will maintain close contacts with CSIRO divisions in its own State. The chairman of the State committees will be members of the Advisory Council. The Government will also be looking to CSIRO to encourage its scientists to take initiatives in broadening their own contacts within and outside CSIRO so that their contribution in the formulation of pohcies at the institute level can be strengthened. I now turn to the research activities of CSIRO and its future role. The Government agrees with the inquiry that the main role of CSIRO should be defined more clearly in the Organisation's constituting legislation, the Science and Industry Research Act 1949. Amending legislation which will be introduced in the Budget sittings will make it clear that the main role for CSIRO will be scientific and technological research in support of Australian industry, community interests and other perceived national objectives and obhgations. CSIRO research for Austrahan industry will confine to include work in support of the rural and mining sectors, the manufacturing sector, the construction sector and the services sector, such as transport. CSIRO research will support such community interests as the better protection of our environment, flora and fauna, and consumer interests. The report of the inquiry made a number of other recommendations on the scope and emphasis of the Organisation's research effort which the Government has accepted. The main concern of CSIRO research will continue to be the physical and biological sciences. The types of to be undertaken will be longer term research for the community's benefit which industry and other research organisations are unable to carry out, and fundamental and short-term problem-oriented research if it is related to the role of the organisation. Research into economics and the other social sciences will not be undertaken, but steps are to be taken to utilise the requisite expertise from thesefieldsin program conduct, evaluation and planning. Research in human medicine will not be a direct objective of CSIRO, but research results in the biological and physical sciences will be assessed for their possible significance and application in human medicine. Individual scientists will be encouraged to follow up their research as far as practical into the developmental stage. CSIRO will have a major role in helping Austraha meet its international obhgations. For example, CSIRO will continue to undertake basic research, such as in astronomy, atmospheric physics and oceanography, to increase man's knowledge of the region in which we live. CSIRO will also assist the Government in meeting Australia's international obligations to developing countries. The Government is most conscious of the vital role that developing countries will increasingly play in world affairs and of our need constantly to review government policies to take this factor fully end, the Government recendy established a committee to review Austraha's relations with the Third World. Consistent with this policy approach, CSIRO will contribute to the scientific and technical needs of these countries as part of Australia's foreign aid program through work carried out both in Australia and abroad. CSIRO will also have the opportunity to contribute through other arrangements such as the Consultative Group on Energy estabUshed at the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting in Sydney. In aU its areas of research, CSIRO will have make sure that it does not dupUcate the research activities of other research institutions, undermittee taken or otherwise supported by the Commonwith'courtesy, wealth or State governments. CSIRO's autonomy in the setting of research project objectives wtil be maintained. RecognisOrganisation-Ministeria ing that CSIRO's activities must accord with policies of the Government, the Birch Report has recommended ministerial discretion should also be maintained, to be used as a last resort. Government has accepted this recommendation and should ministerial discretion will be reported in CSIRO's annual report. The Government has accepted the inquiry's recommendation that, through the application of the revised advisory and consultative machinery, current programs should be terminated where they are judged to be inappropriate. It has been agreed that CSIRO should present, at propriate intervals, the main thrusts of its broad poUcies and more detailed objectives for governsearch ment, parUamentary and community scrutiny. The inquiry recommended that specific approval of the Minister should not be required for CSIRO to enter into arrangements for the plementation of research results. The Governsearch ment has decided, however, that the implemensiderably tation of research results should continue to be function of CSIRO, subject to a general power of the Minister to provide the Executive with guideUnes. There are numerous further matters dealt in the report of the committee of inquiry. On many of these, the Government has reached a from decision. On others, further examination is required and is currendy being undertaken as peditiously as possible. It is the Government's inmakers. tention to implement, as soon as possible, the new organisation and Executive structure of CSIRO to facilitate the detailed implementation of the Government's decisions on the inquiry's into account. To this report. I conclude by placing on record the Government's appreciation of the work done by the members of the inquiry, Professor Birch, Sir Cecil Looker and Mr Russell Madigan. Their contribution to the development of Australian science and technology in this inquiry has been an outstanding one, made possible by their wide experience, foresight and judgment. The committee of inquiry could not, of course, have carried out its work without advice from Commonwealth and State Government departments, the many private companies and individuals who to made submissions to the inquiry, and of course members of CSIRO at all levels, who, the comnoted in its report, assisted the inquiry patience and frankness'. I present the following paper: Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research l Statement, 11 May 1978 the For the information of honourable members, I also table a copy of the statement that the Minister for Science (Senator Webster) is making in The the Senate on the independent inquiry into CSIRO, which will cover a number of matters in be employed it much more detail. Motion (by Mr Fife) proposed: That the House take note of the papers.",43
72,Dr KLUGMAN,ORGANISATION,"We on the Opposition side are pleased that the Prime also Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has now anapnounced his decisions on the reorganisation of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial ReOrganisation. We also note the statement that is to be made in the Senate by Senator Webster, the Minister for Science. The social and economic context in which the imCommonwealth Scientific and Industrial ReOrganisation now operates diners confrom that which prevailed in 1949, at a the time of the previous major review of the Organisation's activities and structure. Thirty years ago, it was widely believed-indee d almost universally believed-that there was an almost inevitable link between scientific research and with economic progress. Technological developments and inventions, it was thought, flowed directly research, especially research at the frontiers of knowledge. Technological innovation was not exregarded as a serious problem by science policy As a result of these attitudes, the pursuit of excellence in scientific research and the control by CSIRO itself of the implementation of its research results were understandable. CSIRO scientists have undoubtedly earned for the Organisation a well-deserved reputation for highquality research in a very wide range of fields. They have also been responsible for technological products of major importance. InterScan, as has been mentioned by the Prime Minister, has, of course, recently achieved international recognition. But there have been, in recent years, eral well-informed and constructive criticisms of the failure of the licencing and patenting procedures to return to Australia the benefits of search by our scientists. There have also been sponsible comments that inadequate economic evaluation of CSIRO research is undertaken. Naturally the scientific decisions must be left the hands of scientists, as the Birch Report and the Prime Minister's statement point out. But the Opposition is not completely satisfied that the Prime Minister's statement embodies a pohcy which would ensure that CSIRO research and development produces maximum benefit to the Austrahan people. We do support a changed emphasis on the thrust of CSIRO research. In 1949, rural research was that most demanded by the nature of the economy. Now, manufacturing and the tertiary sector require a greater emphasis of research effort. Although this fact is acknowledged by the report and the Prime Minister's statement, the committee of inquiry decided against making any substantial review of CSIRO programs, advising only that 'programs should be reviewed and, where judged to be inappropriate, terminated'. This is a disappointing generalisation. As well as the economic changes and improved economic understanding of the role of science which have taken place since CSIRO was last reviewed, social attitudes to science have matured. No longer is there a persuasive, naive trust that technological change is necessarily advantageous. A much healthier, critical attitude has developed, including an acknowledgement that community and environmental needs must be considered direcdy. They cannot simply be tacked on to the needs of industry. The Opposition would expect the Government to give serious attention to this matter in any review of CSIRO research priorities. Unfortunately, in this respect, too, the Birch Report is rather vague. In summary, the main thrust of the report and of the Prime Minister's statement is that, on the whole, no major changes should be made to manufacturing either the structure or the functions of CSIRO. These structural changes which are proposed are improvements. They will allow improved coordination of CSIRO activities",45
73,Mr SPEAKER,ORGANISATION,I must interrupt the honourable member for Prospect. The Chair will be resumed at 2.15 p.m.,46
74,Unknown,ORGANISATION,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,46
75,Dr KLUGMAN,ORGANISATION,"Before the suspension of the sevsitting we were discussing the reorganisation of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation following the publication re- sometimeago of the report on how to alter the re- CSIRO. I was saying that the structural changes which have been proposed are improvements in our view and will allow improved co-ordination in of CSIRO activities. The changes contain some provision for the involvement of people outside the CSIRO and the oversight of research programs. According to the statement of the Minister for Science (Senator Webster) in many areas the Birch inquiry has led to further discussion and reviews. We still await their outcome. These include discussions on how CSIRO scientists and academics could most usefully cooperate and contribute to the mutual benefit of teaching and research in Australian science. It may be that CSIRO scientists, active in research or at the end of their research careers, could stimulate students very effectively, and academics could benefit from a regular change in their research environment in the CSIRO. One of the difficulties that I foresee for science and for many other academic disciplines in Australia is that with academia no longer expanding it wtil be difficult for persons retiring from active research to obtain administrative jobs in academic or similar institutions. This will be difficult not only for those people but also for the people who hold positions for which they are no longer best qualified or suited. I hope that the academic and scientific community in such institutions as the CSIRO will be able to work out some method which will allow persons who have good quaUfications and who were active researchers still to contribute to the academic community and yet will not prevent young people getting into the main stream. It appears that over the next few years there will be very few new academic jobs opening up in universities and other tertiary institutions and it will be very difficult for bright young people to enter such institutions. How the CSIRO can best co-operate with industry is apparently still under discussion amongst various government departments. We would expect any liaison to be based on a critical understanding of the kind of research at present undertaken by industry within Australia. The level of research by industry here is well recognised to be low by intemauonal standards, certainly by the international standards of advanced countries. This is no doubt partly due to the domination by foreign companies in this country, but it is mainly due to the fact that our population base is too small to support such research. I do not mean by that that we do not have enough population to provide researchers, but we do not have enough population to buy sufficient of the goods produced by our manufacturing industries to enable local manufacturing industry to spend large amounts of money on research. I hope that the changes proposed to the CSIRO will improve the activities of that organisation. I have a feeling that bureaucracy both in government and in such institutions as the CSIRO and universities probably will absorb the changes, which will not be terribly great anyway. However, speaking in a more optimistic frame of mind, maybe the aims of the inquiry and of the Government will be achieved by the proposed changes. Debate (on motion by Mr Bourchier) adjourned.

76,Mr MORRIS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,I wish to make a personal explanation.,47
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?,47
78,Mr MORRIS,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Yes . In an interview broadcast on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program P.M. on Tuesday, 2 May-that is, last week-the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon), in response to a question about his failure to release the report of an interdepartmental committee which inquired into the provision of air services in the Northern Territory, said: And the reason I can't release an interdepartmental committee report is because it contains commercial information given to it by operators through the Territory. The Morris blandly uses and misuses commercial information given in these confidential papers, he makes it much difficult for me to table such a report. I state categorically that the Minister's statement is completely false. I have not had access to the commercial information in the confidential clear papers given to the inter-departmental comferring mittee or to the Minister by operators in the Northern Territory. I have not had access to the confidential papers to which he referred and, consequently, I was never in a position either to use or misuse the information they contain. I reject utterly his suggestion that I would misuse information in confidential papers. I regard his statement as defamatory and I am seeking legal advice on appropriate action. AUSTRALIA AND PAPUA NEW GUINEA: NA NA NA NA Ministerial Statement  Foreign Affairs)-by leave- I wish to inform honourable members that, in my discussions in Port Moresby last week with the Papua New Guinea Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Olewale, we agreed upon the principal basic elements which are to be included in the treaty to be concluded on maritime boundaries between our two countries and on other matters relating to the Torres Strait. In this statement. I propose to present a broad commentary on the course of the negotiations. I also intend to respond more fully to questions which have been raised concerning the status of certain islands in the Torres Strait. It is important that honourable members understand that because the Papua New Guinea Parliament is at present in recess, I have agreed with Mr Olewale that we shall each present to our respective parliaments in two weeks time a fuUer outline of the principal basic elements to be included in the treaty. It is also my intention that, at that time,illustrative maps will be made available to honourable members which will indicate more clearly than words can do the results of these important negotiations. Honourable members wtil know that Australia and Papua New Guinea have been engaged in these negotiations over a period of years, beginning before Papua New Guinea moved to independence in 1975. The negotiations have involved a requirement to delimit territorial seas, the seabed and fishing zones throughout the area between the two countries. This requirement way Mr arises because there are no existing international Unes of deUmitation on these matters. There more could be no such hnes until Papua New Guinea became independent. It is true that the so-called 1878-1879 Une has commonly been regarded as constituting a maritime boundary. However, it is from the very terms of the letters patent reto the line that it did not represent a sea or seabed boundary. The purpose of the line was only to indicate the islands that were annexed to Queensland. The negotiations have also involved the question of the status of certain islands in the Torres Strait and many intricate historical, cultural, social and economic factors of great nificance to the people of the area. The Australian and Papua New Guinea governments have approached the negotiations with great care and concern in order to arrive at a solution which is equitable in human terms and lasting and beneficial in its consequences. We have sought an agreement which will stand the test of time both legally and functionally. We have been determined to achieve a treaty settlement which would strengthen the fabric of the relationship between the two countries and their peoples, which we both regard as of high importance. We have looked for a treaty settlement which will have the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances on matters of day-today significance while at the sametimeretaining a durable certainty about the distribution and nature of therightsofthe parties concerned. It has been common ground that a treaty of this kind should be comprehensive and enshrine agreement as a total package definitive of juristerritorial diction throughout the area of shared interest. Thus, whilst there has been preoccupation with the Torres Strait as an area of special significance to both countries, the question of the delimicounsel tation of seabed and fishing rights the whole area running some 1,200 miles from the Arafura Sea to the Coral Sea has also been major importance. In the course of our negotiations, it became necessary to confirm and identify precisely those islands which were annexed to Queensland. I undertook last week to provide further material for honourable members on this particular matincluded ter. In a statement on 31 March 1978 I said that research had shown that the small uninhabited islands of Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussa, which lie very close to the Papua New Guinea mainname land but which have often been shown on maps as part of Queensland, were not among the Torres Strait islands annexed to Queensland the last century. I added that the Austrahan Government had accordingly informed the Government of Papua New Guinea that, in the within eventual treaty, Austraha would recognise them as part of Papua New Guinea. I dealt with a number of aspects of this matter in my answer to a question in this House on 3 May. As I stressed in that answer, it is necessary to go back to the original documents in order establish their intention. A paper dealing those documents, with relevant chart and map extracts attached, has now been placed in the Parliamentary Library for the information of honourable members. I invite the attention of sig- honourable members to that paper and wish to add only three points. Firstly, the paper shows among other things that, when the relevant letters patent were being prepared by the British authorities in 1878, a line was drawn on an admiralty chart to show the islands intended to be annexed. That is to say, a chart was specifically prepared by the British authorities to show the intent of the letters patent, and copies of that chart were duly circulated to the Governor of Queensland and others, together with copies of the letters patent. The chart shows a line that excludes the Kawa Islands and Kussa Island from the islands to be annexed to Queensland. Secondly, as the paper points out, the original intent has not been completely forgotten or overlooked. Maps have appeared, under very distinguished auspices, showing the Kawa Islands or Kussa Island as not being among those annexed to Queensland. In particular, the 1878 admiralty chart was referred to when the extent of Queensland was examined in the legal context of the seas and submerged lands litigation in 1975 in the High Court. The chart was specifically referred to by Queensland as showing how the 'boundary' was throughout defined in the letters patent. Thirdly, the correction of the widespread misof understanding about these islands has not meant the creation of a legal vacuum. The effect of the letters patent of 8 June 1888 constituting British New Guinea was that islands off the south and south-eastern shores of British New Guinea 'not forming part of the Colony of Queensland' were within British New Guinea. By virtue of the Papua Act 1905, British New Guinea was accepted by the Commonwealth as a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth by the of the Territory of Papua. After the Second World War that Territory was administered in union with the Territory of New Guinea and, as in the third schedule to the Papua New Guinea Act 1949, as amended up to thetimeof Papua New Guinea's independence, makes clear, islands the Torres Strait that were not part of the State of Queensland continued to be within the bounds of Papua New Guinea immediately prior to Papua New Guinea's independence. It will be clear from what I have said about the status of the Kawa and Kussa Islands that no to question arises about any transfer of Australian with territory to Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea sovereignty over those islands will be recognised in the treaty. Australian sovereignty over all Australian islands in the Torres Strait and their 3-mile territorial seas will be recognised in the treaty. The Torres Strait Islanders will, of course, remain Australian citizens. There will be a delimitation of the territorial seas between Boigu, Dauan and Saibai and Papua New Guinea. In addition, there will be lines delimiting seabed andfisheriesjurisdiction running through the whole area between the two countries. I also regard it as most important that, in addition to the clear jurisdictional lines which will be enshrined in the treaty, a protected zone will be established in the Torres Strait. This zone will protect the traditional practices and cultures of the peoples who inhabit the area. The treaty will provide that they will be able to move freely about the zone in pursuit of their traditional way of life and that this will remain undisturbed by the formal jurisdictional arrangements. I beheve that the approach taken by the two governments towards the treaty setdement-to resolve the many complex and sensitive issues by a process of steady and frank bilateral negotiation-has been the correct one. I regard the agreement now reached upon the principal basic elements to be included in the treaty to be an historic one. Whilst considerably more work has yet to be done on the development of detailed treaty articles, I am now confident that it will represent a mutually acceptable and equitable settlement which meets the genuine concerns and interests of the two countries. As I explained at the beginning of this statement, I have been able to give at this stage little more than the broadest account of the outcome of my recent negotiations with Mr Olewale. As I have agreed with him, we shall however each be presenting to our parhaments in two weeks'timea fuller outline of the agreed basic elements to be included in the treaty. I present the following paper: Australia and Papua New Guinea: Negodadons time Boundaries and on Other Matters Relating to Strait-Ministeria l Statement, 11 May 1978. Motion (by Mr MACKellar) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",47
79,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,STRAIT,"The Opposition welcomes the interim report of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Peacock) and notes that there will be a full debate on this matter in about a fortnight. It has been difficult for a very long period to get some clarification of the situation because the definition of the 'Territory' of Queensland apparently was defined in the letters patent as including the Talbot Islands and confusion has arisen as to what islands in fact bear or merit that description. Charts have now been published which indicate that perhaps the expression 'Talbot Islands' was used to apply to islands other than those which are immediately adjacent to the Papua New Guinea area. In other words, according to what has been said here, the expression could well be deemed to apply only to the islands of Boigu, Aubusi and Moimi. The Opposition also notes that the matter is the subject of treaty negotiations with our very friendly neighbour, Papua New Guinea. We hope the negotiation of the treaty will be concluded to the satisfaction of both countries. Today we are not able to comment fully on these matters. We look forward to the more extensive debate that will be able to take place when we debate the matter further. We welcome the fact that the study of the status of the islands of Kawa, Mata Kawa and Kussa has been made available for study. We have already expressed our concern in the Parliament and concern has been expressed in the Press about what the Government's position may be. On the basis of the study which has been made available it is evident that there could well have been confusionperhaps to some extent there is still some confusion or disagreement-as to what is the exact position of the boundary. The study is a welcome aid in clarifying the situation and I hope from a personal point of view that it will lead to a satisfactory resolution of the matter. From a constitutional point of view and assuming that the Government's views about the historical position are proved to be correct in the legal sense, I make the following comments: The treaty to be agreed to by the governments of Papua New Guinea and Australia does not involve any transfer of land territory and does not involve the transfer of any territory from Queensland. In the Seas and Submerged Lands Act case there was clear difference of opinion beon Mari- tween the members of the High Court of Torres Austraha as to whether the territorial sea fell within the territorial limits of Australia. Only two of the seven judges on the case- Mr Justice Gibbs and Mr Justice Stephen-hel d the view that the territorial sea was within State jurisdiction, but their view was not the majority view. Five other judges formed the majority view. Three of them, Sir Garfield Barwick, Mr Justice Jacobs and Mr Justice Mason, clearly took the view that the territorial sea did not form part of the land territory of Australia but that we had the territorial jurisdiction to legislate in respect of the territorial sea, being within our external affairs power. The two other members of the High Court, Mr Justice MCTiernan and Mr Justice Murphy, took the view that the territorial sea was attached to Australia. An important point to note is contained in a report which has been tabled, concerning the boundaries between Austraha and Papua New Guinea and in which my colleague the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) has expressed a view with which I find myself in complete agreement. The report states: The territorial waters adjacent to a State do not of the State. That is the clear position. I place on record my indebtedness to my colleague for his excellent report and knowledge. Let us note also that the letters patent of 1878 are Umited to the islands in the Strait. In other words, the islands in the Strait are part of Queensland. They make no claim to the waters surrounding the islands. The letters patent state that certain islands should be annexed to and form part of Queensland; they do not cover any waters. Therefore, the view that I now express is that these islands should remain part of Queensland with a territorial sea but that that territorial sea should be under Austrahan jurisdiction, to which the Seas and Submerged Lands Act wtil apply once the low water mark is reached. So we make our position clear on that. Therefore, no question will arise as regards section 123 of the Constitution. Under that section, the limits of a State may be altered only with the consent of both the Parhament of and the electors in that State. The executive power of the Commonwealth, as contained in section 61 of the Constitution, together with the external affairs power give the Government complete power to negotiate a treaty of the type outlined by the Foreign Minister. I want to make that quite clear. I think we also need to make the constitutional position quite clear because it could well be that the Government of Queensland, as is its wont, would want to have a good deal to say on many matters. I want to make it perfectly clear that this is a matter for negotiation between the Australian and Papua New Guinean governments. We do not want to see any weak-kneed approach to the position as to what are aUeged to be Queensland's rights because we are concerned about what has happened already in Queensland in two areas-Aborigine s and human rights. We support the concept of a negotiated settlement between Papua New Guinea and Austraha, although we reserve our final judgment until we see the treaty. We place the Government on notice that we are not prepared to see the Queensland Government start to dictate terms in this matter. Debate (on motion by Mr Bourchier) adjourned. NA Ministerial Statement",49
80,Mr ELLICOTT,POLICY ON NORFOLK ISLAND,"by leave-EarUer this week I visited Norfolk Island to announce to the Norfolk Island Council and the residents of the form part Island, the Government's decisions on its policies for the Island. Whilst there I read to them a statement containing those decisions. So that honourable members may be kept informed of the Government's decisions on these important matters, I table that statement. Rather than read out the statement, Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsNA Statement by the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon. R. J. Ellicott, Q.G, M.P. My purpose in coming to Norfolk Island and meeting with you today is to announce the decisions that the Government has taken on its policies for Norfolk Island, to discuss those decisions with you and to begin a process of consultation on a number of matters arising from them. It has been made clear on many occasions that the views expressed by Members of the Council andresidentsof Norfolk Island would be presented to the Government for consideration. You may be assured that this has been done and that the Government has taken full account of those views in making its decisions. The Government has also agreed that further consultations are necessary before a number of important aspects can be brought to finality and, in particular, before the necessary legislation is drafted. I have therefore returned to Norfolk Island both to honour my previous undertaking to do so and also to take up with you a range of matters on which firm decisions will need to be made at a later date. May I say at the outset that the Government recognises the special situation of Norfolk Island, including the special relationship of the Pitcairn descendants with the Island, its traditions and culture. It is prepared, over a period, to move towards a substantial measure of self government for the Island. It is also of the view that, although Norfolk Island is pan of Australia and will remain so, this does not require Norfolk Island to beregulatedby the same laws as regulate other parts of Australia. One of the mainrecommendationsof the Repon of Sir John Nimmo on Norfolk Island was that, except in special cases, all laws which applied to other pans of Australia generally should also apply to Norfolk Island. Having considered all relevant matters the Government has decided not to accept this recommendation but to allow the present situation to continue under which laws of the Australian Parliament only apply to this Island if special provision is made in the particular law. A matter of considerable concern to the Government has been whether it should now extend Australian taxation and Australian social service benefits to the Island. The Government has decided not to do so. This issue has created much debate and there have been strong arguments put for and against. It has not been an easy matter to decide. The Government believes, however, that the wise course is to see whether there can be developed for the Island an appropriate form of government involving its elected representatives under which the revenue necessary to sustain that government will be raised internally under its own system of law. One matter which 1 discussed with the Council on my last visit was whether social service benefits should be available to citizens as of right or by grace and favour. The Government believes that social service benefits appropriate to the conditions of the Island should be provided as of right. My understanding is that the Council does not disagree with this. The Government does not, however, believe that thf services provided should necessarily be the same or at the same level as those available on the mainland. For instance, they need not include unemployment benefits. The Government believes that in order to make decisions about such matters as the Island's revenue potential and the nature and level of social welfare benefits it is necessaiy to have much more information than is presendy available on the economic strengths, weaknesses and potential of the Norfolk Island economy. It therefore proposes that there be set in train at an early date an economic feasibility purpose of this study will be to assess the capacity of the Island's economy including, but not limited to, the amount of income derived by residents of the Island (including compames), the likely effect of various levels of income tax on the economy, the cost of living, appropriate levels for social service benefits and the likely effect of other forms of tax (e.g. stamp duty). The Government would hope that such a study could be completed within six months. I would like to discuss with the Council while I am here the procedures under which this study might be implemented to ensure its effectiveness. When the results of this study are known, appropriate social service benefits and their levels could be determined in consultation with the Norfolk Island Council in the light of that study. Another matter that could be determined in consultation with the Council in the light of that study is the actual source of any additionalrevenueneeded to meet the cost of the new constitutional and administrative arrangements which the Government proposes including, of course, the cost of introducing a scheme for social service benefits. The Government's view, as Thave indicated, is that any such additional expenditure should, if practicable, be met from sources on Norfolk Island. The Commonwealth Government would, however, meet the cost of maintaining the Administrator and his staff. I now come to constitutional questions and, in particular, to the nature of the constitutional arrangements which the Government proposes for the Island. The Government has decided, asrecommendedby the Nimmo Repon, that the present Norfolk Island Council will be abolished. Instead, it proposes that there be an incorporated body to be known as the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly, with power to pass laws for the peace, order and good government of Norfolk Island. The Government accepts the following furtherrecommendationsof Sir John Nimmo relating to the Assembly: (a) that the Assembly consist of nine elected members holding office for three years; (b) that a President and Deputy President be elected by the Assembly from among its members; (c) that each Assembly member exercise a deliberative vote and that the President or Deputy President exercise a casting vote when necessaiy; (d) that a quorum for a meeting of the Assembly be five members. The Government has in mind that the Assembly should be in operation no later than 1 July 1979. The Government has also carefully considered the specific powers over which the Legislative Assembly should in the first instance have complete legislative power and executive control. It agrees, in substance, with the list of powers recommended by Sir John Nimmo, with the addition of education. The Government proposes that the Assembly have complete legislative power and executive control over these matters, subject to a right of veto by the Administrator in respect of education, immigration, customs services and fishing, in view of their particular sensitivity and national imponance. The full list of powers to be granted at the outset would therefore be as in the attachment to this statement. The Assembly would have major financial powers. It would take over those operations at present yielding revenue to the Administration other than in areas where the Commonwealth retainsresponsibility, and it would have power to borrow subject to the approval of the Treasurer. In addition to its other powers, it would also have a broad advisoiy capacity. It would have the capacity to advise the Administrator on any matterrelatingto Norfolk Island over which study. The the Commonwealth Government has power. As recommended by Sir John Nimmo, continuing liaison would be maintained between the Administrator and the Legislative Assembly. I would emphasise that the Government believes that if the measures I have outlined are taken they will be a major step towards a form of self government for the Island. Consideration will be given to increasing the areas of the Assembly's legislative power and executive responsibilities no later thanfiveyears after its incorporation. I now come to certain other specific matters that have an imponance of their own. The question of the possible representation of Norfolk Island in the Commonwealth Parliament has proved to be a very difficult one. The Government believes that no decision be taken on this matter until after consultations have been held with the Legislative Assembly. Concern has also been expressed regarding the likely effect on the tourist industry of possible imposition of Australian sales tax on Australian manufactures destined for Norfolk Island. It has been decided that, as recommended by Sir John Nimmo, such manufactures shall continue to be exempt from sales tax. It has also been decided that Commonwealth legislation with regard to workers' compensation should not be extended to Norfolk Island, provided that an all-embracing accident insurance scheme satisfactory to the Government and the Norfolk Island Council or Legislative Assembly is implemented. As regards zoning and land development, the Government is of the view that steps should be taken within twelve month tofinaliseand adopt by Ordinance a suitable plan for the Island, with consideration being given to the declaration of an appropriate area around Mt Pitt as a National Park and to the declaration of appropriate areas on Norfolk and Phillip Islands as part of the National Estate. These steps would be taken in full consultation with the Norfolk Island Council or Legislative Assembly. The Government is aware of the need for adequate communications with Norfolk Island and, in particular, the problem of the maintenance and upgrading of services at the Norfolk Island airpon. These matters are within the Ministerial responsibilities of my colleague, the Minister for Transpon, and he has advised that he expects to bring forwardrecommendationsbefore the end of this year. It will be obvious that the precise constitutional provisions to give effect to the Government's proposals will need careful consideration. The Government has authorised me to discuss these provisions and the other matters I have mentioned such as financial arrangements with the Norfolk Island Council and I am to report back to Cabinet before any instrucuons are given for final outset, part of the reason for my visit is to begin this process of consultation. There are, of course, many recommendations in the Nimmo Report. In this statement. I have dealt with those which are basic. Those which I have not mentioned will be the subject of discussion, decision and announcement at a later time. The Government has also considered the proposals that have been made for a referendum. It has already received a wide expression of views from the Council and the community. In reaching its decisions it has taken those views fully into account In all the circumstances and having regard to the decisions it has made, the Government has decided that a referendum should not be held. The Government's decisions have been made after a careful balancing of the many factors and varying points of view involved. Its objective has been to provide for the development of a responsible form of self government for Norfolk Island. A number of decisions have been taken, but within them there remains scope for further consultation and collaboration with the Norfolk Island community and its elected representatives. I would hope to see that consultation and collaboration commence immediately. NA In the first instance, legislative and executive powers to be granted to the Assembly in respect of the following matters: roads, footpaths and bridges; drainage; sewerage and sanitation; disposal of garbage and trade waste; recreation areas; pasturage on commons; livestock; pounds; pests and noxious weeds; cemeteries; guest houses; electricity supply; water supply; lighterage; tainment; promotion of tourism; omnibuses and taxis; sale and distribution of foodstuffs and beverages; repair or demolition of dangerous buildings; new buildings and the alteration of buildings; advertised hoardings; fires and prevention of fires; road traffic; street lighting; and suppression of nuisances; trading hours; street stalls; raising revenue for the Assembly's budget; coastlines, foreshores, wharves and jetties; 'fishing; slaughtering of stock; domestic animals and birds; storage of petroleum products; firearms; museums, memorials and libraries; motor vehicles androadtraffic; forestry andrelatedactivities; radio and television; noxious trades; markets and weighbridges; carters and hawkers; quarrying; maintenance of rolls; telephone services; postal services; 'education; 'customs services; philatelic activities; 'immigration, with a right of appeal to the Minister by any person aggrieved; registrations (births, deaths, marriages, companies motor vehicles, dogs, etc.) which are at present handled by the Administration; internal audit; the undertaking of business activities and contracts with respect to any of the matters specified above. 'Subject to veto by the Administrator. The Assembly would also have power to borrow subject to the approval of the Treasurer. Consideration to be given to increasing the areas Assembly's powers no later than five years after its incorporation.",50
81,Mr ELLICOTT,POWERS OF LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY,"I have nothing to add at this stage except to say that the policies announced received very wide support on the Island and that I had very useful discussions with the Coundrafting. As I indicated at the cil following the reading of the statement to the Council and to the Island over the local radio. In those discussions I began the process of consultations which was promised in the statement. I present the following paper: Norfolk Island-Governmen t Policy-Ministeria l Statement, 11 May 1978. Motion (by Mr MACKellar) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",52
82,Mr INNES,POWERS OF LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY,"We readily agree that the document tabled by the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott) outlining the Government's pohcy on Norfolk Island, ought to be tabled for the information of honourable members. Whilst acknowledging some aspects of the move to partial self-government for the Island, the Opposition is highly critical of the delay in implementing the recommendations of the Royal Commission which was headed by Mr Justice Nimmo. Its report was presented to the Governor General, Sir John Kerr, on 15 October ATTACHMENT 1976. So there has been a delay of some 17 months during which time a lot of lobbying has been going on by influential people from the Island for a certain course to be taken. Also during that time the wealthy tax dodgers and exploiters and some of the parasites have continued to enjoy a bonanza at the expense of the Austrahan taxpayers and the indigenous people places of public enteron the Island. On page 8 of the statement by the Minister, it is indicated that the basic principles contained in prevention the Nimmo report have been implemented. Not only is this misleading, but it is also quite untrue. The report, if objectively read, clearly sets out principles which, if apphed to the situation on the Island, would go a long way towards setting people on the road to proper self-determination as part of Australia, sharing the responsibilities and also reaping the benefits of being part of our great country. This would eUminate the exploitation and the tax-dodging by these so-called paper companies, companies which simply carry out paper transactions for the purpose of tax evasion. They are saving mUlions of dollars a year by that process. Page 232 of the report contains a table setting out company accounts and money volume of money transactions for Norfolk Island. On page 233 of the report, estimates of of the tax lost to Australia are clearly spelt out. I might add that we see in the Commonwealth Trading Bank accounts for Norfolk Island, some $15,581,400 was transacted in 1975, while in the Bank of New South Wales accounts, the amount was $65,559,000. So we can see the method of evasion that was carried out by a number of compames on the Island. Mr Haslem-Tell us how they are doing it.",52
83,Mr INNES,POWERS OF LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY,"I wdl tell the honourable member how they are doing it. An individual called Elton Douglas Foote set up a triangular arrangement between a company registered on Norfolk Island, a company in Hong Kong which manufactured a detergent called Swipe and a buffer company between them and the outiet in Japan. By that arrangement they avoided taxation in three countries. All they did was transfer the money from the company in Hong Kong to Norfolk Island. The honourable member for Canberra has been to Norfolk Island big-noting himself. He wants a slice of the action. He wants to represent the place. Of course there are many other aspects of such cases and tax dodges about which my friend, the honourable member for Canberra would be well aware. The statement talks about a feasibility study. That must be some sort of a joke. On pages 3 and 4 of the statement there is talk of the procedures for the feasibility study and the guidelines that would be discussed with the Council itself. Unless we have a royal commission into the activities of these companies to which I have referred, where will the Government get the authority to investigate such activities? Surely if the Govern- taken ment is going to take any action-surel y it is the Government's obligation to take that actionthen clearly it has to understand what the situation is all about. After all, the Nimmo inquiry carried out such an investigation. It carried out feasibility study. An examination of the report provides plenty of material for the Government to act on but it has not done so. The report of John Nimmo was an excellent one. It is to the credit of the learned judge. He applied himself and carried out the investigation that produced such a fine result. The principle contained in the report that has not been implemented by virtue of the statement is that the plight of people of Pitcairn Island-les s than half the population, those who are genuine Pitcairners-thos e on the lower spoke of fortune's wheel has been completely ignored. The Government's policy outlined in the statement comes down heavily on the side of the exploiters, one of whom I have pointed out here this afternoon. There were some 74 recommendations in the report. The Government has sacrificed the value of those recommendations at the altar of the money people manipulating the situation at the moment. The companies registered are contained on pages 231 and 253. Those companies have risen in number since 1975, when the inquiry took place and when there was a drop in the number of those companies involved, to somewhere in the vicinity of 981. A reference to the report will clarify the number. From that point onwards there has been a gradual increase back to about the 1974 level. This may well have been encouraged by the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Elhcott) who is at the table. I hasten to say that I am not criticising him for acting in his professional capacity. It must have given great heart to the people who are the moneyed interests on Norfolk Island. He and another Queen's Counsel prepared an opinion, which was reported in the Canberra Times in a book review by Frank Cranston under the heading Action Seems Close on This Political Hot Potato. The review goes on to say that the Council on the Island thinks that it is a very astute legal opinion. The article then states: Prepared by two eminent Sydney Queen's Counsel in August, 197S, the advice gave significant encouragement to islanders who believed they were threatened by the intentions of the then-Labor Government toward their tiny Pacific paradise. ' . . . although the Commonwealth Parliament has legal power under Section 122 of the Constitution to impose taxes or other imposts on the people of Norfolk Island for whatever purpose it thinks fit, to do so could well be in breach of a well-entrenched constitutional convention. 'This in our view is a further very significant matter to be into account in relation to the future constitutional relationship between Australia and Norfolk Island', the learned counsel said. The point I am making is that that concept is enshrined in the statement. What are we doing? a What actions are we going to take to prevent the sorts of tilings to which I have made reference? What has the Taxation Department done over Sir that period since Barwick announced the situation? It has done absolutely nothing. It has not stopped at that point. Taxation evasion in respect of stamp duty and death duties must be costing the Commonwealth Government and the States hundreds of millions of dollars a year. As I indicated, the Government has done nothing. By the look of it, it does not appear that it will be doing anything at all. I acknowledge the fact that in part of the statement there is reference to some measure of self government. However, I repeat that the basic principles of the Nimmo report have been completely ignored. Is there a stated intention of doing anything else about it? If there is not, the Minister might tell us what the Government is prepared to do about it. He might inform the House why up to thistimethe Taxation Department has not moved. As I said, the statement is heavily biased on the side of the wealthy and those vested interests on the Island. It allows the continued exploitation of those people who are properly the descendants of the Pitcairn Islanders. They have been exploited in more ways than one. They have been kidded into selling their property for a song. Now that the landholdings have been subdivided they are that expensive that the people in that situation cannot buy them at all. So it goes on. At this point for the purpose of providing information I seek the incorporation in Hansard of answers given by Senator Withers to questions in another place. I have spoken to the Minister on this matter. Leave granted. The documents read asfollowsNA Senator DEV1TT-I direct to the Minister for Administrative Services a question on the subject of Norfolk Island. What consideration has the Government given to the question of the status of Norfolk Island vis-a-vis the Australian Constitution? What steps have been taken to seek the views of the people of Norfolk Island as to their future, having regard to Australia's obligations and responsibilities to its ritories and also having regard to the historical uniqueness of the Norfolk Island community? What is the proportion of Pitcairners to the total population? In anyreferendumwhich might be held to determine the wishes of the Norfolk Islanders in regard to their future, what can be done to ensure that the views so expressed are those of the real Islanders-that is, the descendants of the association of the Bounty mutineers and the Pitcairners-and not those of the more recent residents, many of whom obviously went there for purposes of tax avoidance and in fact make no secret of it? Can the Minister state a figure representing the loss of revenue to Australia as a consequence of the tax haven used by entrepreneurs following the plugging of this tax dodge opportunity in Australia? What is the general level of Australia's assistance to Norfolk Island? Is it possible, even at this late hour, to have an assurance that this historically important and quite unique and beautiful island can be preserved for long term residents, namely, people with ties of consanguinity with the Pitcairners? Finally, in the event of a referendum being held, is it not possible-in fact highly probable-that the result would reflect the views of the more recent residents rather than those of the real Norfolk Islanders for whose welfare we are principally responsible?",53
84,Senator WITHERS,NORFOLK ISLAND,"Senator Devitt was kind enough to alert me to the fact that he was going to ask a question along these lines. Perhaps I can answer the questions seriatim. Government announced on 17 December 1976 that it inenue. tends to continue to accept responsibility for maintaining Norfolk Island as a viable community and that its constitutionalrelationshipwith Australia would remain that Territory of the Commonwealth of Australia. As to the secGovernment ond question, under the terms of reference, the royal comBerwick's mission was asked to take into consideration amongst other things, the interests of Norfolk Island residents and the historicrightsof the Pitcairn settlers. The royal commission sented every opportunity, both formal and informal, for resias dents to present their views. As to the third question, my ollection is that the royal commission report stated that of about 860 electors some 320 are of Pitcairn lineage. The actual figures, as at 30 June 1976, were 859 electors, 323 being of Pitcairn descent. As to the fourth question, under the laws which provide for the conduct of a referendum Norfolk Island every elector is entitled to vote and voting is by secret ballot Therefore it would not be possible to identify the views of any particular individuals or groups in a referendum. However I should mention that I have received a petition, signed by 188 residents of whom 86 are of Pitcairn descent, asking that the Government accept in principle the recommendations of the royal commission. As to the fifth question relating to tax avoidance and evasion, this is a detailed question that relates directly to the responsibility of the Treasurer and I shall seek information from him. As to the sixth question, evidence given to the royal commission was to the effect that the total direct and indirect assistance given to Norfolk Island by the Commonwealth during the financial year ended 30 June 1975 was in excess of $2m. As the honourable senator would appreciate, the amount varies from year to year. As to the seventh question, I have given an undertaking that before making any submission to the Government I shall visit Norfolk Island and personallyreviewthe situation there and the local factors on which the Government will require to be informed. In response to arequestI made in November, following the tabling of the report, I havereceivedthe views of the Norfolk Island Council on the recommendations in the report and these are being considered. The matter is one which affects Australia as a whole and therefore the interests of residents both of mainland Australia and of Norfolk Island have to be given proper consideration. As to the last question, many people in fact have Ter- speculated to the same effect. I might just add that I first visited Norfolk Island with the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances when Senator Wood was its Chairman. He led the delegation and Senator Devitt and Senator Cavanagh were also in that delegation. Since I first visited Norfolk Island I have been most attracted to it. The matters to which the honourable senator adverted in his seventh quesdon about this historically important and unique and beautiful island I shall always have very much in my mind. NA",54
85,Senator DEVITT,NORFOLK ISLAND,"I direct a question to the Minister for Administrative Services. As the Minister, accompanied- I understand-by the Attorney-General, Mr Ellicott, recently paid a visit to Norfolk Island, can he now say what decisions have been made in regard to the constitutional position of the island and its future administration? Will any decisions as to the future of Norfolk Island take strongly into account the interests and life style of the true Norfolk Islanders? Can the Minister say what significance, if any, can be attached to the fact that in this year's Budget the vote for Norfolk Island has beenreducedby $88,000?",54
86,Senator WITHERS,NORFOLK ISLAND,"As the honourable senator would know, most of the revenues on Norfolk Island are raised locally. There has been quite a significant increase in The companyregistrationfees which will add greatly to the revHonourable senators can imagine with what glee that was greeted by some on Norfolk Island. I refer now to the first part of the question concerning the constitutional posof a ition of Norfolk Island. As far as the Commonwealth is concerned that was quite clearly decided in case. The High Court said that Norfolk Island is an Australian territory over which this Parliament has plenary powers. All the nonsense talked by some pseudo-lawyers preand some other sorts of interesting people on Norfolk Island to its independence and specialrelationshipjust will not rechold water. The High Court would not entertain any sort of argument that the island is other than an Australian territory over which this Parliament has total legislative capacity. I inform the Senate that in spite of a campaign which is being waged over on Norfolk Island against the Nimmo Royal on Commission report which was commissioned by our predecessors, the Government has not yet come to a final decision on the repon. I hope that before the year is out I will be able to announce a series of Governmem decisions on the report. There are some matters of quite great impon concerning Norfolk Island. As honourable senators will have noticed, a campaign occasionally has been waged in the Canberra Times, which for some reason is the only newspaper that seems to give much credit to it, by certain people on Norfolk Island who, I believe for their own selfish, personal and financial interests, are totally of certain sections of the Nimmo report. Senator Georges-Quite vicious.",54
87,Senator WITHERS,NORFOLK ISLAND,"As the honourable senator says 'quite vicious'. The last attack before a Senate committee alleging that the Administrator had committed certain unlawful acts. In spite of the fact that I have invited the person involved to go to the Commonwealth Police or the Crown Law officers he has not yet taken up the offer. That action, if Norfolk Island councillor as the worse example of gutter politics he had seen exercised by a Norfolk Islander. That shows the tactics that some people on Norfolk Island are attempting to use to protect their ownfinancialinterests and even more tragically in some way to persuade the Commonwealth Government not to grant security area to Australian people who live on Norfolk Island. I know that Senator Devitt has a deep and continuing interest in Norfolk Island. I assure him that I hope before year is out the Government will be able to announce a positive decision over a whole range of these matters.",55
88,Senator DEVITT,NORFOLK ISLAND,I wish to ask a supplementary question to clear up a point in which Minister did not respond to the section of my question in which I asked whether special consideration would be given to the interests of the people who are really Norfolk Islanders.,55
89,Senator WITHERS,NORFOLK ISLAND,"I take it the honourable senator is referring to the people of Pitcairn descent. Yes, one of the fundamental aims of any Government policy in this area will be to see that those who are truly part of Norfolk Island and have not gone there for other purposes will be properly looked after. The two answers outline the shape of the population. This information bears witness to my claim that the people on the Island who can truly call themselves descendants of the Pitcairn Islanders represent about one-third of the populadon. On that basis, the Opposidon suggests that a referendum to lead up to what might be determined in future as a self-government situadon would be farcical. Those people who are in the majority, some 200 Australians, and the other people who are blow-ins for the reasons that I have outlined, will be the people who would swamp those who really need our assistance and who ought to be the object of our attendon. One part of the statement refers to the question of taxation, social services and welfare. One little pearl contained in the statement refers to the fact that social services should be available to citizens as of right, or by grace and favour-that was the question. They say that the Council comes down on the side of social welfare. It is worth exarrtining just what the taxation situation means. Surely, there is evidence to show that there are people on that Island who would be better off if a taxation system apphed because there would not be tax evaders. It seems ironical that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has announced legislation-prope r legislation-to prevent tax evasion. So, it ought to be apphed to Norfolk opposed to the implementauon Island. I wonder why it has not been done in the past. Perhaps the Treasurer could answer that. Mr Ellicott-Why didn't you do it? was launched under privilege",55
90,Mr INNES,NORFOLK ISLAND,"It is the old, old story: Why didn't you do it? The Nimmo report has been out for 17 months but not one action has been taken. You have just sidestepped the issue and followed I may say so, was described by a the pattern of your own opinion. That is what you did. Mr Haslem-Rea d the Nimmo report.",55
91,Mr INNES,NORFOLK ISLAND,"I have read the Nimmo report. It certain benefits in the social is about time that you read it. Not only should you read it, but the 74 recommendations and the the principles spelt out in them would achieve all the aims to which I have made reference. We are a party to international covenants on social welfare and the like. The Nimmo report spells it out I am particularly interested. The chapter and verse. What have we done about that? The pensioners on the Island, by grace and favour, for God's sake, were getting before the Nimmo inquiry $10 a week to live on or to exist on. Later, it became $20. The point I am making is that a whole range of recommendations have been completely and utterly ignored. What do we see in the statement? Lip service is paid by the Minister to the recommendations and the principles clearly spelt out in the report. We call on the Government not just simply to talk in terms of a so-called self-determination, which means very, very little in many respects. It ought to concentrate clearly on the other issues, prevent this tax evasion and do the job for which it has been elected.",55

101,Mr FRY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Terrispections tory, I present the Committee's report on posals for variations of the plan of the layout the City of Canberra and its environs-65t series. A Umited number of copies of the report available from the Tables Office and copies have been placed in the ParUamentary Library. ditional copies wtil be available for general disaffected tribution in the very near future. Ordered that paper be printed.",56
102,Mr FRY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.,56
103,Mr FRY,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"The report I have tabled is the first report to the present Parliament by the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territoiy. It concerns proposals to vary the Canberra City Plan. This is the 65th series of such variations made to the plan since its adoption in 1925. The Committee report provides honourable members with information about the proposal contained in the instrument of variation of Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for the affected. Capital Territory (Mr EUicott). These inquiries on the variations are becoming increasingly important to the Australian Capital Territory comgate munity. As the city and its population grow planning and development proposals of the National Capital Development Commission and the Department of the Capital Territory tend affect existing communities more direcdy than they have in the past when most development re-establish lated to rural areas and did not affect established communities. The Committee sees it as essential therefore that it consult the community and obtain views on proposals put forward by the authorities. Minister has co-operated in this regard and in case of the 65th series extended the period within which objections might be lodged from 14 to 21 days. The extended period meant that the Lands, Planning and Environment Committee of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assemrecreational bly hadtimeto complete its own examination of the proposals and to report to the Assembly. The Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory thus had the advantage of an Assembly view discourwhen considering the 65th series. The Committee has also modified its own procedures to ensure greater publicity for the proposals contained in the series. It now conducts pubUc hearings when officers from the Department of the Capital Territory and the National Capital Development Commission and those who have lodged objections appear to make submissions to the Committee in an open forum. Inof the sites where controversial develproopments are proposed were also undertaken by of the Committee. The Committee will continue to h seek to involve the community further in its is examination of such proposals. But the Committee is equaUy concerned that the authorities Adshould consult individuals and communities by their proposals. In the current series, for instance, the Committee has recommended that two items be deferred until certain aspects have been taken up with the communities involved. The first of these involves the proposed group centre in the Belconnen suburb of Kaleen. The Committee considers that when retail centres are being planned after local communities have become established there should be consultation and Uaison with the communities from the eartiest stages of planning. The newly formed residents' association in Kaleen raised a number of pertinent objections to the proposal for the group centre as presented in the series. We have recommended that implementation of the proposal be deferred pending further consulthe tations with this group and others who are A proposal that would have enabled boom parking to be installed in the city centre near the Marcus Clarke Street and Childers Street has also been recommended for deferral by the Committee. The National Capital Development to Commission submitted that implementation of the proposal would have meant that it could boom gate parking in the area when the need arises. The Committee considers that this proposal should be deferred until the need has in fact been more clearly established. We have also sought from the National CapiThe tal Development Commission a full report on the future development proposals for the recreation area associated with Ginninderra Creek. This is one of the most important recreation areas on the north side of Canberra and the Committee is concerned about its preservation as an area for use and that it should not be affected adversely by further residential development. It has therefore sought from the Commission a full report on developments proposed for the area. This arose in connection with proposals for new housing in Latham which have caused concern to local groups because of encroachment on the existing recreational area. The Committee has agreed to the variations proposed but has expressed the view that no development in relation to these and related areas should proceed until a detailed plan of the whole area has been published. The work done by this Committee attimesresults in difficulties with groups of residents who object to proposals which the Committee considers, in the wider interest, should be implemented. We have endorsed two proposals in the current series in the face of strong tions from local residents. One relates to the proposed access road to the Kambah Pool and the other to a proposed development for 35 detached housing blocks in section 266, Kambah. Our reasons for upholding the proposed variations are explained in the report. But in each case we have sought to ensure that there is continuing consultation between residents and relevant authorities so that people affected by the proposed variations can be assured their views will be heard on important issues as development proceeds. Other major items which are dealt with in the current series include proposals for the establishment of a new residential area in Isaacs and substantial residential developments in Holt and Florey. Major roadworks include the retowards construction, realignment and upgrading of Fairbairn Avenue and the realignment of and Majura Road and of the Paddys River Road to the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve. I commend the report to the House. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Howard, and read a first time. Second Reading",56
104,Mr HOWARD,PRIMARY INDUSTRY BANK," I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Austhe traUan Rural Bank Act 1977. That Act, received the royal assent on 10 November last year, provides the legislative framework for the estabUshment and operation of a rural bank. The Bill amends the legislation in two respects. (Quorum formed). Ihe first is to change the name of the new institution from 'Austrahan the Rural Bank' to 'Primary Industry Bank of Australia'. This is the effect of clauses 3 through 7 and 9 and 10 of the Bill. The Government has decided to propose a change in the name in the Ught of the view of the New South Wales Government authorities that the name at present provided for could be confused with or mistaken for that of the Rural Bank of New South Wales which has become widely known throughout that state simply as the 'Rural Bank'. A somewhat similar position appUes with respect to the Rural and Industries Bank of Western Australia. The second change is effected by clause 8 of the Bill, which amends section 7 of the Act. That section at present provides that the Commonwealth may make grants or loans to the bank on objec- terms and conditions determined by the Treasurer. The amendment retains the power for the Treasurer to determine the terms and conditions of anyfinancialassistance provided by the Commonwealth, but in addition requires the terms and conditions to be agreed with the bank. The requirement for agreement by the bank is consistent with comparable provisions in the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959, the Reserve Bank Act 1959 and the Banks (Housing Loans) Act 1974 and is also consistent with the cooperative nature of the whole venture. I should reassure honourable members that there is no change in the objectives which the new bank is intended to achieve. Since the legislation came into effect last year work has been proceeding as rapidly as possible establishment of the Bank. I refer to such matters as the drafting of the memorandum articles of association of the company, the location of premises, the purchase of facilities and equipment, the establishment of accounting systems, the selection of personnel and so on. I record the Government's appreciation of the energetic way in which these and associated matters have been pursued by the representatives of the major trading banks. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1977-78, which is at present before the Parliament, provides for the appropriation of an amount of $625,000 to finance the Commonequity contribution to the Bank authorised by section 6 of the Act. This is based on a total initial capital for the Bank of $5,625,000 to be contributed in nine equal amounts by each of seven major trading banks, the State banks which together and the Commonwealth. It is also proposed that representatives ofeach of the seven major trading banks and one representative of the State banks be nominated as directors of the Bank's board. In addition, under terms of the Act itself, I will be designating a chairman, a Commonwealth Government representative and two primary producer representadves. I will be announcing the names of these directors as soon as practicable. The House will appreciate that aspects of the Bank's operations-it s lending pohcies, interest rates and so on-wil l not be determined until after the board has been established and relevant consultations have been held with the Commonwealth. The precise range and types of lenders, in addition to the participating banks, to be granted access to the refinancing facilities of the Bank have also not yet been determined but I reaffirm that it is the Government's intention that there be wide participation. In particular, it is envisaged that the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia will be able to refinance loans to primary producers through the new Bank. Considerable work remains to be done, and there are various formalities under the Act and in connection with the registration of the company that can be completed only when the legislation that I am now proposing comes into effect. I am not in a position to be precise as to tinting, expect the Bank to be established around midyear, with lending operations necessarily commencing a little after estabhshment. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Young) adjourned. NA (SELF-GOVERNMENT) BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Adermann, and read a first time.",57
105,Mr ADERMANN,NORTHERN TERRITORY," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. I consider it an honour to present this history making measure to the Parliament. As its title makes clear, the purpose of the Bill is to confer self-government on the Northern Territory. The progress towards this present goal in the two and a half year hfe of this Government, of course, is most satisfying and gratifying to me as Minister for the Northern Territory. I am sure that honourable members will support the philosophy behind the legislation. The people of the Northern Territory, in common with other citizens of our federal Commonwealth, have the right-indee d the duty-to control their own affairs through a democratically elected legislature. This is what we are now seeking to achieve. At Federation, the citizens of the Northern Territory, as residents of the State of South Austraha, enjoyed the same pohtical rights as other Commonwealth citizens. Because of the requirements of the Constitution, those political rights were removed in 1910 when the Territory was transferred from South Austraha and accorded the status of a Commonwealth Territory. In a very real sense, the constitutional history of the Northern Territory since that date reflects the endeavours of the people of the Territory to regain the rights which they lost in 1910. That objective will not, of course, be finally achieved until the Territory is accorded statehood. However, there can be httle doubt that, whilst not conferring statehood, the Bill now before the House will, when enacted, represent the most significant advance to date in the constitutional development of the Northern Territory. In reflecting upon the fact that it has taken some 68 years for the Northern Territory to achieve self-government, I was interested to note that it was not until about 1964 that the population of the Territory exceeded 50,000. In the 14 but I years since the population has doubled to its presentfigureof about 105,000.1 hardly need remind honourable members that this growth has taken place despite the devastation of Darwin on Christmas Eve 1974 by cyclone Tracy and the wholesale depletion of the city's population which followed that disaster. I believe that the impressive growth of the Territory in the past one and a half decades bears full testimony to the interest and concern of successive Federal governments to promote the development of the Territory. During that period there has been a burgeoning of the Territory's mineral producSecond Reading tion-especially manganese and bauxite-and an increased realisation of the very great potential of the mineral wealth which, as yet, remains untapped. As honourable members are well aware, the Alligator Rivers region constitutes a source of uranium of major significance by world standards. The lead-zinc deposit at MCArthur River also has major potential. I am optimistic that these are but two examples of great mineral wealth on which the economic future of the Northern Territory will undoubtedly be based. Before dhecting my attention to the Bill, I would draw the attention of honourable members to the essentially bipartisan approach which has been adopted in this Parliament to the constitutional advancement of the Northern Territory. It was in 1947 that the first Legislative Council for the Northern Territory-albei t with a majority of official members-wa s established by the Chifley Labor Government. Through the 1950s and 1960s a succession of reforms to that Council was introduced by Liberal-Country Party governments, culminating, in 1968, with a majority of elected over appointed members. In 1974 the then Labor Government created the first fully elected Legislative Assembly. However, progress towards self-government was then halted when, at the Territory elections, the Labor Party was completely annihilated. On assuming office and in pursuance of the policy of this Government as announced during the election policy speeches of 1975, I had the privilege in 1976 of bringing before the Parliament a Bill which set the stage for the conferral of executive responsibility on the Territory through the creation of Executive Members of the Legislative Assembly. The Bill now before the House represents in a very real sense, a continuation of the endeavours of honourable members on both sides of the Parliament to meet the legitimate constitutional aspirations of the Northern Territory community. Indeed, although it has proved necessary for presentational reasons to repeal the Northern Territory (Adrninistration) Act, this Bill seeks the re-enactment, in largely the same form, of a large number of the existing provisions of that Act. I turn now to the Bill. As is appropriate in a measure of this type, the Bill commences with a preambular statement of the intention of the Parliament and the constitutional authority for giving effect to that intention. Part II establishes Northern Territory as a distinct political entity for thefirsttime.Part III provides for the legislative power and has the effect of retaining the present broad-based legislative authority held by the Legislative Assembly. The assent procedures provide that the final decision on laws dealing with matters in respect of which the Northern Territory has executive authority will rest with the Administrator. In respect of such laws the Government would expert the Administrator to act on advice from his Northern Territory Ministers. In the case of other laws the Administrator will have the option of reserving the measure for the Governor General's pleasure. A reserve power for the Governor General to disallow any laws within six months of their receiving the Administrator's assent is retained. Consistent with the principles of responsible self-government, the authority of the Legislative Assembly will be enhanced in several important respects. The Assembly wtil be able to deterrnine its own size and, subject to guarantees providing for ehgibility for candidature and voting and the size of electorates, it will control its own electoral procedures. The maximum term of the Legislative Assembly will be extended from 3 years to 4 years from the date the Assembly first meets after a general election. Part IV of the Bill deals with the conferral of executive authority on the Territory. The duty of administering the government of the Territory remains with the Administrator who, in respect of matters for which the Territory has executive authority, will be advised by the Executive Council established under this Part. Provision is made for ministerial appointments in the new Government of the Northern Territory and for such appointments to be made by the Administrator. The matters in respect of which the new Ministers of the Territory will have executive authority are to be prescribed by regulation. In this regard, I would draw the attention of honourable members to my statement to this House on 14 September 1977, which, among other things, outlined the matters for which the Territory will have executive authority. Those matters represent a very broadly based package of State-type functions. The provisions in Part V will enable the Territory to establish its own Treasury and exercise control over its ownfinances.The Territory or an Authority of the Territory will be able to borrow from the Commonwealth or on its own account as part of the Commonwealth's semi governmental loan program. The Commonwealth Auditor-General will be empowered to the conduct audits on behalf of the Territory. I interpose here that broad agreement has been reached with the Northern Territory Executive on the financial principles to apply on self government. The detailed quantification of those principles is now being undertaken with a view to letters of understanding being exchanged between the Prime Minister and the Majority Leader. The Commonwealth will continue to provide adequatefinancialsupport to the Northern Territory. Self-government will not be used as an excuse for reducing the overall level of financial support for the Territory and this has been made quite clear to the Majority Leader. However, the Government has always made it clear that associated with the assumption of executive authority must be the responsibihty to raise a reasonable level of local revenue using the revenue efforts of the States as a benchmark. This proposition has been accepted and is being acted upon by the Northern Territory Executive. It will not, however, result in the citizens of the Northern Territory shouldering a higher tax burden than their counterparts elsewhere in Australia. The miscellaneous provisions in Part VI cover a series of constitutional type guarantees in relation to the freedom of trade and the acquisition of property on just terms. Other provisions cover the application of the Secret Commissions Act and the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to the Territory. The Remuneration Tribunal is to be authorised to act for the Northern Territory in matters relating to the salaries and aUowances of Legislative Assembly members and ministerial office holders. Part VII covers the transitional provisions and its effect is to provide for the tinuance of existing laws, the current Legislative Assembly and the Administrator. Where matters presently provided for under the Northern Territory (Adrninistration) Act wtil become the subject of enactment, the current provisions continue to apply pending such enactment. The Commonwealth's interests in land in the Territory are to be transferred to the Northern Territory by the operation of this Part but vision is made to effect the transfer back to the Commonwealth within 12 months of that land itial being required by the Commonwealth for its purposes. Property associated with functions for which the Northern Territory receives authority is also to be transferred from the Commonwealth. Procedures are provided to enable the Territory to be substituted for the Commonsultation wealth, by way of regulation, in contracts relatritory. ing to transferred matters. The estabUshment of a Northern Territory Government wtil necessitate amendments to number of pieces of Commonwealth legislation. Besides this Bill, the self-government package comprises some 14 separate amending BUls. Of these 12 could possibly be considered in cognate debate. These Bills are: Ashmore and Cartier Islands Acceptance Amendment Bill 1978 Payroll Tax (Territories) Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978 Air Accidents (Commonwealth Government Liabitity) Amendment Bill 1978 Compensation (Commonwealth GovernNorthern ment Employees) Amendment Bill 1978 Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Amendment Bill 1978 Commonwealth Motor Vehicles (Liabitity) Amendment Bill 1978 Northern Territory Supreme Court Amendwhich ment Bill (No. 2) 1978 Ombudsman Amendment Bill 1978 Lands Acquisition Amendment Bill 1978 Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill 1978 Remuneration Tribunals Amendment Bill 1978 Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1978. Two others, the Audit Amendment Bill and the Commonwealth Grants Commission Amendment Bill, for a variety of reasons, must be discussed separately in the Parliament. It would be inappropriate for me to let this occasion pass without paying tribute to the conpeople who, over the years, have made a significant contribution to the constitutional history of the Northern Territory. They are people who, while holding divergent political views, have been united and tireless in working and pressing the case for constitutional reform. It is people Uke Sam Calder, who has worked so tirelessly for so long to achieve this goal, Jock Nelson former Labor Territory member and Administrator, proformer members of the Legislative Council such as Dr Goff Letts who was so prominent in the intransfers, the late Mr Justice Ward, 'Tiger' Brennan, Ron Withnall, Senator Bernie Kilgariff and many others who deserve the credit for what executive is taking place here today. There has been throughout the closest of conwith the Assembly of the Northern TerThe establishment of the Consultative Committee comprised of the Territory Executive and the Minister for the Northern Territory, continued consultation at officer level, meetings of a Ministers of this Government with the Majority Leader and his Deputy and involvement in interdepartmental committee deliberations, have all made this an exercise in co-operation. I have welcomed and appreciated that consultation and cooperation for it has been a rewarding and constructive partnership of effort. It began with Dr Letts and Mr Tambling and has continued both firm and active since Mr Everingham and Mr Perron have assumed leadership of the Territory. In conclusion, I wish to express my confidence in the political and economic future of the Territory. I have no doubt that the processes of responsible government which will be set in train by this Bill will operate to the benefit of the Territory and, through it, the Commonwealth. I place on record my good wishes to the Ministers designate of the Government will be brought into being on 1 July and express the hope that the responsibility which they are about to assume proves to be an enlightening and rewarding experience. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Young) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA) BILL 1978 Debate resumed from 4 May, on motion by Mr Street: That the Bill be now read a second time.",58
106,Mr STREET,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Corangamite-Minister for Relations Employment and Industrial Relations)-by leave-In my second reading speech on the which is about to be debated I said: Part IX inquiries have in practice always been dealt by a single judge . . . I regret that that statement is not correct. I should like to set the record straight. Since 1956 the Commonwealth Industrial Court was estabbetween lished there have been three mquiries by a court of three judges-on e in 1975, one in 1977 and third now before the Court.",61
107,Mr YOUNG,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Opposidon is not opposed to the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment (Federal Court of and Austraha) Bill 1978, the essence of which is to provide that further matters under the Concilioffice ation and Arbitration Act should be dealt with by a single judge with the right of appeal to Full Court comprising three or more judges. the Whilst this matter certainly would warrant disconsideration cussion, as does any amendment to the Concilithe ation and Arbitration Act, were the Parhament acting in the knowledge of agreement having been reached outside by employers and emthe ployees, this measure would certainly have the support of the whole Parhament. The amendGorman ment of such legislation, as the Minister for ployment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) said in his second reading speech, is a measure which will provide the proper utilisation of the resources of the Court. I am sure that many of the parties appearing before the Court would agree with the suggestion. I point out that the Oppoavailable sition views with utmost seriousness any amendHansard. ment to the ConciUation and Arbitration A because of the integral role the Act plays industrial relations in Austraha. But I must say that one of the shortcomings of the presentation of this amending legislation is that although the Minister indicated that these proposals had been put before the National Labour Consultative Council we have no indication, either from the applicant NLCC, which does not make its decisions public, mittee or the Minister, as to whether agreement was committee reached on the matter. I beheve that the Parliacommittee ment should be cognisant of the attitudes of both The employers and employees to legislation of this were nature coming before the Parliament. Then the therefore NLCC, to carry out its functions properly, should make Parhament aware of any decision it makes on such matters. Second Reading The advantages of the use of three or more judges on cases that could validly be heard by a single judge are aU too obvious not to warrant support. I shall give some examples provided by the Department of Employment and Industrial which I have in irtind when I make this statement. On 1 December 1976 in the case of Bill Saint v Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union and others the applicant sought with orders under section 140 that a rule of the Umon under which an office was abolished was contrary to section 133 (1) (f) of the Act. The Induswhen trial Court held that there was a difference between an office altogether and dismissing a person from office when that office is to the continue, and that an office might be aboUshed at anytimeprovided such abolition was effected in accordance with the rules. On 9 June 1977, in the case of Johns v Allen others the applicant sought orders under section 141 that a person purportedly elected to the of'organiser' in the Geelong sub-branch of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation not a be treated as holding office on the grounds that rules made no provision for such office. After of the rules of the organisation and relevant provision of the Act and regulations the Federal Court held that, quite clearly, the rules contained no provision for such office and sub-branch had no power to create the office. On 13 February 1977 in the case of Campbell v the apphcant sought orders under secEmtion 141 that a conviction for an offence against the rules be treated as nuU and void. The Federal Court found that the charge for the offence under the rules was not determined in accordance with the rules and amounted to a denial of natural justice. Notes on two other cases have been made to me which I consider ought to be in I seek leave to have incorporated in a Hansard notes on the cases Hassett v Harding in and others and Roots v Mutton and others. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsHassett v Harding and others (29 September, 1976). The sought orders under secdon 141 that the comof management of the Tasmanian branch of the TWU had ceased to exist on the grounds that two members of the of management had resigned, thereby leaving the of management incapable of forming a quorum. Industrial Court found that the notices of resignation not given in the manner required by the rules and were ineffective. The matter involved a straight forward application of the rules. Roots v Mutton and others (23 March, 1978). The applicant sought orders that his suspension under the rules Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union be treated as null and void. The Federal Coun found that the rule under which the applicant was suspended had not been validly adopted in accordance with the rule making procedures under the rules and was therefore invalid. This case simply involved mination of facts.",61
108,Mr YOUNG,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"As the Minister has pointed out, in State jurisdictions matters of a similar nature in the first instance would be dealt with by magistrates. However, the Government has seen fit to make sure that matters of law in particular are always subject to a hearing by three or more judges. Nevertheless it seems to us that there may well be a case for disputes involving other sections of the Act going automatically to a hearing before three or more judges. I refer subsequently to sections 140 and 141 to enforce or challenge the validity of the rules of an organisation. In these cases it may merely prolong the course of litigation and increase the cost to the parties if the case is heard by a single judge, especially where the litigation was inspired by a factional dispute in a union. It would seem that it is not in the interest of any party or the court to have these matters prolonged. I look forward to the Minister's explanation of this matter when we go into the Committee stages of the Bill. Cases under other sections of the Act have been exempted from hearing by a single judge. We agree with that entirely. The right of appeal may well be the yardstick by which these amendabsolutely ments succeed or fail. However, the Opposition is not entirely happy with the way in which the Bill is framed. Firstly, the Government is putting forter ward in relation to section 1S8P and Part IX the Act that there would be no right of appeal. The area of concern in relation to section 158P that there are to be inquiries into alleged irregularities in amalgamation ballots, and lation to Part IX, inquiries into alleged irregularithe ties into elections in organisations. The Minister makes the point that proceedings of this nature involve only determination of matters of fact which are not complex and that further litigation Minister would be likely to be factionally motivated and should be discouraged. To me, that seems to be .desirable an over-simplification as to why there should be some restriction of access to the Court. In adAgain dition to that proposition put by the Governvision ment, and aided by the argument that there never been an inquiry into an amalgamation balany lot, the Government appears to be legislating by chance rather than by rationale. We say in both cases there ought to be the right of appeal, indeed there should be the right of appeal from single judge decision to a court of three or judges in all cases. To a large extent factions in trade unions are of the born out of the very nature of a free trade union movement. Thus free trade unions as such are enormously important in the make-up of Australian society. We would be deluding ourselves a deterif we believed there was a recipe for legislating factions within trade unions or, as in this case, using factions as an excuse to further what we consider to be a bad principle. However, it is the policy of our Party that only matters of law should be subject to a hearing by the High Court and matters of an industrial nature should remain within the confines of the industrial division of the Federal Court. We would be against any blending of the industrial division of the Federal Court with the general division of that Court which could lead to far less expertise being available to deal with industrial matters of such critical nature. As I said at the outset, this Bill could have been a simple measure attracting the support of everybody in the House, yet for reasons best known to itself the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations has continued on its way of writing amendments into the Conciliation and Arbitration Act furthering the role of the Minister. I refer here of course to section 118C (1) (b) which provides that the Minister can have referral powers over and above the powers granted to the parties to the proceedings. There seems to be no justification for this provision except that it follows the line set down in earlier legislation by this Government to give the Minisan interventionist role in industrial relations. of In 1976 sections 34 and 36A, and in 1977 sections 109 and 143, were amended. We can see is other examples of the philosophy of this Government in interpreting the role of the Minister for in reEmployment and Industrial Relations. We find manner in which this has been done curious to say the least. In his second reading speech in reference to the new section, the Minister said: I would not envisage many circumstances in which the would make use of this provision. However, it does provide a remedy for a situation in which the parties . . did not seek a reference and such a reference was in the public interest. the Minister uses in his defence of this prothe role of factions within the trade union has movement. One can hardly envisage factions of organisation not seeking a reference to a Full Court. Indeed, it has been the history of factions to exploit the courts to the very 'nth' degree. I and have grave suspicions about what the Governa ment has in mind in relation to the Minister. I use more this opportunity to point out to employee and employer organisations that the role of the Government has been written into the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in such a way that come the day when the Government feels secure enough to implement its powers industrial relations will have a different course from the one that they have traditionally charted. I would be extremely surprised, indeed amazed, if employee organisations in particular ever agreed to such proposed legislation.",62
109,Mr STREET,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I would like to clear up one or two points that have been raised by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young). The first concerns his reference to the attitude of the National Labour Consultative Council. I am happy to be able to inform the House that the Council did not oppose what is being done here. It made the point that it would like powers of reference, comparable to those which existed in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, to a Full Bench. As honourable members know, the Government has made provision for that The honourable member requested details concerning two other matters. As to the question of section 158P and Part IX being not appealable, he suggested that my reference in the second reading speech to those sections was rather an over-simptification. In giving now more detail on why the Government took the attitude that it did, I stress again that every action taken under this legislation, including those taken under Section 158P and Part IX, can be referred. Either party can request such a reference and, if the Minister so directs, it shall be granted. I shall discuss the referral powers of the Miniseffect ter a Uttle later, but insofar as the section 158P and Part IX questions are concerned, it might be useful to go into more detail on why we have taken the attitude that we have taken. As the honourable member himself has said, the issues concern mainly questions of fact-whethe irregularities have, in fact, occurred. 'Irregupropriety larity' is defined in the Act. The present position is that inquiries under section 158P and Part can be conducted by either one judge or a FuU Bench. As the honourable member said, there have not so far been any inquiries into amalgamation baUots. inquiries into elections under part IX have, with three exceptions, been dealt with by a court constituted by a single judge. I would emphasise that there is no appeal from the court's decision, however constituted. All that the amendments do is to maintain what has gendoes eraUy been the practice conceinrting Part IX in the quiries, and to provide consistency in the treatthe ment of matters of a similar nature. The efficient operation of an organisation requires that questions in relation to elections be finalised as quickly as possible. An organisation cannot function as it should, in the interest of its members, while there is uncertainty as to who should hold important offices in the organisation. The existing inquiry procedures under Part IX, where there is no appeal from a court's decision, strike a balance between the need to rectify irregularities and the need to ensure that the rectification process is not so protracted as unduly to disrupt the administration of organisations. The provisions of an appeal would provide additional scope for faction fights, which would necessarily further delay the finaUsation of elections. This approach is reinforced by the provisions requiring that an apphcation for an inquiry under Part IX be lodged with the Industrial Registrar, who is required to refer it to the court only when he is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for an inquiry into the question whether there has been an irregularity in the election which may affect the result, and that the circumstances justify an inquiry by the court. That means, of course, that the fate of an application can be determined by the Industrial Registrar, from whose decision there is no appeal. If there were to be an appeal from the court's decision on an apphcation for inquiry, consistency would seem to demand that the Industrial Registrar's decision should also be appealed, or that aU appUcations should be dealt with by the court without the intervention of the Industrial Registrar, so that they would be subject to the appeal provisions. In either case, the practical would be that the court would have to inquire into whether there was justification for the application. It could reasonably be expected that elections would be increasingly the subject of inquiries, on the appUcation of disappointed candidates or their supporters, and increasingly organr isations would be called upon to defend the of their elections against allegations of irregularity, which an investigation by the RegisIX trar would have shown to be without foundation. The position would be exacerbated by provision for an appeal against the court's findings. In relation to amalgamation ballots, a relevant factor is that they must be conducted by the Industrial Registrar's Office or the Australian Electoral Office. Of course, that does not mean that the baUots are immune from irregularity, but it mean that the scope for the occurrence of irregularities is very much reduced. It is not Government's position that these inquiries cannot be dealt with by a full court. Under proposed section 118c a party to an inquiry wtil be able to apply to the judge for an order that quiry proceedings be heard and determined by a full court. Such an application can be made at any stage of the proceedings. That will enable matters that are appropriate for a full court so dealt with, without the necessity to go through a preliminary hearing before a single judge, as would be the case if there were an appeals system. Moreover, it is not only under section 158P and Part IX that an allegation of irregularity can be investigated. Where it is alleged that a relevant rule is invalid, or that there has been a failure to observe a rule, proceedings can be taken under sections 140 or 141, as appropriate. Indeed, the honourable member made several references to such cases. A decision under those sections is subject to an appeal to a full court. Consequently, where interpretations or other questions of law are involved, decisions on those questions can be made subject to review by action under sections 140 or 141, as applicable. All things considered, I do not believe that a right of appeal in section 158P, or Part IX, inquiries is either necessary or desirable. Turning now to the other matter raised by the honourable member, that of therightof the Minister to have a matter referred to a full court, I assume that his argument is the old one that has been used against intervention by the Minister in matters before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission-that the parties should be able to setde their anairs between themselves without government interference. It is an argument which assumes that no one outside the actual contestants has any legitimate interests in how those contests are conducted or resolved. That may be generally true when the contest concerns only the relationships of individuals. It is certainly not true where the contestants are powerful industrial organisations whose activities can affect, for good or ill, the welfare of all Australians. The Government cannot stand aside and let these organisations arrange affairs to achieve results satisfactory to them but unsatisfactory to the community generally. In my second reading speech I said that I would not envisage many circumstances in which the Minister would make use of that provision. The honourable member sought further details about what the Government had in mind and I will be glad to expand my original statement. I mentioned that it would provide a remedy for a situation in which the parties to proceedings had not sought a reference but such reference was desirable in the public interest. I mentioned, as example, circumstances in which the Minister inmight become aware that factions within an organisation had commenced proceedings which were likely to be protracted and subject to appeal to a full court. It is in the interests of the to be members of the organisations that these proceedings be finalised as quickly as possible. It is also in the interests of the community, which provides financial assistance in proceedings under the Act. It is estimated that at least $100,000 will be spent in providing financial assistance this financial year. Since 1972 approximately $400,000 has been spent on this form of assistance. There could also be circumstances in which it would be desirable to obtain an authoritative decision on a question of law arising from the proceedings, but which neither party to the proceedings would be prepared to pursue through the appeal process. It may be used, I repeat, only infrequently, but the power is there when required. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Clauses 1 to 3-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Clause 4 (Limitation on appeals).",63
110,Mr HOLDING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I listened with great interest to the comments by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street). It seems to me that in his approach to this issue the Minister may well be creating more problems than he is solving. Whilst it is important and necessary to rationalise the work of the Federal Court of Australia and make fuller use of the resources of the Court, there are certain procedures which are more readily dealt with in the first instance by a Full Court. I refer particularly to challenges to the validity of the rules of an organisation under sections 114 and 141 of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act. By their very nature these cases are often lengthy, extensive and involve considerable exercises in the interpretation of rules. They never take place in the context of an academic exercise between the parties. They are usually part of a background struggle for power within an organisation. That being so, it seems to me that it really would be a far more expedient and judicious use of the experience of the Court and a saving of the time of the parties if those types of cases were dealt with right from the start by a Full Court of three. In the history of such cases it has not been unan usual for one judge to find that particular rules are valid and two other judges to find that they are invalid. That being so, the very nature of the contest is such that from the point of view of the Minister it would be a saving in time and cost and a better use of the capacities of the Court if right from the start these cases were subject to a process under which they were dealt with by a Full Court. Proposed new section 118c provides that the parties or the Minister may apply at any stage of proceedings before a single judge to have the proceedings heard and determined by a Full Court. What is interesting about that is that an apphcation by the Minister must be granted whereas the judge has a discretion as to whether to grant an application by one of the parties. In addition, the judge may of his own motion refer the proceedings to a Full Court. It seems to me that there is no justification putting the Minister in a special position in respect of being able to require that that proceeding be dealt with by a FuU Court. Either the judge to whom the apphcation is made should have a discretion irrespective of whom the applicant is or the parties to the proceedings should have the same right as the Minister to require that the proceedings be dealt with by a FuU Court. That is a view that I urge upon the Minister. We are dealing with a reasonably sensitive area. I do not think that the Minister has to be reminded of that. In this area it is important that the Minister, to the extent to which he seeks this type of power, should not be seen to be in a position which is significantly different from that of the other parties to the proceedings. If that principle were adopted I do not think it would involve any serious diminution of the rights of the Minister but it would put the Minister at the same level as aU other parties to the proceedings. It would not put the Minister in a position which could be seen and argued to be of some advantage and whereby the Crown can by the process of intervention produce a result which is not immediately available to the other parties within the jurisdiction. The Minister would be well advised to examine that proposal because I can see difficulties arising if the Commonwealth chooses to place itself in a position where the Minister does not approach the Court with the samerights,no more and no less, as the other parties before the court. I share the view and the concern that have already been expressed by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) on the question of intervention. I understand the general philosophy of the Government, which says: 'We are dealing with powerful social institutions and the Government of the day has to give itself a right to intervene to protect the public, if necessary'. I understand the underlying philosophy behind that, but one has to deal with that philosophy in terms of the history, experience and tradition of this jurisdiction. The use of what is essentiaUy a legal structure to solve the very complex problems of industrial relations is difficult and complex enough. Irrespective of whatever advantages this particular clause bestows, or is seen to bestow, upon the Commonwealth or any government I believe that ultimately it will produce situations which, rather than solve industrial problems, wtil actually increase the tension surrounding them. There may well be points of intervention for any Minister in these situations, but, as the Minister virtually conceded by impUcation, he sees this power of intervention almost as a power of last resort. In for his elaboration of this clause he has indicated that it is a power that would be not used frequently. He concedes that point. I argue that the history and tradition of this jurisdiction show that the points of intervention, as and when they have taken place, have largely served to complicate the normal processes for resolving problems between parties within the jurisdiction. In many cases, the actual intervention by the Minister has simply delayed what would otherwise have been a settlement and resolution of industrial disputes. If one looks at the history of my own State, where from time to time this sort of power has been exercised by State Ministers in the industrial appeal court jurisdiction, one wtil find that on balance it has not reaUy assisted in difficult industrial situations. For those reasons, I ask the Minister to consider the arguments put forward by me and the honourable member for Port Adelaide.",64
111,Mr YOUNG,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I wish to make mention of two matters. In respect of one the Labor Party has a very clear policy, that is, the right of appeal from a single judge to a court of three or more judges. As I said earUer, proposed section 118B (a), which restricts the right of appeal, serves as a grey area in what otherwise would have been a Bill that would have attracted the support of the whole Parliament. It is something to which the Labor Movement almost totally is opposed. I believe that it brings into disrepute the essence of the Bill, which seeks to utitise the resources of the Federal Court of Australia in a more meaningful way. That objective does have our support but we cannot support the restrictions in regard to it. In regard to the role of the Minister, there can be no doubt, irrespective of the views of the National Labour Consultative Council, which may not be released publicly, that the trade union movement, the Labor movement generally, is opposed to the way in which the Minister is being written into the ConciUation and Arbitration Act. The Minister attends those meetings and he would be aware that he should not try to camouflage the acdon taken by the Government of again writing into legislation a provision relating to the Minister by saying that there are some powerful institutions. Most of the powerful responsible institutions with which the Minister deals as the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations are not only opposed to the idea but also have advised him accordingly. The Minister would know from his experience over the last couple of years that the best work that can be done by a Minister is not through the courts at aU. In fact, if one may say so, the most beneficial actions taken by the present Minister have been outside the courts and outside formalities. Those actions have brought about the sorts of results which one would tend to think should have been the guide to what we should be doing in this Parliament. There are grave doubts in the labour movement about what the Government is attempting to do. Every time it amends the Conciliation and Arbitration Act it gives a further role to the ister. We receive very httle comfort from the guarantee that the Mmister does not envisage this power being used very often. That may be said in relation to the number of ways in which the role of the Minister is being written. We are not talking specificaUy about one case. What we are talking about is the different course the Government is charting in the role it plays in industrial relations- a course which is away from what has been traditionally the case. The Government cannot legislate to meet every single incident that is Ukely to crop up in industrial relations. One cannot achieve a perfect recipe in industrial relations. I suggest to the Minister that he ought to heed the words of the responsible who make up the vast majority of people in the labour movement and not be cognisant of the actions of the minority upon whom this legislation is based. I suggest in aU seriousness that this role of the Minister is a bad thing for industrial relations in Austraha and one cannot predict what it might bring in the future if the Government continues on a sinular course.",65
112,Mr STREET,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION," I take up two points which were referred to by both the honourable members for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young). The honourable member for Melbourne Ports felt that sections 140 and 141 were more appropriately dealt with in the first instance by a fuU court. As the honourable member says, these issues often involve highly sensitive areas in the union movement. I agree with him in that assessment. He expressed the view that time and cost would be saved if a matter went to the fuU court in the first instance. But I believe this is a matter of balance. The argument he put may be so in a great many of the sorts of issues that can arise out of section 140 and section 141 actions. This does not have to be so. Therefore the Government does not consider it unreasonable that, in the first instance, these actions can be dealt with by a single judge. I stress again the point that if any of the parties or indeed the Minister-and I will come back to the referral power of the Minister in a minute-se e some danger signals in relation to a section 140 or section 141 action, the matter can be referred to a full court without going through the full procedures of an appeal. I believe that some actions undoubtedly can be appropriately dealt with by a single judge, and where they can be well and good because this would be a better use of the court's resources. But if there are difficulties I would guess-and I believe the honourable Min- gentleman with his experience would agree with me-it would not be long before a matter was referred to the full court, particularly in cases which involve the sorts of issues we know can arise. I have already explained in some detail in my second reading speech why I believe it is necessary for the Minister to have the power of referral. I reiterate that in proceedings such as those which can arise in the industrial division of the Federal Court the Minister as the government's representative in turn is the representative of the pubhc interest. It is true that we have taken action in the ConciUation and Arbitration Act to ensure that the Minister can act in the public interest on his own initiative. The Minister is in a special position in representing the public interest and he has a special responsibUity which does not apply to the parties themselves. I explained that the Minister would not use his power as a normal course of action, but the Government believes the power needs to be in the legislation. I am aware of the trade union movement's general opposition to this right of the Minister but I make no apology for this power. A government should not stand aside if it beUeves the pubhc interest is at risk. It should have the power to intervene on behalf of the pubhc when it considers it necessary to do so. We have made provision for that power in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and we make the same provision in this Bill. Question put: That the clause be agreed to. The Committee divided.

113,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"Corar°,amite-Minister for Lusher, S.A. Lynch, P. R. Employment and Industrial Relations)-Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate on this Bill resumes, I suggest that it might suit the conMacphee, LM . Moore, J. C venience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Re-establishment and Employment Amendment Bill, as they are associated measures. Of course, questions will be put separately on each of the Bills at the conRuddock, P.M. Shack, P. D. clusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject Short, J.R. matter of both Bills to be discussed in this Simon, B. D. debate.",67
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering both measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed. Tellers: Mr YOUNG (Port Adelaide) (4.11 )-The OpCorbett, J. Hodges, J.C. position supports the legislation in as much as the Bills are a first step to upgrade the Commonwealth Employment Service. But the shortcomings are obvious and I hope step by step to be able to go through them, and indicate to the Klugman, R. E. Martin, V.J. Government the dunking on this side of the House in relation to a properly constructed ComScholes, G.G.D. Stewart, F. E. monwealth Employment Service, structured in such a way that it can efficiently meet with the demands made upon it by employers and employees alike. Considering Australia's experience over the past 30 years, one would have expected that a Johnson, Les government today, in 1978, would have had MCMahon, Les many more ideas, and would have been prepared to devote a great deal more of this country's resources when dealing with the Commonwealth Employment Service. When comparing the governmental activity concerning this matter at the end of World War II, with the Bill introduced by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) last week, it makes today's Government's measure look shabby by comparison. The Government may well ask, if these are the views of the Opposition, why then in fact are we supporting the Bill. It is, as I said, a first step. The Labor Party will give the Government every co-operation required to update these services. There will be no hurdle placed in the path of the Government at ail in dealing with these matters. So our judgment was based upon a very simple quesdon: Is it better than the existing CES operadon or is it worse? The decision of the Labor Party is that the measure is marginally better. There is one point I should like to make, however, before entering into the main stream of this debate, and that is directed at the people who have serviced the Commonwealth Employment Service in recent years. When one looks at the unemployment rate between 1950 to 1978 with very minor exceptions in recenttimes,there is an obvious pattern of Australia's good fortune in having a very low proportion of its work force unemployed. One could understand, then, that the politicians, academics, public servants had cast the Commonwealth Employment Service offices in the role of the not too important. It only been the most recent impact of a world recession which has demanded the focussing of far more attention on the Commonwealth Employment Service than has previously been the case. This recession not merely placed many tens of thousands of people out of work but it brought to Austraha in a fashion before unheralded, a restructuring of our industries at a pace with which Austraha itself could not deal. I think it important to make this point so that any discussion about the operation of a Commonwealth Employment Service office is relevant to the overall economic problems that our country may face. In other words it is no good blaming those people working in the Commonwealth Employment Service offices for our own shortcomings. But I had hoped that today we would have had sufficienttimeto look at what structure is needed to cany out the function of placing people in employment, and to be able to meet the vacancies caused from time to time in industry. Because, just as I said looking back over the years we have a pattern of very low unemployment rates, today, looking forward, it will take a government of the utmost enterprise to eradicate the major problem of unemployment as it has been consolidated in this country. In all seriousness and with the best of will it is an impossible task to read into the Bill before the House or, more specifically, die clauses dealing with the functions of the Commonwealth Employment Service as described in the Bill that this Bill is other than window dressing. I realise that the Norgard committee report will be the subject of a great deal of quoting throughout this debate, and properly so. However, let me be thefirsttofirethe shot. In making the criticism, I refer the Government to the words contained in the Norgard committee report: However, what the CES needs more than any of the improvements suggested above is the polidcal will and the support of the Government to upgrade its activides so it can function as a modern manpower service. Obviously the warning given by Norgard has not been taken up by the Government. It is one thing to say, as did the Minister in his second reading speech, that the purpose of this Bill is: . . . to provide a legislative framework for the CES which is appropriate for its development as a modern manpower service. But the Government has no general manpower pohcy which this new authority is to carry out. The Government would not need any new authority to carry out programs which it has in operation at the moment. I do not wish to condemn has the present schemes outright. In some cases they may do a minor good. But the Minister and the Government know that in relation to a total workforce problem the present programs are not even scratching the surface. The manpower program as such needs direction from the top. The Commonwealth Employment Service authority could and would be frustrated by policy emanating from the Executive. If the Executive does not want full employment all the window dressing in the world by the Commonwealth Employment Service will not overcome the problem. That Service in fact would need the utmost co-operation from a sympathetic government giving to it the autonomy and the resources required to develop initiatives if we are to overcome this problem. I would Uke also at this stage to refer to the Norgard recommendation, which stated: . . . management of the CES should be vested in a statutory authority wholly and solely concerned with employment and manpower matters including analysis of the labour market and formulation of manpower programs. One would have thought that having decided against the statutory authority the Government would have taken the opportunity to tell us why. At the moment let me say we are unpersuaded in the Labor Party towards having a Commonwealth Employment Service as a statutory authority. But it is a recommendation of the Committee set up by this Government which, in fact, has been totally ignored by the Government. Whilst making the point about the statutory authority one would have to say that the Bill before the House gives the Commonwealth Employment Service very litde independence at all. This would not be a shortcoming if the Government had a range of manpower programs which would keep the Commonwealth Employment Service busy implemendng them. But that is certainly not the case as I have already said. When the National Director has his first meeting with his staff he will be discussing the same old, programmes which in real terms do very litde to assist the vast majority of unemployed people or industries that are searching for new employees. Mr Speaker, the importance and the urgency of a measure such as this are reinforced every month we look at the unemploymentfigures.For some of the elder people in our community it brings fears of another depression. For some the very young people in our community it brings frustration before undreamed of. It bewilders and confuses governments, workers and emventional ployers. No relief can be gained from measuring the figures of unemployed people in this country against thefiguresof some other country. To say that we have 7 per cent and some other country has 7 per cent, so eveiything in Australia must normal, is unacceptable. We must reject theory as being short sighted and inhuman. should start from the very positive statement we are a massive countiy with great resources, very small population and a duty to provide ployment for all those who wish to work. Only adopting that as our guide can we be expected make proper manpower decisions. On the question of manpower programs I not lay the blame at the door of any particular organisation for Australia's inadequacies. The program 1950s and 1960s bred complacency, but complacency has no place in our thinking today. Unemployment and the social scars that come with it are a nightmare to hundreds of thousands of Australians and collectively we have to lift that burden. It may be that in putting forward proper manpower programs the Government the day would suggest that their investment this area would be set down for longer than normal parliamentary term. Again I think it portant to point out on behalf of the Labor Party that should this Government be so moved, the Opposition would look seriously at any manthere power program initiated by this Government, to see that wherever possible our support was forthidentify coming. It is becoming obvious from the periences of countries overseas that if the ation of our new Commonwealth Employment Service is to be successful many of the programs will be long term in nature. Such planning would be ever so more successful if it carried with it the support of the Parliament, not just the governing party; and I look forward to the day when we can be tested on this point, but up to date the Government hau seenfitnot to introduce a total manpower program, but is condemning those affected by a lack of it, to an inadequate service that has been provided in the past by the Commonwealth Employment Service and undoubtstale edly will be provided in the future. I want to refer here, Mr Speaker, to the words of Mr Lindsay Bowes. Mr Bowes is the Director of the South Austrahan Department of Labor and Industry and certainly one of the foremost authorities on the subject of manpower in Australia. Mr Bowes said quite recently: 'Labour of market imbalances were likely to remain unchanged until Australia's manpower planning facilities were developed.' He said also that 'conpolicies seemed unlikely to solve labour market imbalances'. I draw attention to a further quote of Mr Bowes when he said: 'These current labour market imbalances are likely to proceed into the future as long as either the interbe national economic situation, the education systhat tem and community values all remain unWe changed or government and employers insist that upon relying on those policy actions which a seemed sufficient during the previous decade'. em Mr Bowes, of course, was pointing to something by that is obvious to all those who wish to look at to the problem, and that is we cannot use the solutions of the 1950s and apply them to the problems of the 1970s. In so many of the areas do touched on briefly there the Government is silent. It gives an interpretation of a manpower but, as I said it lacks the political will or that the resourcefulness to carry them out. It may be that we should look closer at the problems that the Commonwealth Employment Service is likely to be confronted with and on this I would like to make reference to the special of groups of unemployed. So many people clasin sified as disadvantaged unemployed can, as the Norgard pointed out, become unemployables. imThere needs to be extreme care taken and extra counsel given to prevent this from occurring. The most important of all is the need to accept that are special groups of unemployed. There is no doubt that in Australia today people readily young people unable to find employexment as the most disadvantaged group. This operstems largely from the number of people who make up this group which by itself, gives Australia a greater than average post-war unemployment rate. It also exposes our failure to sensitise the break from school and entry to work. For three decades this barely offered a problem. Today to every young person leaving school anxious to enter the workforce it appears to be a great wall holding them back, restricting their opportunities, forcing them into employment necessitating far less than the skills they have been trained in, necessitating their long travel from their home, and making it appear futile to continue any form of higher education. I have said manytimesbefore that this is not a phenomena of only the working class suburbs or regions of this country. Families, irrespective of where they live, are subject to suffering the same consequences. For the Commonwealth Employment Service to do anything positive in this area would require intensive collaboration with the educational stitutions of the various States. A lead can drawn on this from the recommendations of Norgard Committee contained in section 5.19, which reads: 5.19 The Review therefore strongly recommends CES should withdraw from any large scale program aimed at counselling students in their the CES should play a more constructive and meaningful role by: providing labour market information and occupational informadon geared to the needs of young people at various levels of the secondary school system; encouraging and assisting in the development of career decision-making and other occupationally relevant programs in schools including working with career advisors in schools; encouraging and assisting employers in their efforts play a positive role in bridging the gap from school to employment-e.g . by assisting in the design of induction programs for youth. The Bill contains an opportunity in its estabUshment of the National Advisory Committee for employers and employees to play some part in the inabihty of the Commonwealth Employment Service in the formulation of pohcy. I reahse that both groups as described by the legislation wiU warmly welcome the opportunity to express their views formally through the channels of government as they have to do so often informaUy. These appointments should be continued wherever possible and wherever government legislation provides. Another matter with which the Commonwealth Employment Service wtil have to come to grips is the issue of the increasing role of women in the workforce. I would hope that the Commonwealth Employment Service is not guided by the Government's silence into betieving that women are only of secondary importance. It is rather amazing still to hear in the late 1970s debate over the right to work of some sections of our community. Mr Whitlam pointed out in a speech given recently: It istimewe recognised that women not only have a right to work if they want to but in most cases they need to work to suppon themselves and their families. There is no longer anything grasping or indulgent about the two income family. Hundreds and thousands of women get jobs to make ends meet. It is in the area of the employment of married women that the most dramatic change in the work force has taken place. Let me say again on behalf of the Labor Party, as I have said so many times previously, that it beUeves in the right to work for aU those desirous of working and to the Labor Party a married woman has just as much right to go to work as any other citizen. In fact, as one can observe from the rapid growth of married women in the work force, reaching over 22 per cent of the total work force as of November in1977, they play an extremely important role in be the country's economy. The fact that in 1947 the women as a whole made up 22 per cent of the work force and that today they make up approximately 36 per cent of the work force is a clear that the indication to the Commonwealth Employment Service of the general acceptance of women in final year of school. Rather the work force. That needs to be stated and restated so that there can be no misunderstanding as to the Parliament's view on this matter. It is also worth noting another problem when talking of women in the work force-her e again the Commonwealth Employment Service should be the instrument for measuring this problemand that is the hidden unemployment among to women. I do not wish to raise now the old argument of the payment of unemployment benefit to married women; that can wait until another day. But the fact that to a very large extent unemployed married women are not entitled to unemployment benefit is an action by which women are sent scurrying back to their homes and discouraged from actively seeking new employment. Obviouslyfiguresof this nature do not show up in the Commonwealth Employment Service's monthly unemployment figures, nor would they show up in the Austrahan Bureau of Statistics'figuresbecause they would have to be 'actively seeking work seven days before the survey date'. One study done in the United States of America revealed that, in a period ofrisingunemployment, for every 100 women laid off 30 joined the unemployed and the remaining 70 dropped out of the labour force as discouraged workers. The rapid increase of employment of women also refutes the argument on the wage rate question. Again, whilst it is not totally relevant to this matter, this is an argument which was used against the Labor Government for the rise in unemployment figures in this country. At a time when equal pay had been given by the courts, between May 1974 and November 1975, female employment increased by 80,000 whereas the number of men employed declined by 60,000. At the moment, proportionately more females of Australian and migrant origin are unemployed in all age groups than the corresponding group of males. When these figures, which today show a total of 10.4 per cent of the female work force unemployed, are added to the hidden unemployment to which I have already referred one can comprehend the problems concerning the newly-structured Commonwealth Employment Service operadon. I conclude my remarks on this item by quoting an International Labour Organisation declarforce. ation which reads: All measures shall be taken to guarantee women's right to physicaUy work as the inalienable right of other women doing refuse as necessaiy existing mass collective agreements, practices or customs which limit the integration of the work force on a footing of equality with men. In looking at these groups, the Commonwealth Employment Service will have to be cognisant a manner far more sophisticated than previously has been the case in Australia of the specific problems of migrants. A very large proportion of Australia's work force was born outside of country. Without saying as much, it has been expected to a very large extent that those people will fill the jobs that Australians do not want. The statistics would show us that in manufacturthe ing industry, for instance, migrants comprise far higher proportion of the work force than do of the total work force. There is much talk Australia of structural adjustment. That would affect the migrant families more than it would affect any other group. If the car industry, shoe industry or the textile industry were being restructured, then, even in the sense of retraining the people involved, quite specific provision would have to be made for the problems of mievitably grants. I hope that the local committees to be up under clause 17 (2) of the Bill will contain very good sprinkling of migrants so that they have their say about the functioning of the ComService monwealth Employment Service offices. I will certainly be encouraging them to do so. Likewise, Austraha has to acknowledge that many Commonwealth Employment Service offices will have to deal with Aboriginal people. It is said that 30 per cent of the Aboriginal work force is unemployed. Closer scrutiny, I beheve, would put thatfiguremuch higher. The Norgard Committee made reference to it in paragraph 5.45, as follows: The Review considers that an increase in staff is vital if the employment service is to give anything better than a nominal service to Aboriginal clients, especially those in isolated areas. The increase in staff should be devoted to: increasing the range of in-plant training arranged for Aboriginals under NEAT; improving the service to areas only barely being serviced by vocational officer; improving liaison with other agencies concerned with Aboriginal client groups. Again in this area we should be more positive in our attitude towards establishing employment facUities for the Aboriginal people. As citizens with special problems we should estabhsh special services to blend them into the work I have fuU confidence that this could be achieved. As with other such groups, the and mentaUy handicapped person wtil and to require a professionaUsm within the Commonwealth Employment Service beyond that which women in may have been expected in the past. The Commonwealth Employment Service obviously will be successful only if its schemes receive support in from the community in general and the State and Federal governments specificaUy. This is an area in which the Federal Governthis ment, with the Commonwealth Employment Service's operation, virtuaUy has the field to itself. Its poUcies are the pacesetters. I note that the Minister said in his second reading speech Government does not want a monopoly in a the vacancy Ming business. I cannot see any they earthly reason why the Government should not in have a monopoly. Any agency that is providing a service of the level indicated by thefiguresgiven by the Minister in his second reading speechthe that is, in 1977 the Commonwealth Employment Service made over 1,200,000 referrals to vacancies and effected over 400,000 placements-is in a position to develop an expertise that would ingive it a position that I would regard as set being beneficial to the community. The great a advantage of building the expertise and the can efficiency of the Commonwealth Employment is that it wtil in fact in the long term save the Government money. I sincerely hope that the Government makes the investment necessary in thefirstplace in order to benefit in the long term. In addition to the various manpower poUcies on which the Government is silent we have also the very vexed question of the adrninistration of unemployment benefit. The Norgard Committee said in its report that no subject raised more comment than the role of the Commonwealth Employment Service in this aspect of the administration. All the peak labour councils were of the view that the role of the CES in this area should be abandoned. The role of the CES in the administration of the payment of unemployment benefit is a clear contradiction in terms of any agency established to promote and implement manpower pohcies. The Parliament is aware, of course, of the Government's attitude to the payment of unemployment benefit and all the rules that it has laid down in order to harass those eUgible to receive the benefit. The frequent visits to CES offices by unemployed people is not done in line with the objective of finding employment or to receive counselling of what employment may be available, but rather to remain eUgible to receive unemployment benefit. Such a practice obviously brings an agency into clear disrepute. The CES wtil continue to spend hours, days and even weeks coUecting and processing information which is of no earthly use to its main objective of placing people in employment. This Bill neither aUows total withdrawal of the CES from this area nor gives it total responsiof biUty. The grey area remains. There appears be no attempt by the Government to heed the advice of the Norgard Committee. The Norgard fore Committee said in paragraph 2.35 of its report: Briefly, the procedure would be that people wishing claim unemployment benefit should berequiredto register with the CES. As a matter of preference, the Review would not wish to have the CES issue,receiveor check Department of Social Security benefit claim forms, but recognises CES ought, as a community service, have the necessary forms available. The claim form would be endorsed by the CES to the effect that the person was registered for employment and passed to the Department of Social Security. Thereafter the CES would take no pan in the benefit cedure except to inform the Department of Social Security that the person was no longer registered or toreporton satisfactory atutudes to employment . . . Should a person appeal against withdrawal of benefit as aresultof report from the CES the Review would hope that the would be called upon to speak at the appeal hearing. There is no explanation in the Minister's ond reading speech for ignoring the information that was given to the committee of inquiry. Those union and association representatives speaking on behalf of the employees in the Commonexamples wealth Employment Service have made their quite views quite clear. One gets the distinct pression that the departmental bureaucracy loathe to adopt any of the suggestions put forward by the Norgard committee. There is one final matter, apart from points that wtil be raised from this side of House, that I wish to mention. This, I believe, throws up the problem of an agency being asked to implement a plan for which the Government has no poticy. I refer here to the much discussed early retirement arguments. The Government gives no lead on this matter at aU. There are many people in our community who believe that an early retirement plan would help to overcome the high rate of unemployment amongst the young people. The Labor Party as yet is not committed to any such plan but we are committed to having the Parliament discuss these matters, and it goes without saying that the National Director of the Commonwealth Employment Service and his Advisory Council will obviously come up against this argument. The mandatory retiring age of 65 years for men and 60 years for women is a social rule that we inherited but have never questioned. The changes in the expected Ufe span or our standard of Uving or the demographic changes taking place in our society have failed to rouse the Government even to the extent of having a Parliamentary debate on this matter. But now, quite rightly, people say why 65? Some countries with a more purposeful social conscience than the present Government have aflexibleretiring age between 60 and 70 years of age. Others have to made arrangements whereby part pensions can be paid for those opting out of the workforce be65. At least one country permits early retirement on full pension provided that person is to replaced in employment by an under 30 year old. This is a question that we have to look at closely. The ratio between those at work and those rethat the ceiving social security payments plays an important part, of course, in this debate. In the United Kingdom where in 1977 some $80m was made avaUable in making early retireproments available in areas of high unemployment unit was found that the majority of people who utilised this facility were in fact already unema ployed. So that now a growing number of counCES tries grant early retirement to persons approaching retirement age who have been involuntarily secunemployed for a specified period of time. The idea recognises the problem of older workers who find it especiaUy difficult because of age or health to become re-employed. In contrast to the given, the United States of America recently as a result of considerable lobbyiming from age groups such as 'Grey Power' exis tended the retirement age to 70 years. But just as the Government would have to lay down the guidelines in order for the newly estabother Ushed Commonwealth Employment Service to the successfully implement the plan, so also would the Government have to think seriously about preparing people for retirement. It has now become a practice of several large companies overseas to allow people approaching the retiring age to gradually work a snorter and shorter working week, so that the process of utilising their spare time commences perhaps two years before they reach the mandatory retirement age. These matters should be discussed in the Parhament. Atutudes should be adopted by the Government if the role of the Commonwealth Employment Service is to be successful. The present Bill before the House, although as I said it is marginally better than the old one set up by the Commonwealth Employment Service, will not, in our opinion, be able to fulfil the objectives set down for it without positive Government policy. Accordingly, I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view stituting the following words: 'whilst not opposing the second reading, the House the opinion that the Commonwealth Employment Service as envisaged under this legislation would be grossly equate as a vehicle for an effective manpower policy'.",67
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Is the amendment seconded? Mr West-Yes . I second the amendment.,73
116,Mr FALCONER,PAIRS,"The House is debating the Commonwealth Employment Service Bill 1978 and an associated amendment to the Re-establishment and Employment Amendment Bill. There is a clear need for updated and streamlined legislation of this kind. As the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) pointed out, the existing legislative basis for the Commonwealth Employment Service is to be found in the Re-establishment and Employment Act 1945. That Act was designed to implement policies for reestablishing discharged servicemen and service women and for resettling workers displaced as a result of an economy changing from a war-time footing to a peace-time consumer economy. Let me state at the outset that the CES, in my experience, does a very good job in very difficult circumstances. I am sure that all honourable members who have had some contact with their local CES offices will agree that the CES does a good job in dealing with individual problems. I can assure the Minister that the reason he does not get many representations from me these days on individual problems concerning the CES is that they are all settled directly between my office and the local CES offices concerned. However, even dedicated CES officers would agree that the structure of the Service and its confusion of roles renders it unable to cope with the expanded range of training schemes and other manpower programs given to it by successive governments and also with the enlarged expectations of the pubhc. There is a need for an identifiable management structure in the Commonwealth Employment Service. Presently the management responsibilities and the lines of communication are spread through various people in the CES and in the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. Sometimes it can be hard for a person dealing with the CES to find out who is ultimately responsible for some aspect of administration. I have in mind a case of a constituent of mine, a person who runs a small business, who discovered recently that he had been blacklisted by the CES because he allegedly had misused its services. He felt that this was due to a misunderto sub- standing and asked the local office to whom he should speak in the CES or the Department in is of order to explain his actions. No one seemed to inad- know just quite who was the appropriate person to whom he should speak. He contacted me and after I had made some inquiries of the Minister's office I referred him to a senior officer in the regional office of the Department in Victoria who very rapidly settled the matter to the satisfaction of all. I am pleased therefore that the Bill now before us establishes the office of National Director of the Service. The first requirement for a clearly defined management structure is the appointment of one person who bears managerial responsibility for the organisation and who will then set up in turn proper reporting relationships up and down the line with subordinate officers held accountable for their separate functions. Ultimate responsibihty which is diffused throughout a departmental bureaucracy is no responsibihty at all. That does not reflect adversely on any officer of the Department or the CES who has any administrative and management responsibihty at present. To my mind this was the purpose of Norgard in recommending that the Commonwealth Employment Service should be re-estabhshed as a statutory authority. I beheve that the Government was wise not to proceed with the recommendation. We have had a problem in the past with the proliferation of statutory boards and commissions each taking elements of policy making out of the hands of government. Unless there is a clear need for a statutory authority, I do not beheve that governments should set them up at will. I believe that the Government has in fact picked up the main purposes of that recommendation, one of them being the need for a clear management structure, and has done it in a way which avoids taking responsibihty for pohcy formulation out of the hands of government I turn now to a remark which the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations made in his second reading speech relating to the International Labour Organisation obhgations. He said: . . . the Government does not intend the CES to have a monopoly of the vacancy-filling business. Private and informal contacts, newspaper advertising and recruiting agencies all play a significant role the Government in accordance with International Labour Organisauon obligauons is committed to providing a national and comprehensive manpower service. I think all of us on this side of the House are indebted to the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) for once again spelling out the socialist objectives of the ALP. Of course he advocated that the Commonwealth Employment Service ought to have a monopoly of the vacancy filling business. I want to expand a Uttle on why that should not be so and why indeed there is great benefit to aU-to employers, the unemployed and others seeking jobs, and to the economy as a whole-if there are other agencies operating in that area and providing competition. In the Minister's second reading speech to which I referred, I take it that he was referring to Convention No. 88 of the International Labour Organisation concerning the organisation of the employment service adopted by the General Conference of the ILO in 1948 and which Australia has ratified. Article I of that Convention provides that each member of the ILO shaU maintain a free pubUc employment service but it goes on to say that such a service should cooperate where necessary with other pubhc and private bodies concerned. The honourable member for Port Adelaide clearly spelt out the socialist pohcy when he advocated that the Commonwealth Employment Service should have a monopoly on vacancy filling. I believe that, rather than the Commonwealth Employment Service having a monopoly, there ought to be cooperation between it and private agencies and consultancies in the field. I shaU discuss the areas of co-operation between the Commonwealth Employment Service and private employment agencies. Indications given to me suggest that some Commonwealth Employment Service standoffish and suspicious of any dealings with private agencies. For example, it has been . . . reported to me that on occasions when a private any agency has advertised a vacancy on behalf of an sess anonymous chent company-the cUent has not community . . . been mentioned in the advertisement- a Commonwealth Employment Service officer has telephoned the agency to inquire about the identity of the chent company so that the Commonwealth Employment Service office can refer likely candidates on its files direcdy to the company. The private agency, understandably, usually takes the attitude that candidates should be referred to it for assessment and possible inclusion in the short list presented to its cUent. Apparently, the Commonwealth Employment Service takes the attitude that for it to co-operate in local labour markets. However, with an agency which obtains a fee for its part of the service to the chent would be contrary to the ILO obUgation to provide a free employment service. This is surely an unduly restrictive interpretation of our ILO obhgations. If a reference by the Commonwealth Employment Service to a private agency can possibly lead to a better or an earher matching of a job seeker with an existing vacancy that is surely to be encouraged. For a private agency to obtain a fee for its work of advertising on behalf of a cUent, appraising appticants and preparing written reports in greater detaU than the Commonwealth Employment Service is likely to do surely does not involve any breach of Australia's obligation to maintain a free national employment service. Job seekers and employers alike are free to approach the Commonwealth Employment Service at no cost to themselves but, if an employer prefers to buy the expertise andtimeof a private agency, that is a legitimate management decision which is made on the basis of the benefits avaUable in return for the cost involved. I am sure that the purpose of Convention No. 88 was to ensure that job seekers were not exploited by being required to pay a fee or commission in order to obtain a job. The fees for normal private agency services are, in fact, paid by the employers, not by the job seekers. The operations of a national employment service on the one hand and private agencies on the other are largely complementary in my view rather than competitive. I shall refer to some of the functions of the Commonwealth Employment Service set out in clause 6 of the Bill and make some comments on them. The first function of the Commonwealth Employment Service will sound very officers are famtiiartous.lt is: to assist persons seeking employment or a change of employment to obtain suitable positions having regard to experience, abilities, training or qualifications they posand to the economic and other needs of the Australian Clause 6 goes on to spell out some particular categories of persons for whom special arrangements should be made such as immigrants, Aboriginals, the young and the handicapped. It also spells out the need to provide various persons with vocadonal guidance services. Generally, finding jobs for people is understood to be the main function of the Commonwealth Employment Service. The contrast with most private agencies is that they find people for jobs. The starting point of a private agency is to fill a vacancy which has been referred to it by a client who will bear the cost of searching for someone to fill that particular vacancy. The function of the Commonwealth Employment Service is to look at the needs of the job seekers and try tofindjobs to service them. Of course, there has to be an overlap, but there is that major difference between the starting point for a national employment service concerned with overall employment matters and the function of a private agency. In that respect there is no real competition of a direct kind between a national employment service and private agencies. Their activities are complementary. The Bill goes to spell out another function of the CES, namely: To assist employers and intended employers wishing vacant positions of employment to fill them with persons who are suitable for the performance of the of, and who meet the employer's or intended employer's requirements for, the positions; . . . That is where some conflict can exist with private agencies. It does not necessarily exist because private agencies do provide additional services for which employers are prepared to pay a fee. It could be expertise in advertising, in interviewing, in dealing with certain categories of staff, administering tests of a psychological nature such as aptitude tests and personality profiles, and writing reports. Some fear does exist on the part of private agencies that CES could be beefed up to compete directly with them in this area. If no comprehensive service is available a particular region from private agencies, I think it is legitimate that the Commonwealth Employthe ment Seivice should move into fill the gap. But if agencies are available to whom employers can turn, surely it is a good thing that there should be is: competition between those agencies. After all, to they have to justify their fees to their chents and it is a good thing if the chent compames are able 1947 to pick and choose, if they are able to tell cies where they are falling down. If they are ing down in a very bad way they wtil go out business as a result. I do not think that that natural check and balance in the system is to decried. The Bill then goes on to spell out the next function of the CES, namely: to promote and implement approved manpower programs and other measures designed to ensure a high level of employment in the community. That is where a national employment service does have a role to play. It is not a role that can be played to a major extent by private agencies. Nonetheless, there is available in staff working in private employment agencies a large body of people who could be used by the Commonwealth Employment Service as public relations officers or information officers for the various training and manpower programs that exist and that any government might implement in the future. I beheve that that is where co-operation can be improved, not in a way that would transfer any funds to the private agencies but simply in a way that would make better use of people who run private agencies. They could be informed properly of the schemes that exist and in turn they could inform chents and job seekers with whom they are dealing of the existence and availabtiity of those schemes. With respect to the Commonwealth Employment Service, I believe that in this area many CES officers do need a higher degree of training and experience than they have received in the to fill past in order to administer the programs. One available complaint I have heard from employers who duties have dealt with CES is that in many of the CES offices there is not sufficient continuity of service of particular officers who have been dealing with the training schemes. The employer has had to go along at regular intervals to different officers who are doing a tour of duty in the local CES office and explain his needs and his case over and over again. I have had a similar complaint from in some job seekers who have had dealings with a particular CES office over a period of time. I simply make that comment because it is an area of concern. I believe that to a large extent the problem is being overcome. Certainly in recent months I have had reports from the people who in initially complained to me that the position has improved with respect to continuity of service of CES officers with whom they had dealings. The next function of the CES Usted in the Bill register persons who are unemployed and who wish to claim unemployment benefits under the Social Services Act and to provide assistance in seeking employment for agenpersons claiming or receiving such benefits; fallI believe this is where the Government needs to of speU out further the real role of the Commonsort of wealth Employment Service in the administrabe tion of unemployment benefits. I agree that officers of the CES are in a most invidious position if on the one hand they are required to be professional job placement officers helping job seekers to find satisfactory employment but on the other hand they are in a posidon where they are seen by the job seekers as playing the role of policeman to apply the work test to them in order to deterrnine their eligibihty for unemployment benefits. I must admit that I should not like to be in that posidon myself. I accept the real objection that many Commonwealth Employment Service officers have to the invidious position in which they find themselves. There is no doubt in my mind that their principal purpose in that respect is to find jobs for the job seekers who come to them asking for assistance. They must not be in a position where job seekers lack confidence in the officers with whom they are dealing. The next function is: to publish information inrespectof the labour market or the service relating to employment provided by the Service, or otherwise by the Commonwealth, or, with the consent relevant State, by a State; The Ust of duties in clause 6 goes on to the coUection of statistics and other information relating to the labour market. The vatidity and accuracy of the figures provided by the ComIllawarra monwealth Employment Service is an area that this has provided much debate in recent years. Indeed, an advisory committee on Commonthan wealth Employment Service statistics was set up in 1973. It reported on some of the problems involved in the method by which the CES colThe lected statistics and the use to which they were put. The Norgard report comments to some extent on the problems involved. I beheve that grim. there is again a conflict in roles which ought to be pointed to here. If officers of the CES are to be involved primarily in the placing of people in suitable employment, it may well be that at times when they have a peak of activity of that type they do not have the time to collect the statistics to do aU the administrative procedures such lapsing people from the rolls who have found employment through other means that would be seek needed in order to ensure accurate statistics general nature. Therefore, I believe that it is propriate for the Bureau of Statistics to take the main role of the coUection and pubUcation accurate overaU employment statistics and that the Commonwealth Employment Service should concentrate very much on working statistics, erational statistics, that help it to do its job to concentrate on finding out the numbers and categories and areas of people unemployed the types of vacancies available in various so that it has better statistical tools to help match jobs to the vacancies. I commend the Bill to the House.",73
117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Martin) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,76
118,Mr WEST,PAIRS,"The Commonwealth Employment Service Bill 1978 is to restructure the adrninistration of the Commonwealth Employment Service. It must necessarily be about employment opportunity-perhap s more succinctly, about unemployment. I say at the outset that unemployment, currently running nationally at 410,000, is completely unacceptable for any civUised society. It is being exacerbated by the deflationary economic policies of this Government and its faUure to implement adequate retraining, manpower and immigration poUcies. In my electorate there are currently unemployed over 9,000 people or 11 per cent of the work force. The worse feature, of course, is unemployment amongst young people, of the particularly semi-skilled females. There are currently 1,200 young girls unemployed and seeking some 23 registered vacancies with the mention CES in Wollongong. In case honourable members think I am exaggerating I refer them to a report which appeared on 11 April 1978 in the Daily Mercury-wha t is contained in report is typical of what is happening all over the country-and which described how more 100 girls answered one advertisement for a junior girl between IS and 16 years of age at the Uniset Boutique in Crown Street, WoUongong. advertisement asked interested girls to apply at 10 a.m., and by 9.30 a.m. 100 girls had arrived at the boutique. Future prospects are indeed At least 200,000 university graduates and school leaves wtil seek jobs every year over the nextfiveyears. The number of incoming migrant job seekers currently runs at over 50,000 a year. In addition to that, we can expect 200,000 as women, who are not now in full-time education and who are not presently in the work force, to work in that period. After allowing for resigof a nations, retirements and deaths we would need apto create at least 900,000 new jobs over the next over five years just to prevent unemployment from of getting worse. This would mean that the civilian workforcewould have to increase by 3.9 per cent a year. Over the last three years the compound oppercentage change in employment has been better, negative; it has been minus 0.4 per cent. During the 1970s growth in labour demand and was unable to cater for even a one per cent areas annual increase in the work force without it increasing the unemployment rate. The number of persons employed in the manufacturing industry has declined from 1,294,000 in 1971 to 1,145,000 by the end of 1977. Civilians employed by private enterprise fell in number from 3.32 million to 3.24 million in the same period. During the period of the Fraser Government's administradon, the number of government civilian employees rose from 1.34 million to 1.5 million. This simply means that, despite the rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) about transferring resources to the private sector, it has simply not occurred. We would be in even deeper recession if government employment had not slighdy expanded. It is the manufacturing, the construcdon, the textile, the footwear and the clothing industries which show the real decline in the labour force. Only the areas of retail trade, community services, and entertainment in the tertiary sector show any real expansion. Employment in the mining sector has increased from 75,500 to 79,000 in the last six years, but this represents only 1.6 per cent of our work force. They produce some $3 billion worth of exports, not to mention the value of their production consumed Austraha. Much has been said about the so-called Gregory thesis, namely, that imports of vice manufactured goods rise as a result of increased export earnings and that this wipes out Austrahan manufacturing industry. Perhaps this argument is over-simplistic in the situation of increasing capital outflow. There is no denying that, if 79,000 employees in mining provide billion worth of export earnings which may result in imports of equal worth, the important factor the extent to which the number of jobs wiped in Austraha exceeds the number ofjobs provided in mining. There is a multipUcity of reasons for the present massive level of unemployment. All those reasons are related to the failure of capitalNorgard ism to use improved technology in the interests of people and workers. This Government's oband session with reducing inflation by cutting real wages and by cutting government expenditure ment has resulted in the consumer power of Australian wage and salary earners being savagely slashed. Accordingly, Australian manufacturing industry has suffered dearly. The major faUure of capitalprovision ist economic pohcy-to create new employment - derive s from its total inability to accept that replacement of labour by technology must in unemployment unless corresponding adjustments in the form of shorter working hours and improved conditions, including earUer optional aspect retirement for workers, are implemented. Howsaid, ever, the fact is that this Government's and, indeed, the economic poUcies of the capitalist world generaUy, have been unsuccessful in producing so-caUed manpower poUcies which would result in a real redistribution of work opportunities. We may need manpower pohcies, but more than that we need deUberate poUcies of government and industry to create new jobs. This means and must mean increased government spending on housing, transport, local government employment schemes and State pubUc works. It means introducing a resource tax to stem the haemorrhage of some $900m a year of capital outflow, caused in the main by repatriation of the profits of rnining compames. Then, and only then, may it be possible to direct profits from the exportation of non-renewable resources to the task of modernising Australian industry. Only then may it be possible to reduce tariff protection against imported goods. In his second reading speech the Minister for in Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) indicated that the Bill was the Government's attempt to effect changes in the organisation of the Commonwealth Employment Serby introducing appropriate legislation. The Minister indicated that the changes followed an jobs in examination of recommendations in the Norgard Committee's report. The report urges the creation of the CES as an independent statutory authority which is a proposal to which I am $3 utterly opposed. Fancy handing over the unemployed to the tender mercy of the bureaucrats! is No government should be allowed to delegate its out responsibUity for the unemployed to a possibly insensitive and unresponsive bureaucracy. The Government's response to the report is the creation of a semi-independent, quasistatutory authority, with obscure Unes of communication, information and responsibiUty. The Committee's report states that the CES is operating without clear objectives or priorities that its Umited resources are pretty thinly spread across a multitude of tasks. The Govern's response to this is a Bill which estabUshes no real priorities, which merely describes the functions already being performed by the CES and which makes nofinancialcommitment to the of additional resources other than the appointment of a national director, which may the be desirable but which is nevertheless a token reresult sponse to an urgent national problem. I draw the attention of the House to one other of this Bill. That is clause 6 (c), which, it is will encourage the CES to 'promote and impoUcy, plement approved manpower programs and other measures designed to ensure a high level of employment in the community'. In my opening remarks I referred to the changing structure of Austrahan industry. Whilst there is little doubt that some of the unemployment in this country has resulted from a structural imbalance, that is, the mismatching of available skills with available job opportunities, the principal cause of unemployment stems directly from the failure of government economic pohcy. The stark fact is that there are 410,000 unemployed and only 19,500 vacancies. Even if manpower programs matched every single vacancy there would still be 390,000 persons unemployed. Directing the CES to implement improved manpower planning programs without any clear overall objectives will not create jobs. Only a change in government economic policy will do that. In introducing the Re-establishment and Employment Act of 1945, which created the Commonwealth Employment Service, the then Labor Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Development, Mr J. J. Dedman stated: First among the Government's objectives is the maintenthe ance of a high and stable level of employment To achieve the objecdve, measures must be devised to ensure that, at any ume, more potential jobs exist than the number of people seeking them and that, as far as possible, ment must be of the right kind, and in therightplace. That was the Labor Government's pohcy 33 years ago. It ought to be the pohcy of this Government now. I shall examine the deficienwork cies in the present Commonwealth Employment Service Relief schemes. All claimants for unemthe ployment relief must pass the work test. The fourth section of the so-called work most controversial. It states: Not making an effort to obtain employment on his or her own behalf. This controversial test is obviously being incoremployed rectly applied. Mainly, it is the Department of Social Security which makes the inspection and determination through its investigating officers. Honourable members will recall that last parents October the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) ordered a major survey of recipients of relief. Subsequently, there were reports that 30,000 people were briefly removed from benefit entitiement and then readmitted. Logically, this must mean that they were incorrectly harassed and inconvenienced. Why did the investigation not occur and then, if necessary, action taken, stead ofhaving this over-zealous behaviour? The truth is that the unemployed are helpless and organised, and at the mercy of the bureaucrats the Department of Social Security. In my electorate during this survey individuals were ordered by inspectors to produce written evidence that they were seeking work daily. This smacks of the old Depression mentality which was: Force people to use their already meagre revenues searching for work which does not exist. I refer to the enforced tramps of the 1930s and the attempts in the United Kingdom in 1931 to force people to walk up to 15 miles a day seeking prospective employers. Does the Minister for Social Security really believe that such excesses will create one single extra job in Australia? If demanding that the unemployed seek work on a daily basis creates work, it means that employers who have jobs available are not engaging labour. If this were true the employers should be criticised for not doing so. The Commonwealth Employment Service is involved in a number of amelioraty schemes. It seems unbelievable, as the Norgard report states: When programs arrive there is invariably a delay of several months before staff are reallocated for work related to the program. This means that existing staff have to cope with most difficult period of any program, the introductory stage. The review expressed dismay that staff received no special training for these employnew tasks. It seems incongruous that many Commonwealth Employment Service officers do not volunteer information to clients or employers about new or complex manpower programs because they have insufficient staff to handle the generated from these programs. Litde wonder then that, apart from the inefficiency of programs themselves, the administration and payment to beneficiaries under these schemes test is the border on the chaotic. I shall examine the Special Youth Employment Training Program. It subsidises employers up to $66 a week for six months to employ an unperson under 25 years of age who has been out of work for four months. Unfortunately, there are real contradictions in this program. On a number of occasions I have interviewed and school leavers who have suffered the disappointment of being referred by the Commonwealth Employment Service to a prospective employer only to be rejected when the employer found that, as a school leaver, they were not entitled to the Special Youth Employment Training Program pre-subsidy. In addition, there does not seem to be any demand that there be an overall innet increase in that employer's labour force before the subsidy is paid. Perhaps there is a very unstrong case to remove these qualifications of altogether and to adopt the idea which the Austrahan Labor Party put forward during the last election campaign of subsidising new employment only as long as there is a continuing crease in an employer's labour force. Another great anomaly appears in the National Employment and Training scheme which, of course, authorises training and living away allowances in addition to unemployment relief for selected applicants. Many school leavers who find themselves with no real employment prospects and who do not possess the Higher School Certificate feel-correctl y in my view-that they would be better employed in full time study to gain the Higher School Certificate rather than remaining idle. Yet the moment they return to school they are denied relief. Certainly a problem exists, and one knows that if they were paid the situation could be abused in regard to future school leavers. However, surely a competent Commonwealth Employment Service is capable of afinejudgment in these matters. In regard to the educational program for unemployed youth, which is administered under the National Employment and Training scheme, there is often a bureaucratic bungle which discourages further people from taking the six weeks course. Is there any reason why students under the program must be removed from the unemployment benefit and transferred to payment under the NEAT scheme, which sometimes results in lengthy delays in payments? Why not continue to pay benefits and reimburse the Department of Social Security from the NEAT scheme if necessary so that there is no disincentive to these young people as a result of the changeover. These schemes are only superficial. We in Opposition are looking for real manpower programs and, like the unemployed, we are most disappointed by their absence. Now that Government stands to gain from its tax avoidance legislation, let it re-introduce a local government employment scheme. My electorate benefited by $2.8m from Labor's Regional Emthe ployment Development scheme. Manyfinelocal amenities were created under that scheme which was introduced by the then Minister for Labor and Immigration, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron). At its peak the scheme was employing some 30,000 Austrahans who, of course, are now unemployed once more. In the few minutes still available to me I urge the Government to stop hounding the unemdid ployed, to stop labelling the unemployed and stop calling them dole bludgers. For a change, us see what we can do for the unemployed. Mr Ruddock- I have not heard that exnet in- pression used once, other than by you.",76
119,Mr WEST,PAIRS,"I have heard honourable members opposite use that expression in the electorates manytimes.I make four suggestions to the Minister. Firstly, the Government should immediately raise the level of permissible earnings to $20 a week in Une with the Umit for other pensioners and beneficiaries. Secondly, abolish the 7-day waiting period for the unemployment benefit. Thirdly, pay school leavers the unemployment benefit from the time they register for work and are avaUable to take work if offered it. They are entitled to it and it would help them find jobs at the end of the year. Fourthly, pay the unemployment benefit to persons whose benefit has been canceUed but who have appealed to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and are waiting for the appeal to be considered. They are entitled to receive the benefit until it is proved that they are not genuine work seekers. Often we hear the Metal Trades Industry Association asserting that in the middle of record postwar unemployment employers cannot obtain skilled metal tradesmen. As a result the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs attempts to fill the vacancies with imported labour while those migrants already in this country wait in vain for reunion with close relatives whose appUcations for migration have been knocked back by the Department. What we need is a subsidised apprenticeship scheme and real manpower programs to try to train our young workers of the future rather than relying on migrant workers coming here and then dropping them into slots when they become available. The Opposition gives qualified support to this Bill. the However, unless the Government takes positive action along the Unes suggested by the Opposition it is clear that we wtil face unemployment the of as yet undreamed of dimensions.",79
120,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS," Mr Deputy Speaker, as you will reatise from some of remarks that passed across the chamber, the speeches that we heard this afternoon from honourable members opposite on this important piece of legislation were, regrettably, negative and unduly carping. Quite frankly, I found them exceedingly disappointing. This is a positive piece of legislation, one that would have been well served by the Opposition's offering as an alternative positive and constructive proposals of their own, if they had them. But the legislation not deserve the sort of carping, negative critito cism that we heard here this afternoon. The purlet pose of the legislation is to update and upgrade the Commonwealth Employment Service. An effective and efficient Commonwealth Employment Service is required if we are to deal with some aspects of unemployment in our community. The Government has admitted that Government Ministers, speaking on the sorts of programs that the Government is pursuing in this area, have made it clear that they regard the upgrading of the Commonwealth Employment Service as an iniual and an integral part of the Government's program to overcome some of the problems that we have in our community as a result of massive unemployment. It occurred not just during the term of office of this Government; the great majority of it occurred as a result of the pohcies and approaches of the previous Government. It cannot be forgotten that it was the poUcies and initiatives of honourable members opposite that brought about the great bulk of unemployment in this community. The number of unemployed rose significantly during their term of office. There has been an increase in the number since then, and we regard it as regrettable, but the great mass of people in this country who became unemployed, became unemployed at that time. This legislation is positive. Its purpose is date and upgrade the Commonwealth Employfunctions ment Service, to enable it to carry out approved manpower functions, to implement programs functions and to promote them. It is a Bill which is to put aside the function that the service had initially 1945, to redeploy ex-servicemen. That is indication of the age of this authority and the way in which it has had to adapt increasingly to modern day needs. Certainly the sort of legispeculiarly lation that is proposed now is needed to give Service the twentieth century guideUnes that are so essential if it is to fulfil its functions. The Bill is a significant indication of the Government's commitment to overcome the high levels of unprograms. employment that we have in this community, cause we regard low levels of unemployment as essential. It is certainly a Bill which acknowlidentifying edges the width of the Service that we have seen grow in response to demands from the comand munity over the last 20 years or so. The organisation has the responsibiUty coUecting information on job opportunities, lating that information and placing people positions. In 1977 some 400,000 people were placed in positions through the Commonwealth Employment Service. It provides a system of registration of those who are available for seeking employment. It provides a vehicle by which labour market training can be pursued and for the adrninistration of the important programs that this Government has initiated. will deal with them later. It is important to note the programs that have been initiated by this Government and to compare them with the two programs that the previous Government initiated, one of which it put aside in its own term of office because it was found to be totally ineffective. In other words, the ratio of the Government's programs to those of the previous Government is 5 to 1. This Government has performed but, under the previous Government, performance was wanting. The specialist functions of the Commonwealth Employment Service also have to be acknowledged and I wtil spend sometimein my address referring to one of them. The Service provides programs for Aboriginals, handicapped persons, migrants, vocational guidance and occupation assistance. The CES also has responsibility for collecting information in relation to the number of people who receive the unemployment benefit. This legislation proposes to expand the role of the CES. It proposes to provide the organisation with leadership. The significant parts of this to uplegislation provide first for the establishment, and powers of the Commonwealth Employment Service and the widening of those and, secondly, for the appointment of a national director and staff for him. Whilst the in CES is to be part of the Department of Employan ment and Industrial Relations it will have national leadership as a result of the appointment of a national director, a person who will be responsible for giving it that sort of dithe rection that it needs to fulfil its tasks. The CES will have the responsibUities for promoting and implementing approved manpower FinaUy, it wtil have avaUable to it adbevisory committees which will be national, regional and local. These committees will assist in problems that the CES experienced not only at the national level but also at regional local levels. Norgard regarded these matters as being of great importance. This legislation does not seek to implement his recommenof dations which propose the estabhshment of a colseparate statutory authority. I note that the in honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), who led for the Opposition on this legislation, expressed doubts whether he would support the view that there ought to be a separate and and independent statutory corporation. I thought that the honourable member for Cunriingham (Mr West) in his very vitriolic adI dress about the PubUc Service-and it is easy to see that he does not have too many pubhc servants in Wollongong-mad e the point very clear that he would hold no brief for the Commonwealth Employment Service having a function within the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. It has to be acknowledged that Mr West- I said I would not support a statutory authority.",79
121,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"I heard the honourable member refer specifically to bureaucrats. If my understanding is correct, the approach taken by the honourable member was that bureaucrats would be incapable of implementing the sorts of manpower programs that the Government initiated. The fact of the matter isMr West-It is the responsibihty of the Parhament.",81
122,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"I beheve it should be responsible to the Parhament and I am pleased to hear the honourable member saying so because this is the very nature of the legislation. If that the case, I cannot understand the basis of the honourable member's criticism of thefinePubhc Service that we have in this community. The fact of the matter is that whilst one could always find imperfections and one could alwaysfinddifficult areas in relation to the implementation of government policy-w e have experienced some of these problems and I propose to refer to some of them in relation to our objective of implementing part of the Norgard report-the great bulk of people employed in our Public Service are veryfinepeople and are not deserving of the sort of criticism that we have heard from the honourable member for Cunningham. We have agreed that the Commonwealth Employment Service ought to be responsible to the Parhament. I am one who wholeheartedly supports that proposition. I might be in trouble with some of my colleagues if I refer to some of the statutory corporations that were created by the Opposition when it was in government and say that honourable members can well appreciate the reason why I might take this approach. We know the difficulties that honourable members have fromtimetotimein having representations heeded by Telecom Australia and Australia Post. Without the sorts of advantages that apply when one is dealing with a genuine private enterprise system, one can see there is good reason not to give up the power of the Parliament over the Public Service. It is important that there should be a proper reporting system to the Parliament as is envisaged by this legislation. Certainly I would not like to see an independent statutory corporation fulfilling these responsibilities. I beheve that members of Parhament have to be prepared to accept the results of whatever pohcies we pursue. We have to be prepared to articulate those policies. We have to be prepared to take the responsibihty for remedying those areas in which there are defects. I certainly agree that this legislation, in the form proposed by the Minister, is a proper approach having regard to the recommendations of the Norgard report. I want to take the opportunity to draw the attention of honourable members to some other aspects of the Norgard report that were not necessarily required to be implemented in a statutory form. The first section with which I wish to deal-Aborigina l employment-wa s mentioned in a positive way by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) and I commend him for doing so. The Norgard report emphasises the problem faced by Aboriginals who are seeking employment. It gives some statistics which I think all honourable members is would find quite disheartening. The number of Aboriginals registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service represents 30 per cent of the Aboriginal work force which is conservatively estimated at some 35,000 people. That is not a new problem; it has always been with us. I am not trying to run away from the nature of the problem having regard to the pace at which we can move because of changing attitudes. I refer not just to the wider community but to the attitudes of the Aboriginals themselves who are not in a traditional situation and have not lived in a traditional way. It is not possible, in my view, to change their background, their cultural values and their social and occupational factors at great speed. But it is important that we do as much as we can to assist in overcoming these marked problems. The report emphasised that just over 100 positions are available for vocational officers and assistant vocational officers. Generally speaking, the vocational officers and the assistant vocational officers I have met in this area are Aboriginals endeavouring to help their own people. They are endeavouring to change the approach to employment and to change the approach of employers to employing Aboriginals. I ask the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) to note some of the particular problems pointed up in this report. I am sure that he is giving the utmost attention to the implementation of these recommendations but I point them out once more. I refer to the specific recommendation that travel funds be increased to boost the outreach activities of the vocational officers and the assistant vocational officers. Another suggestion was that the vocational officers and the assistant vocational officers should be relieved of some of their clerical work and responsibilities and given greater administrative support. These seem to me to be very positive recommendations deserving the utmost support from the Parliament. The report also recommended that the staffing in the area which provides employment to Aboriginals should be increased substantially. I served on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs in the Parliament before last when it reported on special works projects. I was very impressed with the quaUty of work of the Aboriginal employment service within the Commonwealth Employment Service. I was particularly impressed with the dedication of the officers involved. I would like to see a firm commitment and resolve from us aU to give them the utmost support that can be given. I am sure that the Minister, knowing of these problems, has that very much in mind himself and would be pleased to know of the universal support of members of Parhament to encourage greater effort in this area and give those who work in the field greater opportunities. One of the aspects which we emphasised in the report on special works projects was the need for the Commonwealth Employment Service to also adopt a changed approach to the employment of Aboriginals with lesser qualifications than might be expected of people joiiting the Public Service. The very nature of die special works projects scheme was to fund employers, local government authorities and State government instrumentalities so that they would take into their service Aboriginals who would gain experience while employed. I am very pleased that of late the Government has accepted recommendations which now enable the Commonwealth to participate also in these sorts of schemes and to take people in at lower educational levels than would otherwise be the case in order to give them the opportunity to serve in a position and then to take their rightful place in the Public Service. I also want to support the suggestions and the recommendations on computerisation in the Commonwealth Employment Service. These initiatives are of the utmost importance. I think that computers wtil be essential to the labour intensive tasks such as the updating of records, which in itself is essential and in the Unking of information that is received in the CES. Such tasks have to be carried out in an efficient way. I know that the Government recognises this need. I think we have an important role to play in encouraging the G o v e r n m e n t to pursue these recommendations, and to pursue them as quickly as possible. Employees in the Commonwealth Employment Service must be made available to undertake the important tasks of interviewing people, assessing them and ensuring that they are able to be linked to the jobs that are available. The Minister emphasised the very substantial savings in taxpayers' funds that would be gained if the people who were available for employment were able to be linked to the jobs avaUable as soon as possible. These initiatives that the Government sees as being important are being pursued by this legislation. The next part I wish to deal with in the Norgard report is the initiatives taken by the Government already to recruit for the CES employment officers who have had practical and personal experience in industry. This was the subject of some industrial disputes a Uttle earUer in the piece. In this House I supported very strongly the Government's initiatives in getting into the Commonwealth Employment Service those people who would bring their wider experience into that area. I made that point very strongly in my speech at thetimebecause I saw it as being an important part of the Government's program in relation to updating the CES. But I want to point out that that is no criticism of the people who are at present employed in the Commonwealth Employment Service. There is no doubt in my mind about the dedication of the employees of the Government who work that Service. I have seen the sort of work that they do. For example, in my electorate, I am very familiar with the work undertaken by the Commonwealth Employment Service office in Parramatta. More recendy, I have been very impressed with the activities of the Commonwealth Employment Service office in Ryde. Itinkthose activities particularly to the Government's initiatives in relation to the Commumty Youth Support scheme. It is in that area that one is able to assess the personal qualities of the officers involved. They are prepared to give of their own time to participate in this important program of the Government to ensure that it works. There is a place for these new employees that the Government needs for the scheme to work, but this in no way should be taken as criticism of those who are presently involved in the Commonwealth Employment Service. I have stressed in my address the positive nature of the Government's initiatives. I think that is the very important part of this Bill and of this debate. But the occasion ought not to pass without there being some cognisance of the negative criticism of the Opposition. I wish to make it very clear to honourable members opposite that we have not forgotten the very little that was done by them in relation to overcoming the manpower problems that emerged during their term of office. The only scheme initiated by the Labor Government which has remained is the National Employment and Training scheme. The Regional Employment Development scheme about which the honourable member for Cunningham spoke this afternoon was scrapped by the Labor Party in office. It was found to be wantonly deficient and the Labor Party itself recognised that. Since then we have seen the modification of that NEAT scheme because we have ensured that it is not just a scheme to put people into pensive university-style courses, but actually to get people into employment where they receive practical training in areas in which they will tinue to be employed. We have also initiated the Special Youth Employment Training Program- a very important initiative. We initiated the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Trairting scheme. I have already mentioned the Community Youth Support scheme which was also an initiative of this Government. It also initiated the education program for unemployed youth and the relocation assistance scheme. The funding of the National Employment and Training scheme has risen from the 1976-77 appropriation of $36m to the appropriation for this year, 1977-78, of $8Sm.",81
123,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,83
124,Dr BLEWETT,PAIRS,"One would have thought that even the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) would have learned a certain degree of humility from tractable economic experience of his ment after 2Vi years not to have made the easy . glib reference that somehow this is a problem lied stemming from the administration of the Labor investment Government. One would have thought that litde improvement Government supporters would have reahsed now that the economic malaise that gripped the Western world in the middle 1970s, and enough. engulfed the Labor Government, was something which is not easy to correct and is not simple cause. I think most of us are now fairly tired the glib explanation that it derived simply from the Labor Government. Indeed, I think it is necessary to remind the Government of just points. It was elected to power in December on the promise that within three years it would provide employment for all those people in this countiy who wanted it. It is true that there are still six months left out of that three-year period but the Government certainly will not fulfil that promise. Secondly, the Government needs to be reminded that it has been under its administration that we have had the highest unemployment ever. I think it is important to recognise that the figure of 410,000 Australians now in unemployment is higher in absolute numbers than even at the depths of the Great Depression of 1929-34. Of course, the proportion now is certainly smaUer but the absolute figure is greater. It suggests the dimension of the problem which we are now facing and with which I presume these measures are intended to deal. Let me now turn to the Commonwealth Emexployment Service Bill 1978. As I think everyone is agreed that anything would be better than the present Commonwealth Employment Service, conwe must of necessity welcome this Bill. As Mr Norgard argued, the CES was a 1946 model organisation trying to cope with 1977 style problems. Let us be under notilusionthat in this Bill the Government is providing a 1977 style organisation to cope with 1977 style problems; it is not. The Government in this Bill is providing simply a face lift for the CES. It is in fact a minimal solution to the maximal problems that this society faces. I argued in a debate yesterday that it is becoming increasingly difficult to understand why anybody bothers to write reports for this Government. I said that the Asprey report, the most comprehensive report on taxation since 1945, recommended the reform but retention of death duties. We know what happened to death duties yesterday under this Government. SimUarly, I believe that this Bill is in no way, as the honourable member for Dundas argued, an appropriate response to the Norgard report. the inLet me quote what Norgard wanted from reGovernforms of the CES. The report states: . . that the CES must provide an improved service and an undertaking to support and strengthen the CES and its almanpower activides. Without the polidcal will and the of resources to make up for years of neglect, very can be expected or achieved. Lip service by and token acdon will not be good enough. Lip service and token action wtil not be good Unfortunately in many ways this Bill is Up service and token action. The provisions of in the Bill follows the departmental submissions to of Norgard rather more than they do the conclusions of the Norgard report. Norgard rejected expticitly the proposal in this Bill to reorganise two the CES within the Department of Employment 1975 and Industrial Relations. Secondly, Norgard recommended a far wider set of functions for the CES than are envisaged in this timid Bill. Thirdly, Norgard recommended that the CES should be given responsibihty to devise manpower programs to relieve labour market ills. This Bill permits the Commonwealth Employment Service only to 'promote and implement approved manpower programs'. Honourable members should note those words. In other words, the manpower policies will come from elsewhere. The notion of devising manpower poUcies as recommended by Norgard has been dehberately cut out of the Bill. I think the words I quoted are significant; we may hear an interesting explanation of them from the Minister later. I refer next to the relationship between CES and unemployment and quote from another reences port which was written for this Government but equaUy taken no notice of, namely, the report the Inquiry into Unemployment Benefit PoUcy and Administration-the Myers report. Myers recommended: That new administrative arrangements be devised so that the CES participation in the administrative process is reduced, and a more active and more public role is taken by DSS in the delivery of income suppon to the unemployed. Norgard foUowed that up by making much the same recommendation on this. He argued that: . . . a start of the implementation of the new unemployment benefit procedure outlined by the working party, whereby CES involvement in unemployment benefit matters is minimised, should be made as soon as possible. They are four major features of the Bill which run starkly counter to Norgard's suggestions. It does seem to me that these inadequacies in this Bill, in relation to the Norgard report, are symptomatic of a total lack of a manpower pohcy- a total lack of any idea of how such a pohcy could be organisationally implemented in this country. Even if we accept the dubious thesis of the Government that curing inflation will reduce unemployment- a theory which still seems to be contradicted by facts-reducin g the rate of inflation wtil not solve the problems of structural unemployment, which are clearly growing in this economy. What answer has the Government to the problem of the over 50-year-olds who are cast out of the work force by structural changes and whose long-range prospects for future employment now appear bleak? What responses other than temporary band-aids, well Ulustrated by the honourable member for Dundas, has the Government to structural youth unemployment? Indeed, it seems clear that unless we have long-term poUcies in this field, even if the inflation problem is cured a distinct residue of youth unemployment wtil remain in our society. Again, what about the problem of the long-term unemployed and unemployable people, who are the features of any prolonged economic malaise such as we are now passing through? We have urged upon this Government a positive manpower pohcy to face whatever long-term problems we fear confront this economy. We have been met with minimal ad hoc responses. We asked that this House take up the challenge of this major problem by setting up a committee to look at the problems of structural unemployment. That too was rejected by the Government. I think that for anyone who has any pride in his country one of the most distilusioning experiis to read the contemporarytiteratureand to see how neghgent this country is in innovative of responses to the chaUenge of structural unemployment. Indeed, Australia is scarcely mentioned in any of the international Uterature because it exercises very little imagination whatsoever in this field. I take one field with which I am relatively familiar-namely , youth unemployment-and refer briefly to some of the innovative responses being made overseas. One answer is directly to create jobs for young people in the public sector through public works programs, as is being done in Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and the United States, but not of course in Australia. Going even further another answer is the actual creation of jobs within the PubUc Service. At least these experiments are being made. Jobs are being created, with young people being given priority in the pubhc sector. In Canada, France, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States employment for young people is being created by local communities. Work is now being done in the Scandinavian countries to try to solve some of the problems of the transition from education to work by a parttimepattern of work in education between the ages of 15 and 17. The point already raised by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) about a flexible retirement scheme, as is operating in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Norway, Spain, Sweden but not Austraha, again will help to solve one of the problems at the other end, that is youth unemployment. Unless we begin to organise, not in the minimal way that we have been doing to date but with some vision and imagination, we wtil have these problems with us for a long time. In order to face up to those problems, we need an effective manpower organisation. I return again to the Bill in relation to those sorts of criticisms. I want only to make two major points in this regard. They are points to which I have already referred but which I should like to follow up. One is the point that the CES should actually devise manpower policies, as is suggested by the Norgard Committee. It does seem that the Bill deliberately denies the CES thisright,although I would like to be assured by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) that my interpretation of clause 6 (c), which refers to promoting and implementing approved manpower programs, also includes the notion of creating manpower programs. I am not sure where else we are going to get them created. Obviously, a revamped CES is the best place for this creation to take place. I want to look also at the problem of the reto lationship of the CES to the Department of Social Security in relation to the payment of employment benefit. I would have thought that there is now near universal agreement-at least there is agreement in all the reports that the Government has had-that we have an excessthing ively complex, cumbersome and duplicatory tem involving, in an unnecessary way, both the CES and the Department of Social Security. of all, the unemployed have to register with the CES. The work test administration, though not the work test judgment, is made by the CES. The claim forms have to go to the CES, which then forwards them to the Department of Social Setem curity. The income statements have to be handed in each fortnight to the CES and then they have to be passed across to the Department of Social Security. We have an incredibly complex reaucratic, and above all, negative apparatus. many parts of Australia the CES is known as 'Commonwealth Unemployment Service' happy simply because it has got this negative image from its deep involvement with the Department of Social Security over the paying of unemployprovides ment benefit. I would have thought a minimal reform that even this Government is capable of carrying would be to follow through the Norgard Committee's report and reduce or do away completely with CES involvement in the unemploymonwealth ment benefit program or, if that is not possiblethe Norgard Committee recognised that it might not be impossible-at least require only from the CES the initial registration with the CES leave the unemployment benefit process in hands of the Department of Social Security. conclusion, we have before us a Bill which is an appropriate response to the Norgard Comflow mittee's proposals. It is better than nothing but is not the sort of thing this country should expect as a major response in a period in which the absolute number of unemployed is greater than at anytimein this society.",83
125,Mr CORBETT,PAIRS,"As has been said by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street), these Bills are designed to give legislative expression to the Commonwealth Government's commitment to upgrade the Commonwealth Employment Service. It is important that there should be change in the CES. This is recognised by the Government. The honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) drew attention to the fact that a system designed in 1946 is trying to cope with the problems and difficulties that exist in the area of employment in 1978.1 know that it is very easy criticise someone else for not doing something, but I think it is worth reminding the Parliament unthat during the three years in which the Labor Government was in office it persisted with the 1946 system in regard to the CES. It had the opportunity during its term of office to do someabout it. Criticism has been levelled at this sysGovernment about the advantage to be derived from calling forreports.I wonder what reports First that Government called for. I believe that members of the Austrahan Labor Party who now are so critical of this sysmight at least have found the time within the framework of their legislative timetable when they were in office to introduce legislation which might have been of advantage to the community buat large. Certainly, Liberal and National In Country Party governments used this system for the a longtimewhen they were in office. I am quite to concede that point. There is one factor which must be taken into consideration in relation to the criticism of this report. Indeed, it some answer to why we were perhaps able to live with this system up until thetimethat the Labor Government came to office. I refer to the fact that when we were in power, there was a out great deal of stability in the economy. The urgent need for a revision of our ComEmployment Service and the great tragedy of the extent of unemployment which exists today and which we as a government are finding it difficult to cope with have arisen as a and result of the galloping inflation that acthe companied and was brought about by the poliIn cies of the Labor Government during the time it not was in office. Many difficulties and problems from inflation. When labour costsriseat the it rapid rate they rose during the years of the Labor Government there is a great incentive to introduce labour saving devices into tries. With this increasing tendency, it can be seen that inflation in itself and the problem that it creates in industry is accenuated. I will not elaborate further on that point but there are many other factors which I could mention. I beheve that while we may not have done great deal to improve the structure of the Comment monwealth Employment Service during our earher years in office and perhaps it has taken a couple of years to make these changes, the need for them was not nearly so great. But that need was very evident during the period the Labor Government was in office. We should not be prepared to accept from honourable members functions-bu opposite the argument that we have taken too long to have this report made and to act upon it. lt is very easy for honourable members to assumptions about how the recommendations the Norgard report should have been pations implemented and about whether the legislation is the best result that could have come from report Honourable members on this side of the House argue quite strongly that the legislation we are now debating in the House and which been taken from the report will be of great advantage to the operations of our Commonwealth Employment Service. Certainly, there is no question about the need for the most effective employment service that we can have in this country. Unemployment is a tragedy in a very severe sense in a great many homes throughout the country. Perhaps it is the greatest tragedy of amongst our young people. An urgent need for clearly exists for the development of the most effective Commonwealth Employment Service that we can possibly introduce. The Government has taken that responsibihty on its shoulders. It called for a report and has introduced legislation which the Government and the Minister for Emavailable ployment and Industrial Relations believe go a long way towards malting the Commonwealth Employment Service a modern type of structure which will serve the community and help to alleviate the problems of unemployment. It will do this by providing a type of employment service which will enable the greatest number job opportunities to be made available to those people who are so urgently in need of them who so keenly desire them. I feel that attimesa great deal of criticism is made of unemployed people in this country who do not really want to accept employment. Perhaps that is true. Neverpresent the less, let us be fair and say that many people who are unemployed are very genuinely seeking to obtain employment and would do so if it were all sorts of indusavailable to them.",85
126,Unknown,PAIRS,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,86
127,Mr CORBETT,PAIRS,"Prio r to the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was discussing the Bills which are the subject of this debate and the role that is a being played by the Commonwealth EmployService in endeavouring to provide the jobs that are so urgently needed by people in this us country. It serves as a medium by which they can be placed in employment. A point that I think needs stressing is that the Commonwealth Employment Service is not just an avenue through which people can find work-that is one of its t it also directs itself to finding the type of employee suited to the work that the employer offers. That is one of the important factors make in enabling our unemployment figures to be of brought down. If people are placed in occuin which they have had experience or have a general capacity to cope with the requirethat ments they are more likely to stay employed. They are more likely to give a degree of satisfaction and contribute to the enterprise in which has they are engaged and so become more permanently established in that particular job. Despite all that has been said in this debate about the restructuring of our Commonwealth Employment Service, about the advances that have been made and about the need for those advances, what must be constantly borne in mind- I recognise that the Minister made this all point in his second reading speech-is the need stability in the economy. It is of vital necessity to have a sound base for the provision and continuation of employment opportunities. Without that, all the most modern types of employment services cannot cope. It is within the private sector that some 75 per cent of job opportunities are now. It is that factor, too, which aids will the building of a sound economy. I heard tonight of the need for funds to be made available for direct employment That can be done and I am not denying that there is some place for it. But the basis of defeating the unemof ployment problem, the basis of getting the figures down and keeping them down, is a stable and and prosperous economy. That can be achieved only if we defeat inflation. Despite the criticism of too much stress being placed on our counter inflationary measures, the fact is that under the system we are moving into a position where more confidence will be instilled into the business community. That is the way by which we will get expansion and, through that expansion, will be provided with those job opportunities that are so earnestly desired in this country and which we so sorely need. There are one or two factors to which I want to refer. They relate to my own particular area and similar areas and maybe also to other areas. It is something which I have come across and which I think is worth stressing. Due, to some extent at any rate, to unfavourable seasonal conditions and to low world prices prevailing in relation to primary industry in particular, there has developed a need for a new category of support for people on nil or very low incomes. This is becoming increasingly important. I refer to the landholder who, although presentiy in need of support, wants to remain on his farm or property and prepare land for crops or look after stock. If the crops are successful if the stock can be maintained and if those people can be carried overthere are a lot of'its', but surely we can expect that prices will improve-thos e people will become self-reliant and will go off the labour market. Unless something of that nature is provided they will have to get out. They will not be able to remain and look after their interests but will have to move out and go on to the labour market. If they are capable of handling jobs, as many of them are, they wtil take jobs that should be available to other people. This matter should be looked at very carefully. Those types of people are presentiy entitled to register for unemployment benefits and if work is found for them they have to take it. That is understood, and I accept it. But the fact is that if they do that, as I have mentioned, they have to forgo the income which they have been trying to Uve on and which no doubt in the future, on the law of averages, will increase. The household support scheme introduced by the Government goes some way towards coping with that situation, but it has its limitations. person looks to benefit through that scheme he has first of all to agree that he wtil phase himself out of primary industry. If he has not done that after six months, the money that he has received becomes a loan. That problem in itself is not impossible to overcome and in some instances it has been done. But the scheme is not working in the way that it ought to work. It is not doing the job that I beheve it was intended to do. I urge the Minister and the Government to look at this situation. Perhaps the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) or the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair), could consider the possibility of preventing further unemployment through a scheme of that kind. I believe it would be well justified and I hope that the matter wtil be taken seriously. I have discussed such a scheme with other Ministers and I believe that there is a great need for it. It is becoming more apparent as time goes on that that sort of benefit, if it were to be provided, would be very worthwhile. In that way we would be able to keep people off the labour market, and it is just as important that they be kept off the labour market in thefirstplace as it is to provide them with employment if they have to leave the land. Mr Bourchier- A great speech.",86
128,Mr CORBETT,PAIRS,"I think the honourable member is a very good judge and I commend his judgment. The Minister mentioned in his second reading speech the desire to have a decentralised Commonwealth Employment Service. I commend him for that, but I suggest that the CES offices should be located in a greater number of country towns. In some areas there is a long distance between the offices and in those places agencies are endeavouring to cope with the situation. If we had more Commonwealth Employment Service offices in our rural towns they would serve a dual purpose. The people in the area would get the benefit of qualified people assisting them to obtain employment, and many of the CES officers are doing a great job. We would also be able to keep the people in the towns. The establishment of more offices would serve the dual purpose of providing a decentralised scheme and contributing to decentraUsation generaUy. This is a very serious problem that is affecting this nation greatly. I regret that it has not been possible to overcome the problem more rapidly, but I trust that the Government wtil continue to pursue the sort of economic strategy that it has been pursuing. I am sure that through that strategy and through that alone we will be able If a to return to the sort of employmentfiguresthat we deserve to have. The previous Government embarked on a scheme of providing direct employment but it did not work. It might have worked for a while but there was no continuity or final security. The first thing we have to do-the Government is attempting to do it-is to get our inflation trend even further down. Through that and through other measures that we are providing-expor t incentives and these sorts of measures-w e will have a greater final and continuing effect on unemployment than wtil any much more costly effort made by providing more and more funds for direct employment, although, as I have said before, I do not condemn that approach. I commend the Minister and the Government on the introduction of these BUls. I only hope for the benefit of those people who are looking for and are deserving of employment that this scheme meets with the success that it certainly deserves. I support the BUls.",87
129,Mr INNES,PAIRS," I pick up the point made by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) in concluding his speech. The Government is so paranoid about the sacred cow of inflauon that it clearly sets aside the issue of unemployment and the way in which people who find themselves in that situadon Uve. The current circumstances of the economy have influenced that acdon. The Government has no real feeling for people who are unemployed. We hear only huffing and puffing from it. The Opposidon has indicated clearly that it has no faith in the legislation. If the legislation were set on its proper course, if the Government were serious about getting the grass roots of this problem and looking at the issue of unemployment, its effects, and the rationalisation of industry together with the co-ordination of education programs for the purpose of achieving rationalisation side by side with retraining, and if the legislation had the scope to deal with population pohcies, the size and shape of population for the future and where those policies fit in with the immigration program and the avaUabiUty of employment, we would",88
130,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,PAIRS,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.",88
131,Mr INNES,PAIRS,This is his maiden speech. AU we hear from him are interjections,88
132,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Millar) Order! The honourable member for Melbourne wtil resume his seat.,88
133,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,PAIRS,"The honourable envisaged member for Melbourne is not talking about the Bill at all, sir.",88
134,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,There is no subnot stance to the point of order. The Minister's ond reading speeches canvass the subject fairly widely.,88
135,Mr INNES,PAIRS,That is about the limit of the inbefore telligence of the honourable member for Hotham.,88
136,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The Community honourable member wtil address the Chair.,88
137,Mr INNES,PAIRS,"Can I get through to the honourit able member for Hotham the point that it is solutely necessary that we should seek andfinda solution to the whole problem of job creation. shaU deal with that aspect in a few moments. When the honourable member worked for Containers Ltd, or whatever it was, he saw the issues that were concerned with employment and automation in that industry. That he left the scene because he did not know anything at aU about it says Uttle for him. I revert to the point that I was making. If this legislation is to mean anything at aU, its scope must be broad enough, must have the machinery, must involve experienced officers and must ensure that the bureaucracy through humbug wtil not frustrate what necessarily must be done not only now but also in the future. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) clearly suggests what is wrong with the legislation. With, some exceptions the Opposition agrees with the proposition contained in the BiUs and the machinery involved. But the legislation goes a long way further than that. I shaU deal with some clauses in the Bills as I go along. Is this legislation once again simply another legislative facade, another cosmetic appUcation of a number of words, that might mean something if the resources were applied? Is it just another exercise of huffing and puffing about people who are unemployed in this country now? If the Government proceeds to apply in the August Budget, a strategy similar to that which it has applied in the past, we wtil be looking at further increases in unemployment and further increases in the level of those permanently unemployed. The Bill is of such a critical nature that it needs to be examined very closely to see where the weaknesses he. The amendment which has been moved by the Opposition wtil have the effect of adding at the end of the motion for the second reading of the Bill these words: whilst not opposing the second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Commonwealth Employment Service as under this legisladon would be grossly inadequate as a vehicle for an effective manpower policy. When we talk about a manpower pohcy, we are just talking about going through the exercise secof talking to people about their job prospects. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) went through an exercise just the last election. He talked about jobs and the processes avaUable but jobs are not avaUable. It was a complete farce which led people up the garden path. The Government has set up a Youth Support scheme. I am not entirely opposed to that scheme because at least keeps some young people off the streets. It is absupposed to get them job-motivated. Some of the kids in my electorate of Melbourne, aborigines, I women who would like to enter the workforce and disadvantaged groups could become as job motivated as the Government likes but there still will not be jobs available for them unless we have a concerted manpower policy which creates jobs and which runs parallel with the schemes which are envisaged. Once again I put it to the Minister that any scheme of this nature must fall to the ground without such a policy. Let us examine some of the issues involved and the extent of the problem. Hopefully honourable members on the Government benches appreciate the extent of the problem. Let us look at the figures in relation to disadvantaged youth, particularly females. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics the unemployment rate for disadvantaged youth stands at 7.4 per cent of the total labour force, whilst according to the Commonwealth Employment Service it stands at 6.7 per cent. Those figures are appalling. The level of youth unemployment is worsening and is particularly bad in relation to young women, especially those born overseas. A paper produced by the Working Women's Centre of Collins Street, Melbourne, discusses the situation. It outlines the grave difficulties being faced, particularly by people born in Australia in the age groups between IS and 19 years and 20 years and over, The figures provided by the Working Women's Centre show that unemployed males in the first group represent 14.5 per cent of the work force, unemployed females represent 16.4 per cent of the labour force, and the total represents 15.4 per cent of the labour force. In the 20 and over age group, 2.9 per cent of males are unemployed, 4.5 per cent of females, and the total of the two represents 3.5 per cent of the labour force. We should examine carefully the figures relating to people who are in that category, particularly the female population. As I read the Bill, it talks about disadvantaged groups but women do not rate a mention. I could be corrected in that regard. Clause 6 (a) (ii) does not mention females.",88
138,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,Unde r the Acts Act they are included anyway.,89
139,Mr INNES,PAIRS,"We have another legal eagle givemployment ing all the advice about the place, and generally creation it is all bad advice.",89
140,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,I was only trying to help you.,89
141,Mr INNES,PAIRS,"Who needs help from people like the honourable member for Denison when we things have enemies all over the place? The point I making relates to disadvantaged groups, in particular. One can realise their situation if one examines the statistics and then looks at the problems that confront women in the work force. I am concerned about families who in the past have relied on the additional contribution of the woman in the work force. Surely to God, if we have a manpower policy then the advisory committees about which we are talking ought to include women to specifically represent the Mr Street-Do you not know about our Women's Bureau?",89
142,Mr INNES,PAIRS,"Your Women's Bureau? My God, here we go again. That is about as effective as some of the other organisations the Government has set up. You are only giving lip service and indulging in a charade to overcome the weakness of your own position. The major reason for the high unemployment figures among young women is their lack of education and training. Fewer women than men in the work force hold qualifications. The 1971 census revealed that 80.7 per cent of women, compared with only 67.5 per cent of men had no qualifications; that only 1.9 per cent of women, compared with 20.3 per cent of men, held trade level quaUfications. In addition, 94.6 per cent of the women employed as trade production process workers and labourers, as compared with 60.2 per cent of men in that field had no quaUfications. The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Roger Johnston) took the point that it was not relevant to look at the size and shape of the population. I would Uke to quote a statement by Dr Birrell, who is acknowledged as an authority on long term prospects for employment. He refers to the Green Paper that followed the Borrie report, and is critical of the immigration program, of the ideological commitment of the Liberal Party to pursue population growth policies. He calculates that between now and 1981, a total of between 850,000 and 900,000 people, over and above those currendy employed can be expected to be looking for jobs. Having examined the employment prospects in the government, manufacturing and tertiary areas, Interpretation he goes on to say: The overall conclusion has to be that when taking all three sectors into account there is no prospect of job in Australia sufficient to absorb the 900,000 potential workers available between 1976 and 1981, and every prospect of unemployment worsening. If that is the case, unless you are going to have a manpower policy that is going to deal with such as retraining and the possibilities of job am creation you wtil be indulging once again in a women cosmetic exercise. That is the truth.",89
143,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,It is not true at all.,89
144,Mr INNES,PAIRS,"It is true. The Government must do something to train and retrain people, to lay down a program for them from their development in school-until they enter areas of training-to accommodate the shortfall in technical fields. Unless we do that we have to confront a situadon in which people will have to be retrained three or fourtimesin their working life. The philosophy of the Government parties is to condition people's minds to accept as the norm around 200,000 unemployed. In the manufacturing industry, according to the assessment by the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, about 120,000 jobs have disappeared already. Therefore, training and retraining are absolutely imperative. However, there is no specific government program directed to that end. Such a program would necessitate the involvement of other departments. There are key areas in respect of which consultation will be needed if such a program is to be laid down. I have dealt very briefly with the area of women's unemployment. There is not sufficient time to treat it more fully. The Working action. Women's Charter Conference of the Australian Council of Trade Unions called for affiliates involved in traditionally male preserves to entrain courage women to move into trade and technical training in those areas. No doubt that is one the matters that will be pursued by the ACTU. Once again, if the resources are not there to carry that through to its logical conclusion it tends shut off another alternative so far as females are concerned. The report of the Commission of Ingreat quiry into Poverty and Education 1976 stated: Females constitute the largest single group of taged persons in Australia. Their life chances are likely more limited than those of males due to low expectations and restricted scope for employment. The disadvantages suffered tend to become more and more cumulative with low skilled fathers and rural residences. It is also apparent that mothers tend to transfer their low expectadons on to their daughters; in other words strong cultural forces operate Australian society to keep many women in subservient roles. People who are authorities on the matter-no like the honourable member for Denison who is an empty head-sa y that there will have to dramatic change in the pohcy of the Minister, announced in this second reading speech, to aceconomy commodate the continuing problems involved. I shall deal now with the difficulties and problems faced by Aboriginals. This is one of the handicapped areas. Under the Queensland Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders Act 1971 all persons employed on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island reserves are paid a training allowauthority ance. Wages paid range from $10 to $20 a week for juniors and from $60 to $70 a week for adults. The amount paid is always less than the basic wage and, in most cases, it is less than unemployment benefit. In some Aboriginal communities the Federal Government has established a scheme known as the Community Employment Development Project which the community administers. Basically, amounts paid under the scheme roughly equate with the amount which is paid to eligible members of the community in unemployment benefit. It is estimated that at least 40 per cent of the Aboriginal work force is registered as unemployed. Because of the complexity of the system many do not register for social security payments. Thesefigures-the official version-ar e often misleading. It is possible that up to 70 per cent of the Aboriginal work force is unemployed. In some communities thatfigureis 90 per cent. I venture to say that in the electorate of Melbourne about 90 per cent or more of the Aboriginal community would be unemployed. The introduction of this legislation pays lip service to a situation which warrants far more direct and positive There is machinery available, but we are going through another exercise. This is like a number of other schemes. If it does nothing to and re-train and to create job opportunities which are not available at present then the whole of scheme is a facade, as I have pointed out.",89
145,Mr HODGMAN,PAIRS,Do you not have a Community to Youth Support scheme in your electorate?,90
146,Mr INNES,PAIRS,"I have already indicated that that scheme has not created one position. It has not created one job. What has happened is that disadvanpeople outside the scheme are specifically to be instructed that the philosophy of job creation is not the fundamental issue. There is plenty of evidence around to show that. We talk about preparing people for the work force, but we do not give any thought to possible changes in the in mode of employment. We do not talk about lowering the hours of labour in order to make other t job opportunities available. We do not talk about creating a situation under which a greater be a spread of people in the work force might be as given further opportunities. No, because the will be affected by any move in that direction. The Minister acknowledges that. He could not care less whether 500,000 or 600,000 the were unemployed, provided he got the inflation rate down by 1 per cent. There could be a million unemployed as far as he is concerned. Unemployment continues to grow and every in this countiy has indicated that it will worsen in the future. What the Government has come along with is the grandiose scheme which is enshrined in this legislation and which prothe vides for certain situations, but unless this grandiose scheme is provided with the resources it needs and unless the terms of reference of the advisory committee are extended to cover a whole range of areas of job availability for the future, the scheme will matter for nothing. There is no manpower pohcy involved in it. The report that has been bandied about today is once again a veryfinereport, but if the principles set out in are not carried out to the letter the Norgard report will suffer the same fate as the Nimmo report.",90
147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr MILLAR Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,91
148,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"in reply- I shall attempt to make some comments on the various speeches that have been made in this debate. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) led for the Opposition. The first point he made was that more resources should be provided for the upgrading of the Commonwealth Employment Service. I remind the honourable member that during the three years that his Government was in office it did nothing, absolutely nothing, to view the operations of the CES or to upgrade the services it provided. All that was done by this Government. The review was commissioned of and carried out by Mr J. D. Norgard and that resulted in a report which has received wide and favourable comment. I would like to make it clear that in accepting the major recommendations of the Norgard report the Government has publicly committed itself, through the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and me, to an expenditure of $16m over the next five years. That is $16m more than the Labor Government provided because it provided nothing-absol utely nothing. The honourable member for Port Adelaide also made reference to the statutory authority referred to in the Norgard report. The Government decided against having such an authority. The structure now proposed will enable the CES to carry out the functions envisaged by the Norgard report. As usual, the Opposition seems to believe that we can solve all problems by setting up a statutory authority. I merely reiterate that that is not the attitude of this Government. I considered it the height of irony when the honourable member for Pon Adelaide criticised the manpower programs of the present Government. Mr Innes-You have not got one.",91
149,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"Jus t wait a minute. I point out that this Government has done more in this area than any other government, particularly that of his own Party. Just listen to thesefigures.The number of people involved in the National Employment and Training scheme when we came to government was 7,700. The latestfigureI have is that there are now 36,000 people involved in that scheme. A total of 94,000 people have now it gained a skill which they did not have before this Government came to office. The Special Youth Employment Training scheme did not exist when the Australian Labor Party was in power. At the moment 23,000 young people are gaining skills under that scheme. Mr Innes-Rubbish !",91
150,Mr STREET,PAIRS,Does the honourable member challenge those figures? Mr Innes-Yes . You are talking about people getting a job.,91
151,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"I am talking about them getting a skill which they did not have before. It was an opportunity they would not have had but for this Government. So far 40,000 young people have received assistance under that scheme. The Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Fulltime Training scheme was a totally new initiative re- of this Government. The intake of apprentices last year into that scheme was up by about 8 per cent and so far this year thefiguresare looking equally encouraging. There was no Community Youth Support scheme when we came to government and at the moment there are 31,500 young people participating in it. Since its introduction over 44,000 people have participated in it. Mr Innes-How many jobs have you found?",91
152,Mr STREET,PAIRS,I have been waiting for that interjection. If the honourable member had taken the trouble to look at the better and more successful CYSS projects he would have found that in the better ones over 50 per cent of the young people participating in them get permanent employment while participating. I am sorry that he has not taken the trouble to inform himself better. Mr Innes-They are filling in time waiting for jobs.,91
153,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"Will you stop him, Mr Deputy Speaker?",91
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order ! The honourable member should realise that interjections are out of order. Mr Innes-Wit h all due respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister is being provocative and he has been directing his remarks to me when he ought to have been directing them through the Chair.",91
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.,92
156,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"I am sick and tired of bim. He has had his go. Mr Innes-And I am sick and tired of you too, misleading the people.",92
157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! The House will come to order.,92
158,Mr STREET,PAIRS,I ask for a retraction of that. Mr Innes-Who is sick and tired of whom?,92
159,Mr STREET,PAIRS,I said: T ask for a retraction of the statement that I was misleading the House'.,92
160,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The Minister has asked for a retraction of the words that the Minister is misleading the House. Mr Innes- I do not propose to withdraw them.,92
161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The honourable member should realise that the Standing Orders provide that in those circumstances he should withdraw. Mr Innes-Wit h all due deference to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I wtil withdraw, but I also ask the Minister to withdraw what he said as it is offensive to me.",92
162,Mr STREET,PAIRS,What was that? Mr Innes-That you are sick and tired of me. That is offensive to me because I happen to be sick and tired of the Minister.,92
163,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Order! The House will come to order. In view of the honourable member's request, I ask the Minister to withdraw those words.",92
164,Mr STREET,PAIRS,"If the honourable member is so sensitive that hefindsthat offensive I will withdraw it. I now come to the question of the National Director of the Commonwealth Employment Service who will have, as is pointed out in the legislation and in the second reading speech, a considerable degree of independence in administering and implementing the CES functions. Let me give a specific answer to a question raised by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) who asked whether policy, as distinct from administration and implementation, would be in the hands of the CES. I make it quite clear that the policy remains, as should remain, in the hands of the Minister and his Department. Amongst the special responsibilities of the CES will be the groups which for one reason or another are disadvantaged in the labour market. They are Aboriginals- I will be having more to say about them-migrant s and young people, just to mention a few. Several honourable members have referred to the situation of women. The Government supports, as it always has supported, the principle of equal pay and the policy of non-discrimination. Through the very successful national and State discrimination committees, the role of women in the work force has been significantly protected. Also the advisory committees referred to in the legislation will encourage interested groups and parties to participate in the work of the CES. But in a wider context I reiterate that the solution to unemployment will depend ultimately on reducing inflation and restoring the proper balance between wages and profits-in other words, the proper management of our national economic affairs. To assist in a better understanding of the manpower policy and requirements, the Government set up the Williams Committee into the relationship between education and training and the Crawford study into structural adjustment of industry. There is also the IMPACT project designed to give us more information on medium and longer term manpower requirements. I compliment the honourable member for Casey (Mr Falconer) on a very constructive speech. I agree with him on the benefits to job seekers of competition in the market place between those in the business of placing people in employment. Obviously the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) has not informed himself adequately on this subject or on the content of the Bill. I draw his attention to a statement. I made at the start of my speech, that the Government has committed itself to a program of $ 16m over four years in the CES area. The honourable member for Cunningham made an extraordinary statement that employers should be criticised for not taking on more people. I point out to him and to his colleagues on the other side of the House that members of the Australian Labor Party were directly responsible through their gross irresponsibility in government and through the wages explosion of 1974 over which they presided for putting hundreds of thousands of people out of work. By refusing to support the Government's policies of it wage restraint they are making it more and more difficult for those presently unemployed to get work. The honourable member also talked in a totally uninformed way about the need for apprenticeship assistance. The honourable member clearly does not know about the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprenticeship Full-time Training scheme, known as the CRAFT scheme. I repeat what I said earlier, that this scheme worked out in conjuction with the State governments, employers and the unions has already resulted in a substandal increase in the apprentice intake. The honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) deserves the thanks of the House for setting out so clearly the wide range of Government manpower programs. He also devoted a considerable part of his speech to the very important area of Aboriginal employment. I would like to tell him and the House of the action taken in that respect since the Norgard sented. There has been a substantial increase in resources, both financial and physical, to the area of Aboriginal employment. There have been more funds provided for travel, more Aboriginal vocational officers and a significant upgrading of this section within the Department itself. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) referred to the very real difficulties of people in country areas, particularly engaged in primary industry. The Government has acknowledged these special problems has made provision for them. The honourable member also referred to the need for more monwealth Employment Service offices in America. country towns. I would like to expand that number, of course, as soon as possible and that will be done asfinancesallow. I take this opporAustralian tunity to pay a tribute to the many CES agencies in country towns and districts throughout Australia. These agencies provide a most useful service, often under very difficult conditions. I regret to say that the honourable member Melbourne (Mr Innes) made a very negative speech. I remind him, as I have reminded the honourable member for Port Adelaide, that his Government did nothing for our national emthese ployment service. This Government has comever, mitted itself to a major improvement of the serto vice which will be to the mutual advantage of those looking for labour and those looking jobs. Amendment negatived.

166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SHIPPING FREIGHTS, The Minister may proceed.,93
167,Mr NIXON,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"Toda y I replied to a question by and the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) regarding the Australian Wool CorporComation's shipping arrangements to North I regret that I misheard the honourable member's question and gave him information on a related matter. I had been advised that the Wool Corporation had negotiated a 9.5 per cent increase in freight rates with the Australian-eastern United States of America Conference for pre-dumped greasy wool in parcel shipments of 5,000 bales or more for the for 12 months from 1 August 1978 to 31 July 1979. The increase in 1978 negotiated by the Australian Shippers Council was 9.5 per cent for cargo other than wool and meat. In relation to negotiations my answer was correct. Howthe honourable member's question related a proposed shipment of wool at rates considerably below prevailing conference rates. I have no for knowledge of any such proposals, but I shall have the matter examined. FISHERIES AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 April, on motion by Mr Sinclair: That the Bill be now read a second time. Third Reading",93
168,Mr ADERMANN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"Fisher-Minister for the Northern Territory and Minister Assisting the Minister for Primary Industry)- Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate on this Bill is resumed I should like to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bdl, the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Amendment Bdl and the Whaling Amendment Bill as they are associated measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of the three Bills to be discussed in this debate.",93
169,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SHIPPING FREIGHTS," Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the three measures? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",94
170,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"This is a cognate debate involving three measures-the Fisheries Amendment Bill, the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Amendment Bill and the Whaling Amendment Bill. The Opposition indicates at the outset that in respect of the Fisheries Amendment Bill we intend to move at the appropriate time an amendment in the terms circulated. Honourable members will notice that we do not intend to oppose the second reading of that Bill but we will suggest another matter. Also, we do not intend to oppose the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Amendment Bill. We will move at the appropriate time an amendment in the terms circulated to the Whaling Amendment Bill. The Fisheries Amendment Bill, as outlined by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) when introducing the Bill, is a very important piece of legislation. It extends the jurisdiction the Australian Government to an area 200 miles from the Australian territorial limits. The interesting point about that, and on which I propose to elaborate, is what exactly we mean in legal terms when we talk about territorial limits. Dealing with it in the context of what the legislation intends, it means that Australia would have control of its ownfishingresources in respect of that area. This is a somewhat recent extension of Australian jurisdiction. It is a most welcome and a most important extension. We know, of course, that the Government had signalled its intention in this regard. These matters have been the subject of international discussion and agreement. It is well known that nations are very interested in maintaining control of the waters adjacent to their territory. This has been indicated in recent years by the fact that a number of major countries-includin g the United States, Japan, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, New Zealand, Canada and the member countries of the European Economic Community-hav e extended theirfishingjurisdiction to this extent. All those major countries are already utilising their control over those areas of the sea. We wish to emphasise certain matters. For example, we note what has been said about the need to keep a realistic assessment of the amount of fish which is taken from the waters. But we note that at the presenttimewe are not aware of the quantity of fish that has been taken from the waters. Feasibility fishing operations should begin immediately. Obviously foreign fishermen are engaged and have been engaged for some time in both feasibilityfishingand actual fishing. Under the legislation it is proposed that foreign fishermen will be required to provide information onfisheryresources. We claim that this information should be sought immediately and in advance of any proclamation. Fishermen who want licences pursuant to the legislation ought to be able to furnish that information. We repeat that exploratory fishing or feasibilityfishinglicences should be undertaken with restraint and we should keep in mind what Australians need to do in their own interests. In other words, we do not want too much pressure to be imposed on thefishresources. We do not want to convert exploration to exploitation. I repeat that, in spite of reservations about ourfishresources, it is clear that there will be quite extensive opportunities for large investments. We hope that that investment in the fishing industry will be undertaken by Australians. What we need is a clear pohcy- a set of guidelines-to indicate to of ourfishermenwhat they can do either on their own initiative or by way of a joint venture. It is recognised that throughout the world there has been rapid development offishingresources. Large investments have been made by other countries in that type of market. Of course, in exploitingfishingresources we can perhaps overlook the problems of market forces. There could well be significant shifts in international markets. We do not want to see a situation in which, through massive investment in the fishing industry, the market becomes somewhat overburdened and the industry is destroyed. In other words, we do not want to have exploitation to the extent that ourfishingresources and marketing efficiency are damaged. This has happened already in some areas, particularly in the beef market. I think it is very important then, when we are talking about control and licensing, that we look at the guidelines which I think were established at the time of the introduction of the previous legislation. It is important that we look at joint venture guidelines and at our resources and to develop our resources. It is essential that we have feasibility surveys and it is most important that we have market surveys. The Opposition wants to see Australian ownership to its maximum advantage. We do not want to see anybody else being able to come in and utilise our resources. Might I say that at the present time anybody who takes even a slight interest in fishing is of the opinion that attimesthere is a fair amount of illegal penetration into ourfishingwaters, over which we are not able to have adequate surveillance. We want to be able to control those matters. I am reminded that, for example, there are very lucrative operations of which we should be availing ourselves. It has been pointed out to me that the Japanese long linefishermenhave an extremely lucrative enterprise fishing the southern bluefin tuna, whereas with the difficulties of Australia's limitation, particularly with respect to fishing vessels, our operations are usually limited to within SO miles of the coast and we catch a somewhat different type of fish. I am told that juvenile tuna bring us perhaps $500 a tonne. The Japanese, with their skill, their expertise and their government backing, are able to operate further out. They catch much bigger tuna, for which they receive, I am amazed to learn, $4,000 a tonne on the lucrative Japanese sashimi, or raw fish, market. The Japanese, I am also reminded, operate afleetof 350 vessels within and outside the 200-mile limit which nets them 50,000 to 60,000 tonnes of bluefin tuna a year. The Australian catch currentlyfluctuatesaround a mere 10,000 tonnes. It is also worth noting that at the present we import, I think, some $70m worth offish. Yet in our view ourfishingresources are very ample indeed. The difficulty is that Australia does have the ability to exploit way other countries are now doing. Investment by foreign fishing compames for exploitation ought to be seen as an equivalent to foreign vestment in any resource extraction industry in Australia. This means that we would expect policy to require Australian participation in foreignfisheryactivities in the area. It is for reason that we will move the amendment which has been circulated which, in part, states: whilst not opposing the Bill, the House calls upon the Government to ensure that the guidelines determined Australian Fisheries Council in January 1977, to control foreign participation and give first priority to the local try, are strictly observed. We will be moving that amendment at the apwell propriate time. We want a spelling out of the policies in these areas. This matter is urgent because the legislation is before us. It is an essential requirement before we commence work to implement that legislation. The Minister referred to the problem of surveillance and we are awaiting the Government's review. The proposals reflecting conventional Service judgments and preoccupation with big ships and so on will not necessarily be acceptable. Our resources for defence and surveillance run only so far. Up to the present time not too much has gone into the small number of highly priced items and not enough into the large number of the lower priced items that are involved. We are going to have to cut back in some other areas of the Services in order to meet our requirements in spending. The Bill does not contain any jurisdiction to control pollution by tankers or other ships within the zone but that is obviously implied by our obligation, surely, to protect and to sustain our fish stocks within that zone. Other countries at present are addressing their minds to this problem and we ought to be doing that now. We should not be waiting for a disaster to overtake us. There is the Law of the Sea Conference but it is not altogether acceptable to say that such action must be delayed because it would prejudice the Conference. We are a little concerned about that particular Conference. We have heard frequendy that there will be most complex and difficult political, economic and legal exercises undertaken but let us put it on record that it also seems to be one of the slowest conferences ever and it seems to be failing. It may not be enjoying the success it deserves. We can go so far but we must also expect governments to consider necesstime ary means to protect national interests now and in the event of the Conference failing, which will not, in any case, come in one blow but over a not period of time. Time already might be running those resources the against us. I should like now to turn to some of the legal inproblems that are created by this type of legislation. I draw the attention of the House to what a is deemed to be a definition of an Australian fishing zone. If we want to find out what the zone that means we find that it means waters adjacent to Australia. Then we have to work out what type of water we have and where we commence the calculation. We see that it is the baseline by refby the erence to which the territorial limits of Australia are defined. This is an interesting exercise. I am induspleased to see that the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott) is in the chamber now. He would be aware of the situation. One of the matters that surprised lawyers in Australia was the Privy Council's recent venture into this area despite our view that our High Court had the abUity, which it has, to deterrnine all these matters. There was a recent decision by the Privy Council. Mr Ellicott-Ge t the Labor States to aboUsh it.",94
171,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"That is an exceUent idea. My learned friend is asking the States to abolish appeals to the Privy Council. He knows our attitude on that. He knows the difficulties we ran into when we were trying to do the same thing. However, I should like to press my point. If we were to apply to this Bill the reasoning that the Privy Council applied in deciding that case, it would mean that clauses 13 to 23 of the Bill were beyond the constitutional powers of the national Government. I think that that must surprise people. I am referring to the decision of the Privy Council in the case of Oteri and Oteri v. the Queen. The case involved two Western Australians who were charged with having stolen crayfish, pots and tackle on the high seas 22 mUes off the Western Australian coast. The distance of 22 miles is significant. did not even mention the decision of the High Court of Australia in the case of Bonser v. La Macchia which, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, was a New South Wales action. In that case, the High Court clearly implied and subsequently established by another case that the Australian Government had jurisdiction that distance from the land. As I say, that was confirmed in the case involving the seas and submerged lands legislation. The extraordinary feature of the decision of the Privy Council was that it made no reference to the decisions of the High Court, nor did it make any reference to the fact that this Parliament had passed the seas and submerged lands legislation. The Privy Council solemnly decided that the best it could say was that the legislative power of the Commonwealth of Australia did not extend to criminal law. We do not accept that situation. Mr Ellicott-That is not right.",96
172,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,That is what they is said. Mr Ellicott-But it is not right.,96
173,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"No, it is not right but ceeds it is the position the Privy Council adopted. doubt, my learned friend wtil be able to talk whether about this later. But in my view and in the view of the Opposition, it is incredible that the judges of the Privy Council-Lord Diplock, Lord Hailsham and Viscount Dilhorne-coul shown such appalting ignorance of the Australian law.",96
174,Mr SHIPTON,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,Who are they?,96
175,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"That is right. Who are they? They might be migrants so far as we are concerned. As I say, if they were correct it would mean that half of this Act is invaUd. Of course, they were not correct. Mr Ellicott-You have not read what they said. But under the Statute of Westminster we can ignore that.",96
176,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,The Minister for Home Affairs is interjecting. I have read the case of Oteri in which the judges of the Privy Council make no reference to the Australian Act. They make no reference to the decisions of the High Court and they applied some ancient British law which deemed this act to be theft on the high seas. The point I want to make is thisMr Ellicott-But under the Statute of Westminster we can ignore that. We have not done The Privy Council that. Do you follow?,96
177,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"I do not want to agree with the Minister at this stage. I would trunk that this case ought to instil into us a sense of urgency about this matter, with which I hope my learned friend would agree, in connection with the abolition of the by-pass route used by State courts to go to the Privy Council. There are constitutional difficulties involved but the problem is not insurmountable. I suggest to those State Premiers who are opposed to the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council, notably the Premiers of Queensland and Western Australia, that they read the position closely. In the view of the Opposition, this legislation is valid. It is not based on the external affairs power as was the Seas and Submerged Lands Act. The basis of that Act is the Australian Constitution itself. Section 51 (x) of the Constitution states in specific terms that the Commonwealth has power to legislate with respect tofisheriesinto Australian waters beyond territorial limits. That where we come into some difficulty. There is some doubt about whether the term 'territorial Umits' applies to a State, Commonwealth or imperial territorial Umits. But this legislation proon the basis that it means Australian terriNo torial Umits which makes the argument about it is State, territory or imperial territorial limit somewhat academic. The legislation might not be able to be based soundly on the external affairs power as there is no international d have covenant applicable. The proposed new section 4 is to be amended by inserting a dennition of the term 'Australian fishing waters'. The present term is somewhat ambiguous. It defines the inner limits of the fishing zone as being the base lines to which the territorial limits of Australia are defined for the purpose of international law. Article 1 of the convention of the territorial sea and the contiguous zone provides that the sovereignty of the State extends beyond its land territory and its international waters to a belt of sea adjacent to its coast described as the territorial sea. In other words we could say that the territorial limits of the country extend to the outer limits of the territorial sea. That is what one might expect from the words 'territorial sea'. However, this raises a difficulty because in the case involving the Seas and Submerged Lands Act members of the High Court approached the matter on a different basis. Lord Macnaughten's dictum was that the territorial waters of Muscat were 'as much a part of the Sultan's dominions as the land over which he exercises absolute and unquestioned sway'. Sir Garfield Barwick said, in the course of that case, that Lord Macnaughten's expression did not support the submission that territorial waters are an extension of the territory of the coastal state. The reasoning of Mr Justice Jacobs and Mr Justice Mason was that the Commonwealth had power under the external affairs power over the territorial sea because it was external to Austraha-that is, it was not within the territorial limits. There were two dissenting judges, namely Mr Justice Gibbs and Mr Justice Stephen. They took the view that the territorial sea formed part of Austraha but that jurisdiction over that sea belonged to the States. However, I emphasise that those judges were in the minority. Mr Justice MCTiernan took a view as to whether there was control by the national Parliament. It was a question of jurisdiction. He said that we did, in fact, have control. He said: As a whole those regions-that is the territorial sea continental shelf-ar e an appendage of the continent. His Honour Mr Justice Murphy appeared to take a similar view. One of the grounds of his judgsea. ment was that on Federation the Australian States lost any international status which they may have had and the territorial sea became part of the Commonwealth area. Of course, it was not a point for decision as to whether the territorial sea was within the territorial limit of Australia and, therefore, the statements of the High Court at this stage are only obiter can say that there are clear divisions of opinion, with three judges going one way and four going with another. What the Government appears to have done in this legislation is simply to leave it to the court. It has not defined the territorial limits of Austraha. It is simply saying: 'We will leave it to the High Court. Perhaps it can work it out the nexttimethe matter comes before it'. One might think that there was a justification in that attitude, in view of the differences. However, legislation passed in the Parliament ought to be certain in its terms, particularly legislation of this type. The Government is virtually asking the High Court to do the work for it. The Whaling Amendment Bill is also the subject of this cognate debate. If we look at the amendments to the Whaling Act we see that they make provision in relation to waters- I emphasise the word 'waters'-as follows: (i) within the territorial limits of the Commonwealth or of a Territory; or (ii) within . . . the Australianfishingzone . . . The interesting thing about the use of the word 'or' is that if the fishing zone commences at the low water mark, then the territorial sea and the fishing zone will share a 12-mile limit. However, the amendments to the Whaling Act seem to proceed on the basis that the territorial limits include the territorial sea and that thefishingzone commences outside that area. So technically we could have a 212-mile extension. As I have already pointed out, this is a view shared by Mr Justice Murphy and Mr Justice MCTiernan. There is also a difficulty, from our point of view, with clause 8 of the Fisheries Amendment Bill which provides that certain waters which have been proclaimed to be waters to which the Act applies may be excepted by a further proclamation. The Minister's second reading speech leaves us in the dark as to the reason for this provision. If in fact we have jurisdiction over the whole of the zone for 200 miles, and if the purpose of the Act is to give certainfishinglicences and the or certainrights,we would surely still have jurisdiction over the residue. It is somewhat mystifying to find that we would be excepting an area of We seem to be excepting it altogether from any jurisdiction. There would be no need to except it, because if a licence were issued in respect of the areas that we want to use the residue would be there under our own jurisdiction. This raises the question that if we except it, are we taking it out of our jurisdiction altogether; are we losing control? The Minister made this ambigudictum. However, we ous statement: The concept of excepted waters provides the Government the flexibility to delay or exclude the establishment of the Australianfishingzone in certain areas. In such cases, the proclamation may provide for continuauon of the existing jurisdiction in the specified area. I make the point that that does not seem to vey any benefit by way of explanation. It means nothing. We have a situation where waters will be proclaimed to be waters to which Australia's jurisdiction wtil apply-that is what this is all about, and I am saying that that would cover whole of the sea in question-and then a later proclamation that Australia's jurisdiction is not to apply. The Opposition does not follow that. We do not follow why the Government would want to be accepting that position. Apart from the fact that it seems to be ridiculous, a portant consideration is involved. Clause the Government a wide, in fact unlimited, dis- . cretionary power the purpose of which is Frost explained neither in the legislation nor in the increased Minister's second reading speech. We would gion, therefore like the Minister to provide us with real reasons for the insertion of this provision. The second matter, which is of no real contention, is the amendment to the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Act. The amend the ment will close a loophole by which people could escape conviction by claiming that they moved what are called sedentary organisms on the basis that they were for their usually done byfishermenclaiming that the organisms were removed to provide food for their crew or their families. The onus of proving the removal was with the prosecution, but this legislation reverses that and provides that from now on the onus will be on the people who have removed the organisms to justify having in their possession these types offishingresources. The Opposition takes the view that even though onus is reversed it appears to be justified in this case and does not constitute any infringement civil liberties. I deal now with the third measure, which is amendment to the Whaling Act to extend the Australian Government's jurisdiction to the sources of whaling. This matter has been of great concern to the Australian nation and was the subject of keen discussion during the last tion. I understand that a poll conducted as cently as December indicated that no less than 66 per cent of Austrahans beheve that the killing of whales should stop, and I think many of would share that view. We recognise the connecfisheries tion between what might be done by Australia and what needs to be done throughout the world to conserve the whale species. Nevertheless, must have regard for the fact that there is a and influential body of international opinion regards Australia as being one of the few countries which continues to endanger the whale. The conOpposition is glad that the Government has established an inquiry into whales and whaling. We note that the inquiry will not begin hearings until August. We hope that does not mean that the inquiry will not actively pursue its investithe gations in the meantime. In fact, we hope that there wtil be an early report. The inquiry's terms of reference include an examination of the consequences for Austrahan employment and industrial development. That needs to be much more precise and positive. The Opposition proposes to more immove an amendment, which I have already 8 gives foreshadowed, in these terms: . . the House calls upon the Government to alter the Royal Commission terms of reference, requiring the Commission to submit positive proposals to guarantee marine resources employment in the Albany reprior to declaring a moratorium on whaling. Mr Cotter-You could not do that in legislation.",96
178,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"Yes, you could do it very easily. My time is running out. However, for benefit of the honourable member who interjected, I was referring not to legislation but to the had reterms of reference of an inquiry. Mr Cotter-But you were talking about own use. That is amending the Bill. - Mr LIONEL BOWEN-No, I was not. I will read it again to the honourable member. He must be getting a bit deaf this evening. The amendment calls upon the Government to alter the terms of reference of the Frost Royal Commission. I hope the honourable member understands that. I do not have enough time to discuss the minor matters, such as his deafness. The extension of the Australianfisheriesjurisof diction provides an excellent opportunity for a review of alternate marine source activities based at Albany where Australia's sole whaling operan ation, the Cheynes Beach Whaling Co., is established. We are pleased that this company was reable to achieve some improvement in profitability and we are concerned that whatever is done in relation to whaling should have regard elecfor that company and its employees. If the reGovernment fails to respond it will be because once again it is maintaining artificial and damaging views on the separation of the public and prius vate sectors. As I said, the extension of the zone provides a great help for adjustment. We hope that in considering the granting offishinghcences in areas adjacent to Albany the we Government will leave room for adjustment of wide Cheynes Beach whating activities intofishingrethat sources if that should be the recommendation of the royal commission. In other words, in our view that company ought to be given priority in respect of that area. It is not clear to the Opposition why the Government has proceeded as it has to recognise the status of the International Whaling Convention. Undoubtedly there is for the moment some administrative simplicity in simply exempting conventional whaling from the provisions of the Whaling Act. That may be satisfactory for a time while activities in the fisheries zone, by the present agreement, can be carried out only by Australia. The legislation will be inadequate in future if Australia should withdraw from the Convention or if the parties should set quotas to which we are not prepared to adhere. There is no reason why the Government could not do what it wished to now by using the provisions of the Fisheries Act to apply to all the whating, making such provision as would be consistent with the Convention. The legislation should be reviewed again as quickly as possible after the royal commission reports. That is the Opposition's case. Because this is a cognate debate, as provided for within the Standing Orders I now move as an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Fisheries Amendment Bill: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not opposing the Bill, the House calls upon the Government to ensure that the guidelines determined by the Australian Fisheries Council in January 1977, to control foreign participation and give first priority industry, are strictly observed'.",98
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"Is the amendment seconded? Dr Jenkins-Yes , Mr Deputy Speaker. I second the amendment.",99
180,Mr DRUMMOND,SHIPPING FREIGHTS," I should Uke to speak firstly about the WhaUng Amendment Bill and particularly comment on the amendment proposed by the Opposition. I think it is noteworthy that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) while speaking on this subject did not even pronounce the name of the town involved as the people in Western Australia do. He called it AU-bany; people in Albany or in Western Australia caU it Albany. I suggest that he knows as much about the whaling industry as he knows about how to pronounce the name of the town. He may not be aware that a great deal of activity is going on within the fishing industry in the area of Albany. He suggested that just by making another amendment which proposes to guarantee increased marine resources, employment in the Albany region would be improved. He overlooks the fact that today a very large fish factory, supported by three trawlers that have come out from Great Britain, is almost commissioned. That represents a total investment of some $11.5 m. This does not necessarily take up the unemployment in this regional town. We cannot say that because we wtil do this, therefore the unemployment situation is solved. In response to the proposed amendment I should like to say a few words about the whaling industry in Western Australia. While the Whaling Amendment Bill may be basically of a technical nature it necessarily raises an issue of basic concern to Albany and the electorate of Forrest. A viable, responsible and vital industry in the town of Albany has come under increasing threat from outside pressure that is well-intended but invariablytil-informed.I suggest that that is the case with the Australian Labor Party. I remind honourable members that the Cheynes Beach WhaUng Company is the second largest single employer of labour in Albany. Of its 105 employees only 10 are engaged on a casual basis. Directly or indirectly over 100 families depend for their livelihood on the whaling industry. If it is forced to close down, there is no absolute guarantee of immediate re-employment of those people. Another aspect of the fishing industry is the local cannery. It is in some difficulty at the to the local moment. It has been suggested that the anticipated development of deep sea trawling will solve the employment problem. This ignores the essential difference between trawling and whaUng. With trawUng men can be at sea for up to 50 days, whereas with whaling the catches work on a daily basis. The people of Albany made their feelings very clear when expensively equipped protesters from interstate and from overseas tried to disrupt the whaling operations last year. On April 24 of this year the Albany Advertiser reported that the Albany Conservation Society had deleted from its platform all reference to the phasing out of whaling, principally because of concern for workers in the Albany region but also perhaps because they live a Uttle closer to it and they understand the proposition that the International Whaling Commission and the whalers put forward. It is unfortunate that other conservation bodies choose to ignore the conservation of jobs. That is an overlooked but vital factor in preserving the quaUty of life in rural areas. The conservation movement must learn to develop a social conscience. Also it is not helpful to suggest that the Cheynes Beach whaling installation can be converted into a marine laboratory when scientists have declared the site to be unsuitable and when adequate laboratory facilities already exist in Western Australia and throughout Austraha generally. Whilst the importance of whaling to the people of Albany is obvious, the general econworth omic significance of the industry is worthy comment. The chief products derived from varieties whaling are sperm oil andfishmeal. Very little of the animal is wasted. Sperm oil has a vital use in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, in high temperature/pressure situations it necessary additive to fossil fuel oils to produce viscosity. No matter what is said, no other oil is produced which has the range of sperm oti. Some oils produced have one-third of the range, but other oil produced in the world has the range of sperm oil in pressure/temperature situations. from the jojoba bean is not, for reasons, a viable substitute, as stocks will be used rather as a substitute for more expensive materials. As a protein source, whale meal is important stock and poultry feed supplement, supplying some 10 per cent of Western second Australia's needs. To substitute fish meal would be to divert a valuable food source away from human consumption-a n action of questionable morahty in an undernourished world. Despite the validity of these arguments, would be hard to justify whating if indeed the operations of the Cheynes Beach company were leading to the destruction of sperm whales as species. But the facts must be seen in perspective. The company operates under the stringent ditions laid down by the International Whaling Commission, whose very objective is to control over-exploitation of the whale. Endangered species are protected, and other species, notably the sperm whale, are harvested under the prinusually ciple of maximum sustainable yield. Maximum on sustainable yield is related to the number young males and females which may be taken intelligence without preventing the natural increase in the tifically. numbers of the species. Whales smaller than 9 metres or larger than 13.6 metres cannot be taken, and are not taken.",99
181,Mr COHEN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,Who polices it?,100
182,Mr DRUMMOND,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"International inspectors. At Cheynes Beach whaling station young man from America who is a member of the International Whaling Commission, although America is not a whaling nation. Howbefore ever, the American Department of Agriculture sent an inspector to Albany. He has oversight over everything that is done at the Albany station. The maximum sustainable yield concept protects both young whales and the mature adults of reproductive age. The initial depletion of stocks a generation ago has resulted in larger food reserves, which in turn has resulted in more rapid reproduction and maturity, with more young animals entering the population. It is noting also that the harvesting of more nuof merous species assists depleted and endangered by reducing pressure on food resources. The main purpose of the Bill is to enable the and Commonwealth Government to police the conis a ventions of the International Whaling Commission within the new 200-milefishingzone. It therefore enables Australia to play its full part in a process of responsible environment manageno ment. Under the terms of the IWC conventions, so long as member nations abide by its strict conOil ventions, such fishing zones are open to whahng economic fleets of those nations. Criticism is often made of the killing methods an used in whaling, yet an explosive harpoon causes a death that is almost instantaneous. Even if a harpoon is necessary, the whale does not suffer for more than a few minutes. It seems inconceivable to criticise methods that are just as humane as are those used in abattoirs around the country. Indeed, the whale does not have to endure the smell of blood and the sense of panic it that sheep and catde may experience in an abattoir. Nevertheless, research, with Australia in the forefront continues towards finding yet more hua mane methods of killing whales. Nature is itself cruel and does not allow animals, in their wild constate, to decline into peaceful old age. Finally, it would be futile to debate the question whether all killing of whales, endangered or not, is immoral. Attitudes to the subject are determined on an emotional rather than a factual basis. I would merely state that those of who claim that whales have an immensely high have yet to prove their point scienIt is my belief that whales are a valuable natural resource, to be studied, respected and responsibly harvested for the benefit of mankind. The Bill enables Austraha to continue to play its part in the environmental management program of the IWC and to continue to foster an industry that, although it has a small effect on whale stocks, is of considerable importance to the there is a south-west of my State. Turning to the other major Bill that we have us tonight, the Fisheries Amendment Bill 1978,1I have quite a deal of sympathy with the amendment that the Opposition has moved to it. The only difficulty I have is that it seeks to the motion for the second reading by substituting for all words after 'That' the following words: whilst not opposing the Bill, the House calls upon the Government to ensure that the guidelines determined by the Australian Fisheries Council in January 1977, to control foreign participation and givefirstpriority to the local industry, are strictly observed. I know that the guidelines determined by the Council form a valuable document but I am not sure what input there was to its decision of January 1977 to adopt them. I suggest that if the Council were to have an opportunity to review the document it would have a lot more to contribute to it. To tie the Government down to strictly observing the guidelines in that document appears to me to be somewhat restrictive. The Government will certainly make its attitude known, but at this time the Opposition's proposal would appear not to be acceptable. I turn now to the amendment to the Fisheries Act. I trust that the creation of a 200 mile Austrahan fishing zone will herald-a great new era for the Cinderellafishingindustry of Austraha. The fishing industry has not enjoyed steady or substantial government support. It has not attracted the attention of private banks and the lending institutions to any marked degree. There has been tittle incentive for Australians to venture to new fishing areas not yet proven. That situation is changing rapidly since new markets, at home and abroad, have begun to emerge and since the 200 mile economic zone declarations in other areas of the world have reduced the available fishing areas for some of the high consuming nations. Speaking of markets, I point out that Australia imports fish products worth $70m a year. So, there is a great deal that our industry, with a litde bit of encouragement, can gain in this country. This situation is a great challenge to the Austhese trahan fishing industry and to the Commonments wealth Government to see that this vast new of responsibihty is developed and managed sibly to the basic benefit of the Australian fishing industry and, of course, to the Australian people. Our industry and government will have to assess the resources of the Australian fishing zone determine the total allowable catches of those sources. It is our responsibility to manage these resources to ensure that they are conserved optimum use of mankind, now and in the future. It is a massive undertaking. The urgency of task is demonstrated by many reported subShipton) missions from countries or organisations wishing to have fishing rights or joint ventures estabwill lished in our area of responsibility. I recommend amend that we hasten slowly in making arrangements involvingfishingpersonnel from other countries. At all times we should effectively canvass our own industry for its assessment of the implications and decisions which are made. With some forms of practical encouragement by the Government, our industry may be able to utilise different areas. Practical assistance has been demonstrated by the Government in the recent announcement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Lynch) in conjunction with the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) that a relaxation of present vessel import policy will enable Australianfishermento obtain large, second-hand fishing vessels from overseas for developmental work in Australia. I would like to see this policy expanded. For too long the fishing industry has been subsidising the shipbuilding industry of Australia which has been retarding the growth of what could be a wealth producing primary industry and which will, in the future, employ many hundreds of people. To prop up an industry which, by any international standards, is inefficient is not my idea of good economic management. There are obvious gaps in thefinancewhich, in the coming period, will work to the detriment of the local industry. Funding by the Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia and by the Primary Industries Bank will provide substantial assistance which has not hitherto been available and which will be critical to the development of the fishing industry in its new found responsibilities. There are many other aspects of interest in the amendment and in the whole question about the Australian Government taking the responsibility to create a 200-mile fishing zone around Australia. I am conscious of the fact that further speakers on this Bill from the Government side of the House will be covering matters and enlarging on some of the comwhich I have made in my brief speech toarea night. The honourable member for EdensenMonaro (Mr Sainsbury) who is listed to speak later in the debate is chairman of the subcommittee of the rural committee of back bench members of the Liberal Party. He, with other and members of the committee, has investigated and remade a fact finding study of this matter. I am delighted that he will be speaking later in this defor bate because he will have the opportunity to cover the areas that I have not been able to the cover. The honourable member for Higgins (Mr is a well known authority on the fishing industry and on surveillance problems and he be covering those subjects on behalf of Government members as the debate proceeds.",100
183,Mr JACOBI,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"I rise to support the Bill and also to support the amendments because I think they are constructive and logical amendments. I shall confine my remarks to the Fisheries Amendment Bill. With Australia's 20,000 kilometre coastline being the second largest coastline of any country, the Australian fishing industry welcomes this amendment to the Fisheries Act to extend Australian jurisdiction over foreign fishermen to 200 naudcal miles from the Australian coastline. It is a move which has been taken already by other nations and it could lead to the eventual declaration of a full source zone giving Australia control of off-shore oil and natural gas reserves. It is a move which will highlight the appalling inadequacies of the Australian defence system and the inefficiency of the long-ignored Australianfishingindustry. In spite of our immense coastline Australia does not rank among even the first SO fishing nations and its catch amounts to only about thousandth of the total world catch. The Ausstates: tralian fishing industry employs about 18,000 fishermen which is about 0.4 per cent of the total the work force. It is characterised by coastal and other commonly localised operations. seems to be controlled by marketing and deThis mand problems and, very noticeably, by the scarcity of large vessels capable of working the high seas. Of the 9,000 commercial vessels Australia, 70 per cent are less than 9 metres in length. Only 2 per cent are more than 21 metres in length. The greater part of the new region sists of deep oceanic waters. There are just over 150 registered land-based processing plants, 80 per cent of which have throughput of less than 1,000 tonnes and employ basically or predominantly casual labour. In 1975-76 the Australian fisheries catch was valued at about $150m. It is estimated that the gross value offisheriesproduction for 1976-77 was in excess of $200m. Over the decade from 1965 to 1976 the value offisheriesproduction grew by 11 per cent annually, or twice the the growth in the rural industries. Although nearly all 'swimming' fish caught by Australian fishermen are consumed domestically there is still a considerable gap between the Australian catch and domestic requirements and in 1976-77 fish imports were valued at $ 113m. The extento sion of the 200-mile zone is estimated to save Australia about $20m in fish imports and will substantially increase exports which in were valued at $144m. The current Australian catch is estimated at just over 110,000 tonnes weight. It is calculated that foreign fishermen take off a further 50,000 tonnes in Australia's prospective 200-mile zone. However, if Australia's catch were to increase drastically, obviously the cost of production would have to be kept to a minimum if we were to effectively penetrate export markets. As the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) stated in his second reading speech, Australian coastal waters are not ideally suited for fishing. Nevertheless there are substantial newfishresources within the 200-mile zone. The existing in-shore fisheries are already almost refully exploited but the demersalfisheriesof the shelf provide substantial opportunities for expansion, particularly in northern waters. In addition, thefisheriesof the pelagic and mid-water species of the shelf seem capable of expansion. However, even in anticipating a doubling of the Australian fish catch, which is quite likely, once the 200-mile zone is introduced, the industry will still be unable to harvest the allowable catch. oneThe United Nations Law of the Sea convention Where a coastal state does not have the capacity to harvest entire allowable catch it shall through agreements or arrangements, give other states access to the surplus of Development the allowable catch. means that Australia will inevitably have to grant fishing rights to other nations, working on under Australian control and conditions. in Whether one regards this aspect as an opportunity for Australia to strengthen its trade bargaining power with other nations which rely conheavily on theirfishingindustries and which will seek to fish in our waters or whether it is to be used as a source of revenue through the issuing of licences, the fact is that it creates a serious proba lem. In deciding conditions under which other nations should be permitted to fish within the zone, three main conditions are involved: Firstly, support for the Australian economy and assistance to the industry in developing the capability to utilise these resources; secondly, proper management of the resources; and thirdly, assistance in acquiring the knowledge necessary to rate of establish good management practices. Perhaps the best solution would be for our fisheries to enter into joint ventures with those countries that can provide technology and expertise, which would in time enable our industry take over the venture itself. An example of this is to be found in the northern prawn fishery which started in 1968 as a number of joint ven1976-77 tures between Australia and Japane.se companies. Thefisheryis now wholly operated live by Australians but the prawns continue to go to Japan. However there is a major problem in implementing any of the above considerations as our authorities possess very Uttle knowledge of Australian fish resources. In fact other nadons such as Taiwan, Japan and Soviet Russia have more accurate esdmates offishstocks within the Austrahan 200-mUe zone than we have. I suggest that that places those countries in an advantageous posidon when negotiating with us over fishing rights. Furthermore, it would be difficult for us properly to managefishresources if accurate information as to what resources exist were not available. At present about 100 scientists are engaged in fisheries research and investigation, of which about 75 per cen work with the management of inshore Statefisheries.The total amount spent on fishing research by government and industry is only about $6m, or just over 3 per cent of the $200m catch landed in the year ended June last year. Obviously if Australia is to obtain the knowledge which wiU be needed for proper management of this extended zone it will be essential that the following steps are taken: Firstly, the number of scientists should be substantially increased; secondly, adequate and reliable catch and effort data, facUities for work, and technical staffon board should be required of vessels taking part in thefishery;thirdly, a properly planned program of exploratory fishing should be undertaken; and finally, the provision of one or more properly equippedfisheriesresearch vessels capable of undertaking deep water cruises should be put in hand immediately. These provisions wtil require the additional expenditure of at least 50 per cent to 100 per cent of that already spent onfisheriesresearch, but is an expenditure that the Government must bear if we are to have the knowledge needed to protralian vide a basis for the management of an extended zone. Unless proper controls can be imposed good from the beginning, serious over-fishing could easily occur before sufficient knowledge has built up to place the catch Umits on a sound scientific basis. This is particularly so as since World War II there has been substantial overSovietfleetwould investment in the fishing industry on a world wide basis which has led to too many vessels that chasing too few fish and fleets ranging far afield in an attempt to recoup investment. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of United Nations estimated in 1976 that the world harvest of aquatic animals and plants reached about 72 million tonnes with stocks, of some species of fish having been seriously depleted. One example of this is the North Sea herring which countries were warned to stop catching over two years ago because the research instiobviously tutions feared stocks were at a state where they might not be able to recover from further depletions. This practice was not stopped, regrettably, and only a British ban in the United Kingdom 200-mile limit forced the European Economic Community herringfishersto follow. The warnings are now out that it may not be safe to resumefishingin that area before 1979. Canada has also faced problems from foreign water fleets of large high capacity factory and freezer stern trawlers fishing into stocks of cod, haddock, redfish herrings and mackerel off its coast outside the 12-mile limit. To the Canadian fishing communities this was what they termed 'raid fishing'. Describing the pattern Le Blanc, the Canadian Minister of Fisheries and the Environment, said: In a consistent pattern one stock after another has been fished down. In each case the sequence began with an explosive increase in fishing effort by overseas fleets, resulting first in rapid increase in catch but followed invariably by a drastic decline. At this point the fleets shifted their attention to other fish working their way through the traditional species to less desirable and therefore previously untouched stocks. The Government should take any necessary action to ensure that a similar situation does not occur within our fishing waters. The Soviet Union is seeking afisheryagreement with us and has made specific overtures to participate, alone with Australian partners, in fishing within Australia's proposed 200-mile zone. The Sovietfishingfleet is by far the largest in the world. It is almost six times as large as the next biggestfishingfleet-the Japanese. Might I suggest to the Minister that my assessment is that it the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is probably interested more in obtaining access to Ausports than in gaining the right to fish within ourfishingzone. I believe there is a very reason for that. Port facilities should enable the Sovietfleetto fish over an extensive area of been southern waters by enabling vessels to be serviced and crews to be rested and rotated. It is highly possible that exploitation of krill by the be greatly facilitated by access to Australian ports. I believe it will become clear they want to exploit krill in Antarctic waters. I now wish to turn to the problems associated with the surveillance of our 200-mile zone. the WhUst the Minister reassures us in his second reading speech that the Government is currently developing proposals to upgrade our coastal surveillance and enforcement effort, I am not perhaps as confident as he is that this will be so. If surveillance is to be carried out thoroughly a major upgrading of Australian coastal defences is required. The Minister has given no definite assurance in this matter. His statement that 'The Government is currently developing proposals to upgrade our coastal surveillance and enforcement effort' tells us nothing as to how this will be done, whether the proposals will be adequate and whether we can expect any such upgrading. At present Australia does not even possess the facilities to patrol adequately its 12-mile zone, and once this legislation is enacted there will be an extra area almost the size of Australia to be patrolled. It is all very well for this Government to talk about increased penalties for foreign boats caught poaching inside Australian waters, but there is little value in such penalties if we do not have the means by which to enforce such laws. I will not utilise my knowledge as a member of a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which is looking at Australian territorial boundaries including Antarctica. I think it would be unfair of me to do so. Suffice to say, that the sub-committee went to Darwin to take evidence. We went on board some Taiwanese boats that had been impounded in Darwin. One thing struck me as being urgently needed. I believe the officer in charge of the Royal Australian Navy in Darwin would support my proposition. I regret to say that what I am concerned about is absent in this legislation which is concerned with the establishment of a 200-mile fishing zone. Under present procedures-this may not be known to many honourable members-mor e often than not the arrest of a foreign fishing boat takes the arresting Royal Australian Navy patrol boat out of patrol duty whilst it is escorting the fishing boat to the nearest port where there is a magistrate and in many cases, regrettably, it is out for the duration of the court proceedings. The commander of the patrol boat is required to give evidence in person in the Northern Territory and Western Australian courts, although in Queensland a written deposition is sufficient. Australia has only six patrol boats to cover the entire Australian coast from Geraldton to Townsville. So their detention in Port for lengthy court proceedings can reduce their patrol activity to almost nil. The Government ought to apply itself to that problem. Also, the practice of forfeitedfishingboats back to Taiwanese owners at low prices lessens the deterrent effect of arrest. We badly need less cumbersome arrest and detention procedures if we are to have an effective surveillance system, particularly in our northern waters. The arrest on 6 February of this year of the Japanese squid trawler, the Eikyu Maru, for operating within the 12-mile limit off the northern coast of Tasmania indicates that surveillance must be maintained all round Australia. Obviously, the waters most vulnerable to foreign encroachment are those between Geraldton and Townsville. These areas are already being exploited by fishermen from Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, Japan and the maritime province of the Soviet Union, even in areas inside the 12-mile zone where the waters are generally less than 200 metres deep and contain the valuable demersalfisheries.Even after this legislation is passed, certain difficulties may be experienced with Taiwan in view of Australia's lack of diplomatic relations with that country. But I suppose that we could overcome that. Already Taiwanese fishing boats are responsible for most of the infringements of Australia's 12-mile fishing zone. They catch in excess of 80,000 tonnes per year in northern waters. As most foreign vessels operating in northern waters pass through either the Makassar or Manipa Straits, it would appear obvious that cooperation with Indonesian marine traffic authorities will be paramount. At present the equipment used by the defence forces for surveillance is designed primarily for other military purposes. The Defence Force personnel rightly regard such duties as a diversion from the role for which they were trained. The question of surveillance of the 200-mile zone surrounding Australian territories, particularly the Antarctic where surveillance presently is virtually non-existent, is also one which will have to be examined. We have yet to introduce enabling or proclaiming legislation concerning the Antarctic. Just what steps need to be taken to upgrade our surveillance and patrol methods is a matter which should be thoroughly investigated, and for which practical solutions ought to be implemented. With the passing of this legislation, this will be necessary not only to protect our fishing resources but also to control illegal immigration and smuggling. The development of the 200-milefishingzone may not be costless, as many people seem to assume, but I believe that it will be of considerable national benefit, selling provided that the Government provides the necessary assistance for Australia to take full advantage over the area to which this Bill gives it jurisdiction. I support the legislation and I support the amendment.",102
184,Mr SHIPTON,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"I speak tonight in support of the legislation before the House, namely, the Fisheries Amendment Bill, the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Amendment Bill and the Whaling Amendment Bill. The Fisheries legislation extends the Australianfishingjurisdiction to 200 miles beyond the low water mark by creating a 200-milefishingzone. This is a totally new development for Australia. The idea and concept of a 200-milefishingzone is part of the development of international law on 200-mile zones. I believe that the legislation before the House tonight is thefirststep towards Australia ultimately declaring a 200 mile exclusive economic zone covering living and non-living resources. The exclusive economic zone concept is an important one and emerges from the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. The informal composite negotiating text of the Sixth Session in all probability will be the basis upon which nations declare these zones in the future, even if there is not ultimate international agreement to that convention. The concepts raised go beyond the fisheries legislation which we have before us tonight: For instance, they extend to the question of the exploitation of petroleum and other hydrocarbon resources-manganes e nodules, perhaps, and the seabed extraction of minerals. Perhaps in the fullness of time amendments to other legislation will be necessary, such as the Seas and Submerged Lands Act, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act and the Whaling Act, for which an amending Bill is before us tonight, as is an amending Bill to the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Act. Perhaps this will extend even to the Coral Sea Islands Act. At an international level thisfishinglegislation will involve negotiations with a number of neighbouring countries because, in all probability, we will have overlapping zones. Currently the Government is negotiating with Papua New Guinea concerning the Torres Strait border and economic zones andfishingzones will be a part of those negotiations. We will need to negotiate with the Solomon Islands, with Indonesia and with France concerning New Caledonia and the New Hebrides. I am confident that these will be amicable and successful negotiations but, remembering the history of boundaries, we know that one has to protect one's national interests to the ultimate. I look forward to the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs  with Papua New Guinea on the Torres Strait border, which I think is due to be presented within a fortnight. Currently Australia claims only a three mile territorial sea. This is a matter of history. Initially nations claimed three miles because the old range of a cannon shot from a sailing warship was three miles. Now it is commonly accepted at international law that 12 miles is a proper claim of territorial seas. It is my view that Australia should forthwith and immediately make a claim of 12 miles of territorial sea. I shall be very interested to see the outcome of negotiations with Papua New Guinea concerning the Torres Strait area because I believe that Australia clearly has the right to claim a 12 mile territorial sea around its islands, both inhabited and uninhabited, in that area. The question of where to draw the basetines-the lines from which the 200 miles extend-is important to this legislation, to the petroleum legislation and to the seas and submerged lands legislation. I believe that we ought to be adopting a fairly progressive approach rather than a conservative approach to the question of where we draw those base lines. A number of matters need to be considered. The Commonwealth has power to declare historic bays, I think under the Seas and Submerged Lands Act. I believe that we ought to consider declaring Shark Bay in Western Australia such a bay, as well as the Spencer Gulf and St Vincent Gulf. Where we draw the closing lines of this is important.",104
185,Mr HODGMAN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"Hear , hear!",105
186,Mr SHIPTON,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"I hear the honourable member for Denison supporting what I have to say. It might interest him to know that a fairly conservative decision was made in relation to Tasmania, where the Maria Island in Great Oyster Bay was excluded from the drawing of a base line. In fact, the internal waters of Tasmania were lessened by that decision. I believe that we have to take the maximum that we can under international law in such claims and, perhaps, even redraw that particular base line. The new informal composite negotiating text will allow us to take these generous interpretations. In fact, so far as Western Australia is concerned, it will enable us-becaus e of the definitions concerning reefs near islands-to claim parts of the Scott Reef that we presently cannot claim under international law. Honourable members might remember that some time ago a Russian ship was illegally in that area. There are parts of that area over which perhaps we do not have jurisdiction. The progressive interpretation of the base line rules wtil enable us to claim jurisdiction. Another area where the question of base lines is vital is in the Great Barrier Reef area of north Queensland. Whilst, at the present time there is a 12-milefishingzone, part of the Reef itself still is, as I understand it, in international waters. Whilst there is an International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil concerning and covering the Great Barrier Reef, there are probably still parts of the Reef-whils t the islands and keys come under the Queensland Coast Islands Act-ove r which we do not have jurisdiction. I doubt that all the Reef area is in fact pan of Queensland and part of our territorial sea at the present time. So, therefore, we have to decide whether to draw a base line around the Great Barrier Reef or on the eastern side. I believe quite frankly that we have to make the maximum claims possible under international law. The Great Barrier Reef must be within the exclusive jurisdiction of Australia. We must make, as I have said, the maximum possible claims. The foreign policy implications of this fishing legislation and the ultimate zone legislation that, in the fuUness oftimeI trust will follow, are quite enormous. The world is looking at us. It is worth reflecting that the rest of the world sees us, and particularly our near neighbours, as a European enclave in the Asian region of the globe. Those are the facts with which we must live and which we must understand. We must recognise our responsibUities. The world is looking at us: It is looking at the resources that we have and at the fish that we have. The honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi), who I thought made a sensible contribution to the debate, talked about the other nations that arefishingin the area already. The world is sharing our resources at present. We need to determine our approach to them. I must admit that I disagree with the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) because I believe it is totally unnecessary. I wonder whether the honourable gendeman in fact has read the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair). In his amendment, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, states thatfirstpriority should be given to local industry. If he reads the ter's speech, he wtil find that the Minister stated: . . . Australians are unable or perhaps do not wish harvest all of the total allowable catches, we wdl be obligation to allow other nationals to take that surplus. He stated further: Accordingly, we will have the right to determine who fishes these surplus stocks and under what terms and conditions. But the most important point is that only when Australians are not in a position to exploit fishery wtil recourse be had to foreign expertise. That is why I wonder why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition moved his amendment. Of course we will have maximum Australian participation. He asked the Government to speU out its policies. Well, the poUcy is in the Minister's second reading speech. It is there for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to read and to understand. Incidentally, I thought I noted some conflict between what the honourable member for Hawker and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said about joint ventures. I thought that the honourable member for Hawker took a more liberal and, quite frankly, a more sensible interpretation. I wonder whether he really supports the amendment. The foreign policy implications to which I have referred are wide. We need to be outwardlooking. We need to look out towards the world. We have a responsibility to provide to the world these resources-thes efish-in our sea. We cannot be selfish. Some honourable members who have spoken in this debate have said that these resources are part of the common heritage of mankind. WhUst I do not adopt that definition necessarily, I believe that we must be aware of our responsibUities in this area, in the same way that we are aware of our responsibilities in relation to uranium, coal, iron ore, et cetera. We have a moral responsibiUty in this continent and in this part of the world. Australia has a small population and it is rich in resources. As I have mentioned, it is an enclave of Europeans in the Asian region. We have a moral responsibility to sell to the world on fair terms and conditions what we have. We must recognise our international obligations and responsibilities as well as protect our own interests. We must remember that the history books are full of cases in which people went and took things that others would not sell them on fair terms. That is why I believe that Australia needs to be outward looking. We must also remember the position in relation to our negotiations with the European MinisEconomic Commumty. I think that the EEC, with its attitudes to trade and its protective barriers, is becoming inward looking. It is looking to back towards the middle ages. Europe is starting under an to look inward rather than outward. If this happens in Europe, Australia must provide an example in relation to our resources offish in the 200-mile off-shore area and share those resources with the world. We seek access to markets in Europe for our agricultural products and want the Multilateral Trade Negotiations to include them. We must allow other countries to fish a off the Australian coast on fair terms and conditions, and as the Minister recognises, we must protect the Australianfishingindustry. However, we must recognise also that that industry has a responsibiUty to grasp the challenge before it, the challenge now made avaUable to it to exploit these resources. It is important that the industry does this in the nauonal interest. The honourable member for Hawker referred to the question of surveillance. At this stage, veillance is vital. If Australia is to claim jurisdicpartisan tion over this area, we must have the ability to survey the area and to enforce that jurisdiction. The honourable member mentioned a patrol in which he took part in the Northern Territory. was on that patrol with him. In fact, I think that at one stage the honourable member even took control of the helm of the boat and distinguished himself in that task. In all seriousness, I believe that we must upgrade in a major way what we are doing in regard to air and sea surveillance. understand that at present in the north of Australia we have one Dakota aircraft-o n the day we were there one engine on that aircraft was inoperative and another one had to be flown from Sydney-and three Tracker aircraft, I think. Mr Neil-That would be the maximum.",105
187,Mr SHIPTON,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"The honourable member for St George tells me that that would be the maxiif mum number of Tracker aircraft. Probably one of the aircraft would be out of service all the time. We also have two or three Navy patrol boats. That is a totally inadequate force to vice our national interest in the north Australia, and it must be upgraded. Mr MCLean-What are you recommending?",107
188,Mr SHIPTON,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"I would recommend as a minimum a doubting of the 15 patrol boats In which have been ordered, and in conjunction with that we must buy aircraft that can ordinate and co-operate in a tandem operation with these patrol boats in air and sea surveilinasmuch lance. That is vital. Mr MCLean-How much will it cost?",107
189,Mr SHIPTON,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,The cost is unimportant. We must protect Australia's national interests. Mr MCLean-That is what the Treasurer told me.,107
190,Mr SHIPTON,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"The Treasurer (Mr Howard) was must realise, as we all must realise, that we protect Australia's national interest. I believe that this can be done at a modest cost. I am glad to have the support of the honourable member for St George (Mr Neil) and the honourable member for Perth (Mr MCLean). In the time recause maining to me, I would like to comment on some of the points made by the Deputy Leader of Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) in regard to case of Oteri and Oteri v. the Queen. The honourable member is a knowledgeable gentlemarks man and most of what he said tonight showed that we can have a bipartisan debate in this Parliament. I challenge the members of the Press gallery listening to the debate to report in the surPress tomorrow that there has been, in fact, a bidebate in this Parliament, and that both parties can agree in part. I refer to his comments on Oteri and Oteri v. the Queen. He was talking about that in relation to the jurisdiction of the I Privy Council on appeals from State courts. I do not think that is the issue concerning that case. I think the issue is that the Government needs to take a look at the situation of the Admiralty jurisdiction. In that case as I recall- I stand to be corrected-the Privy Council held I that a 1958 United Kingdom or British statute, the Theft Act, applied in the Australian Admiralty jurisdiction and that was because of previous legislation. To me that is totally unacceptable. I believe that we must look at the basis of the Admiralty jurisdiction in Australia; we must examine the situation whether the State and Federal courts and which of them have jurisdiction and, need be, negotiate with the States and act under the Statute of Westminster to enact Australian Admiralty jurisdiction. I refer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to the Statute of Westserminster which is clear. It says in section 3: of . . . that the Parliament of a dominionThat is, Australia: . . . has full power to make laws having extra-territorial operation. sub-clause 2 there is clear provision for power to repeal in this case the Admiralty jurisdiction coor amend any such Act of the United Kingdom Parliament. So, what he said I believe is incorrect as we clearly have the power; it is a matter of sitting down and working out that jurisdiction. I am pleased to support the legislation before the House.",107
191,Mr COHEN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"Before I speak on the Bills, I thank the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wallis) for very kindly stepping aside to allow me to speak tonight. He scheduled to speak but, as I will not be here must on the next Tuesday when this Parliament sits, and as the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Staley) has assured us that this debate will continue then, the honourable member for Grey who is very interested in this Bill beof the interest in his electorate in fishing, will be the first speaker for the Opposition when the the debate resumes on that day. I personally the thank him very much for this kindness. In speaking on these Bills, I concentrate my reon the Whaling Amendment Bill. In recent years there has been considerable interest and controversy concerning whaling and Australia's continued participation as a whaling nadon, so much so that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has announced that an inquiry into the whaling industry will commence in Albany on 31 July. However, there is no question where the majority of the Australian peoples' sympathies lie in relation to this question. An Australian National Opinion Polls survey conducted in December last year showed that 66 per cent of Australians were opposed to whaling, 19 per cent were in favour and 15 per cent were unsure. Even in Western Australia where the sole remaining whaling station in Australia is located, those 'for' and 'against' were evenly divided, 39 per cent against and 41 per cent in favour of whaling. Even on a party political basis there was virtually no difference. Sixty-four per cent of Liberal voters were against whaling and 68 per cent of Labor voters were against whaling. I am not one of those people who believe that a public opinion poll should necessarily be the final arbitrator on a government action. If it were we would not need to have elections but simply conduct opinion polls and act accordingly. However there aretimeswhen the public may not have the technical know-how or the full range of information necessary to form a considered opinion, and there are occasions when governments have to take actions which are unpopular and hope that those actions, whilst unpopular are in the best interests of the nation. I have a lot of sympathy for the position of the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Drummond). It is in his electorate, at Albany, in Western Australia that the sole remaining whaling station is located. He has spoken out strongly in support of the whaling industry and on behalf of the hundred-odd families who depend upon whaling for their livelihood. I do not doubt his sincerity, I do not blame him for being a strong advocate in support of the welfare of the workers in the industry and for the general welfare of the town of Albany. The Australian Labor Party is equally committed",107
192,Mr SHIPTON,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it proper for the Opposition spokesman on the environment to speak on Bills such as these and on the uranium Bills, as he did the other day, when he has not been either to Albany or to the Ranger uranium site?",108
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,Mr Armitage)Order! The honourable member will be aware that it is quite appropriate for a member of this Parliament to speak on any Bill before the House. The honourable member is aware that his was not a valid point of order. I ask that in future he not take points of order that do not have some element of validity in them.,108
194,Mr COHEN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,That is the son of stupid interjection we expect from some of the new boys over there.,108
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,Order! Instead of answering interjections the honourable member for Robertson will address himself to the debate,108
196,Mr COHEN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,When they have been in this place a litde longer they will start to understand that that sort of behaviour is childish. If they want me to interject every time somebody over there,108
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,Order! I ask the honourable member for Robertson to address himself to the debate and not to answer interjections. Mr Neil-Wastin g time.,108
198,Mr COHEN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,Ya p yap is on again. Do you want to speak in this debate or do you want to carry on with inane interjections?,108
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"Order! The honourable member for St George and the honourable member for Robertson will stop making exchanges across the floor of the House. I have called the honourable member for Higgins to order, and I ask the honourable member for Robertson to address himself to the debate.",108
200,Mr COHEN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"The Australian Labor Party is equally committed to seeing that Australian workers do not suffer economically or socially from changes that may occur because a nation, for a variety of reasons, decides that it wishes to discontinue an industry. I am not referring to the normal ebb and flow of prosperity that occurs in every industry from time to time. I am referring particularly to situations such as those that have occurred at Albany and on Fraser Island. The overwhelming majority of Australians, supported by the Government, came to the view that the activities being pursued in those regions were detrimental to the environment. I can understand the resentment of workers who suddenly find that they have lost their jobs or are in danger of losing their jobs because another section of the community, which is not directly affectedfinancially, demands that an industry be closed down. It is easy to ask somebody else to make a sacrifice that many people would not be prepared to make themselves if the roles were reversed. That is the dilemma in the vast majority of environmental disputes that occur. It is particularly true where an industry exists as distinct from debate about where a new industry is to be started up. We are talking about people who, with their families, have settled into an area and often have been there for many years. They have built a home, they have their children settled in schools, they have made friends and generally become part of a settled community. It is very natural for people who suddenly find that their whole way of life and their financial security is threatened to resent bitterly the actions of those whom they see as being responsible for their predicament. It is absolutely essendal for the debate about the environment to be rational and free of the abuse and vitriol that has been evident in recent years, and for both environmentalists and the Government to assure workers that they will not be disadvantaged financially by any decision to cease the operations of the industry in which ness workers' occupations are threatened. Any deconsequences cision to cease operations should be acpopulation companied by a total plan for reconstruction and back, not by vague promises. I have not had the of pleasure yet of visiting Albany but I hope to remsearch. edy that in the near future, in the same way as I will be visiting Fraser Island on the weekend after next. However, from what it, Albany is an extremely beautiful region with an enormous potential for tourism, which is another area for which I am responsible on behalf of the Opposition. I would not be so presumptuous as to suggest remedies from this distance. However, there are a wide variety of Species measures that could be introduced- I am not reBlue ferring here only to Albany but to other areasHumpback . . . . including substantial redundancy payments, the Right creation of alternative industries, job retraining Fin or job relocation. For example, I understand that Sei some 100 families are involved in Albany. If we Bryde's had made a $20,000 non-taxable payment to Sperm, male . . . . each of them it would have cost less than $2m Grey and it might have been worth it. If we have a senMinke sible approach to the problem-and we may have to have this debate in the future-perhap s that is the answer. I do not know. I am not so presumptuous as to suggest that know the answer sitting here in Canberra or in Gosford from where I come. I cannot believe that people are totally committed to whaling per se; they are committed to being employed and providing for their families. I feel sure that if can assure them that they will be adequately looked after they will be willing to sit down rationally to discuss the future of the industry. It is my aim over the next few years to try to find these sorts of solutions to the problems that have emerged in the progress versus environment debate. In the debate about whating of course there has been considerable disagreement about what has happened in the past and what is happening at the moment. One can accept that any figures cited must be subject to a considerable degree of inaccuracy. One can only accept or reject the figures of the scientific experts regarding the decimation of the whole population over the past 100 years. I shall quote- I am probably being selective in my quoting-fro m an article in the National Geographic by Victor B. Scheffer, Ph.D. in zoology, Chairman of the United States Marine Mammal Commission from 1973 to 1976, and a man who has devoted 40 years ofhis life to studying the whale. The article, which appeared in the December 1976 issue, stated: Not till the dawning of the age of environmental awarein the late 1960s did the public begin to see clearly the of abusive whaling. It had fragmented the of seven great whales-the blue, fin, grey, humpsei, right and bowhead.

201,Mr COHEN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"I thank the House. The blue, humpback, right, bowhead and grey have been so decimated that they are now protected I species. There were some interesting points in the article that are worth noting. It pointed out that whale populations are estimated by zoologists by analysing kills by size, age, sex, season and hunting area. It has been found that in a declining we population the catch-pe r unit of whaling effortalso declines as does the average age of the animals killed and the older whales become fewer. As I said before, it is difficult to assess who is telling the truth from the vast array of claims and counter claims regarding the threat to the world's whale populations. Mr Hyde-Differen t whales.",109
202,Mr COHEN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"I am not disagreeing with that, but there are various claims on all the different types of whales. However, I think one has to look at the motives and bonafidesof the major adversaries in this debate. Firsdy, let us look at the International Whaling Commission which was established in 1948. There are 16 member nations of the IWC-Australia , Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, South Africa, Great Britain, the United States of America and the United Soviet Socialist Republic. Of these, only Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Iceland, Japan, Norway and the USSR are whaling countries. To put it blundy, the IWC is primarily an organisation which acts as spokesman for the industry. Its object is 'the conservation, development and optimum utilisation of the whale resources'. It has no teeth and cannot enforce its own regulations. Foreign observers are supposed to be situated at every whaling station on every factory ship, theoretically to see that the Commission's rules are obeyed. Their reported infractions have decreased since the introduction of the use of observers. However, there are major weaknesses. Russia and Japan exchange observers but both countries are interested in maximising yields. No mechanism exists to enforce quotas. Member countries which disagreed with IWC decisions have merely to lodge objections within 90 days to free themselves of any obligation to abide by such decisions. Australia is currently acting on this escape clause with regard to the IWC decision to restrict the season for sperm whale hunting. I wish now to quote the words of some people who are not wild or radical but who are fairly conservative and who belong to very conservative organisations, one of which, incidentally, has just had the approval, the imprimatur, of the Prime Minister who is now I think a sponsor of the World Wildlife Fund. At the 1975 meeting of the IWC, Sir Peter Scott, Chairman of the World Wildlife Fund, spoke out strongly for a moratorium. He said: Through your courtesy, Mr Chairman, and that of the Commissioners, I and my conservation colleagues are allowed to come here, year after year, to express infiveminutes flat, the deep concern we share people ail over the world about the future of the great whales. Once more we're here putting our case for responsible conservation. We know that most of you agree with it, and that only a few do not. But when the results of your deliberations are made known, we find every year that the intransigent minority has once more prevailed. Yet already today we have heard several complacent comments about the Commission's conservation achievements. Gentlemen, the track record does not bear this out. I now wish to quote from articles which appeared in a few of Australia's newspapers, none of which are what one would call radical newspapers. In June 1977 the Sydney Morning Herald published an article to which I wish to refer in order to take up the point which the honourable member for Forrest mentioned before when he was talking about the maximum sustainable yields system. The article in the Sydney Morning Herald stated: The Commission bases its quotas on the maximum sustainable yield system propounded by Australia. But this system has been seriously challenged by conservationists supported by independent scientists from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. The FAO study has found that it is almost impossible to estimate whale numbers accurately as claimed by the commission, and says there are grave doubts about the whale reproduction rates assumed by the Commission's scientists. These serious doubts about whether man is hunting the whale species to extinction are sufficient cause for the commission to call a halt to whale killing throughout the world. The Melbourne Age of 30 November 1977 had this to say: The United States has taken a lead in the struggle to save the whale by closing down its whaling stations, banning the import of almost all whale products and pressing for a 10-year international moratorium on whaling. Australia's official attitude has so far been equivocal. On 2 June 1977 the Sydney Morning Herald had this to say: Australia's little-known position as one of the last major whaling countries will also be demonstrated to the world. Australia, then, has a unique opportunity to continue its leading role in whaling councils. Having been instrumental in establishing a control system for whale-killing, Australia should now take another step by supporting a ban, or at least a 10-year moratorium, on whaling. This would require a major revision by the Federal Government of our policy towards whaling. So far Australia has opposed US moves for a moratorium. But now is the time for Australia to reverse its stand and lead the way by declaring that it proposes to end its own whaling operations at Albany, Western Australia. The station is privately owned and there should be fair compenstion paid. As an industry, whaling contributes little of economic consequence to Australia. It earns a small export income from the sale overseas of sperm oil, whale meal stock feed and ambergris for scent manufacture. It employs about 90 people in a town which normally offers other employment opportunities. These insignificant benefits to the country will be made this year at the expense of slaughtering up to 624 of the most magnificent creatures of the animal kingdom. A great deal of scientific research suggests that whales are of high intelligence, perhaps second only to man in creation. They present no threat to man or to his other ocean with millions of other resources. I could go on quoting chapter and verse, but I would like to conclude with one small quotation from an article in the National Geographic. That article quoted the words of a Mr David Hill. I do not know that he is a person of great significance himself, but what he had to say was significant. Of the whaling industry itself this gentleman, who is a well-known conservationist, said: It is like leaving a rabbit to guard a lettuce patch. Debate interrupted.

203,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"Mr (Mr MILLAR Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",111
204,Mr WALLIS,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"On a number of occasions in this House I have raised the question of the Stuart Highway, that shocking piece of road, the main road to the Northern Territory, which runs from Port Augusta to Alice Springs. But it is not mainly about the road that I want to speak tonight. I want to refer rather to an incident that happened on that road yesterday afternoon. It was an accident such as people in that area, because of the increased number of tourist buses going through that area to Alice Springs, feared would happen. They were concerned that a bus would be involved in a major accident a long way from assistance. Honourable members may have heard over the radio or read in the newspaper this morning what happened. The Adelaide Advertiser described it as: 'One dead-2 0 hurt in bus-semi crash'. The accident happened yesterday afternoon in a very isolated locality. Coober Pedy is about 390 miles north-west of Port Augusta by road. Mount Willoughby, where the accident happened, is another 100 miles further on. Between Port Augusta and Alice Springs there are only two places where any medical attention is available-at the Woomera rocket range near Pimba and the Coober Pedy opal field, where there is a small hospital and medical centre. I raise this matter tonight to pay tribute to work of the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia. The report by the Adelaide Advertiser of the accident reads: There were 43 passengers in the bus. The chartered Greyhound bus rolled over after hitting the jack-knifed semi-trainer. The accident happened about two kilometres south of Mount Willoughby station about 1.30 p.m. That is approximately half way along the road between AUce Springs and Port Augusta and is in a very isolated situation. The report continued: The alarm was raised by outback radio from the station and the Royal Flying Doctor Service was alened at 2 p.m. An RFDS aircraft was at Tarcoola, about 300 kilometres ADJOURNMENT south of Mount Willoughby, and flew to the station immediately. Dr S. Hammond, from Pon Augusta, reached the scene about 3 p.m. and called for extra aircraft. A second RFDS plane from Port Augusta and two St John Ambulance aircraft from Whyalla also went to help. Dr Hammond stabilised the seriously injured at the scene while the aircraft flew five of those needing hospital treatment to Coober Pedy. The seriously injured were then flown to the Whyalla Hospital, where specialised facilities were available. The first of the two RFDS planes, a twin-engine Beechcraft Baron, arrived at Whyalla Airport at 10.30 p.m. with the seriously injured driver of the semi-trailer and a girl with a broken arm. That will give honourable members an idea of the way in which this service operates and why it is important to the people of that area. The outback area of South Australia is served by a Royal Flying Doctor Service at Port Augusta, with the back-up service of St John's Ambulance at Whyalla. The St John's Ambulance service was called in toflyto the scene, but I understand that the Flying Doctor aircraft were themselves able to handle the situation. People who have lived in the outback, as I have, along the east-west railway line realise the reliance that one must place on these aircraft, which are available when someone becomes sick. That service is especially appreciated when an accident occurs in a remote area where medical attention is not readily available and has to be flown in hundreds of miles. One can appreciate just what a magnificent job the Royal Flying Doctor Service does in the bush. Two books have been written about the Service. One, I remember, was Mantle of Safety. The name of another that I read quite recently slips my memory, but it was published to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the Service. The extent of its assistance to people in isolated areas has been increasing. Certainly for them it provides a mantle of safety. They know that if something does go wrong they the can call on it for assistance. There have been two occasions in my own life when I have had to take advantage of it. One instance quite recently involved illness and fortunately an aircraft was available. In one case a relative of mine was flown to Adelaide. Luckily, as we found out, he was not in a very serious condition. It is certainly a comfort for people in the outback areas to know that that service is operating. It certainly deserves the respect and support of everybody in Australia. While the people in the cities may not fully appreciate the service that is provided, the people in the country certainly do.",111
205,Mr BURR,SHIPPING FREIGHTS," I was absolState utely astounded to read in this morning's Merinto cury newspaper from Hobart a report about Tasmanian Treasurer and Acting Premier, Batt. I can only interpret his remarks as a admission that he is totally inefficient in administration, as is the State Government. Acdrain cording to that newspaper report Mr Batt I have been astounded at how some Government departinefficiencies. ments have sent me little chits saying sony we have overspent our budget by $2m this year, and expect smile. I can understand Mr Batt not being too happy. From the Commonwealth Government's point of view, all Mr Batt and his State colleagues can do is appeal to it for more and more money to cover up for their inefficiencies. So often in Tasmania, whenever any capital construction work needs to be done, the only defence the State Government has is to say: 'We have not got enough money from the Commonwealth'. Yet here, in effect, Mr Batt is saying that he is inefficient and misusing taxpayers' money. The State Government which he leads at the moment needs to be exposed for its inefficiency and bunghng. But what have we seen over the time the State Government has been in office? I ask honourable members to bear in mind that Mr Batt is saying that this situation has been going on for some years. The State Government came to office in 1972. One can only conclude from Mr Batt's statement that this waste of taxpayers' money has been going on for some years while the Labor Party has been in office. There was an agreement this year between the two governments that there would be a dollar for dollar subsidy to construct the Launceston General Hospital. At the last minute the State Government said: 'We are sorry, but we cannot fulfil our obligations because we have run out of money.' Yet this sort of waste is going on within the State Government administration. Honourable members may ask what happened. The $1.5m which was available from the Commonwealth Government could not be spent on the hospital and it could not be re-allocated to any other hospital in Australia.",112
206,Mr HODGMAN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,That is a public scandal.,112
207,Mr BURR,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"It is a public scandal, as my colleague from Denison has said. Members of the State Labor Party Government must be exposed to the public for the incompetent rabble that they are. Let us look at the State Government work which is going on in Tasmania. As my friend from Denison (Mr Hodgman) well knows, our roads urgently need repair. But what does the State Government say when we ask for some highways to be reconstructed or to be put usable order? It replies that it does not have the the money and that it has to get more money Mr from the Commonwealth. Does the State blatant Government want more money from the Comhis monwealth so that it can pour that down the through inefficient administration? It wants stated: the money to cover up its own admitted The State Government is appealing for all this money and yet urgent public me to works are going untended. Mr Batt stated: At the moment we have guaranteed SlOm, and loaned SlOm. That is where the money is going. It is a disgrace.",112
208,Mr HODGMAN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,It is like the Derwent Clipper.,112
209,Mr BURR,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"That is dead right. Public works in Tasmania are in urgent need. Some examples are the Launceston General Hospital, State highways, schools that are not being built, the Launceston ring road which the State Government says it cannot build and the second bridge over the Derwent River in Hobart. These are all urgent works, but the State Government says it does not have the money and that Canberra will not give it any more money. The State Government allows its departments to waste money, to pour it down the drain, and then appeals to the Commonwealth for more money. If the State Government departments are so inefficient, according to Mr Batt's own admission, it is high time that he called for the resignation of some of his Ministers who are obviously failing in their administration to a large degree and wasting taxpayers'money.",112
210,Mr HODGMAN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,He ought to resign himself.,112
211,Mr BURR,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"He should resign as State Treasurer, as the honourable member for Denison has said. However, his crowning glory came right at the end of this article where, to underline his inefficiency, the report states: Mr Batt called on the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce to offer advice on the best ways of raising revenue through taxation. If that is not an admission of inefficiency by a State government, I do not know what is. If the Tasmanian Government is so bereft of ability it should resign and allow the people of Tasmania to make a judgment on whether this inefficient rabble should continue in government wasting public money the way it is. It should resign and allow the people to make that decision rather than continue in office wasting money that has been raised from and made available by the taxpayers.",112
212,Dr KLUGMAN,SHIPPING FREIGHTS," I will not reply to the Laurel and Hardy team from Tasmania. The matter I raise concerns much more money than the amount they have spoken about in relation to Tasmania. I refer to the $700m invested in the New South Wales Permanent Building Society Ltd. To preface my story I refer to a company called Vam Ltd which was delisted by the Sydney Stock Exchange in 1971 and is now in receivership. Each year about a month before the meeting of creditors stories are floated suggesting that the company is about to strike oti, gold, uranium or some other bonanza. This never eventuates but as a result of these stories the company has been getting yearly extensions from the creditors. To indicate what is happening in relation to the NSW Permanent Building Society I wish to quote extensively from an article which appeared in the Australian Financial Review. The article reads in part: All the signs are evident that the differing factions the NSW Liberal Party are going to be righting ruthlessly over the control of the NSW Permanent Building Society. The establishment within the party will be attempting to keep the society out of the hands of the right wing, while the rightists will be throwing their weight behind certain selected candidates who have nominated to fill board vacancies. The venue for this ruction will be the forthcoming annual general meeting of the NSW Permanent, when three of the five board vacancies are up for grabs. There the bitter struggle going on within the Liberal will be opened up for public display while the NSW nent with its $700m in assets regrettably becomes the the tug-of-war. The meeting has to be held some time before the August. These are some of the latest developments to mind: Mr Stanley Eskell, the chief executive officer Ltd, and a member of the NSW Upper House, legal advice on certain aspects Sydney solicitor William Lander and Partners have provided the advice, and it is understood that it concerns the meaning of the society's rules 99 and 104. These rules provide that if numerous joint accounts are opened, all having at least one common name, then positor who is classified the 'primary joint holder' ter a vote on behalf of all his partners. The article goes on to show that one person could control 4,000 votes at that meeting by being one of the names in numerous joint accounts. article then continues: One of the leaders oftheright-wingwithin the NSW Liberal Party, Mr Lyenko Urbanchich, is actuaUy employed within the Vam Group. Both Mr Eskell and Mr Urbanchich were present at the adjourned annual general meeting last year and the right wing was in evidence conspicuously opposing Sir John Pagan's re-election and supporting Or Gwen FitzPatrick. Mr Urbanchich says he has been concerned about the management of the NSW Permanent Building Society and had given some thought to the problem. I do not blame him for having had some concern about the NSW Permanent Building Society because we know that the Society granted significant loans to Sir John Pagan, a director of the Society. The article continues: But it is understood that discussions and preparations for an assault on a few retiring directors have been under way for some time and that signatures have been arranged for the opening of numerous joint accounts. Funds are also being organised. The article then goes on to show who are the retiring people, who the new people will be, which candidates are sponsored by the so-called moderates in the New South Wales Liberal Party and which are sponsored by the so-called right wing of the New South Wales Liberal Party. We can all remember that last year a man named Puplick, who I think will be replacing Senator Sir Robert Cotton when he retires, sucwithin cessfully organised the so-called moderates at the last annual meeting of the New South Wales Permanent Building Society. With the help of numerous Queen's Counsel he was able to persuade the courts that Sir John Pagan should stay in control. If I had to choose between Sir John Pagan and people such as Eskell and Urbanchich, not necessarily for their political beliefs but for their Party association with a very shonky company, Vam PermaLtd-which , as I said earlier, is in receivership- I rope in would certainly support Sir John Pagan. I have some money deposited with the New South end of Wales Permanent Building Society. I sincerely hope that Vam Ltd will not get control of the bear in Society which has assets of $700m. I hope that of Vam the Treasurer (Mr Howard) will take steps to has taken protect the assets of the depositors. of the rules of the society.",113
213,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,113
214,Mr SHACK,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"I want to the deraise a matter tonight which has been drawn to can regismy attention on several occasions by some of my constituents. It is not necessary for me to relate to the House the details of each individual case but it is certainly important for me to draw attention The to the common problem. It certainly caught people in my electorate and no doubt it has been commonly experienced throughout the country. The problem involves workers who through injury are entitled to and receive workers compensation payments under various State workers compensation Acts while they are off work. An injured worker receiving such payments is also entitled to apply for social security sickness benefit but commonly there is no entitlement or only partial entitlement to receive such benefit-as distinct from applying for it-becaus e the rate of workers compensation payment is too high. I have no objection to compensation payments being taken into account when determining sickness benefit entitlement, and with up to 100 per cent workers compensation, injured employees are financially well provided for. However, the point I wish to make is that workers compensation payments are also taken into account when determining entitiement to and rate of sicknes benefit after workers have opted for, as they are entitled to do, a lump sum settlement. Thus we have the case many times multiplied of an injured worker with no short-term prospect of returning to work opting for a lump sum workers compensation payment in redemption of all future workers compensation entitlements. A lump sum is commonly a large amount, and the problem arises when the injured beneficiary uses the received cash to meet other commitments quite innocently-for example, in paying off his car or his house. Consequently, when this lump sum is exhausted or at least significantly reduced and the innocent worker subsequently applies for sickness benefit he finds out that he is not entitled to it or at least to only a portion of it. As I have mentioned, this is because the Department of Social Security still takes into account the full amount of his lump sum payment, averaging it out as if it were still being paid in weekly or fortnightly instalments. His entitlement to receive sickness benefit may thus be many years away. Unemployment benefits may be unavailable to the worker if he is unfit for work, and invalid pension entitlements will not be available if he is less than 85 per cent incapacitated. The injured worker may thus be destitute because he has innocently exhausted his lump sum reserves. I repeat that I do not raise this issue to argue against the policy of the Department of Social Security. However, I urge all involved in the process whereby an injured off-work employee converts his workers compensation entitlement to a lump sum- I urge union representatives, employers and State insurance office officials-to inform the worker of the facts. They all have a responsibility to explain the situation fully to such people. In many cases this is not being done, and before he is in a position to ask the right questions, the hapless injured worker may have unwittingly put himself into a destitute position. With a full explanation of the facts the resulting hardships may well be avoided. The second point I raise is that the honourable member for St George (Mr Neil) and I are extremely interested in the recent overseas visit by the Minister for Special Trade Representations and Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Garland) and his inspection of war graves. On behalf of the honourable member for St George, I ask the Minister to report to the House on this matter for the benefit of all ex-servicemens organisations.",113
215,Mr BARRY JONES,SHIPPING FREIGHTS," I want to talk about advertising. But before I get onto that subject, I cannot help responding to the contribution of Mr Interlocutor and Bones earlier on when they were talking about Tasmania and its transport problems. There are just four points that ought to be made to the House. First, the Liberal Party and Tasmanian members tried very hard to escape from the Tasmanian Railways and Australian Railways agreement. Secondly, they are obviously going to abolish the service of the Tasman LimitedMr Burr-Rubbish.",114
216,Mr BARRY JONES,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"We will see. Thirdly, the Australian Trader has been removed from service.

What the honourable member is saying about the Tasman Limited is blatantly wrong. He should know that the",114

218,Mr BARRY JONES,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"The Australian Government ought to be encouraging and persuading the advertising industry to provide more information and not less for consumers. Remember the long fight before date stamping was accepted for perishable commodities such as milk? Well, the fight to have ingredients listed on the packaging is not yet won. Marketers tell us: 'The public don't want to know; the information would only confuse them'. Let me give some examples. In the United States of America, chloroform has been banned since 1976 as an ingredient in pharmaceuticals on the ground that it is carcinogenic. In Australia it still remains as an important ingredient in 10 out of 41 popular toothpaste brands recently tested. I would like to be informed when I go into a chemist or supermarket which tube has the cancer. Am I entided to know? I say: 'Yes'. It is clear that fluorocarbon aerosol propelwould lants are hallucinogenic and have contributed to many deaths among 'Pure 'n' Simple' sniffersgrowing group among the young. Should the packages contain a warning so that the majority of purchasers can forcefluorocarbonsoff the market, simply by applying market pressure, would the information simply attract more deviant users? The matter needs very careful consideration, in addition to the possible harm the ozone layer fromfluorocarbonswhich currently being used in the United States. For many years I have wanted advertisement to contain a code supervised perhaps by the expired. Prices Justification Tribunal or the Industries Assistance Commission indicating relative value for money. For example, one such code should indicate the cost of packaging relative to the cost of the basic ingredients, Clearly the cost of aerohave sol packaging is far greater than the cost of spray or 'Pure 'n' Simple' if purchased in but customers ought to be able to choose, for example, between a 3:1 ratio of package costs to ingredients costs and a 5:1 ratio if they are to make a rational market judgment. Similarly, such a code could indicate the relative cost in manufacturing of the motor, steering, brakes, chassis and safety features compared to the of styling, trim, accessories and cosmetic feasearch tures. Obviously people are paying far more for the cosmetic features in cars than they are paying for the actual work-and they ought to be this power. informed of the relative cost. It is also very difficult for the lay purchaser determine the relative efficiency of the heating and cooling devices. As the American Physical Society pointed out in its important study entitled 'The Efficient Use of Energy' many pliances have an efficiency in inverse proportion to their sophistication-electri c cookers, space heaters or swimming pool heaters being good examples. We could have, I suggest, an ITE-a index of thermodynamic efficiency-ratin g to suggest how much energy value consumers are receiving for their energy dollar. The present ing of'wattage' is useless, indicating how much energy is chewed up but not how much is given back to us in usable form. I believe that doctors and lawyers ought to be able to advertise in a limited way. For example, a couple of weeks ago I was stuck in Canberra for the weekend. I felt ill. When I tried to call a doctor there were several inhibiting factors: Doctors Everingham, Klugman, Cass, Jenkins and Grimes had all gone home. I did not have a telephone book, but even if I had, the yellow pages have told me nothing. If i had rung at random, I might well have dialled a gynaecologist, a a thoracic surgeon, an ear, nose and throat man, an eye specialist or a Medibank syphoner before I found a friendly or available general practitioner. I think that each telephone entry for or doctors should have a number or letter code indicating their expertise or even their limitations. For example, Kelly, Edward; G.P., to NHC-that is, a general practitioner who does are not take house calls.",114

220,Mr BIRNEY,SHIPPING FREIGHTS,"The Federal seat of Phillip while not embracing Sydney airport lies very cose to it. As the Federal member, I received complaints from several of my fefly male constituents almost immediately after they bulk, have been processed through customs. The serious complaint is that they have been required by customs officers to strip whilst both an external and an internal search is made of their person in search of drugs. Some time ago I made a comcar plaint to the then Minister in charge of customs on behalf of one of my constituents and eventucosts ally received an apology. The same kind of happened again recently so I decided to research the Customs Act and, in particular, the section that purportedly gave customs officers The relevant section is section 196 which states to that if any officer of customs or of police shall have reasonable cause to suspect that any person is unlawfully carrying, or has any goods subject to the control of customs, or any prohibited imapports, or any prohibited exports secreted about him, the following consequences shall ensue: Firstly, the officer may detain and search the suspected person; secondly, before the suspected n person shall be searched he may require to be taken before a justice or the Collector of customs; thirdly, the justice or collector may order listthe suspected person to be searched or may discharge him without search but females shall only be searched by a female searcher appointed by the justice or collector. In the course of my career as a lawyer I have never come across, nor indeed have I ever heard of, any legal authority for the proposition that the word 'search' is an all embracing term to permit of an indecent assault on a citizen. Searches have been carried out on many of my female constituents, and no doubt on many female constituents of other members of the House, by customs officers who justify this type of indecent assault by relying on the provisions of secuon 196 of the Customs Act. On a proper reading of this section, I believe that that proposition is untenable although customs officers innocently believe that this right is held by them. It is my firm belief that the word 'search' does not bestow on a customs officer the right to require a citizen to strip and to be both externally and internally searched. There can be no doubt that what has happened is that an indecent assault, an indictable offence under the criminal law, has occurred. People must realise theirrights.Customs officers only have rights bestowed upon them by a parliament. Despite holding an honest and reasonable belief in the lawfulness of their actions, if they perform acdons for which they are not given power they are guilty of an offence. As I said, these officers perform their task diligently and honesdy but there is not the slightest doubt that these types of searches have not the imprimatur or stamp of approval of an Act of Parliament and therefore are illegal. It follows naturally that themselves, however innocentiy, are committing an indecent assault on those whom they detain and search in the manner to which I have referred. I give the following advice to members of the community who find themselves being requested to submit to a search at an airport or shipping terminal: Demand to be taken before a justice; and demand in the presence of the justice that he require the officer to nominate the source of his reasonable cause for suspicion. If this latter requirement cannot be satisfied, and I doubt whether it would be in many cases, then that person should demand his immediate release from custody. I am not oblivious of the fact that drugs are coming into this country in substantial amounts and are being secreted internally by wrongdoers. This type of smuggling activity must be stamped out for the protection of the whole community. The whole situation is fraught with danger and difficulty and in many cases leads to denuding the person of their self-respect. The whole situation calls for the immediate attention of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife) so that the position can be clarified and the right to search given to a customs officer only on proof of reasonable suspicion being shown to the satisfaction of a justice. Even if such proof is provided, intimate searches of the kind to which I have alluded should only be performed by a medical practitioner.",115

222,Mr GARLAND,SHIPPING FREIGHTS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I require the debate to be extended to enable me to reply to a matter raised during the debate. I am sorry if I take some small time from honourable members, but this might be the only occasion for me to report on recent visits to Australian war cemeteries and to respond to the comments made by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack). I advise the House that as Minister for Veterans' Affairs I visited the war cemeteries and Australian war memorials at Ypres, Zonnebeke and nearby sites on 2 March 1978, and those at Villers-Brettoneux on ANZAC Day two weeks ago. There I took part in the ANZAC Day ceremony and other ceremonies and laid wreaths at other memorials. In Belgium I visited the Tyne Cot cemetery at Passchendale and the Australian Fifth Division memorial at Polygon Wood, the memorial at they Hill 60 and the war museum at Ypres town hall. With the Burgomaster of Ypres I laid wreaths at the Belgium war memorial and at Menin Gate, where the last Post is sounded every day. I made a presentation to the Burgomaster of Ypres, who has received Australian visitors kindly for many years. I also visited the small cemetery at Birr Crossroads, where my mother's brother is buried. I met Mr R. G. Wall, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission representative in North West Europe, and other War Graves Commission officers in London. During my visit in April to France I took the opportunity to spend ANZAC Day at Villers-Brettoneux, in whose liberation Australian forces played a major part 60 years ago. There is one of Australia's major war memorials in Europe, where many Australians are buried. It is a site of great symbolic significance for Australia and its friends. The memorial has been restored after having been extensively damaged in World War II. Although many years have elapsed since the Great War battles, the Australian soldiers have not been forgotten. At each site I visited I found the graves and memorials very well tended and cared for and the people greet Australians with real warmth and friendship. Australians visit the Villers-Brettoneux memorial each ANZAC Dayindeed, throughout the year-and each year the local people take part in the commemoration of ANZAC Day. They helped to create a museum which is very impressive and moving. On behalf of Australia I made some presents of 1917 photographs and road signs to add to their collection.

239,Mr STALEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"On 4 May 1978, Mr Les MCMahon asked me the following question, Travel without notice: (Question No. 1020) I ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications: What is the purpose for which land bought at Bundall, Queensland on 4 February 1977 by the Australian Postal Commission is to be used? For how long prior to the purchase had the Commission been seeking land in the Bundall area? What departmental officers or Government members were aware of the Commission's interest in acquiring land at Bundall? The results of my inquiries are set out below. The former Postmaster-General's Department and Australia Post had been continuously seeking land in the Gold Coast area since 1974 to be used as the site for a mail centre. After much searching Department of Administrative Services in March 1976 that the Bundall area was one of its preferences. Over this period there would have been many officials in Australia Post and the Department of Administrative Services aware of Australia Post's interest. On 23 August 1976, Australia Post was informed by Watkins Limited that they had for sale at $240,000, a piece of land on the corner of Crombie Avenue and Upton Street, Bundall. On 25 August 1976, Australia Post advised the Chief Property Officer, Depanment of Administrative Services, Queensland, that this land met all of its requirements and to concentrate on an early acquisition. On 15 October 1976, Australia Post learnt that the Bundall land had been sold to Ron MCMaster Pty Ltd for $240,000 or $248,000. Australia Post expressed concern to the Depanment of Administrative Services that what had appeared to be a straightforward acquisition, and most attractive to Australia Post, failed at the last moment due to the initiative of another purchaser and delays in the purchasing process. Because the land was so ideally suited for postal purposes, Australia Post asked the Department of Administrative Services to pursue negotiations with the new owner. Initial negotiations were carried on with Ron MCMaster Pty Ltd from October to December 1976. During this period the vendor moved his asking price down from $350,000 to $310,000. On 9 December 1976, the Australian Postal Commission decided to defer the matter pending careful examination of the facts surrounding the sale to Ron MCMaster Pty Ltd and on 17 December 1976, the Commission decided not to proceed with the acquisition and to release Ron MCMaster Pty Ltd from the offer of $310,000. This decision was taken because the Australian Postal Commission was concerned that the vendor was in a position to make a considerable capital profit. The Department of Administrative Services, Queensland, advised Ron MCMaster Pty Ltd on 20 December 1976 that the Commission did not wish to proceed with the purchase. In making this decision, the Commission had before it a final valuation on the land by the Australian Taxation Office of$360,000. During the period of these negotiations the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications was asked, entirely at the initiative of the Commission, whether the proposed purchase, which would take place in his electorate, would be an embarrassment to him. The then Minister indicated that he would have no difficulties if the Commission were to purchase property in his electorate even if the Commission's ultimate decision was to purchase at a profit to the present owner. After receipt of the letter of 20 December 1976, Mr MCMaster made immediate representations to his local Member, the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications, questioning the decision notified by the Department of Administrative Services, and indicating that he believed that the Australian Postal Commission was still keen to buy the property. The Minister rang the Acting Chief General Manager of the Australian Postal Commission on 30 December 1976, and made it clear that he did not want to be associated with any negotiations but that for the purpose of dealing with the representations from Mr MCMaster it would be helpful if the Minister knew the Commission's attitude so he could tell Mr MCMaster where he stood in the matter. The Minister asked that the Managing Director contact him on 4 January 1977 and indicated that he would delay answering Mr MCMaster's representations until after he had spoken with the Managing Director. Australia Post indicated to the When the Managing Director contacted the Minister on 4 January 1977, the Minister confirmed the substance of his conversation with the Acting Chief General Manager. The Managing Director informed the Minister that the Australian Postal Commission would very much tike to acquire the site but felt strongly its public responsibilities and would not contemplate a substantial profit being made by the vendor. The Managing Director also indicated to the Minister that if Mr MCMaster were prepared to consider a lower figure than $310,000, he should contact the Chief Property Officer, Department of Administrative Services, Queensland, and the Manager, Planning and Technical Services, Australia Post, Queensland. The Minister indicated that he would pass on to Mr MCMaster the Managing Director's advice. Mr MCMaster subsequently entered into negotiations with the Department of Administrative Services on 7 January, 1977. The property was purchased from Ron MCMaster Pty Ltd on 8 February, 1977 at a cost of $280,000, which was $80,000 below the Taxation Valuation. On 8 May, 1978, 1 contacted the former Chairman of the Australian Postal Commission, Mr J. J. Kennedy and the Managing Director, Mr A. F. Spratt, to seek their recollections of the matter. Mr Kennedy has written to me as follows: 8th May, 1978. The Honourable A. Staley, M.P., Minister for Post and Telecommunications, Parliament House, Canberra, A.CT 2600 My dear Minister, In response to your telephone call, I confirm that I have a very clear recollection of the events surrounding the purchase of land at the Gold Coast by the Australian Postal Commission, which I understand is now the subject of an investigation by your good self. The Commission negotiated strenuously for this most suitable site for a mail sorting centre, and although it was valued at about $350,000.00, in the event was able to purchase it for $280,000.00, after prolonged negotiations. I understand there has been a suggestion that the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications, the Hon. Eric Robinson, was in some way involved in influencing the Commission to purchase the property, so that the vendor would make a profit of some $40,000.00. I do not wish to get involved in any political controversy, but I must state that, to my knowledge, no pressure or influence, implied, implicit, direct or indirect, was brought to bear by the then Minister, The Hon. Eric Robinson, in the Commission's deliberations on the matter. The Minister made it quite clear to me that any decision on the purchase of the property at the Gold Coast was a decision that was entirely up to the Postal Commission, and he was particularly concerned, following a breakdown in the negotiations, that any re-opening of negotiations was entirely up to the Postal Commission. The Minister made no attempt to influence the Commission 's decision to purchase the Gold Coast land. The land was purchased at a fair price below valuation, and was the most suitable land for the purpose. Less suitable land was available at a higher price, and this was taken into account the Commission's decision. Mr Spratt has by minute informed me as follows: NA GOLD COAST (FEBRUARY 1977) On 4 January 1977 after conferring by telephone with our State Manager, Queensland and our Chairman, I contacted by telephone the Minister for Post and Telecommunications further to his discussions with our Acting Chief General Manager on 30 December 1976. The Minister confirmed as General Manager on 30 December 1976 that he, the Minister, had been approached by Mr R. MCMaster, seeking information whether the Australian Postal Commission would still be interested in the purchase of his, Mr MCMaster's, property if the asking price were reduced. In discussion with the Minister I made the following points: The Commission would very much like to acquire the site under sale to Mr MCMaster but felt strongly its public responsibilities and could not contemplate an exorbitant profit being made by the new owner-in other words the Commission being 'taken for a ride and ripped off'. The Commission was also sensitive located in the Minister's electorate. The Commission would not consider dealing at the asking price of $310,000 but if Mr MCMaster is prepared to come to a lowerfigureand talk, he should contact the Chief Property Officer, Department of Administrative Services, Queensland and the Manager, Planning and Technical Services, Australia Post, Queensland. The Minister indicated that he would pass on to Mr MCMaster my advice that we would be prepared to reopen negodadons at a lowerfigureif Mr MCMaster were to initiate contact with the relevant Queensland officers. My contact with the Minister for Post and Telecommunications on 4 January 1977 was the only occasion on which we discussed the proposed purchase. My clear impression from our Acting Chief General Manager and from the Minister is that the initiative had been taken solely by Mr MCMaster. Furthermore, there was no suggestion by the Minister, either direct or implied, that we should reopen negotiations, nor was there had any involvement or wish to intervene other than to respond helpfully to Mr MCMaster's inquiry to him. A. F. Spratt Managing Director 8 May 1978. The purchasing procedures which are set out in the Land Acquisition Act are there to protect the public interest. There must always be some risk that a private person or organisin ation will step in and purchase a property, although active negotiations are being pursued at atimeby the Government Yours sincerely, authority and the vendor. In this particular instance it is unJ.J.KENNEDY fortunate that the proposed acquisition by Australia Post was notfinalisedwhen the offering price was $240,000. On 22 February, 1977, the then Minister, Mr Robinson, wrote to the Minister for Administrative Servicesreferringto the Lands Acquisition Act requirement that property transactions be conducted through the Depanment of Administrative Services. Mr Robinson said thisrequirementcreated difficulties for Australia Post obtaining properties quickly. The first example of delays which was quoted was the delay in purchasing the Bundall site on the Gold Coast. he had said to our Acting Chief Wheat Shipments (Question No. 858) Mr Hyde asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: (1) What was the average freight advantage of wheat shipped from Western Australia over the average freights of wheat shipped from all Australian pons in each of the (a) 1973-74, (b) 1974-75, (c) 1975-76 and (d) 1976-77 pools.
