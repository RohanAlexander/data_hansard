15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP," Mr Speaker has received advice from the Acting Government Whip that he has nominated Mr Grace to be a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs,  NA Motion (by Mr Beazley) agreed to: NOES That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, 26 November 1991, at 2 p.m. unless the Speaker fixes alternative day or hour of meeting. NA Privileges Committee",118
16,Mr COSTELLO,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"I present the report of the Privileges Committee in connection with the matter referred to the Committee by the House on 11 September 1991, together with the minutes of proceedings of the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",118
17,Mr COSTELLO,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"by leave-The report that I have just presented follows a decision of the House on 11 September to refer to the Privileges Committee the question of whether Mr Stephen Paddison of the State Bank of South Australia misled the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in an answer he gave to the Committee on 30 April in response to a question about nonperforming loans and losses by the bank.  ding Committee, had been asked whether publicly stated figures of $2.5 billion worth of non-performing loans and approximately $1 billion lost by the bank were still ap firstly, that he believed that any official confirmation of the banks loan projections was most appropriately carried out in the context of the bank's full year results. He said: So I will not comment on that. But he went on to say: I did comment that I thought that we were feeling fairly comfortable with our assessment procedures in an environment such as we have now. If you were plus or minus 10 per cent, I think that you would feel that you had done a pretty reasonable job of estimation, and we are certainly within those parameters . . .' The concern that this answer may have been misleading arose from information contained in a copy of a confidential memorandum signed by the General Manager of the bank and dated 21 March. An attachment to this memorandum showed that the management of the bank projected non-productive accounts to reach $3.48 billion by December 1992 and potential losses to reach $1.3 billion by that date. The essence of the complaint was that it  as a senior officer of the bank, would have known of the memorandum of 21 March and the projections attached to it when he gave evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on 30  the Committee, that he was so aware. The Committee of Privileges received a written submission from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who had raised the matter in the House in the first instance. The Committee made this material  him to appear before the Committee on 7 November.  regret that the answer he had given resulted in the honourable member for Mayo forming  Finance and Public Administration Committee. He said that it was not his intention to mislead the Committee or any person who heard or read his evidence.  of time to reflect, he acknowledged that the clarity of his evidence had been compromised by his qualifying comment and that he had been trying to convey the impression that the bank's loan loss and assessment procedures were still regarded as essentially accurate. He said: I acknowledge that my evidence would have been enhanced by an explanation of the significance of the particular figures referred to by Mr Downer MHR-Le. the net figures of $2.5 billion and the net present value loss of $1.0 billion. I apologise for not recognising at the time the desirability of ensuring such clarity.  the figures quoted to him by the honourable member for Mayo and those quoted in the attachment to the 21 March memorandum was explained by the fact that the figures quoted by the honourable member for Mayo were net figures, whereas the figures quoted from the 21 March memorandum to the Board were gross figures.  this matter, the Committee of Privileges has concluded that he did not intend to mislead the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. Accordingly, the Committee has found that no contempt was  that the House take no further action on this matter. Mit"" SNOW (Eden-Monaro)-by leave-I wish to make a short comment on the statement of the Committee of Privileges. As stated by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the Committee examined Mr Paddison thoroughly on this matter. But it  the question of the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) was incomplete, rather than ambiguous as stated by the Committee. Unfortunately, as honourable members know, there are a lot of pressures in this chamber and I was unable to reach the Committee meeting on time to contribute to the decision. I accept the decision. I want to say  answer was incomplete. Of course, he could have provided more detail voluntarily in answer to the honourable member for Mayo. Then again, the Standing Committee could have asked him for more detail. I believe the responsibility was just as much on the Standing Committee to seek that detail as on Mr Paddison to provide it. I support the view of the Committee that  Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in his answer to the honourable member for Mayo. I accept the decision. I wanted to make the point that I believe that his answer was incomplete rather than ambiguous. Selection Committee",118

19,Mr GORMAN,CHAIRMAN,I present the fourteenth report from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies of the report are being circulated to honourable members in the chamber. Report-by leave-adopted. Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities,121
20,Mr BRERETON,CHAIRMAN,On behalf of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities I present the report of the Committee incorporating a dissenting report entitled Use Immunity Provisions in the Corporations Law and the Australian Securities Commission Law. I seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.,121
21,Mr BRERETON,CHAIRMAN,"It is with pleasure that I table the report of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities regarding the operation of use immunity provisions in the laws governing corporate regulation. Removing the use immunity and derivative use immunity provisions of the current regulatory framework is not something to be recommended without detailed consideration. I assure the House that detailed, in-depth consideration, is exactly what has gone into this report. The Committee undertook its investigation at a time of unprecedented concern about the ethics of Australia's corporate world and the effectiveness of the regulatory framework which oversees it. It is a concern generated by a minority, but felt by many overseas investors whose fingers were burnt by the questionable activities of ostentatious Australian cowboys and by an Australian public growing tired of reading about the lavish lifestyles of nominally bankrupt entrepreneurs. The decade of decadence now past alerts us to the failings of the previous cooperative framework of corporate regulation. In the face of its obvious breakdown, the Government revamped the regulatory system setting up a truly national framework overseen by the Australian Securities Commission. In doing so, the Government was conscious of the need to grant this new body adequate powers of investigation and deterrents, both civil and criminal. The advent of the new system met with general approbation from a traumatised investment community. However, doubts quickly arose about the efficacy of the criminal powers in the absence of any prosecutions. In the face of the startling revelations about the corporate excesses of the 1980s, the Committee knew that the absence of trials was not due to any absence of criminal activity. The subsequent evidence supplied by the ASC and the Director of Public Prosecutions bought into question the supposedly enhanced powers of the new body. Indeed, it became apparent that the vital investigatory powers granted the ASC had become, in many cases, a poison chalice. In no small measure, this was due to the operation of derivative use immunity and document use immunity provisions. In addressing the concerns about use immunity, the Committee had to strike a balance between the need to guarantee confidence in the regulatory framework and the need to protect the established common law right to remain silent. In striking this balance, the Committee took account of both the unique nature of corporate crime and the privileged legal position that a company occupies in our society. Corporate crime, of course, has a unique quality, that is, the apparent lack of a direct victim, although the number of indirect victims has run into tens of thousands over the last decade. It is also a crime which may only be known to one person-the perpetrator. That person is often exploiting the elevated legal status of the company, a status offering limited liability and indeed, in the case of public companies, the ability to raise public money. In many ways this makes the crime all the more reprehensible. The Committee's recommendation to restrict immunities is by no means unprecedented. The superseded Companies Code, the less than satisfactory parent of the corporations law, offered no immunity for derivative evidence. Similarly, a previous report of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation recommended that the derivative use immunity be removed. For whatever reason, this was not done, much to the detriment of effective corporate regulation. In the United Kingdom the regulation of corporations and securities has been tightened through measures including the cm1ailment of the right to remain silent. The legality of this reform was subsequently upheld in the high profile, recently concluded Guinness case. If the ASC is to be an effective corporate watchdog, it must have the capacity to employ both civil and criminal penalties for corporate misdeeds. The Government gave it investigatory powers to enhance its other powers in this regard, not to leave it hamstrung by legal technicalities. When jokes about Australia become commonplace in the world financial circles, it is not only embarrassing; it reflects more seriously on the lack of faith in this country's regulatory framework. In a country that relies on foreign capital inflow this situation is clearly unacceptable. The recommendations of the Committee are aimed at ensuring that the avenue of criminal prosecution remains open to the ASC. In doing so it will reinforce the intention of the original legislation. The Committee proposes to closely monitor the ASC's use of its investigatory powers. It also proposes a sunset clause so that the effects of the changes will be reviewed in five years time. In the international context in which businesses now operate, and in tenns of previous legislation, the Committee's recommendations are in no way path-breaking. They are, however, vital to the proper functioning of the country's corporate regulatory framework. For that reason, I would urge their careful consideration. The memories of the 1980s remain vivid.",121
22,Mr FORD,CHAIRMAN,"by leave-The tabling of the report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities raises a matter of utmost importance to this Parliament. Senator Cooney and Senator Campbell, together with myself, have submitted a dissenting report. The proposals to so greatly extend the power of the ASC so that witnesses before hearings are denied the right to remain silent are dangerous in the extreme, particularly where the derived evidence obtained can be used against them for criminal procedures. Indeed, the principle of the right to remain silent-like the presumption of innocence--is absolutely fundamental to a democratic way of life and the freedoms most of us take for granted. What is proposed is the creation of yet another Star Chamber, in which un elected adjudicators may force some unfortunate business person to incriminate himself through derived evidence. In recent years we have seen the privilege against self-incrimination varied or removed by this Parliament with respect to the Australian Taxation Office and the Trade Practices Commission. That this has happened at all gives more weight to the case against extending similar controls to the ASC. Why should the common law privilege against self-incrimination be available to child molesters and the men who tortured and murdered Anita Cobby but not to a person who may have acted in an unethical way in business? If evidence is derived from evidence obtained compulsorily, it should be excluded from use in criminal proceedings. Lack of success in the prosecution of corporate crooks is not, in itself, a reason for this huge increase in the power of the ASC. Could it be that this apparent concern for those who have lost money as a result of the corporate collapses of the 1980s is simply a smokescreen for a more sinister agenda--that of transferring authority from the elected representatives of the people to the unelected social engineers of the bureaucracy? In these circumstances, is it any wonder that people are begitming to pose the question: who would become a company director? Debate (on motion by Mr BeddaU) adjourned. COMMITTEE REFERENCE: NA Public Works Committee: Construction of a Third Runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport",122
23,Mr BEDDALL,APPROVAL OF WORK,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, and by reason of the urgent nature of the works, it is that the following proposed works be carried out without having been referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works: Construction of a third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The proposed development of a third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport has been the subject over the last 21/2 years of the most comprehensive and exhaustive environmental assessment ever undertaken in this country. Any delay in construction of the new runway would significantly impair the functioning of Australia's premier domestic and international airport and impose unwarranted cost penalties, congestion and increased delays on users and the travelling public. Exemption is therefore warranted as a matter of some urgency. If the House supports this motion, planning and construction can be commenced immediately by the Federal Airports Corporation. I commend the motion to the House.",123
24,Mr JULL,APPROVAL OF WORK,"The motion moved by the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) for work to begin immediately on the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport without reference to the Public Works Committee highlights a most unusual and amazing situation. The Opposition will not oppose it, because it recognises that the completion of the third runway is one of the most urgent pieces of micro-economic refonn on the Australian agenda. But, really, in the light of what happened today, I am amazed at the hide of the Government. I want to make it perfectly clear that we support the motion because of the absolute urgency of the issue. We do not support the motion to save the political skin of the Government. We do not support the motion if it is to be purely a measure to keep the troglodytes both in the Ministry and on the Government back bench quiet. The plain facts are that this Government has failed to serve the best interests of Australia by waiting until 14 November 1991 to announce the commencement of this most urgent project. It was the Government's decision to cancel the third runway in 1983. For 5 11z years it procrastinated, with senior members constantly deriding the calls for the construction of the expedient runway. We have no respect for the Government and its' failure to provide the runway before this stage. Any problems the Government may have are all its own doing. The Government must proceed as soon as possible with this project. As the motion states, the project has been subjected over the past 2112 years to the most comprehensive and exhaustive environmental assessment ever undertaken in Australia. Costs have blown out enough with the delays already, and further delays would only further expand costs and help to maintain the congestion and the delays at Kingsford-Smith Airport. There is no doubt that Sydney is Australia's major international gateway and that the city and the nation are already severely disadvantaged by the delays at the airport. The Government is talking of doubling international visitors to Australia by 1995-96. The Opposition says that its aim is to redouble that figure by the year 2000. It is therefore absolutely essential that the Kingsford-Smith Airport facility commence immediately and the plans proceed posthaste for the construction of the second airport at Badgerys Creek. The World Tourism Organisation estimates that by the year 2000 some 100 million people in Asian countries alone will travel offshore for holidays. The major expansion of international travel during this decade will be primarily in the Asia-Pacific region, and Sydney and Australia must be ready to earn their fair share of this growth, and therefore the immediate construction of the runway is absolutely essential. This runway project is about efficiency for Australian industry and the travelling public. It is about earning foreign exchange for Australia. It is about an additional 40,000 jobs for Australians in the construction, aviation, tourism and hospitality industries. For these reasons this motion must be supported, but not as a means of easing the disgrace and embarrassment of this Government through its blithering incompetence and lack of vision since 1983 regarding this most urgent project.",123
25,Mr HOLLIS,APPROVAL OF WORK," As Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I wish to speak to the motion moved by the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) regarding the construction of a third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The purpose of the motion is to exempt this proposal from the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee on the grounds of urgency. At the outset, let me say that I have no criticism of the Minister moving the motion; he is representing another Minister in this House. I also wish to make clear my personal position regarding the third runway. I believe that the project is warranted and that it should have been constructed well before this. I have always personally supported the building of the third runway. However, I do not accept, nor does the Public Works Committee accept-and if my Deputy Chairman was here, he would be supporting me-that the project should be exempted on urgency grounds. I believe that the normal parliamentary process should apply. The case for urgency cannot be sustained, particularly in view of the spectacularly meandering EIS process which took some two years and seven months to complete-some nine months late-at a cost of $8m. I totally reject the claims that Ministers make that the Public Works Committee process delays projects. It does not. Projects are delayed because of bureaucrats who do not like coming before committees and departments that cannot get their projects up on time. If this project was referred to the Committee today, we would report to Parliament early in the autumn sittings next year, and at considerably lower cost than the $8m. The Committee takes very seriously its responsibilities to report to the Parliament as expeditiously as possible on all projects referred to it. If departments and authorities such as the Federal Airports Corporation kept to deadlines with the same efficiency as the Committee displays, we would not be faced with motions such as this, which seek to deny to this Parliament its rightful role in the scrutiny of major public works projects-and few are more major than this one. One must look very closely at claims made by Ministers that parliamentary processes cause delays to projects such as this. To give an example: the FAC advised the Committee on 3 April 1991 of its likely program of references for the remainder of 1991-92. In addition to the third runway proposal, the list included two other projects at Sydney Airport and one each at Brisbane and Melbourne airports. All were scheduled for referral by the end of 1991. However, with the possible exception of one Sydney project, all have slipped to next year, through no fault of the Public Works Committee. Will the Minister stand here next year and seek exemption on urgency grounds, when quite clearly the delay has been caused by the FAC? I have no quarrel with the FAC and its desire to get on with the task that it has been charged with completing by this Parliament. I have gone on record as commending the excellent job the FAC is doing in some areas, particularly with the new terminals at Darwin and Alice Springs, which the Committee inspected recently. I add that the Committee was instrumental in ensuring that aerobridges were included in the project. I know that the third runway project is controversial, but that is all the more reason why it should have been referred to my Committee. I also know that the bureaucrats do not want it referred, and that they will fight tooth and nail, as they have for the last two years, not to have it referred. If the bureaucrats' case is so strong, why are they terrified to have it referred to the Public Works Committee? One would think that if their case really was so strong, they would welcome the scrutiny of the Committee. People assume that only people who oppose the project would appear before the Public Works Committee, but the Committee also gives an opportunity to those who support the project to put their case. I think it is important that they appear before the Committee, because it is one of the few occasions, especially on very controversial programs, on which ordinary members of the public have a chance to appear before what, in effect, is the Parliament. However, the Government, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) and the FAC should be aware that the Committee is also chargeq with a duty by this Parliament and, while it may be inconvenient in the short term, there must be very good reasons for departing from the principles of parliamentary democracy-and in this case there are none. On a personal level, I am disappointed that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support did not have the courtesy to inform me, as Chairman of the Committee, that this motion was to be moved today. The first I knew of it was when I received my daily program this morning, and I think that that is outrageous.",124
26,Mr MACK,APPROVAL OF WORK,"North Sydney) (5.34 p.m.)This motion and today's events underline in three ways what is happening with our political system. Firstly, almost half the Parliament tried to censure the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin). What for? Because he was trying to tell the truth, as he saw it, and he was trying to represent the people whom he is supposed to represent. Yet the Parliament tried to censure him for it. The second thing it underlines is that 147 members of this House will vote for this motion and only one will vote against it. Yet we have to admit that at least 600,000 people in Sydney are bitterly opposed to this project, and they are virtually disfranchised by our system. What we are seeing, as we have seen so many times, is the triumph of the private interest over the public interest. We have seen it in gun control measures, tobacco advertising and media concentration. Who are the winners and losers in this issue? The first winners are the existing airline interests. One does not have to be very suspicious to think that the arrangement was made a couple of years ago, probably in my electorate, when the long term leases were granted for the space at Kingsford-Smith Airport. The infrastructure owners around the airport certainly are winners. The users are winners also, because there is no questioning that the airport is a much more convenient place for most local users of that airport. That will not be the case in 25 or 30 years, but it is at the moment. The general aviation people, who are the most heavily subsidised'group in this country, are winners. We hear a lot of talk about level playing fields, but we never hear it in respect of general aviation users at Kingsford-Smith Airport. We have to list the Federal Airports Corporation as one of the major winners. It is ironic to list as a winner a body that was set up to protect the public interest, when it has conducted a long and expensive publicity campaign with public money purely as a lobbyist for the airline industries. I suppose the Government must see itself as a winner out of this situation, but I think the Government has to look at itself. If it really wants to be a pale imitation of the Opposition, it has to ask itself what it is really doing here, because the Opposition would have got on with this project nine years ago and it would have saved millions of dollars of public money, and it would have saved nine years of hypocrisy. The losers are at least 600,000 inner-Sydney residents who are affected by the environmental breakdown which ranges far beyond noise. It goes also to traffic, physical breakdown of 56 community centres under the flight path, 18 schools and educational organisations and four hospitals, including Australia's most major hospital, the Royal Prince Alfred, with 51,000 patients per annum, and its staff. They are the losers. The real loser is the lowest socia-economic group in Australia. And this is the Labor Party! As many as 8,000 people live within two kilometres of the end of that runway, of whom 47 per cent are non-Australian born, 33 per cent are under the poverty line and 46 per cent left school before the age of 15. They are only a minority. But what is this Parliament about? Is this Nazi Germany? Do we crush 8,000 people because of the interests of the airlines? A similar number of people in Sydney are now affected by physical danger. We have been living on borrowed time with Kingsford Smith Airport. There will be a major air crash; it is just a matter of time. All of us hope it will be a long time in the future, but it will happen. While we continue to have Australia's international airport on a site which is only one-third the size of any comparable airport in the world, which will be more congested in the next five years during construction and when it is finished; while we are limiting the use of runways and we have to go against wind restrictions to justify not using the east-west runway; and while we are developing Australia's major international airport next to Australia's major petrochemical works, we have what has to be the worse planning decision in this country's history. The continuation of the Kingsford-Smith project is now depriving hundreds of thousands of people in the outer western areas of jobs and it is forcing on them vastly greater travel times. We have lost the opportunity to provide the infrastructure which that area desperately needs. Again, the lowest socio-economic group is always the loser in the long run. The taxpayers have really lost out. That is why there has been no cost-benefit study. In spite of a $7m study for the most major project in many years, no cost benefit study has been done. Why? Because it would show overwhelmingly that the money it cost the taxpayer would have been far better spent developing an international airport at Badgerys Creek. It would have shown up the heavy subsidies to those general aviation users and those subsidies just cannot be justified. The Australian tourist industry is also a major loser in this project because, contrary to what everyone is saying, Kingsford-Smith Airport will never be anything other than a third rate airport. It cannot be, because of its size and constriction. We might build a fourth runway in another 10 years, but it will still be a hopeless airport. In Asia there are at least seven new airport sites. Kingsford-Smith Airport is just establishing'this country as the poor white trash of Asia. Let us look at the effect of Kingsford-Smith Airport on the Sydney region in terms of urban sprawl. In 1945 that airport was as big as two football fields. Today, that area, together with the area around the airport for infrastructure, could house a quarter of a million people at just moderate densities. If we start looking at the public costs of that in Sydney, it makes the cost of airport construction pale into insignificance. I would rank among the worse losers of this project the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe). Members of the Opposition have been taunting him about his 'mad cities' program, and I give him a lot of credit for putting this whole issue of the cities on the public agenda. But members opposite are right: it is a 'mad cities' program if he can support the development of a black hole in the centre of the city, which is one of the major factors in causing the sprawl of Sydney. It is the ultimate hypocrisy to come in here talking about social equity and basic human rights when we look at the 8,000 who will be sprayed with kerosene. It is not just annoyance noise-the noise will affect people psychologically and will crack walls. Is that social equity and human rights? Talk about affordable housing! If honourable members look at the figures, they will see that we have lost 51,000 people from around that airport in the last 15 years. At the end of the development chain, that is the loss of another 25,000 new dwellings out on the fringe of Sydney. In infrastructure costs, that is a loss of over $1 billion dollars. Did that appear on the Federal Airports Corporation budget? Of course it did not. Yet the Deputy Prime Minister talks about affordable housing. The people in the community will put up, to a large degree, with all the things that have been going on in the Australian political system for the last few years. They will put up with corruption, cronyism and incompetence. But what they will not put up with in the long run is a government that acts as a hired gun for private interests and attacks people in their own homes. Question resolved in the afftrmative. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 November, on motion by Mr Staples: That the Bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Braithwaite had moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House calls on the Government to defer the planned automatic revocation of approvals of certain hostels and nursing homes until: (1) appropriate legislation is in place to ensure continuity of funding to the nursing homes and hostels to be transferred; (2) proper guidelines are drawn up for the proposed transfer of accommodation services to the States which will ensure continuity of funding at current levels and on current terms; and (3) there is complete clarification of the intended relationships between State and eral Governments as to funding of accommodation services"".",125
27,Mr HULLS,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I support the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bil11991 before the House particularly because it introduces measures to help frail older people stay in their homes. One enormous achievement of this Government has been the change of society's attitude towards aged people. Australia was rapidly approaching the stage where old people were expected to go into a nursing home for the last months of their lives. Now there is a growing realisation that older people are indeed able to stay at home, that they want to stay at home, and that it is more cost effective in the long run if they do stay at home. This has been the underlying premise of the home and community care-or HACC-program, which I think has been a successful initiative of this Labor Government. Since its inception in 1985, HACC has enabled continuous growth in community care services. The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) certainly has to be congratulated for this expansion. Services such as home care, Meals on Wheels, home nursing, provision of rails and ramps in the home, transport to and from day care centres and personal safety alarms have all been made available to people who would otherwise have to go to a hostel or nursing home. A particular feature of the HACC program has been the packaging or arranging of different types of services to meet different peoples needs. Not everybody needs nursing or Meals on Wheels, and a key feature of HACC has been the emphasis on finding the right mix of services for the right people. There are some people with vested interests who, despite protestations to the contrary, would prefer to see older people regularly shuffled off to hostels or nursing homes. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), who spoke at length on this Bill in this House last night, demonstrated, I believe, the Opposition's confused and indeed knee-jerk response to aged care issues. But the crux of this reform of aged care is the Fed- Government's community aged care services packages and the restructuring of personal care subsidies paid to hostels into three levels of funding geared to care needs. In what I believe was a rambling 30-minute speech full of groundless criticism of the Government's aged care policy, the honourable member for Dawson last night had the audacity to suggest that the restructuring of hostel subsidies was all his idea and falsely accused this Government of neglecting dementia sufferers. I am not surprised that the honourable member for Dawson was forced to acknowledge that he liked the three-tiered subsidy scheme for hostels. As a representative of a rural electorate, he would be a fool not to. The reason for this-and the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services made this patently clear in his second reading speechis that initial approvals for community aged care services packages will particularly concentrate on rural and remote areas of Australia or, in the words of the Minister, 'those areas of Australia in which it is difficult to build viable hostels due to factors, such as the cost of building, the concentration of people in an area who require care or the lack of suitable land'. I certainly welcome the community aged care services package with open arms. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, my electorate of Kennedy takes up about 45 per cent of the Queensland land mass. It is very remote. Back in the Dickensian decades of the Opposition's aged care administration, once an older person became too frail to cope on his own independently at home, he would be packed off to a hostel or a nursing home usually some thousands of kilometres away on the coast. The emotional cost of this policy for my constituents in Mount Isa, Cloncurry, Longreach or on the Atherton Tableland was, and is, incalculable. Older people, still perfectly capable of living independently with a minimum of assistance, were uprooted from their families and from the communities in which they had lived for perhaps all their lives. The HACC scheme has been profoundly successful in my electorate of Kennedy because it has enabled such people to stay at home. This approach has been so successful that it is now being extended to the area of hostel services. Currently hostel subsidies are only available to people living in a hostel. This Bill, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, will enable hostel personal care subsidies to be paid to people receiving hostel personal care in their own homes. The mid-term review of the Government's aged care reform strategy has recommended greater flexibility in the provision of aged care services. In response, this Bill enables over $24m over a four-year period to be provided for community aged care packages. This new initiative will enable the more frail aged in our community to remain in their own homes rather than having to enter residential accommodation earlier than necessary. I know that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, certainly applauds this response. The Government has consistently demonstrated its commitment to aged care service development and its concern to ensure the relevance of services to the people needing those services. As part of the Government's practice of keeping the program continually under review, it was decided to reduce the target for the provision of hostel places from 60 to 55 places per 1,000 people aged 70 or over. The decision was taken as part of a wider range of decisions to provide more appropriate and effective care for those aged people with a higher level of care needs. The care packages will replace these five hostel places per 1,000, providing both a much greater level of independence and a guaranteed level of security. In keeping with this Government's aged care policy objectives, the packages are designed to offer an alternative to residential care in hostels for those aged people who, with a package of support, could still live independently outside hostels. The packages will be aimed at those people living in their own homes who have a high level of dependency or a large range of care needs and who are assessed as being at risk of needing admission to a hostel. Despite significant improvements and the numerous benefits of residential care, most older people stay within their own homes because they want to. The development of the care packages recognises this and allows for services to be delivered to appropriately assist people in their own homes. These packages will use a care package manager to arrange a comprehensive package of services. The manager will make use of the many different types of services currently available. These include residential facilities, community services, relatives and neighbours and, of course, private providers. All of the people participating in the care packages will be assessed to determine their needs. A similar approach has been trialled under the community options projects under the home and community care program and the hostel option care packages. There are strong indications that this approach provides positive outcomes for the physical and emotional well-being of people using its services, particularly those at the higher dependency level, those with a greater range of care needs and those without carers at all. People at a high risk of entry to residential care have been able to stay in the community with similar security but, significantly, at no greater cost to themselves. It is recognised that, despite the numerous benefits of residential care, it can for some result in greater dependency. These packages maximise the choice for the individual and, as I have mentioned, they use a care package manager to make use of the different types of services currently available, including residential facilities, community services, relatives and neighbours and, as I have said, private providers. Time and again governments are accused of providing services without really listening to what people receiving those services want or what people receiving those services actuaIIy need. This initiative shows that the Government is listening and that what it is hearing that frail aged people want to stay in their own homes provided that they can get the services that they actually need. This initiative by the Government will promote just that. To stay in one's own home provides many frail aged people with a sense of belonging and level of independence that others in the compared munity so often take for granted. It may be house in which a person has lived for half of that person's life, full of memories of family or a community in which that person has lived or worked for most of that person's life. Why should we take such people out of those current system. communities? This initiative will have two major benefits for service providers. Firstly, this coordination of services will result in a more efficient of resources through better use of existing facilities such as kitchens, transport and care services. Secondly, it will allow for a greater level of contact between the various organisations which provide aged care seris vices. The development of community care packthousands ages instead of hostel places is a sensible initiative, particularly in the bush. It of great benefit to those people to whom owe so much, that is, the older citizens of this country. Last night the honourable member for Dawson went on and on and on about how this Government is ignoring dementia sufferers. The honourable member for Dawson is ignoring the fundamentals of this Bill. One of the major reasons for the restructuring of hostel personal care funding is to better target funding to hostel residents suffering from dementia. The existing arrangements provide for only one level of personal care subsidy for a wide range of care needs. This is a disincentive for hostels to admit more frail residents. The new arrangements will provide for three levels of funding for residents requiring personal care. Firstly, additional support will be available for the top 10 per cent of residents who are very physically frail, including people with dementia. Secondly, additional funding will be directed to residents with a moderate degree of confusion or dementia. Thirdly, residents with moderate personal care is needs will continue to be supported. So, while the existing dementia grants program is being phased out and incorporated into recurrent funding, the two higher subsidy levels will be provided to all hostels which a provide care to dementia sufferers, as comwith only about 37 per cent of hostels a under the current dementia grants program. It is a far fairer arrangement, as now all hostel residents assessed as needing support for dementia will receive support, compared to the 50 per cent of such residents under the I believe the honourable member for Dawson has a personal interest in all this and I am surprised that someone who knows the ins and outs of the hostel and nursing home use industry, as he does, would have a problem recognising that dementia sufferers will be home getting a far better deal under this Bill. Another initiative in this Bill that I applaud the extension of the controls over the quality of personnel operating approved nursing homes to the hostels sector. There are of honest, experienced, efficient people working in the aged care industry. will be This amendment to the Aged or Disabled we Persons Homes Act will help to ensure that only people with these qualities are involved with the industry. Of course, I know that you, Me Deputy Speaker, will agree that that is the way it should be. lt may suit the honourable member for Dawson to have this Bill delayed. But I am sure it will not suit the thousands of service providers who would be caused unnecessary anguish as a result of the honourable member for Dawson's obstructionist amendment. This Government is well aware of the problems that delays in funding can cause for nursing homes. This matter is specifically addressed by this legislation. The Bill proposes amendments to the National Health Act 1953 which will enable a nursing home to delay applying for a new classification for a patient whose previous classification expired during or shortly after return from hospital leave. Other amendments address nursing homes' concerns about delays in receiving funding for the nursing and personal care of new residents. I believe there is absolutely no need to delay the implementation of these measures, as would be the case if we agreed to the obstructionist amendment proposed by the honourable member for Dawson. I also point out that the Bill contains additional amendments to the National Health Act in relation to nursing home matters. The provisions that I particularly welcome, because of the nature of my electorate are for isolated nursing homes whose infrastructure costs are substantially higher than those of most other homes because of their isolated location. I guess one cannot get much more isolated than Mount Isa and the other remote towns and cities in my electorate. The aged care initiatives announced in the 1991-92 Budget and implemented in this Bill will make further choices available to Australia's aged population, which will lead inevitably to a far better, far improved quality of life. Unlike the honourable member for Dawson I welcome the speedy introduction of thrange of initiatives implemented by this Bill and I certainly commend the Bill to the House.",127
28,Dr BOB WOODS,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Lowe) (5.57 p.m.)Yesterday, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) led for the Opposition when the debate was resumed on the second reading of the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill. Honourable members will recall that the Bill was not listed on the blue sheet and, due to the conclusion of other business and in order to facilitate the work of the House, the honourable member for Dawson agreed to speak on this Bill at very short notice. In the circumstances, there was very little time for him to prepare. I understand that he was addressing the House while the second reading amendment was being typed. Honourable members who refer to Hansard will note that in his speech the honourable member for Dawson referred to the concerns about the adequacy of funding for dementia. The honourable member had intended that this matter should be dealt with in his second re-ding amendment. But, as it happened, this pomt was not picked up. So, on behalf of the honourable member for Dawson, I seek leave to amend his amendment to the motion for the second reading by the addition of a short paragraph at the end to address this point. Leave granted.",130
29,Dr BOB WOODS,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) calls on the Government to defer the planned automatic revocation of approvals of certain hostels and nursing homes until: (a) appropriate legislation is in place to ensure continuity of funding to the nursing homes and hostels to be transferred; (b) proper guidelines are drawn up for the proposed transfer of accommodation services to the States which will ensure continuity of funding at current levels and on current terms; (c) there is complete clarification of their intended relationships between State and Federal Governments as to funding of accommodation services; and (2) expresses its concern at the inadequacy of dementia and nursing home infrastructure funding"".",130
30,Dr BOB WOODS,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I also emphasise on behalf of the honourable member for Dawson that, should we get to the committee stagewhich looks somewhat unlikely in view of the guillotine-we will oppose clauses 13,38 and 53. There are a few areas which relate to my portfolio in terms of health rather than aged care. Firstly, I will talk about the changes to radiology for physiotherapists, which is covered in this Bill. As I think the House is aware, the bipartisan approach of the Government and the Opposition in regard to this has led to a sensible change in the legislation to allow for the loopholes in radiology referrals from physiotherapists to be covered. I think the House will also be aware from the debate on the Health Insurance Amendment Bill last week that we were going to move an amendment to cover both the physiotherapists and the podiatrists. The Government has agreed that, should we get to the committee stage, we will move the amendments for the podiatrists. But in view of the fact that we probably will not get to the committee stage, I seek leave to table the amendments that we will move if we get there, covering both the physiotherapists, which are now covered elsewhere, and the podiatrists.",130
31,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,I understand that they will be incorporated in Hansard if there is no time to move them.,131
32,Dr BOB WOODS,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I will touch briefly on the problems. It is very important that the podiatrists and physiotherapists be offered the same rights in terms of radiology referrals as the chiropractors. This is another unintended consequence of the Government in relation to the referrals for radiology procedures. It is very clear that physiotherapists do time to time need X-rays to tell them what is going on with people's backs in particular, and podiatrists of course do need X-rays of the foot and lower leg to tell them what is going on with the feet. At present, as a supposed cost saving measure, it was intended that patients would have to go to their GP to get a referral for these services, rather than be referred by their physiotherapist. This clearly will not save money overall. It might have saved money on one aspect of the Budget, but it clearly would not save money because visits to the GP would have to be funded, at least on the first occasion to get the referral, and probably on the second occasion to get the report. I think the Government has very sensibly understood that there was an unintended loophole there. I think these amendments do actually close this loophole, and I am very happy to say that we have looked after the needs of not so much the podiatrists and the physiotherapists but the patients of the podiatrists and the physiotherapists. Since the guillotine has been applied, and as I know a number of speakers wish to address the House, I will be as brief as I can. The part of the legislation which relates to the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority contains an amendment which in effect allows a process of appeal against decisions of the PRA. As a result of this, aggrieved applicants will be able to go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of decisions in relation to the approval to dispense pharmaceutical benefits scheme prescriptions, and also in terms of essential pharmacy allowances and payment of financial assistance to amalgamate or close. Senator Walters actually drafted an amendment which was worded in very similar terms with certainly the same effect. So, since we would have supported Senator Walters's amendment, we will certainly support this. Again it is a reflection on the poor drafting, perhaps because of the haste in which the drafting was carried out, that there was really no effective system of appeal against the decisions of the PRA. There does need to be a system of appeal as there are a number of from problems with the PRA. I think the House is aware, as a result of some of the questions which were asked in the Senate Estimates committee, of the extensive problems in Port Macquarie Those matters are being investigated. It does seem as if there has been some, let me say, dirty work afoot, in metaphorical terms. There is also another problem much closer to my own home, in fact, which is the area of Homebush West and Flemington. A pharmacist in that area received $70,000 to close. There was no account taken of the need in that area by the Authority. That area has a large number of elderly patients who need a lot of scripts and who are basically not very mobile. Public transport in that area is not good. It has really meant that a number of these elderly patients face a trudge over a couple of kilometres, across such areas as the Flemington Markets, in order to obtain their scripts. Clearly there is a need there, and that need is demonstrated by the fact that some 2,500 people in the local area alone have signed a petition. Dozens of schoolkids have written to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Little do they know it will not be worthwhile, because he will never do anything. But they have indicated their enthusiasm for the opening of a new pharmacy which, of course, because of the rigid guidelines of the PRA, has been denied. The guidelines say there needs to be a five kilometre space between pharmacists. In strict terms this area does not meet those criteria, even though the need is clearly demonstrated and will clearly be important, particularly to the elderly, in that community. This was mentioned in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday. I understand the journalist who wrote the article received communications from the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), indicating that the information we had given to the reporter about the Homebush West-Flemington area was wrong and that in fact the PRA had not closed any pharmacies. I am always inclined to believe nice things of people, particularly of course of Government members and politicians, so I would be reluctant to assume that the Minister was deliberately deceiving the Sydney Morning Herald reporter. But the facts of the matter are that a pharmacist did receive permission to close and did receive $70,000 from the PRA to close. The address, in case the Minister needs it, is 102 The Crescent. If the Minister wants to check the records, the information given to the Sydney Morning Herald was completely wrong. However, I will accept that it was a genuine mistake rather than a deliberate attempt to deceive. If the Minister checks the records, he will find that in fact that is the case. That is something that needs to be addressed and something I will continue to press for on behalf of the local community. I hope in the end we will get some common sense decisions from the Government about this matter. There are a number of other technical points in the legislation. I will go through them very quickly. They relate, in my area at least, to the National Food Authority Act. This provides that recommendations of the NHMRC which were made prior to the establishment of the National Food Authority but which were not actually dealt with by the previous council can be deemed to have been made under the new Act. It basically means that the recommendations can be dealt with as quickly as possible and the NFA does not have to start all over again. Again it was an oversight which is adequately corrected by this piece of legislation. It is a change which we will, of course, support. There is another loophole corrected and that is again supported by the Opposition, and indeed I think by the whole medical profession. I refer to the introduction of Medicare benefits to encourage day only surgery and the certification which is needed to go with these procedures. The amendment rectifies the oversight. Previously it meant that that certification system was not available to doctors at freestanding surgery facilities. I gather there are something like 64 of these around Australia. That is another loophole which we are happy to support the correction of-although we believe these errors should not occur. However, as they have occurred we are happy to fix them up. We have been very unhappy about the actions of the PRA, but we support the changes here. We will support, in concert with the Government, the changes for physiotherapists and podiatrists and to the National Food Authority Act, and also, of course, to the certification procedures. So from the health point of view we are happy to support the procedures in question, just by moving the simple amendment which has been agreed to by the Government to allow podiatrists the same access to radiology referrals as physiotherapists and chiropractors have at present. However, I just remind the House that should we get to the committee stage, we will be opposing clauses 13, 38 and 53 as has been pre-empted by the honourable member for Dawson.",131
33,Mr SNOW,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"It gives me great pleasure to support the measures in the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill. I particularly refer to the matters aimed at implementing the Government's aged care policy. I briefly want to respond to the comments of the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) on the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority, particularly the action he mentioned relating to a phalmacy in the Sydney area. I have been advised that there are approximately 35 pharmacies in the vicinity of the phannacy which was closed. I can assure the honourable member for Lowe that the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority, and I have had quite a lot to do with the development of the policy on this matter, does take into full account the accessibility of phannacies. He may feel five kilometres is not far enough, but I can tell the House that people in the Eden-Monaro electorate may have to travel 70 kilometres to a pharmacy. People in the electorate of Kalgoorlie I am sure would have to travel hundreds of kilometres to the nearest pharmacy. Dr Bob Woods-And you are supporting it?",133
34,Mr SNOW,SERVICES LEGISLATION,I think it ought to be explained once again that the legislation which resulted in the establishment of the Phannacy Restructuring Authority came from negotiations between the Government and the Pharmacy Guild. The Pharmacy Guild had been saying to Government for many years that it would like the Government to implement measures which reduced the number of pharmacies. Dr Bob Woods-That is not true.,133
35,Mr SNOW,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"It had been and, not only that, there was an organisation formed within official pharmacyDr Bob Woods-Basically, but that is not the Pharmacy Guild.",133
36,Mr SNOW,SERVICES LEGISLATION,There was an organisation formed within official pharmacy which strongly supported the moves that were taken. Dr Bob Woods-But not the Pharmacy Guild.,133
37,Mr SNOW,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"The Pharmacy Guild not only now supports that agreement, and supported the negotiations, but actively provides evidence of that support to pharmacists who feel that they would perhaps like to open. In my own area a pharmacy recently closed at Merimbula, where there were two pharmacies. The people at Tura Beach, an area which has about 2,000 people, have been told by a pharmacist who holidays there occasionally that he would not mind opening a pharmacy part time. That is 4.7 kilometres away from the nearest pharmacy-just under five kilometres jf it is established in the shopping centre. Naturally, the applicant pharmacist would be interested in establishing it near a shopping centre. He has said that he would be prepared to establish the pharmacy even though he knows that it will not be particularly lucrative. We need to have regard to that fact because the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal invariably puts the case that the dispensing fees it pays should be based on the dispensing costs of a pharmacy processing a reasonable number of prescriptions. Naturally, in an area with a population of 2,000 people, the number of prescriptions would be fairly low. When the number of prescriptions is low, the cost of dispensing goes up. It goes up quite heavily because every pharmacy has the same infrastructure. The pharmacist usually has a computer; there is stock and, quite often, in a small pharmacy there are items which are dispensed perhaps only once, twice or three times a month. A pharmacy servicing a low number of people still has to keep a fairly high level of stock compared with phannacies dispensing a large number of prescriptions. The pharmacy has to have a pharmacist and that pharmacist is entitled to receive a reasonable income. Of course, what the Government has been saying to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal is that it should not have to pay dispensing fees on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which will cover the costs of pharmacies which dispense well below average numbers of prescriptions. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia, of course, said to the Government, 'If you are going to do that, we would like you to do something about the number of pharmacies'. The Government came back to the Pharmacy Guild and said, 'Well, we feel that you are the people to do that. Why can't the industry do something about control? We are moving towards industry control; why doesn't the industry control numbers?'. The Pharmacy Guild said, 'Well, we can't'. I can understand that. It is a difficult thing for anyone to do. However, in the end the Government-there were a lot of mixed feelings within the Government-reluctantly, I believe, agreed to restrict the number of pharmacies, to allow pharmacies to close. We agreed to give pharmacists an amount of money to close. It was quite a lot of money if pharmacists had been there for quite a while-perhaps $60,000; the honourable member for Lowe mentioned $70,000. We said that we would give pharmacists that money if they were prepared to close. There was considered to be a surplus number of pharmacies. It is not a decision made, as the honourable member for Lowe said, just on the basis of a pharmacist applying. It is a decision that is made after full consideration. I refer to his example of 35 pharmacies within a five kilometre radius. We cannot have it both ways. Plenty of pharmacists have come to me and said, 'Jim, we feel that there ought to be people who are allowed to get out. They want to get out. They are really locked into this position. They are locked into their pharmacies. They are not making enough money for them. They would rather be out'. In the end they successfully proposed what was eventually adopted by the Government. The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) knows what we went through-how much we went through in dealing with pharmacists and their concerns, how much negotiation there was. It was very extensive negotiation. Previously pharmacists were very unhappy. They had signs in their windows telling people that the pharmacy would be closed if the Hawke Government were re-elected. Well, it is interesting to see what has happened. I have plenty of pharm-cist friends. One friend still has his four cars. One still has his boat and is able to play golf once a week. They are good friends. They deserve it. They have been in business a long time. But they are still there. I might have been in that position if I had not come into this place eight or nine years ago. They are people of my own age and they are doing pretty well in pharmacy. They are not complaining now. They have done well, particularly when we take into account inflation and the fact that there has not been a level playing field. As I said to the honourable member for Lowe the other day, when the Government is paying bills either directly or indirectly we can never say that there is a level playing field. So those pharmacists are not doing too badly. I want to say some things about the Government's aged care policy. The Government has a policy which is coherent, forward thinking, cost effective and is welcomed by both service providers and older people. By contrast, the Opposition has produced nothing except a few vague words about removing fees control in nursing homes, means testing nursing home benefits and allowing people to buy into a nursing home. Of course, the Opposition is also talking about the impending goods and services tax. Its impact on aged care is awaited, quite properly, with considerable trepidation, particularly by the residents of aged care facilities. I add also that disabled people feel trepidation about the imposition of a goods and services tax-perhaps imposed on wheelchairs and crutches. Certainly, the residents of aged care facilities will be paying a goods and services tax. Really what the Opposition has done, just as it did today in regard to employment issues, is come into this place again and attack the Government in all directions on aged care matters while it has had nothing to say. The Opposition does not have a policy. We are waiting for health policies. We are waiting for policies on aged care. We are waiting for policies on the disabled. Mr Webster-You won't have long to wait, Jim.",133
38,Mr SNOW,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Is it all going to come out in that beautiful tax statement? If the honourable member does not believe me I ask him to listen to what the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association says in this regard. That Association stated in a newsletter of 15 October this year: To its great discredit the coalition allowed Labor to take the initiative, consult widely with aU manner of people and organisations during Labor's latter years in the political wilderness and the result was a consensus policy that went to the 1983 election carrying the broad endorsement of many disparate groups. The newsletter continued: We trust that today's coalition will learn from the lessons of history. There is no evidence of that. All we hear is attack from Opposition members, as happened again today with the attack by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on the Government's employment initiatives. I believe that we are yet to see whether that trust expressed in the newsletter is to be vindicated. I want to tum to some of the specific measures introduced in the Bill. Probably the most significant change relates to the restructuring of hostel subsidies. The role of hostels in the provision of care for the aged is a significant one. This was recognised in the nursing homes and hostels review of 1986 and the establishment of the residential planning ratios which provided for a significantly expanded role for hostels in the provision of aged care. In the period 1985 to 1991 some 12,000 new hostel places have been provided. The frailty of hostel residents also has increased over this period. In 1985 some 46 per cent of hostel residents were assessed as requiring personal care. This is compared with 57 per cent of residents in 1991. Therefore, the need for hostels to support a higher number of frail residents was recognised in the Government's provision of a real increase in the rate of personal care subsidies. This has increased from $7.80 a day in 1986 to $22.95 a day from 13 November 1991. The honourable member for Dawson (Mf Braithwaite) attacked the level of personal care subsidy. He talked about dementia patients. We are providing for dementia patients. We recognise that as time goes on people have a longer life expectancy. That means that more of us will suffer from dementia. Therefore, it is important that we take particular care to ensure that hostels and nursing homes have the ability to handle those dementia patients. One level of personal care subsidy has been replaced. That subsidy gave no recognition at all to the variable care requirements of hostel residents assessed as needing personal care support. There was no distinction between the more frail resident requiring support for a wide range of services and the less frail resident with less complex needs. No incentive was provided to hostels to cater for the more frail. Since August 1990, the Government has been carrying out a review of hostel recurrent funding to examine the effectiveness of the present two-tier hostel recurrent subsidy arrangements. Speci fically, subsidies should assist in providing an incentive for hostels to provide for increasingly frail people and accurately reflect the varied levels of care required by those people. The review consulted with peak bodies representing the service providers, consumers and unions, and took submissions from a wide range of organisations and individuals. The proposals in this Bill are the result. The Bill provides for the introduction of new arrangements for the personal care subsidy in hostels from 29 April 1992. The existing hostel care subsidy is unchanged. The new arrangements will replace the existing single level of personal care subsidy with three levels of funding. The highest level will provide additional funding for the 10 per cent of residents who are very physically frail, including those with dementia. The second level will provide additional funding for residents with a moderate degree of confusion or dementia. Residents with moderate personal care needs will continue to be supported at the third level. Dr Bob Woods-Come on, Jim. We all cut our speeches short. Give Bruce a go.",134
39,Mr SNOW,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I felt that I had to spend some time in responding to the points made by the honourable member for Lowe. It is particularly important that I make these points as well. The threshold at which a resident can attract the subsidy will be effectively lowered in recognition of the requirement for personal care support services by a greater number of residents. The restructured personal care subsidy will provide clear incentives for hostels to provide care for more highly dependent and confused people. An additional $14.6m will be available in a full year in support of the restructured subsidy arrangements. The existing dementia grants program will be phased out over a two-year period and incorporated into the new subsidy arrangements. The new subsidies will be provided to all hostels which provide care to dementia sufferers, compared with about 37 per cent of hostels under the dementia grants program. Several interesting new programs have been introduced recently to help people in hostels with dementia. These new funding arrangements which allow hostels to develop some of these programs will continue. I am not going to elaborate on the programs because, while it is important that I make these points, I want to allow time for other honourable members. The revised hostel funding arrangements allow for equity in the financial support provided to hostels caring for people with dementia. Contrary to the previous arrangements, under which only half of all residents suffering from dementia received specific funding, the revised arrangements will ensure that all residents requiring support for dementia will be identified and will receive appropriate funding. The new arrangements will better enable hostels to play their part in the provision of a range of services to meet the needs of the frail aged. They will considerably benefit hostels and the resources of government will be more sharply focused on those with the greatest need. These changes further illustrate the ability of the Government to be sensitive to the changing needs of older people. The Government is able to react swiftly and appropriately to emerging situations. I made representations on - hose, and I am happy to support the flex1ble and coherent aged care planning which is in evidence in this legislation.",135
40,Mr REID,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I want to pay a tribute to the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), for the hard work and dedication he put in on behalf of the Australian Physiotherapy Association on the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill. I am sure, from the representations that I had from that association, that it would appreciate the hard work that he put into make the Government see reason on what had been a very grave error in its legislation. Once again, the legislation, as is often the case with legislation that comes before the House, was flawed. The shadow Minister for health picked up that problem with respect to the omission of the physiotherapists and the right of physiotherapists to request R-type Xrays. I know that the shadow Minister put in a tremendous amount of work with the physiotherapists throughout Australia and was instrumental in getting the Government to accept these amendments. The Government has seen the error of its ways and is now bringing forward these amendments. Like other members in this House, I received strenuous representations from a wide number of physiotherapists. They were particularly agitated about and stressed by the fact that under the original legislation they lacked the capacity to request R-type X-rays. They made strenuous representations to me. I want to mention a couple of them because a number of local physiotherapists made approaches to me. One was the Bendigo physiotherapy group which operates in Heathcote. I was also approached by Mr Trevor Peake, physiotherapist. I also had representations from Adrian Schoo and Ray Pang; Mr N.B. Houghton  Hughes, the President of the Australian Physiotherapy Association-and I am sure that he had extensive contact with the shadow Minis physiotherapist who runs the Golden City Physiotherapy Clinic; Mr Colin Faulkner, physiotherapist, also from the Golden City Physiotherapy Clinic; and Mrs Wendy Cumming from North Harcourt. That is probably only a small sample of the number of physiotherapists who had contact with honourable members not only on our side of the House but also on the Government side. The Government was very tardy in coming to grips with this problem. It certainly did not show any willingness to agree with the Opposition when this Bill was first debated in this House. I am pleased that the Government has now seen the light and has decided to bring forward these amendments which will, as a result of the lobbying by the coalition and particularly by my colleague the shadow Minister for health, include the physiotherapists and the payment of Medicare benefits for R-type diagnostic imaging services requested by physiotherapists. The Government should have taken note of the Opposition from the outset when it originally introduced the legislation to this House. It would have saved the physiotherapists and their Association from some expense in the extensive work they did to ensure that Opposition members were made aware of this. The Government obviously would have received representations from the Australian Physiotherapy Association, yet it took no notice. This is typical of what the Government claims is its consultation process: it makes a decision, tries to railroad it through the Parliament, and after the legislation comes into the Parliament and there is a bit of an outcry from the electorate, it says, 'We will go through the consultation process'. If the Government had listened earlier to the groups and taken note of the information that was provided by the Opposition parties, I am sure that it would have had a much better Bill from the outset. It could have been achieved without extra expense and without occupying the time of the House and that of the Australian Physiotherapy Association. I wrote to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) on 18 June about this matter. He responded to me on 15 August 1991. The final line of his letter, I think, sums everything up. It states: I hope to be able to introduce the requisite legislative amendments during the Budget Session of Parliament. He was living in hope. I would have thought that at that stage of the game, after the strenuous representations that he had had from both the shadow Minister and the Australian Physiotherapy Association, he would have done more than hope.",136

47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I understand it is the wish of the House to debate the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill concurrently with the Migration Amendment Bill (No.3). There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",139
48,Mr RUDDOCK,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Dundas) (8.00 p.m.)The Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill 1991 and the Migration Amendment Bill (No.3) 1991 are part of the Government's legislative scheme to introduce new charges on applicants, or more particularly their sponsors, for granting them a visa or entry permit to enter Australia. The classes of people who are involved in having to meet the taken) charges that are proposed under these Bills are those who come within certain groups. Firstly, there are those entitled to a parent visa in which the balance of family test has been met; that is, people who are migrating from overseas and who are parents of an Australian pennanent resident of more than 12 months duration and! or a citizen, and that person has enough brothers and sisters in Australia to satisfy the balance of family test. . That means that the majority of the family lives in Australia rather than a minority. It also applies to the visa class 104 where there are preferential family members involved. That means those who come within the special preferred class of family in respect of minor orphans, special need relatives, remaining relatives-that is, the ones who may have been left behind on their own because of the migration of other family members before-or certain aged dependents. It also applies to those who might come to Australia in the Lebanese concession class, and to people who are in like categories who apply to stay in Australia. They are granted an entry permit. It also applies to an aged parent who obtains an entry pennit after entry where the balance of family test is met; or a person who is able to sfay on compassionate grounds, and that applies in relation to orphan minors, special need relatives, remaining relatives and aged dependents. The Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill is designed to raise a charge of $822 which is paid in respect of all of the above visa or entry permits. It has been appliedand this legislation will therefore have some retrospective effect because it arose from the Budget-to those who have sought a visa or entry permit on or after 21 August 1991. Unless the charge is paid, the Minister can deny entry to such people. The person who has paid the charge for a relevant visa is exempted from paying the charge which would have arisen in respect of a relevant entry permit which corresponds with the class of visa granted. That means that when the person arrives at the door of Australia and is granted an entry permit, he does not have to pay the charge again if he came with a visa. If an applicant withdraws his application for a visa or entry permit, no charge will be levied. The new charge for health and associated costs is to be introduced at $822, we are told, for each person visaed. It will be indexed against the all group consumer price index and is therefore subject to an increase where the indexation factor in any relevant year calculated from 21 August 1992 is greater than one, and the charge cannot fall below its highest previously determined level. It has been calculated that the charge represents an estimated 50 per cent of the contribution towards the cost of the Commonwealth in providing access to medical, hospital and pharmaceutical benefits to assured persons during their first two years in Australia. It ought to be understood that it does not apply to the cost that might be generated either through the private sector or by State governments, which is a matter I understand of some concern to States in relation to this matter. We will not oppose this Bill because we think it is better existing system, and I will come to that in a moment. The Migration Amendment Bill (No.3) will give effect to the provisions of the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill when it is an Act. It will therefore commence on the same day. It amends sections 24 and 34 of the Migration Act which relate to the granting or refusal of visas or entry permits respectively. In the case of each section, the Bill introduces a requirement for the Minister to provide an applicant seeking to enter or remain in Australia with a notice in writing stating that the grant of the class of visa or entry permit applied for cannot take place unless the charge payable under the Migration (Health Services) Charge Act 1991 has been paid. These notices will apply only to those classes of visa or entry permits in respect of which an assurance of support is an essential criterion in relation to the person seeking to enter or remain in Australia. The Bill contains a prohibition on the Minister granting a visa or entry permit until the charge is paid. In addition, the regulation making power under the Migration Act is amended to provide for the refund of charges paid under the Migration (Health Services) Charge Act under exceptional circumstances. So this Bill gives effect to the health services levy and equally will not be opposed by us. While we are not opposing this legislation, that does not mean that we should not look at the schema that is applying, the explanation of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), and why this legislation is before us. I think it is important that we understand that. I do look at second reading speeches, and I read them. And I expect that when I read them. I might find some reasonable explanation as to why we are dealing with legislation. I wonder what this second reading speech might tell me about the legislation with which we are dealing. I certainly noted that the Minister linked this Bill, which deals with the levy charge for health and associated costs, with the general schema that has operated to require certain newcomers to Australia to offer assurances of support as a condition on acceptance of their than the relatives in Australia. It has been a matter of some long standing moment, because Australia has sought to put an emphasis on seeking skilled migrants who will add to Australia's benefit, that over time, as we have moved to put a greater emphasis upon family reunion, those who have sought family reunion have come to Government and said, 'Look, will you accept our relative? We know they do not have the same skills. They do not necessarily speak English. But we can tell you-we promise you-they will not be a charge on Australian taxpayers. We will look after them. We will meet all their needs. We will provide them with the housing. Just let them in'. The governments of the day, and I must say former governments, responded to those requests and they provided an assurance of suppo;:t scheme. Originally they used to even ask that they produce certain job nominations from people who guaranteed that the family member who was allowed into Australia would be able to be employed upon arrival. I have to say that over time these assuran·· ces of support have been maintained but only for the classes of relatives that are mentioned in this particular Bill; that is, parents, preferential family, minor orphans, special need relatives, those with a Lebanese concession and those who likewise apply to change status in Australia. Over time we have seen this schema-I must say that many people in the community still imagine that it exists-but over time all the brothers and sisters, all the nephews and nieces, have been allowed without any assurance of support to enter Australia under the concessi anal family category without having to establish the same standard of criteria in terms of skill and education and other attainment as independent applicants. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not know whether you are surprised about that, but I imagine that many people are surprised that that change has occurred over time. The assurance of support scheme is very narrowly based, but the Minister tells us: The purpose of the assurance of support scheme is to ensure that the burden of some costs which newcomers may generate during their initial years of residence in Australia are borne by their sponsoring families and not by the general community. It is important to note that the existence of an assurance does not mean that any person covered by it cannot receive social security benefits or other assistance. Rather, it means that the assurer to repay any support that is received. That seems to be a very reasonable statement. He went on to give us some other explanations of the assurance of support scheme. In fact, he tells us that, at the same time as the Government is introducing these provisions, it is watering down the assurance of support scheme over time. We will not see any further legislation; but, in regulations that will shortly be introduced, the Government will reduce the period for which assurances of support are given, but only for the very narrow class of parents and preferential family visa applicants, and those who get the entry permits that I have mentioned. Those family members covered by those assurances of support will now have to give that assurance for only two years rather than five as has been the case to date. The Minister said: This represents a marked decrease in the time taken to incur debts. It certainly does, and I must say that it transfers an obligation to taxpayers generally. He continued: Secondly, the debts that may be recovered have been restricted to special benefits and job search and Newstart allowances paid by the Commonwealth. Other support costs will no longer be recoverable. So all of the other costs that were traditionally the subject of assurances of support will no longer be the subject of a charge. What the Minister was telling us was that the Government is bringing in this new bonding arrangement, which will require somebody to put some money up front, to meet a much more limited assurance of support schema-one that is of shorter duration and which does not cover the same range of benefits as were previously covered. I read through the rest of the Minister's speech and I found a great deal of detail about the matters that were to be covered by the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill, but what interested me was that none of the matters that came to notice in the Senate this week in relation to the assurance of SUppOlt scheme-the disclosures by Senator Richardson-were mentioned by the Minister in his is liable speech. We all know, and we have known over a long period, that the assurance of support scheme was honoured more in the breach than it was in its acceptance. We all know that that was occurring. We all knew that a substantial review of the assurance of support scheme was required. I must say that I thought we would have seen from the Minister some evaluation of what was occurring, and some statement as to why this legislation was required and why the reform should take place. I thought we would have seen some information about the nature of the costs that new migrants imposed upon government generally and the difficulties that their families might often have to incur in meeting those obligations. But, no, there was very little of that sort of explanation. That, I must say, was of very real concern to me. Honourable members would agree, I think, that the support of the Australian people generally is crucial to the maintenance of any immigration program. I have to say that much of the support that the program has historically enjoyed has been seriously eroded in recent years in the light of proven and sustained abuse in many areas of the immigration program. There has been documented abuse across many categories, and while that might not always be the fault of those people who have exploited the possibilities, it certainly left the program with a tarnished reputation. I mention the sham marriages that we have dealt with recently and the business migration program. These are matters of very real concern. The fact is that the assurance of support scheme has also been abused. Millions of dollars remain outstanding, and a large proportion of those outstanding debts will never be recovered. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may be interested to know that Senator Richardson revealed in the Senate this week that at least $2Om has been lost in benefits not recovered this year under the assurance of support scheme-benefits that should have been reclaimed from supporting families. But, because of computer difficulties and problems of keeping track of people who had changed their name-anglicised their name in some cases, or had multiple spellings or whateverthe persons against whom claims for that money should be made could not be traced. Senator Richardson estimated that $32m had been spent on Job Search allowances, Newstart and special benefits for newly arrived migrants under the system. All of that money should have been recoverable under the assurance of support scheme. Yet the Minister told the Senate that only $1.77m of that was raised in debts in 1991. I have to say that this is the sort of information that brings the whole program into disrepute. It is a matter of very real concern to me and my colleagues when it occurs. This legislation was introduced, but there was no explanation from the Government of why it was introducing new arrangements of this sort. Not only has the Government been failing to administer properly this scheme, but also it hides the information from us when it can. The Minister did not mention it in his speech as a reason for introducing this new arrangement, but at the same time as he is putting this new arrangement in place, he is watering down the requirements generally for families to support migrants entering Australia. So I think that this is a matter of very real concern. The new medical levy is expected to recoup some $9.9m in a full financial year, according to the Government. So we can expect the cost of medical, hospital and pharmaceutical benefits to migrants who have been here for two years or less to be only around about $20m per year. However, it is not intended to recover any further health related costs, such as payment of sickness benefits in the first two years of settlement. Payment of sickness benefits to new migrants in the first several years after their arrival amounted to $23m in 1990-91. As I mentioned earlier, the health charge is intended to form a part of a new scheme to replace the old assurance of support scheme. The other part of the scheme involves the payment of a refundable bond by some applicants in the preferential family reunion program. The existing assurance of support scheme will be supplemented by a bond of $3,500 for principal applicants and $1,500 for other adults in the family, that is, those who are over the age of 18 years. It is to be used as the first avenue of recovery of debts incurred by assured migrants in relation to special benefits, Job Search and Newstart allowance paid by the Commonwealth. The bond must be paid prior to the visa or entry permit issue, we are told, and will be returned with interest if no claims have been made after the person enters Australia. The validity of the amended assurance of support scheme will be reduced from five years to two, as I have said earlier, and further costs which can be recovered under the assurance of support scheme have been significantly limited. Previously, liability extended to accommodation, surgical and dental treatment and any other allowance for the support of the assured migrant. Further, debts incurred by State, public or charitable institutions will no longer be recoverable under the new scheme. We have not seen this other legislative arrangement. As I said, I expect that it will be the subject of regulations, but it is now three months since the Minister announced the totality of this new scheme. These bonds were required to be paid before the Immigration Department would issue a visa authorising entry for those who applied for entry to Australia on or after 21 August 1991. I know I have been very critical from time to time of the speed at which the Department processes migrant applications, but I would be very surprised if we are not faced already with numbers of applicants from family members where assurances of support may be required, where these questions would be required and money ought to be presented. Funnily enough, I had one case drawn to my attention where a cheque for the bond money was sent with the assurance of support forms and lodged with the Department of Immigration in Brisbane. The cheque was returned because the officers in the Department did not know what to do with it. The question needs to be asked: what is happening to the applications that have been received since 21 August but are expected to have bonds? Are they being accepted? Is the requirement for the bond being waived? What arrangements is the Government making? It is all very well for the Minister to say that he intends to consult with communities before arrangements for the introduction of bonds are finalised, but how long should this process of consultation take? This is not the first example of undue delays in regard to implementation of announced Government policy as it affects the migration program. The time that will lapse between the abolition of the business migration program, for example, and any new business skills category that the Government promised to implement has already been announced as being over six months. These time lags between Government announcements of policy and the ability of the Government to implement policy indicates, at the very least, a lack of communication and, at the worse, incompetence that occurs when Ministers do not make appropriate demands upon the Service for performance. It may be thought that I have been on some frolic of my own in relation to these matters. Some people often suggest that when I speak about immigration matters and raise a concern about the performance of the Government and its Department of Immigration-and particularly when I have been suggesting that the Government has been allowing the skill level of the program to diminish; when I have made criticism of the way in which particularly the preferential family category has operated and has been abused, especially with sham marriages and the like; particularly when I have made comments in relation to the way in which the Government is now faced with an inability to control our migration entry through the very large numbers of illegal entrants that we are now receiving, the very large number of people now claiming refugee status-I am out there on a frolic of my own, raising these things and being very harsh in my comments, and I ought to let them go. But the fact is that we have seen this week all that I have been saying revealed by the Auditor-General as being absolutely correct in every respect-spot on. This is coming from people who have had the opportunity to do what I have not been able to do, and that is to get inside and see the way in which the processes are working, see the way the decision making processes are being undertaken and have a real understanding of what is occurring. The general public out there has an impression that there is something wrong, but people do not know, because all they ever see are outcomes; they are not in a position to make the judgments f- the inside. r want to read to the House something of what the Auditor-General had to say in his comments this week. This reflects very much the sort of observations r made a little while ago about the way in which this Department was treated by this Government when it ran down its ability to be able to effectively administer the migration program, when the Government starved it of funds instead of looking at other programs as a basis for determining savings. At a time when the immigration program was increasing in significant numbers the Government allowed the standard of processing to fall. It is not a matter to which the Auditor-General drew attention, but it is a matter about which I have commented. The Auditor-General noted: . . . that in recent years considerable attention has been paid to the need for Australia to become 'the clever country'a term that we have all no doubt heard. r am sure it is a term you are very familiar with,",139
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"'the clever country' - a term used frequently by our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)and policies and programs in several portfolios have taken account of the national requirement for upgrading the skills of Australian workers, investment in new technologies and encouragement of a range of activities in which the nation could develop a basis for competition with the rest of the world. He went on to say: This audit dealt with the selection of migrants in categories involving the assessment and testing of employability and skill and rating applicants on that basis. In the light of the national interest in 'the clever country' it might have been expected that the process would reflect rising standards and a high priority to selecting persons with skills needed in the Australian work force. In other words, the Auditor-General was pointing out that when we degrade testing, as this Government has done, when we abandon the requirement for assurances of support in relation to concessional family entrants, we ultimately get a lower standard of entrant. That is what he was saying. He went on to say: Several of the audit's conclusions suggest, however, that other policy priorities have received greater attention. He lists them: In Family migration, the program structure places the skill tested Concessional Family category on a 'residual' basis thus according it a lower priority than the Preferential Family category which is not skill tested. He goes on to say: · A higher than estimated number of approvals in the 'demand-driven' Preferential Family category leads to reducing numbers selected in the skill tested category. He makes a further point: · Changes in the points testchanges do not occur without changes by Governmentsuggest a partial withdrawal from a formerly close nexus between occupational skills, qualifications and experience. It is now less difficult for some applicants to be classified as skilled. These are comments from the Government's own independent assessor. He continues: · Comparing the skill tested categories, Concessional Family applicants receive the advantage in the points test of a lower Pass mark than Independent Entrant applicants, and may also receive substantial points towards the mark from family connections with a sponsor. What he is really saying is that in that concessional family class, for brothers and sisters, we can allow people entry provided they get the other points, from applicants who have a very low level of skill and do not even speak English. They are the very people who are manifested in all of the statistics on welfare benefits in Australia when they arrive. More than one-third of such people have no expectation of being able to obtain employment in Australia when they arrive here. This is the Government, in relation to that very group of people, which has abandoned any requirement for family members to offer an assurance of support. That is what happened. We have that situation. The Auditor General goes on to say: . The test process accords only marginal additional recognition to skills and occupations in short supply in Australia. There are no adjustments to reflect occupations in oversupply. These factors influence the process in directions away from the selection of the most skilled applicants, whose employment could make a substantial contribution towards the objective of a better skilled Australian work force. I regard this report from the Australian Auditor-General as one of the most fundamental reports that we have seen for some time, one which the Parliament ought to have a long, hard look at. This Government has been about lowering the standards of entry to this country for a time. The objective evidence is now on the table for people to make their judgments. Part of the objective evidence of the Government's failure is the introduction of this legislation and its requirement for bonds and for a levy. If the assurance of support scheme had been in operation and successful, and if it had been properly monitored by this Government, this legislation would never have seen the light of day and would never have been necessary.",144
50,Mrs CROSIO,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I support the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill. When the honourable member for Dundas (Mf Ruddock) began his speech I was very pleased to hear that the Opposition was not going to oppose the Bills before the House. I then listened to 10 minutes of tautology from the honourable member for Dundas, who obviously does not have either an independent thought or comment, because all he said in the first 10 minutes of his speech was what the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) should have said, did not say or did say. Because the honourable member needed a filler for the final 10 minutes of his 3--minute speech, he quoted from the Auditor-General's report. In future the honourable member for Dundas, particularly when he is the first speaker for the Opposition on a Bill before the House, should do some research. With research he would gain comprehension; with comprehension he would have understanding of why we need legislation before we have regulation, and why we have to amend Bills and put into process that regulation and legislation even though it was announced in the Budget of 21 August. The Bills before the House will allow for improvements to the arrangements for the recovery of cost in the Federal health and welfare Budget, which flows from the immigration program. The legislation proposes to improve existing cost recovery measures by changes to the assurance of support scheme and the implementation of the health charges. I agree with the honourable member for Dundas that the introduction of a health levy, which must be paid by sponsored migrants who come to this country with little or no intention or ability to support themselves, is long overdue. Such a charge, as outlined in the Migration Amendment Bill, would mean that migrants who come to Australia under an assurance of support from their sponsor would be contributing in a small way to the cost of Medicare and public health care, just as all Australian residents do. The majority of the migrants who would come under this category, as described by the honourable member for Dundas, would Qe too old to work or too young to work, as in the case of orphan migrants, or unable to work. Many of the people in this category may also be in need of medical attention in their first two years in Australia. At first glance this legislation appears to be tough, but on further investigation it becomes apparent that the Bill recognises the need to strike a balance between assurers' responsibilities and the protection of the community's resources. It also does not take away the individual's right to have access to social security benefits or Medicare. If the Opposition could have its way, it would ban newly arrived migrants for their first 12 months in Australia from access to these benefits and all services. Where is fairness and equity in the Opposition's policy? It is important to stress that the bond and the health charge will apply to only certain categories of migrant under the family reunion program. I will not go into those because the honourable member for Dundas has repeated it on at least three occasions. As these migrants are largely unable to support themselves!on arrival in Australia, such legislation as is now before the House is understandable. One part of the Minister's second reading speech that the honourable member for Dundas did not refer to states: This health charge will enable the Government to recover an estimated 50 per cent of the average medical, hospital and pharmaceutical costs incurred by persons covered by the assurance and will result in an additional estimated revenue to the Commonwealth of $9.9m in a full financial year. As soon as they become pennanent residents, these migrants are entitled to health and certain welfare benefits without having to make the lifetime contribution to these services that most other Australians have made through their taxes. When passed, this legislation will mean that the sponsoring families of migrants under an assurance of support would bear some of the cost that the migrants may generate in their first two years in Australia, rather than the community bearing the cost. Although I support the health charge, I am concerned about a certain double dipping scenario which may in a minority of cases occur on the Government's part as a result of this health charge. Obviously, the honourable member for Dundas was not aware of it; if he was, he did not mention it. I have expressed my concern in representations to the Minister and hope that such relevant legislation as this is not overshadowed by a problem which I believe could be rectified by a small amendment to the taxation Act. The problem I see is that, if a migrant under one of the relevant categories who must pay a health charge before being granted a visa and pennanent residency obtains a job not long after arrival in Australia as a resident, that migrant would pay for the Medicare levy in his or her taxes. Consequently, that migrant would be paying the Medicare levy twice. (Quorum formed) Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I thank the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) for calling the quorum. The problem I see-as I have already stated in the speech-is that, if a migrant under one of the relevant categories who must pay a health charge before being granted a visa and pennanent residency obtains a job not long after arrival in Australia as a resident, that migrant will pay for the Medicare levy in his or her taxes. Consequently, that migrant would effectively be paying the Medicare levy twice. As the Minister is aware, I have requested that he investigate the possibility of this situation arising and whether migrants affected by the 'double dipping' scenario would be able to receive a refund of the Medicare levy. Even if the migrant worked for three months out of his or her first 24 months in Australia, I believe that three twenty-fourths of the Medicare levy should be refunded to that migrant. In every other respect this legislation is fair, in that the Australian community at large is not bearing the burden of costs imposed by newly arrived migrants who are unlikely to contribute in any way to the payment of these costs. Under the assurance of support, the migrant's needs are again not having to be paid for by the community at large, but rather by a relative who has made the commitment to support that migrant for a period of two years. The full-year cost to the Commonwealth Government of social security payments to migrants who have been in Australia for 12 months or less was recently estimated by the Department of Finance to be $251m, with $183m of that being paid to migrants in unemployment benefits. Included in that figure are estimates for moneys paid out to newly arrived migrants in sickness allowance, special benefit, other benefits, family allowance and family allowance supplement. Other benefits paid to newly arrived migrants include the adult migrant English program living allowance and living allowances associated with fonnal education programs and with English as a second language courses. When the amount of money paid to migrants each year as benefits by this GovernmentMr Halverson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am having an enonnous amount of difficulty understanding the speaker, and I am just wondering also whether the Hansard reporters are in a position to record this accurately.",145
51,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,I am sure the honourable member would be aware of that and will bear this in mind for the rest of her fastly delivered speech.,146
52,Mrs CROSIO,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker; for the benefit of the Opposition and the Opposition Whip, I shall slow down-is taken into consideration, it becomes clear why it is necessary for an assurance of support to be forthcoming from those who are sponsoring relatives to come to Australia and why it is reasonable for the Government to request a bond-IO years, five years, after this two years. :f migrants have not had to make use of such benefits in their first two years in Australia, then that bond is recoverable. What must be remembered is that assurers have always had a legal commitment to repay the Commonwealth and other agencies moneys for services provided in support of sponsored migrants and for their health costs. This new arrangement, however, while reducing the extent of the liability from five to two years-a fact that the honourable member for Dundas reiterated in his tautology; and what he did not remind the House of was the fact that after two years one can become a permanent resident through citizenship of this country, so is he going to deny those citizens the right to full entitlements such as those an Australian born person is entitled to and, if so, will he want to also change that part of the Act? - will ensure that the Government is able to improve recovery rates if a sponsored migrant receives certain social security benefits. Under this legislation before the House, recoverable costs from the assurance and bond will be limited to the special benefit, Jobsearch and Newstart allowances paid by the Department of Social Security. The large majority of our migrants are not affected by this legislation and are not, for the benefit the honourable member for Dundas, a drain on our economy or our Budget-as a recent Bureau of Immigration Research report entitled Immigration and the Australian Economy has found. According to this report, the composition of the immigrant intake is of particular importance in regard to demand for government expenditure. Through much of the past decade there has been recurrent public debate over immigration and multiculturalism. For example, in 1984 the media claimed that immigration policy was contrary to the wishes of most Australians and threatened social cohesion; that it was leading to competition for scarce jobs and other opportunities; and that it left old Australians feeling like strangers in their own land. It sounds familiar; the honourable member for Dundas has just informed us of it all over again. Of course, in times of economic downturn such as this, the immigration program is always the first to be scrutinised by a public who feels that it is missing out in some way because of the people who are allowed into our country. It is the old story of scarce resources-in this case, employment-and every man, woman and child having to fend for themselves. The traditional views that immigration pressures the real wage down and/or adds to aggregate unemployment are now understood to be completely unfounded. The evidence indicates that immigration has no significant effect on aggregate unemployment; nor does it affect real wages, nominal wages or price inflation-again according to the Bureau of Immigration Research. Although equivalent net budget comparisons including health and education expenditure are not available to me, life cycle considerations suggest that immigrants might contribute more overall to government savings than non-immigrants. The traditional economic focus of the debate on immigration has been significantly overdrawn by supporters and critics alike. By contributing around 40 per cent of Australia's postwar population growth, immigration has clearly had a great impact on the scale of economic activity and the rate of economic of growth with major implications for specific industries, particularly housing and associated sectors. This major effect on overall economic activity is, however, associated with non-existent or very minor effects on such aggregate economic parameters as the real wage, unemployment, nominal wages, inflation and living standards. Research has found that immigrant household e,xpenditure is broadly similar in both magnitude and pattern to that of comparable non-immigrant households, although immigrant households spend relatively more on food and housing-related items. Recent statistics indicate that house purchase tends to occur either very soon after arrival or some years later, after financial consolidation. The construction sector is particularly stimulated by immigration. Although the short term demands from immigration on government are relatively small, investigation has shown that the relative youth of the immigrant intake tends to generate longer term shifts in overall per capita demands for education, health and welfare. Immigration has been a major contributor to Australia's increased scale of economic activity in recent decades, which has seen concurrent gains in industry productivity. Immigrant skill levels on entry are on average higher than those of the resident work force, and a greater proportion of the overseas born have post-school qualifications. For these margins to be properly reflected in skill gains across Australian industry, immigrants must attain positions in the labour market commensurate with their qualifications and background. This generally follows for English-speaking background immigrants but not necessarily for a lot of our others. Appropriate labour market and English language programs are clearly important to assist immigrants in their initial period along with effective procedures for evaluating and accrediting overseas based qualifications, and access to education and training. Further analysis from that same report by the Bureau of Immigration Research has found that there is no clear evidence on whether immigration's role as a source of skills has reduced Australia's commitment to its domestic education and training systems. However, there is likely to be a continuing important role for immigration as a supplementary source, whatever the strength of the domestic system. That report said that immigration does not appear to disproportionately affect the incidence of entrepreneurship in Australia. However, overseas born small business people appear more successful than the Australian born, so immigration may raise the quality of domestic entrepreneurial activity. I originally was not going to use these findings in this debate, but I brought them into show the honourable member for Dundas and the Opposition that, while there are certain charges associated with our immigrants when they first arrive in this country, there are also a lot more benefits we gain as a country overall. These findings, which have been carried out by people far more professional people than I am, have proven that immigration is valuable to Australia and that the majority of migrants are not relying on our social welfare system to support them. It also proves that, if given support and time to settle in, migrants can make and do make a worthy contribution to our country. Yet the legislation before the House is of great importance to the success of a fair and equitable immigration program in which sponsors and assurers are made to face up to the responsibilities of their commitment to support their newly arrived loved ones. Just recently, a committee called a public meeting in my electorate to say that this Bill was very harsh, that it was only going to allow the rich to sponsor their families in reunion and not anyone else. I say to them that a lot of people who, in the past, signed 10 years assurance of support, or five years, are honouring their agreement. Many, too, are contributing through their taxes to the support of others who choose not to honour their assurance of support. There are certain categories associated with our skill migration program as well as our point system program-but in these particular cases we do-and evidence has shown it very clearly-obtain benefit for this country. The legislation deals with a very specific immigrant coming into our country. I commend the Minister for bringing these Bills before the House. In doing so, he acknowledges not only the strength of family reunion but also the necessity for those people who state that they are willing to support and therefore want to be reunited with a remaining family member to also take onto their shoulders the responsibility associated with that desire. I believe it is only right and proper that, if a person is going to have access in this country to our Medicare and health programs structure that has been put into place over many years through the contribution of taxpayers' dollars, he or she in some small way should contribute to the facilities that are in place. If one talks to the migrants who have come to our country over the years and are settled within our communities and making a contribution to our country, one will find that they, too, support this legislation. They believe that it is up to the individual to honour his or her commitment. Most particularly the opportunity also should exist, for those who through unforeseen circumstances are not able to meet that commitment, to have available the assistance which is in place now. But, importantly, if one is going to sponsor and to accept that responsibility, one's signature must be worth more than just a piece of paper. What we have done is to put in legislation that says, 'You will provide a cash bond. In the event that your sponsored person, relative or whoever you are sponsoring does not have recourse to any of those special benefits from the Department of Social Security during the 24 months after your arrival in this country, that cash bond will be returned to you, the assurer'. What it also says is that, through that contribution of $822, which will be indexed as of next year, you contribute in some small measure to the health budget of this country. But, as I have said in the approach that I have already made to the Minister, I would like again to request that he fully investigate the fact that, if a person works in the country and pays or contributes to that Medicare levy in some way, he should not be asked to pay twice. I do not believe in double-dipping. I do not believe that that was the intent of this legislation or the intent of this Minister. (TIme expired)",147
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Before I call the honourable member for Warringah, I just inform the honourable member for Prospect that there was a period during her speech when, as she would understand, Hansard had difficulty in recording. We wi11look into this and I will refer it to the Speaker in the morning to see whether it can be recorded, but it was difficult for the Hansard people to receive it. Mrs Crosio-Due to the background noise, I am sure.",149
54,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,We will see.,149
55,Mr MACKELLAR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I thought that the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) was a little harsh on the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) when she accused him of lacking independent thought, and a couple of times accused him of tautology. I do not know whether she understands the word tautology but, on behalf of a very famous constituent of mine, Mr Rex Mossop, I want to assure her that in that classic confrontation of the use of the English language, the honourable member for Dundas, unfortunately in this case, would come a distinct second. I did not hear any tautological statements in his contribution to the House. Mr Hand-You were asleep.",149
56,Mr MACKELLAR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, who is not sitting in his proper place, interjects that I was asleep. At least I was in the House-and I was not asleep. I would have thought that in a discussionMr Hand-So you were asleep?",149
57,Mr MACKELLAR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"No, I was not asleep. But I would have thought that, at least in a discussion on the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill and the Migration Amendment Bill (No 3), for which he is allegedly responsible, he should have been in the House to hear the discussion. That is just another manifestation of the arrogance of this present Government in its treatment of the House of Representatives. With his background, the Minister should do better. Returning to the remarks of the honourable member for Prospect, I do agree with some of the things that she has said in the debate tonight. She said that the immigration program is the first casualty in a recession. That is true. There is no doubt that, when there are economic difficulties in any nation, the people of that nation start looking for scapegoats, and one of the most convenient scapegoats is the immigration program. A lot of angst and anger is directed against those people who are most recently in the country. The surprising thing about this is that it is not only those who could be regarded as natives of the country who direct this anger; a number of migrant communities themselves are also inclined to criticise the nature of the immigration program and to say that it is wrongly directed. There is no doubt that one of the first casualties in a recession is the acceptance by the host community of the newly arrived migrant. That is a particularly important comment to make and, unfortunately, the honourable member for Prospect did not go on to develop the point. What we have in Australia at present is a real disquiet-this was brought out by the honourable member for Dundas-about the nature and the extent of the immigration program as administered by the Minister, who is now sitting in his proper place in the chamber. The fact is that, to have a successful immigration program, one has to have a willingness of people to migrate to a country and a willingness of the people within the country to accept them. To have successful integration of newly arrived migrants into any country, one has to have an accepting host community. Unfortunately, because of a number of different factors, including, of course and most particularly, the recessive situation which this Government has brought about, the first casualties in terms public acceptance are the newly arrived migrants. Then we have to look at the nature of the program itself. The honourable member for Dundas has quite properly and appropriately drawn attention to the criticisms that have been made, not only by him as spokesman for the Opposition but by independent observers. He quoted the Auditor-General's report. I do not know whether the Minister would dispute the Auditor-General's report, or whether even so well informed an authority as the honourable member for Prospect would dispute the Auditor-General's report, which discusses the actions and the consequences of activities within the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. As we know, the Opposition will not oppose the Bills before the House. The point that I wish to make tonight is a fairly narrow one but, I believe, a most important one. It relates to Australia's right and responsibility to decide who shall or shall not enter this country. The national sovereignty of this country is determined by the government of the day administering an immigration program both for immigration and for temporary entry to this country. It is a very onerous responsibility on the Minister for immigration of the day to administer properly his responsibilities, particularly in a situation in which more and more people throughout the world are anxious to migrate to Australia or to live permanently in Australia. They will seek to live permanently in Australia either officially through the migration program or unofficially by coming in as visitors and then overstaying or seeking to regularise their permanent entry to Australia. They will do it in a variety of ways. Human ingenuity knows very few limits in relation to these activities. The Minister would know and be well aware of arranged marriages and all the other paraphernalia which are used by some unscrupulous people within the community to encourage people to circumvent the normal migration requirements. That does two things. Firstly, if it is successful, it gets around the program. In fact, it of sets aside the Government decision as to what the proper migrant permanent entry to Australia will be in anyone year or anyone period. It gets around that. Secondly, those who seek to enter Australia legally and properly are disadvantaged. It advantages those who get around it; those who do the right thing are disadvantaged. The Minister of the day, whoever he or she may be, has a responsibility to ensure that that does not happen. What has happened? I believe that in Australia at present we are seeing, and have seen over the past few years, a taking away from the Government of the right to determine the extent of the intake and the composition of the intake of people coming to Australia. We have seen it by the exercise of judicial power. Judicial power has taken away from the Minister of the day the right to exercise his or her proper responsibility to make the decisions as to the nature of the program, the extent of the program and how it will be adm inistered. For instance, one has only to look at the number of refugee applications. I am informed that there are-I cannot vouch for these figures-about 22,000 cases of refugees in the backlog at present. There about 800 to 1,000 new applications for refugee status per month. One has only to analyse that for a moment to see the enormous pressure that is placed upon the Minister's Department and the judicial process to understand how quickly the official program can be totally distorted. As I understand it, the present situation is cent. that additional staff have been made available by the Government to the Minister's Depalthave ment to handle this backlog. But in fact I informed that the backlog is not being diminof ished; they are just keeping pace with the rate of applications. Here we have one particular example of how the official program of address immigration to Australia is being rapidly cycircumvented by the interference of the judicial process. The honourable member for Dundas mentioned the case of the Hell's Angels. I do not know the individuals involved. I did have the responsibility of administering the Department for a number of years, and I do know sorts of advice that come to the Department nothing. from time to time as to the background of certain applicants for entry, whether it be permanent or temporary. Mr HandI rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have no difficulty with what the honourable member is saying. I would remind him, however, that the Hell's Angels case is still very much before the courts. I have no difficulty with the broader comments the honourable member is making, but for his information I just explain to him that the matter is very much before the courts.",149
58,Mr MACKELLAR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I take the Minister's the point. I again make the point that in fact the case originally went to the court and, as understand it, a decision was made. There may be an appeal against that Mr Hand-There is an appeal.",151
59,Mr MACKELLAR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"If there has been an appeal against that, obviously I will not go into any further detail-except to say that it does underline the sort of situation which the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs is having to deal with at the present time. I have a copy here of the most recent annual report, Review '91. One of the intriguing things about Review '91, the annual report of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, is that it has an inclusion in it about court cases, about the number of cases taken to court and about the success rate. I do not have the reference immediately available, but the success rate is not too far above 50 per That is a very worrying situation when we the government of the day making the am decisions about the nature, extent and scope the immigration program, and that power being taken away in a very real sense by the legal system. I think the Government should this matter as a matter of great urgenMr Hanrl-We are.",151
60,Mr MACKELLAR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"Well, the Minister has not done much about it. Mr Hand-It is a bit difficult. What did you do when you were the Minister? You did the nothing. You sat on your hands and did",151
61,Mr MACKELLAR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I at least controlled the program. I am quite happy to look at the nature of the program when I was the Minister and defend my record against that of the Minister. The other thing that worries me is that the total number likely to come in under the present program is really not revealed in the statistics that we have available to us. We all know, of course, that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) from a personal point of view made a decision about certain students following the Tiananmen Square massacre, and everybody can understand the background to Prime Minister's concern. But what I am extremely concerned about is that the rate of I entry which follows from this shan be controlled in such a way that the conditions of entry 'will be properly administered so that we do not get a distortion of the stated program which the public has available to it at the present time. Mr Hand-On a point of order, Me Deputy Speaker: I have been fairly relaxed about the direction the honourable member is taking. For the last 12 minutes he has not referred to the legislation before the House. I was prepared not to raise the point but, given that he is talking about the administration of the Department and the inference there being on members of the Department, I ask you to get the honourable member to refer to the legislation before the House.",151
62,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,There is no point of order. I have been following the debate. Mr Hand-On a further point of order,152
63,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,I have ruled that there is no point of order. Mr Hand-On a further point of order,152
64,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"-I hope it is not frivolous. Mr Hand-It is not frivolous. The matter before the House does not deal with the question of refugees in any way at all. My point of order is that the honourable member is addressing the question of refugee processing, which has no relationship to the legislation before the House at all. There is no connection.",152
65,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,It has been a wide-ranging debate. There is no point of order.,152
66,Mr MACKELLAR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"--The honourable member for Prospect outlined the nature of the Bills before the House and in fact mentioned that they were brought into recover costs which had been found to have been unnecessarily incurred by entrants lUlder the program as administered by the Minister; therefore, there was a need to protect the Australian community from unnecessary costs. This is in the nature of the program as it has been formulated and administered by the Minister. I am merely stating that, if we are to discuss the program, then that covers the whole program. There is absolutely no criticism of the Department for a moment because the Department administers the instructions and laws which have been laid down by this Government, or the government of the day. There is no criticism of the Department whatsoever. The criticism is of the Minister, and he recognises that it is of him because he knows, as I know, that the program is out of control. Mr Hand-That is rubbish.",152
67,Mr MACKELLAR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"I will tell the Minister another thingthe people of Australia know that the program is out of control, and there is extreme disquiet about it. Mr Hand-I rise again on a point of order. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have to be reasonable about this. The argument has been put by the honourable member, but I draw your attention to the matter before the House. If the Opposition wants to have a knock down, drag out blue about immigration I will do that, but this is going beyond any concept of a wide-ranging debate into matters that have no relationship to the legislation.",152
68,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,The Chair wilI listen to the debate as it now proce-ds and reminds the honourable member that there is a cognate debate and perhaps he could relate to the subject matter.,152
69,Mr MACKELLAR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"For the Minister's knowledge, if I can educate him just a fraction, the proposed amendments to the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill 1991 raise an $822 charge which is paid in respect of a relevant visa or entry permit which has been applied for on or after 21 August 1991. This is to deal with people coming into this countryMr Hand-Legally.",152
70,Mr MACKELLAR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,Legally--absolutely right-to make sure they are not a continuing drag in the first couple of years on the taxpayer. Agreed? Agreed. What I am saying is that it has been brought in simply because the program as applied by the Minister has been found to be deficient. Mr Hand-No.,152
71,Mr MACKELLAR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"If it was not deficient, why did the Minister bring it in? If it was working properly, why did the Minister have to bring in this sort of legislation? I understand the sensitivity of the Minister. We all understand that he has made a decision that it has all been too hard so he will get out of the Parliament. I can understand that. I can recognise the forces he has had to contend with. He has been trying to administer a department, and I assumeMrs Crosio- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There is no way in the world that the Minister has been trying to implement a program for a department, he has done it very efficiently and very succinctly.",152
72,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SERVICES LEGISLATION,Order! That is not a point of order. I remind the honourable member that such a point of order can be regarded as frivolous. I call the honourable member for MACKellar.,153
73,Mr MACKELLAR,SERVICES LEGISLATION,"There is no way that I am being frivolous. I wish to say to the Minister and to the House in general that the people of Australia do not know the details. They cannot know the details. But there is essential disquiet about the administration the immigration and ethnic affairs portfolio. There is something wrong. The Auditorreduce General in his report has demonstrated that number of areas require very careful attention. The point I wish to make is that, if we are have a successful migration program, we must look at both sides of the equation. We must look at the rights and the opportunities of those who legally come into Australia who wish to make it their home. Just as importantly, we also need to make sure that the host population is aware, and supportive in general, of the broad thrust of the immigration program. That is not the case at present.

74,Mr DUFFY,FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Federal Court of Australia Amendment an Bill 1991 will provide a new representative of action procedure in the Federal Court. The new procedure will enhance access to justice, the costs of proceedings and promote a efficiency in the use of court resources. Under the Bill a person will be able to bring a to proceeding on behalf of a group of persons where the claims of those persons arise out of the same, similar or related circumstances and a common question of law or fact arises with and respect to all their claims. The new representative proceeding provided in the Bill is based on the existing representative action procedure in the Federal Court and in State supreme courts. The Bill gives the Federal Court an efficient and effective procedure to deal with multiple claims. Such a procedure is needed for two purposes. The first is to provide a real remedy where, although many people are affected and the total amount at issue is significant, each person's loss is small and not economically viable to recover in individual actions. It will thus give access to the courts to those in the community who have been effectively denied justice because of the high cost of taking action. The second purpose of the Bill is to deal efficiently with the situation where the damages sought by each claimant are large - n­ ough to justify individual actions and a large number of persons wish to sue the respondent. The new procedure will mean that groups of persons, whether they be shareholders or investors, or people pursuing consumer claims, will be able to obtain redress and do so more cheaply and efficiently than would be the case with individual actions. The procedure contained in the Bill has been developed following the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission entitled Grouped Proceedings in the Federal Court, which was tabled in Parliament in December 1988. The Government was not able to accept all the Law Reform Commission's recommendations. ill particular, it has not adopted the Commission's 'grouped proceedings' approach or the extension of the Federal Court's jurisdiction for such proceedings. The Commission's proposals for contingency fees and a grouped proceedings assistance fund have also not been adopted. The Government has engaged in an extensive consultative process in preparing this Bill and has received comment from the business community and consumer and legal groups. Since the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) announced details of the Government's proposed reforms, two matters of concern have been raised by some sections of the business community and of the consumer movement. The area of concern to business appears to be whether persons having relevant claims against the respondent should be included in the group covered by the proceedings unless they choose to opt out or whether all such persons should have to take a positive step to be included, that is, to opt in. The Government believes that an opt out procedure is preferable on grounds both of equity and efficiency. It ensures that people, particularly those who are poor or less educated, can obtain redress where they may be unable to take the positive step of having themselves included in the proceedings. It also achieves the goals of obtaining a common, binding decision while leaving a person who wishes to do so free to leave the group and pursue his or her claim separately. Some consumer groups have expressed concern that the new procedure will not be available for causes of action arising before the commencement of the amending Art. Practical considerations have led to the Bf ,. applying only to future causes of actit·"" These are the possible insurance implications of enabling increased recovery of claims in respect of past premium years and the possible impact on the Federal Court if past claims could be brought. The only likely costs to business of the reforms in the Bill will be through people being able to enforce existing substantive rights which claimants could not previously afford to enforce even though the liabilities existed. This is to the benefit of ethical businesses which honour their legal obligations without having to be forced to do so by legal action. The other main feature of the Bill is the comprehensive powers given to the Court to ensure that the proceedings are not abused. The Court will be able to order that a proceeding no longer continue as a representative proceeding where it is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so because, amongst other matters, it would be less expensive to have separate proceedings or that the relief sought could be obtained by means of an individual proceeding. It will retain all its current powers including the power to stay or dismiss any application it considers to be vexatious, oppressive or trivial. The Court is also given power to stay or discontinue any representative action where it considers that the costs of identifying group members and distributing money ordered to be paid to them would be excessive having regard to the total of the amount at issue. These reforms are a significant part of the Government's equity and access policies embodied in its social justice program. There is considerable community concern about the cost of, and access to, justice which is now the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The measures contained in this Bill will remove at least some of the barriers for persons who seek redress before the courts. The Bill represents a considered, balanced and responsible response to problems in an area where there is a recognised and pressing need for reform. It is not expected that the Bill will have a significant financial impact. A small number of additional cases may be brought. Offsetting this will be savings where multiple individual actions would otherwise be brought. I present the explanatory memorandum for this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.

80,Mr SMITH,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"The Bills we are debating cognately tonight, the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991, the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991 and the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991, are three Bills introduced by the Government to give effect to a change announced in the and Budget with regard to fees for radio and also to facilitate the treatment of applications for PM licences in regional Australia. I have indicated previously, and do so again, that the three Bills enjoy the support of the coalition. We welcome them, although we have some reservations. This matter has been in contemplation for some considerable period, and I will be making some remarks about that. The measures in these three Bills will allow the faster delivery of new PM commercial and supplementary radio services to regional listeners under the regional radio program, and they will also implement measures announced, as I said, in the Budget. The Parliamentaty Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) has just anived. I inform him that I am agreeing to these Bills; They also implement measures announced in the Budget to have the cunent level of annual commercial, supplementary and remote radio licence fees, and to streamline the taxation arrangements for broadcasting licensees. The regional radio program amendments replace the current establishment and AM-FM conversion fees with an FM access fee to be paid by all commercial and supplementary non-metropolitan radio licensees before they commence service on the FM band. They permit a supplementary radio licence to serve an area smaller than that served by the related commercial radio licences. They also enable a supplementary radio licence to be separated from the related commercial radio licence two years after the commencement of the supplementary service. The Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill, which is a separate Bill, will cut in half the annual licence fees payable for commercial, supplementary and remote radio licences and it will establish a procedure for self-assessment by licensees of annual licence fees. There will be a requirement to pay all annual licence fees on 31 December each year for commercial, supplementary and remote radio services and commercial.and remote television services. That is provided for in the third Bill, which relates to television licences. The concession that is provided to the radio industry by way of licence fee reduction amounts to about $8m a year. One of the interesting features-if time permits, I might comment on it later-is that there is going to be an FM access fee. It is in my view a double-dip fee. I know that the Government was approached by many in the industry to see whether or not that double dipping by the Commonwealth could be avoided. There was a group named Equity in Licence Fees that was put together to make these approaches to the Government, but it would appear that its arguments have not been listened to, which I think is regrettable. The basis upon which it put its approach is that there is already an existing fee structure and this is a double dip, but primarily of course the state of the industry is such that any alleviation of additional fees would at least ensure some continued viability. The matter of viability is also one that I will need to raise because this Bill winds back substantially the test of financial viability, which is a major criterion for assessment by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in issuing licences. As I said, these Bills will not be opposed by the coalition, although on many occasions we have expressed concern, as has the industry, about the snail-like pace of change under the Government. I will be raising some particular concerns a little later. But, taken as a whole, these amendments are a step in the right direction. That is not to say the industry will not face considerable hurdles, especially in the present difficult economic climate. However, the radio industry is a mature one. Many of the regulations surrounding it are questionable, and it is certainly time for review. Interestingly, the exposure draft of the new broadcasting services Bill, which has now been in the public arena for some three or four months, recognises this fact and it presupposes-if it enjoys the support of the Parliament-a dramatic change in how we treat radio in this country. Driving the legislative changes are the rapidly changing and emerging technologies, increased networking and multi-station ownership, all of which we have to recognise. If more broadcasting channels are to be opened up to new players, then the existing operators must be allowed to operate freely in the more competitive environment that technology is going to force upon the industry and will become a reality. The immediate impact on the economics of the radio industry may well be negative. The radio industry is in a very difficult position now. The emergence of new technologies may have some negative impact on some areas. However, the removal of the regulatory stranglehold will, in tum, create new opportunities. This is the area that is the most exciting. It will, at the same time, bring in tremendous change as the industry copes with the impact of that technology in the mid1990s. Of some concern to the industry-in relation to the primary Bill, the Broadcasting Amendment Bill-is the insertion in the Broadcasting Act of a new section 80B which restricts the meaning of the term - commercial viability'. The term 'commercial viability' was a concept applied by the ABT in determining whether a licence would be granted. Broadly speaking, there was a test to see whether these services would be commercially viable. If it was felt that they would not be, a licence would not be granted. It effectively put in place a barrier to entry to the market. This has been a consistent approach of policy. This Bill winds that back. That, in itself, is a good thing. Like so much, we must not just go halfway. If we are to vary and remove that particular centrepiece of policy, we must also address the other regulations and restrictions because those other barriers to entry and the protection of the existing regime need to be challenged. There are four areas that need to be addressed in this sense. Firstly, we have to approve adequate and comprehensive services to an area under the existing regime. That is a fairly high test to meet. Perhaps that ought to be reviewed. Secondly, the 20 per cent Australian music content requirement would need to be reviewed. Thirdly, the requirement to provide local news needs to be reviewed, as well as the issue of deregulation of the labour market-the requirements of industry to be locked into awards for the AJA and the PREIA, which covers technicians. All those matters must be reviewed as well. If we are going to a deregulated industry then we must ensure that all the regulations, restrictions protection mechanisms that have existed to give us the radio industry that we know are reviewed as well. That is the point I make. Another point that needs to be made is that the existing regime gives us relevance, in terms of the local market that is being served, and reliability. They are features of the existing radio market. That will change as a product of broader policies that will need to be pursued by both governments and oppositions, regardless of which side of the House we might be on. We are going to see a movement to quantity. That may well have some impact on quality. There will be a wider variety of services available, there will be more niche programming, smaller audience groups and, therefore, there will be far greater choice. Under the existing regime we seek greater diversity but there will be pressures for the opportunity to provide even greater ranges of choice. That may well see some areas of programming curtailed. I suspect that in the early period there will be more noise because most programming will start to move towards the music type. In my view, this Bill is a way station on the continuum of the highway to major change. In that sense, we certainly support it. I am flagging that there is greater change yet to come. Whilst this addresses a specific - roblem in regional Australia-for a long hme we have argued from this side of the House, as has the industry, a far more liberal approach to allowing FM, a technology that has been around for 40 years, to be made available in regional markets-it is not as quick as I and the industry would like and I do not agree with the access fee system. But it is certainly a step in .the right direction. It is my view that it is not so much frequency that attracts audiences as format. What the audience gets is not determined so much by the frequency by which it is delivered, but b- t?e fo-at. We want to see a viability wlthlO the 10 dus try. That is currently under threat but there has to be a recognition that we have to balance those two issues. The Government has fallen down on the side of and providing the opportunity for greater choice and greater utilisation of emerging technologies. We would certainly be going in that direction. We have to recognise that there are dramatic revenue difficulties for the industry. By coincidence, today the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal issued radio advertising figures which show a drop of 3.7 per cent relative to the same period in 1990. Of course, advertising underpins the viability of the radio industry, so industry is certainly in a very difficult position. I have not sought leave from the Parliamentary Secretary at the table but I am sure that he will grant leave when I seek to table a graph showing the direction of radio revenue based on the industry'S figures, which show that the industry has had a particularly difficult time. The graph shows that revenues for radio stations in Tasmania have dropped dramatically. By way of a complete and total diversion, Mr Deputy Speaker, by coincidence you are in the chair, the Parliamentary Secretary is at the table and I am here. Tonight we will not have a re-run of the SBS debate, as we did the other evening. I hope that during that debate it was not construed that I reflected in any way upon your chairmanship, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will not now enter into the debate, but I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary would know that it is not usually in my nature to become so agitated. Mr Snowdon-You are very much a gentleman.",155
81,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,Is the honourable member seeking leave?,158
82,Mr SMITH,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"Yes, I am seeking leave for that graph to be tabled. Leave granted. Mr O'Keefe-Is that leave to discuss SBS, or what?",158
83,Mr SMITH,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"I just tabled a document about radio. We are not going to discuss SBS tonight. I was saying that the revenue has dropped dramatically for radio. This has been very difficult for the industry. At the same time, it has to go through a very difficult regulatory regime. It is clear that that adds to costs. Whilst we are having some change here, there are other changes that need to be taken into account. The Broadcasting Services Bill will, if supported, give far greater flexibility but it will not give the features of the existing system. The existing system is now undergoing change. It is inevitable that that take place. It will be driven by technology, and that technology must be accommodated. Digital audio broadcasting will have an impact in the medium term in this country and that will provide the opportunity, with CD quality frequency, to deliver services to many more people. There will be frequency liberation. That compounds the problem of charging monopoly rents. That is what the current system is about. I have often asked why country areas are paying a fee. If we are going to have greater frequency liberation, what is the point of having a fee system? It seems to me that no economic rent should be sought outside capital cities. I wonder whether we ought to be treating metropolitan radio regimes and regional country regimes completely differently. We do in the television industry; as we tried to pursue a policy in this country of greater diversity by the aggregation policy, we found-because of the economic pressures that policy has forced operators to acquire additional capital equipment-that there have to be concessions. They amount to over $ 100m. That recognises the difference between networking and metropolitan and regional markets. What we are going to see in emerging technologies in radio is a greater capacity for networking. This Bill recognises that with the seven station rule. I wonder whether that is a realistic rule. In any event, perhaps it should be lower. It is clear that there will be this change. Equating the needs and opportunities in regional Australia to those of the metropolitan area by way of seeking the economic rent in the system that we do now is something that ought to be totally and completely reviewed. It has, in part, been done within the regime of the television industry. There are some other matters that I want to mention. I have already talked about commercial viability, but the watering down of that viability test and the legislative preference given to new players may mean that only in the largest metropolitan markets can the existing stations meet the competition head on by merging or by establishing AM-PM combinations. In the smallest markets, however, the existing incumbent will be able to establish an PM supplementary but not without cost and several lean years. It takes about $lm, I am told by the industry, to set up a new station, with costs running at about 150 per cent and revenues at about 120 per cent, which wipes out profit in' the initial establishment years. On the other hand, it does provide the station with the efficiencies which arise from the synergy achieved. An industry prediction is that in the bigger markets revenues are likely to fall as stations face new competition without the ability to tap extra revenue sources. The anomalies are clear apparently in the case of the Wollongong market. There are also issues in my own area. For example, the Bill appears to be silent on a number of matters. In the area of Launceston there is the capacity for an applicant to apply for an FM licence, but the proposal is silent on whether or not the other AM operator is able to object. One has to ask why it is that an existing AM operator just cannot automatically apply to have the FM licence. It appears to be something that should be addressed. The competitive challenges facing the commercial radio industry are broadly in three areas. The radio advertising revenues, as I have pointed out from the ABT figures, are likely to experience only modest growth, and this is due in no large part to the recession that we 'had to have' and its accompanying low inflation rates in an economy that is stubbornly refusing to move out of the doldrums, despite the protestations to the contrary by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today. Another reason is the modest increase in total advertising expenditure in the short to medium term. There is no reason to believe that radio would extract an increasing share of the total and finite advertising cake. The second challenge is that competition is likely to intensify, and that was the point I was making earlier. We are likely to see more than just one more commercial station in each regional market and two new commercial stations in each metropolitan market by the middle of this decade. This is an acknowledgment of emerging new technologies such as DAB, which I have talked about and experienced overseas. I might just cite what has happened in New Zealand. There has been an explosion of radio stations in that country. In one year, 1990-91, the number of commercial radio stations increased from 56 to 75 and all commercial stations increased by 34 per cent. Privately owned commercial stations increased by 86 per cent in the short space of 13 months. Soon there will be 261 stations, servicing a total population of 3.4 million. Australia, in comparison, has 147 commercial radio stations servicing a population of 17.2 million. I go back to the point that I was making earlier. We are emerging out of a fairly restricted regime, recognising that technology is driving that change. We are doing so at a time when the economic revenues expected to flow to commercial stations are not going to grow; they are going to be lower. There is going to be greater competition. Programming is going to be more narrowly focused. There will be many more stations. It will become somewhat more difficult for people such as us to determine what will happen, but it will certainly be different. I suspect that there will be an emphasis on quantity and more noise rather than quality. I think the community has to recognise that this change is going to come about. The industry does, reluctant as it is. It is not being forced necessarily by governments. In fact, I think that the Government has been too slow to recognise the changes that are about, and that is in part why we welcome this Bill. I think it has tried to put in place a far too restrictive regime with all the tests for localism, content and commercial viability. All those things I mentioned have to be reviewed. We are going to see change. It will go in the direction of the New Zealand model, and underpinning it, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications, who is an expert in these areas, would know, will be this frequency liberalisation that is going to come about. I understand that that area itself is going to be subject to a reform. We have had a parliamentary committee recently report on that area. We are going to have to come to grips with those issues. At the end of the day we must make sure that legislation is technologically neutral. We allow the marketplace to take advantage of those technologies. We always will be concerned to ensure that the community is serviced by relevant programming where we are able but, if we are going to take the view that we have to be restrictive abo""\lt that, that is the wrong role for governmerit. I think the only thing that can be said is that there is going to be tremendous change. The result of all this is that future profit growth and perhaps even profit maintenance are going to have to come from continued cost cutting and cost control. That is why the issues about labour arrangements are so important in this particular industry. It is the capacity of the stations to pay their staff relative to their audience, to their own productivity and to their own ability to attract audience and advertisers that will be important. If there are, as a set constant, wage levels and so on that cannot be negotiated directly with those participating, that is another major barrier that has to be addressed. Of course, there is even recognition within the Labor Party now that direct labour relations is something that must take place in this country. The final matter that I think is worth mentioning is a change that relates to the ability of public radio licensees in areas which do .not overlap with a commercial radio licence service area to broadcast sponsorship announcements. They will run in total for not more than four minutes per hour of broadcasting time. Clearly this is a change to allow public broadcasting to advertise. Indeed, some public broadcasters have been advertising or running sponsorship. I think the closest local example is the Goulburn station. Clearly this will mean that this area also will be out there competing _ for part of the advertising/sponsorship market. The SBS and the television area are now doing it and now the Government is permitting public broadcasters to do it. If this takes place, the amount that will be flowing to public broadcasting from government will be scrutinised to see whether or not the amount needs to be increased, because basically it has been government funding and great support from volunteers that has enabled public broadcasting to be in its present state in Australia. It is quite successful. The ethnic public broadcasting people came to see me the other day, and I was surprised at the extent of the services that they provide to communities around Australia. They play a very useful and quite significant role. I do not always agree with some of the material that is broadcast but, given that we are going to have an explosion of services that will be available to the community, in a democracy it is good to see that diversity emerging. In time it will probably be cheaper to set up a radio station than it is to buy a newsagency. We have to recognise that fact and that therefore we will have greater diversity. So public broadcasting is playing a role, but it is a significant change for the Government to permit sponsorship on the public broadcasters. It is in a very limited form at this stage. I suspect, though, that it is the thin end of the wedge. I have an interesting quote that we picked up from Sir Denis Forman, who is the Deputy Chairman of the Granada Group in the United Kingdom, from The Listener in December 1989. He said: On a national scale it is dangerous to meddle with the delicate checks and balances of a broadcasting system without calculating the results very carefully. Clearly his message was that the advertising cake is finite-that is certainly what the marketplace says-and if the Government gives someone a bigger slice everyone else gets less and demands a subsidy or goes broke. In an age when subsidies have come to an end, the alternatives will be that broadcasters will survive or fall on their ability to attract audience and, if they do not do well, they will not survive. It will not be for governments to be in a position to support that enterprise. Therefore, in that sense, the Government has started to embrace a very open regime of broadcasting in this country. The major debate on this whole central issue will be during the broadcast services Bill when it finally comes to this Parliament. That will be a very significant debate, because it will signal that a 50-year old piece of legislation that has been much amended and is heavily regulatory will be subject to intensive community discussion. I commend the Minister for taking that path. I think that is sensible. He did that with the telecommunications Bill, which was sensible. At the end we had a much better Bill because of it. Indeed, in this area the situation will be much the same. No-one can predict the outcome, but certainly there is a recognition of the significance of this area, which touches every Australian home. Every Australian home has a radio, and the vast majority have television sets. We are seeing a tremendous change take place. It is being driven by technology. We must accept it, and we must accept that there is a lesser role for government in this area. That is to be welcomed; it is not to be feared. But there will be dramatic changes in the mix and diversity of programming available to people and in the methods by which it is delivered to the community. Finally, I turn to the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill. All that Bill does is set a common payment date of 31 December. No concessions are given to the television industry with regard to the amount of fees that it pays. I am prepared to be corrected by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table, but I think that the amount is in the order of $93m a year. I know that in a recent speech to the Federation of Australian Television Stations the Minister said that he hoped there would be a capacity to reduce the impost of those fees, which is a super tax on the industry, in the next Budget. I am one who will certainly want to keep him to that agenda, because they are being used as a taxing point in a way that is unfair, as is the proposal for the double dipping access fee, which is encapsulated in this proposal that is being debated this evening. With those few remarks, and in the very calmest of terms, I say to the Parliamentary Secretary that we will be supporting these three pieces of legislation.",158
84,Mr OKEEFE,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a pleasure to appear in the House before you. I commence my contribution by saying that I welcome the Opposition's decision to support this legislation because it is recognised that at the moment it is needed. As has been outlined, the amendments to the Broadcasting Act define the term - commercial viability' for the purposes of the licensing provisions. The Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill abolishOne es the current establishment and conversion fees and replaces them with an FM access be fee. The Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill amends the Broadcasting Act to set a common date for the payment of licence fees. There are some questions one could ask about these three pieces of legislation. I would briefly like to cover those questions and some of the answers to them from the Government's perspective. Certainly people are entitled to ask why we are introducing these changes to the Act at the same time as we are distributing publicly a draft Broadcasting Services Bill for public discussion and consideration. That Bill is about much more fundamental reform in the industry as a whole. The fact is that we have recently tabled and released for public discussion a more fundamental approach to overall broadcasting reform than is represented in these three Bills. However, particularly in the case of regional radio, we have decided that urgent remedial action is required and these measures should not be put off pending finalisation of the broader review. I think it is true to say that there is very little possibility of the legislative changes that will result from the broader reform of the Broadcasting Services Bill being implemented before July next year. Therefore, there is a need for these transitional arrangements to go ahead. I might say that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and the FM Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Me Snowdon) have widely consulted the various players in the industry and the community in general on these measures during the past 15 months. I know that the Caucus working group that specialises in broadcasting issues, under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), has also worked through a lot of these issues. They all agree on the point that it is important to introduce these reforms at this point, even though they will certainly be subsumed in a much broader reform towards the middle of next year. One might ask why we are inserting into the Act a definition of commercial viability in advance of the Broadcasting Services Bill. could ask why this would not lead to further legal delays and whether it would not - asier to remove it altogether. It is important' for people to understand that the proposed definition and the related amendments which limit its consideration are intended to limit the pressure on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to carry out the exhaustive investigations, often at the behest of parties opposing the introduction of new services, as it is required to do under the current Act. In this way we hope to limit the potential for delays in the licensing process. These delays have been the constant focus of all the bodies presenting before us during the past 12 to 15 months. We also seek to reduce the Tribunal's current obligation to seek independent certainty in assessing commercial viability. We hope to redress the imbalance in past inquiries where, for various reasons, too much emphasis has been placed on the commercial viability criteria at the expense of other equally important considerations, such as the desirability of introducing more services. In respect of the question about favouring independent services and competition when in fact efficiency, cost and diversity arguments suggest that there may be merit in supporting the introduction of supplementary licences, I would just like to say this: while it is difficult to substantiate arguments that supplementary licences are the best way to achieve efficiency and diversity in service provision, we have accepted that in certain cases we do need to keep that option open. There will be areas where it has to be admitted that additional commercial radio services are not feasible. Therefore, in certain situations we need to maintain the option for the approval of supplementary licences. This Bill, therefore, introduces streamlined measures to achieve that, recognising that in some cases a supplementary licence is the most practical way to introduce a new service. But in general we are saying that, in the interests of encouraging diversity of media ownership, it is preferable that a competitive service be introduced wherever it is reasonably practicable to do so, and therefore this Bill includes provisions which give a clear preference to commercial radio licences over supplementary radio licences. What that means in simple terms is that, where we feel that there is the prospect of providing a licence for a new radio service, we would be looking to the marketplace for people interested in setting up commercially under a principle of commercial viability, and such people would be able to tender for a licence based on those criteria. Where there is not the capacity to provide for an additional player, a supplementary licence for an additional station might be authorised for an existing operator. A lot needs to be said about the new access fee for FM radio, particularly in respect of why we have chosen to go down the road that we have rather than introduce a tender system. While the tender process has been used successfully for AM-FM conversion in metropolitan services and was initially proposed for regional radio, it is not compatible with the viability tests and the merit selection procedures for regional radio licences, which we have undertaken to maintain pending the completion of consultations on the draft Broadcasting Services Bill. The current high level of fees has acted to discourage applications for new licences, and that has turned out to be contrary in practice to the policy of increasing the number of competing licences. We believe that the current fee structure has contributed to the difficulties that a commercial radio licensee may face in establishing a new service in the current economic climate, when advertising revenues are hard to win and the establishment capital required, particularly in the radio market-although it is not nearly as high as in newspapers and television-is substantial and is in a much smaller revenue market for advertising. We have recognised that there is a need to reduce the fees that are involved. We are introducing a fee structure which is more effective in supporting these broadcasting objectives. We believe it will remove the discriminatory burden on new independent services. We believe it will provide greater equity between new service providers and that it will apply across the board on common principles to independent services, to supplementaries and to AM-PM conversions. We are keen to try to reduce the workload of the Tribunal in this area, given that there are a number of protracted inquiries currently before the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The arrangements that we have provided for in the Bill-the special transitional arrangements-are intended to ensure that enactment of the legislation will provide for those independent applicants to come under the regime of the lower fees. In the case of supplementary applications lodged before the 23 July announcement, no fee will apply on the basis that these applications were lodged on the understanding that no fee would be payable. One might say that this is government by press release, but the fact is that the statement was made on 23 July and the expectation was there for people intending to operate in this sector of the industry, so this legislation gives effect to the fact that applicamassive tions lodged before 23 July will proceed on that basis. We should also make something of the fact that the Government has decided to reduce the level of radio licence fees by 50 per cent. It is not often that governments reduce charges by 50 per cent. There is a question, I suppose, that could be raised as to why television licence fees are not being reduced by a similar amount. What we would say about that is that we are recognising the fact that the radio industry is becoming increasingly competitive and that the public may be better served by a financially stable commercial radio industry. Not so long ago, when tendering for licences operated, a number of proprietors or intending proprietors did pay prices for their licences which were far beyond the capacity of the revenue in the industry to support. In other words, they have rendered themselves financially non-viable, with high borrowings and high tenderings, and that has led to a lot of instability in the industry. We see the need to stabilise that. We have given consideration to a similar reduction for television licensees, but we have decided that radio and television are different and that in this case the first step ought to be to separate the regulation of commercial radio from that of television. It is interesting that, in the broader reform paper that has been issued for public comment, the Government is canvassing the question of radio operating without restriction, it virtually being accepted that there are so many players in the game that there is not the need for the same controls on competition and range of audience that might operate in television. So there are considerable differences being flagged between commercial radio and television. We are recognising the fact that, from the terms of the regional radio plan and the national metropolitan plan, there has been greatly increased competition and at the same time the industry has been coping with rapid technological change. That is a point the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) raised in his comments earlier. It is true to say that the industry is not going to be stagnant in terms of technology; there will be changes and it could be as soon as five years when people receive their radio information, their radio broadcasting, in completely different technology than that which they are dealing with now. We need to provide flexible legislation that moves with that. Therefore, our view is that we should increase the number and range of broadcasting services available to the public and we should not take a high taxing approach to the industry. We are also recognising that the commercial television industry has been experiencing financial difficulties over the past few years, but these problems are largely due to the commercial decisions made by those directly involved, and we do not take responsibility for those decisions. By implication, there is some acceptance of responsibility for some part of the difficulties in the radio industry. However, we are pledging relief totalling $117m for commercial television licensees who are establishing new commercial services in regional areas under the equalisation policy. If the question is raised as to why we are doing this for radio and not for television, I think there are very good reasons for the difference, and in fact it can be demonstrated that we are not without regard for the difficulties in the television industry at the moment. I will conclude my remarks by commenting briefly on the questions of self-assessment and the common due date. The introduction of the licence fee, self-assessment scheme and the common due date is intended to simplify the administration of the current licence fee system for licensees and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Payment on 31 December means that some licensees will have to pay their licence fees for the 1991-92 financial year six months earlier than they would under the current system, but they have known about this change for at least five months now, and we believe they have had enough time to plan for the common due date. The downstream benefits of a common date in the industry are there for everybody to see and understand. I do not believe it is an issue which will cause any real difficulties. I also make the point that there are no transitional pro rata provisions included in the Bill for the introduction of the 31 December 1992 due date. This is because only the payment due date and not the period for which the fees are calculated has been changed. In other words, licence fees will still be calculated for the financial year, and that means that by 31 December 1992 they will have had plenty of time to plan for that introduction of the common due date. We have given a lot of consideration to these transitional changes. We have looked at the questions that are most likely to be asked by the industry and by people interested in these issues. We have tried to accommodate those questions in the context of a much broader review of broadcasting policy, which I think without question will be one of the most exciting things done in this field for many decades. But we have recognised that, while that broader review is taking place during the public comment period, there is a need to do something immediately in these fields in particular, and that is why we have taken the step of introducing these three Bills, knowing full well that they will be subsumed in broader action in about eight months time. In the meantime I think it is a response to the industry, and the industry will be pleased to see it happening. I appreciate the fact that the Opposition has chosen to support the legislation. The comments which the honourable member for Bass has made will certainly be taken into account in our deliberations. In conclusion, I support the legislation.",161
85,Mr CADMAN,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"Mitchell) (10.10 p.m.)The chairman of the Caucus committee normally supports the legislation and he normally runs his own line at the beginning of his speech and the Caucus line at the end. It was very interesting to watch the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) perform, and I thank him for his speech. Tonight we are considering some interesting Bills, basically non-contentious but important just the same. In my view, the Government has been far too timid in its approach in this area. It needs to be more adventurous and take up some of the challenges of micro-economic reform which are so critical to Australia's future. The demand for new and changing services in Australia has never been more pressing than it is at the moment. In fact, worldwide there has been a massive change in the way in which the use of the radio spectrum and the whole range of broadcasting and telecommunications services is being regarded. It is critical for Australia's future that we take up the challenges of changing technology, because we are geographically located in an area which is dependent on technological change. If we cannot take up the advantages, if we are unwilling or held back by any means whatsoever, we jeopardise our future, including the options available and the leadership that we should be showing in our region. Australia now has the chance to take a lead in this field, but regrettably some time has been lost through the Government's wish to control too tightly telecommunications and the use of the broadcast systems. That is unfortunate, but it is a characteristic of Labor Party governments that they cannot arrange a competitive approach where they cannot intervene. They always must be regulating and intervening. That has damaged to a fair degree Australia's opportunities in this adventurous and exciting field. Unfortunately, as well as those restrictions on Australia's use of the radio spectrum, telecommunications and broadcasting is hampered by the role of some very powerful players in the field. One of the most notable of these must be the Telecom unions. Those unions are seeking, step after step, to assume control in areas in which they currently do not have control and to tighten their control in areas in which they are now active. The prospects for Australia in this area are massive. The prospects for employment and for the development of new skills. semi-trades and services can be developed to our advantage. That is why I am particularly keen that we move quickly into this development. If we hang back in this area to the same degree as we have hung back in waterfront reform, we run the risk not only of losing our international opportunities but also of not being able to create the jobs and skills that are so sorely needed in Australia. I know of only a few areas in which Australia can take a lead. Perhaps tourism is one, but this certainly is an area that Australia can take a lead in. Australian citizens have intelliments gence and high education levels, and we have a dedicated and hard working work force, if it is permitted to operate freely, and we should be taking advantage of that. Intellectual ability, more than anything else. is required in this field. and that is where Australia excelsand we should be taking the lead in our region. The technological development is fast and unpredictable. User preferences cannot be predicted in any way. The quick change some years ago from black and white television to colour television indicates the nature of the Australian community. It is made up of people who want to move ahead quickly and take advantage of new technology. The use of cellular mobile phones is another area which is massively growing as, unpredictably, Australians have seen the benefits of this new technology and are reaching out to take advantage of it. It is convenient, it is particularly applicable with the long distances that we have in Australia, and it allows the nature of our workplace, both in cities and in the country, to be accommodated. The nature of future demand for services is unpredictable; it cannot readily be foreseen or coped with by government. The Government's processes are not sufficiently flexible, far-sighted or close enough to the marketplace to understand why it suddenly becomes very convenient for plumbers, builders, carpenters, truckies, and all sorts of people who need to be in touch, to grab the cellular mobile phone or to take advantage of radio systems. Those are two recent examples of where there has been a change in technological demand. The Government is currently moving to pay television. Nobody can predict how quickly that will be taken up by the Australian community. It may be immensely attractive; it may not be. Cable television is also some time down the track. Nobody can predict where we are going to go, what the demands will be or what the possible rewards will be for those who take up the challenge and present these services to the Australian people. The unpredictable nature of what we are dealing with is something that governare not good at handling. Technology and government combined do not create certainty in the marketplace. I was very attracted by a comment of Nicholas Negroponte of MIT's Media Lab in which he outlined the need for change. He said: ... what currently goes through wires, chiefly voice, will move to air; what currently goes through the air, chiefly video, will move to wires. The phone will become wireless, as mobile as a watch and as personal as a wallet; computer video will run over fibre optic cables in switched digital systems as convenient as the telephone is today. There is the massive change and the possible complete reversal of the modes of communication as predicted by one person. Who can confidently predict that? How can government regulate effectively in that area, meet the demands and allow the flexibility and opportunities we so desperately need to take us to the forefront in these fields? Whilst acknowledging the Government's action to legislate tonight, I am concerned that it is too timid and it is not taking up the opportunities for a major stride in micro-economic reform where it could. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), will say that in eight months time it will all be in place-but we have to add that eight months until people will know what it is all about, and add another twelve months for them to gear up and take advantage of it. We are looking at huge delays in these systems. Huge capital investment is involved, so the Government should not hamper that process by being too ponderous in its decision makservices ing. When one looks at the current system as applies and the regulation of it, one is to look at the basic spectrum and how it is being used. I was particularly pleased to participate in formulating a report for the Parliament prepared by the House of Represpectrum, sentatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure entitled Management of the Radio Frequency Speccommunity trum, which sought to go to the basis of the way in which the radio spectrum is used. During that review the Department of Transport and Communications was asked whether incumbent users had any continuing rights in the spectrum. The Department gave an interesting reply, because it did start to identify the advantages of being part of the current system and being a current provider of services as well as the disadvantages for those introducing change or for those new entrants wishing to provide all sorts of serrecent vices in radio or television. The Department said: In a legal sense under the Radiocommunications Act, that is so because the licence is awarded annual basis. But there is an expectation and which is a realised expectation that the licence would get renewed. Indeed in our arrangements to try to achieve spectrum re-allocation, we negotiate with people under our current system that shift to occur ... sometimes five years of time. . . the expectation is there that tenure continue. So the system itself, as we have it, is one that does not encourage flexibility; it is not one that encourages the development of new techniques or new technologies. In examining whether our current system suitable or not, there are a number of proaches that can be adopted. One can assess whether the current spectrum management practice lacks flexibility and timeliness regard to changing demand for spectrum use. Mismatches may occur in supply and demand, demonstrating the difficulties involved in predicting developments in technologies. It is not a dynamic system, as we have at the moment. The capacity to be technically efficient in the use of the spectrum and also to deliver in the way that is in the best interests of the Australian community is also limited. it The setting of standards imposes costs on new forced and prospective users and may in some instances benefit existing users. There has to be a public merit in this whole process. We have to have police applications of the radio we have to have emergency service, and we have to have things such as community radio. Those uses derive for the a public benefit, a public good. Then on the other end of the use of radio and broadcasting is the area that we are dealing with tonight, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - in case you were concerned-the use for broadcasting and radio and television. Those are the areas of really great commercial value. That is the area where there is great competition to be able to get into the action, because using the airwaves is money. There there has been, until recently, the opportunity for people to find their way to quite lucrative returns. In days, that has not been the case. But I am sure the House will remember the changes of legislation that passed through this place to advantage friends of the Government, the way on an in which those friends abused that friendship, one the way in which the value of their assets rose, and-certainly I remember from this try to side of the House-the way in which those for friendships were later repaid at election time. ahead Therefore, we have another reason why the will Government's intrusion into this area is completely inappropriate. One of the deficiencies of the current system is that, I believe, while changes are meant to play a role in regulating demand in congested areas of the spectrum, there is little is suggestion that this approach really works. apThat is what we are talking about tonight: whether the process the Government is adopting really does work. The Government tries with to pick how much it should charge-and here we come to the licence fees. The Government tries to identify how much it should charge for an economic rent plus a tax on users of highly valuable commercial airwaves, the narrow part of that spectrum that really is highly sought after and that has a commercial use. The Government moves in and makes predictions so that its charge is not really based on a commercial assessment but on what it thinks it should charge. One only has to look at a table of excesses of revenue over outlays to realise that over a period of time, going back to 1983-84, in the broadcasting area the Government returned more and more revenue from the taxing process to itself. Actually, in 1983-84 its revenue was 5.8 times the cost of its outlay. But it has risen in 1989-90 to 9.8 times the cost of its outlay. So here is a taxing process that has been used by the Government over a period of years to return more and more revenue to itself-a taxing purpose which is a tax but is not identified as a tax. I believe in the conclusions of the House of Representatives Committee that the cost recovery component of the annual charges for spectrum access be levied in such a way that the actual costs incurred by the spectrum manager on behalf of individual users identified and recovered from individual users, and, to further assist in developing transport charging structure, that the taxation component contained in charges should be clearly identified. I think that those are able goals. We look forward to the Government taking up some of these proposals so that there is a transparency. If the Government is going to tax people, it should tell them it is taxing them. It is like its wholesale sales taxanother example of where the tax is built into the cost of running Australia, particularly for our exporters and our manufactures, and nobody knows it is there. That is why week, when information on our goods and services tax is released, people will say, 'Well, maybe it's another tax or a different form of tax, but at least we know what it is and at least we know we're being compenthe sated for anything that we purchase-we'll have a reduction in our personal income That is why the Government needs to change the approach that it is adopting in the whole of the broadcast area. Transparency and understanding by the Australian community will build confidence and support for the Government. I do not know why it runs away from it. If the Government can come out and say, 'Well, this is the cost of running the thing; we are going to recover those costs and we are going to place a tax on you as well', that is understandable. But that is not what happens at the moment. Some of this legislation before us tonight is about the collection of fees. On what basis are those fees first assessed? We had the chairman of the Caucus committee saying, 'Well, it's crook out there, so we are going to drop fees a bit'. That is basically what he was saying. There is a Government making an economic assessment of how good things are in radio and television and saying, 'Well, because things are crook, we're going to knock back our licence fees'. I do not think that is altogether a rational approach. Fees are fees for cost recovery and, if there is a tax component, let us identify the tax component. There are a number of ways in which we can look at dealing with the system. We can are . go on with the current arrangement of Ministry fiddling-and there are very expert a people involved. I do not want to discredit them. They are following, in fact, the instructions of the Government. But life is extremely laudcomplicated and rigid in the way in which these things are done. We could fine tune our current system and make it a little bit better. We could introduce a market based system of some sort where, in fact, those people who want to broadcast actually can take up the portion of the spectrum that they want to use by competing against each other. Earlier tonight, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) was in the House. I next remember how he was decried years ago when he suggested in this area of high commercial value that there should be an auctioning process. Dear, oh dear, what a terrible thing! There were headlines; it nearly brought Opposition to tatters. But it is interesting to note that one of the recommendations of tax'. the House of Representatives Committee, chaired by the Australian Labor Partydominated by the Australian Labor Party-has recommended auctions as a system of establishing market value for those areas of high commercial value. So here we have it: within a period of two or three years, the Australian Labor Party, after denigrating a visionary, a far sighted ruan who had said, 'This is the way we should fix up these systems'-a statesmanpicks up his idea. The honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) proposed these things two or three years ago and was bagged from one end of Australia to the other for proposing them. And, two or three years later, as is so often the case, the Government picks up these issues that were raised by the Opposition and says, 'What a jolly good idea. How thoughtful; how intellectually sound; how practical and workable; and how well it can work for the management of the radio spectrum'. So we have the prospect of a complete market approach right across the spectrum, even the prospect of having community radio and police radio and those people being able to sell parts of the spectrum they have currently reserved or currently do not use to their own advantage so that others can use them. They collect the revenue from that process to further improve their own services. Alternatively, we could have a combination of that market approach and an administrative approach, reserving the market system for commercially valuable sectors of the spectrum and using the administrative approach of allocation by the Department to those areas where there is community interest concern and public merit and good. So those are the basic choices that Australia has in front of it. I believe that a greater use of the market system must be adopted. Community groups would gain great value from this approach, so I believe the Government must hasten. It must listen to its backbench and to those people who are desperate to expand the opportunities in this field. Australians for years on a worldwide basis have led in technology. We just need to capitalise on those skills. The Government should not be restraining the dynamic prospects that changes can bring, where opportunities for inventiveness and diversity are encouraged, where those who are poorly equipped and cannot devise efficient systems fail but those who are excellent and popular succeed. What more could we want from our system than that?(nme expired)",164
86,Mr ELLIOTT,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"Parramatta) (10.30 p.m.)At the outset I indicate my support for the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No.2) and the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill. I listened with interest to the contribution from the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), although much of the time he strayed a fair bit from the provisions contained in these Bills. But one of the things that he said-I note that he indicated at the outset that the Opposition would support the measures, as did the honourable member for Bass (Me Smith)-related to the process that we are going through in relation to the more extensive Broadcasting Services Bill. He criticised the fact that that would take some months to be considered. Earlier in the debate the honourable member for Bass commended the Government on the process of this matter and noted that, with this Bill being tabled as it was last week by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Me Beazley) to allow for an extensive period of discussion, that would give an opportunity for the great range of interest groups covered by the whole range of issues in broadcasting policy and operation to have a chance to have an input into that discussion paper before it comes back to be considered by the Government and the Parliament in the new year. I would have thought-I think the honourable member for Bass made this commentthat it offered the scope to produce a better Bill than may have been the case otherwise. That is probably true. The Bill as it stands goes a long way towards the blueprint for broadcast policy in this country in a way that will serve Australia well. But there is certainly scope for the industry and all the great manifestation of players that exist throughout this industry to make a contribution to that debate and thereby ensure that what is finally adopted fits well with both the respective players and the great range of the Australian populace that is obviously concerned to ensure that the measures adopted are those from which they also draw comfOlt and satisfaction. The measures outlined in these Bills really start that first process going and recognise the practical difficulties that particularly regional radio has, and that I guess the radio industry as a whole has, at this point in time. The Government has decided, quite rightly, to act in that area and at the same time to ensure that the measures adopted with the passage of this legislation can be blended into the Broadcast Services Bill when it comes back to the House next year. That is important for a number of reasons. It would be easy to say that it is important only because we want to ensure the viability and stability of the radio industry. That is certainly one of the motivations behind the measures, particularly in relation to the reduction in radio licence fees. But it goes somewhat further than that. To suggest that all the difficulties that the radio industry has in Australia today are due to Government policy is a very unfair interpretation to place on what has actually happened in that industry. Indeed, if one takes account of the experience of radio over the last decade, one could argue very strongly that the auction system, the tendering process that the honourable member for Mitchell alluded to as being appropriate to adopt, is one of the reasons that much of radio is in the predicament that it is in today. Certainly, if one takes the Sydney market as an example, absurd prices were paid for radio stations as part of that manic flavour of the month mentality that existed through the 1980s as people-particularly some notable peoplesought to get into that industry, believing that it would be a great new financial windfall. It was driven not so much by economic considerations as by broader ego considerations and perhaps a whole host of other things that we will not try to enunciate tonight. Nevertheless, the industry has gone through that process and almost all commercial radio faces the predicament of falling revenue because of the economic downturn, but just as significantly because of the debt servicing that people have had to go through. The problems of people exiting the industry because of financial failure and so forth does mean that the Government is right to seek to act in those areas at this time. The honourable member for Mitchell also referred to the radio frequency spectrum, which is certainly an interesting area. There is no doubt that the report that the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure brought forward on that issue opens up a lot of exciting opportunities in that area. It is fair to say that, whilst it is an incredibly complex matter to try to debate or articulate in any logical sort of fashion in a debate in the House, it gives very exciting oPPOltunities for Australia. We know that Australians generally have a great thirst for technology and are willing to take advantage of that. In fact, these Bills recognise that in a number of ways because what we are actually saying is that there is scope for new and more players and the development of niche marketing in radio that perhaps has not been fully appreciated in the past because of the fairly fixed sort of structure that has been operating. These measures tonight represent an important patt of the restructuring that is going on. The Broadcasting Services Bill that we will deal with next year will really go very much further in that process. I have no doubt that the opportunities and the flexibility that the honourable member for Mitchell sought in this area in his contribution tonight are well and truly catered for in the various proposals in the two parcels of legislation that the House will consider over this period. I think the period of discussion and debate is a worthwhile one because one of the things one learns as soon as one starts to look at these areas is that changes in technology are so rapid-and almost beyond belief for someone who does not have any particular understanding of the technology. A period of debate will not be unhelpful. Far from it; it will very much help to get the environment and the setting right so that those who seek to participate in radio, be it in regional areas or broader community interests, will be able to do so. Of course, that raises the other points about what we seek to do with these measures relating to licence fees. Over a period I have had many representations from radio operators who have expressed great concern. As the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) outlined earlier, a lot of people have put to the broadcasting working group the difficulties experienced by people in regional radio because of the limitations and the time delays that have occurred in dealing with those processes. So I will talk about those at some length. Looking at the fee structure first of all, the levels that were set in 1988 reflected the very speculative sort of valuations on PM channels rather than sustainable commercial values. With that experience we are able to say that it is reasonable to have a reassessment of that process now. The current fee structure has also had the failing that it could not be applied to PM allocations other than new independent services and conversions where a new PM service entered the market. Its progressive scale relied on brackets which could produce inequities at the bracket margins and which were naturally subject to inflationary bracket creep. The new access fee arrangement recognises a more efficient way of enabling particularly new players to come into the radio industry. It will be a more equitable means of encouraging that access. Certainly in terms of the competitive environment, as we get more players in the radio industry, it lends itself very much to that sort of approach. The calculation of the PM access fee takes into account the number of commercial radio services operated in a given service area and the relevant average gross earnings for these services. The honourable member for Mitchell felt that those sorts of economic considerations should be left out of it. But I think experience has shown that this type of approach, particularly for radio and particularly in the current climate in the radio industryand particularly because of the new opportunities that exist for people to get into the radio industry-is one to be fully taken advantage of. It is clear when one looks at the media issues generally that the opportunities for people to run radio stations as time goes on will be very considerable indeed, with technology developing as it is. The old times when someone would be more likely to set up a small newspaper or the like, or seek to develop other sorts of media interests, will give way to the technology that radio and optic fibre and other things offer. A number of speakers have referred to the development of cable TV, Even in that area, if one was to take a lO-year spectrum, one would be very brave indeed to assert that any one particular mode of pay television will apply right through that decade. Clearly that will not be the case. The changes which will occur in technology will be immense in that field. In trying to establish a framework, in this particula'r package of Bills we have said that we recognise that particular difficulties face the radio industry, particularly regional radio operators. We have acknowledged that in some cases there is a limited opportunity for people to participate with the public broadcasters who often, as the honourable member for Bass pointed out, have not had their services fully appreciated. This applies particularly to ethnic broadcasters, as I think the honourable member mentioned. That is certainly true. A number of positive and encouraging things have been achieved in that area, and the changes outlined here certainly will facilitate much of that process. As I said, the combination of measures here gives scope to the radio industry to be more commercially viable and vital. It also ensures that the Tribunal has a role. It has had a tendency in these areas to get somewhat bogged down and to become unduly complex. It will be able to streamline its processes in this regard and it will be able to have more effective regard for public interest criteria. The sort of debate that goes on between competition and efficiency is more adequately reflected in the Bills before us. The Tribunal, in taking account of the changes in the law in that area, should be able to ensure that the whole administrative process for the granting of licences is one that it is abie to carry out more efficiently and effectively. As to the delays that the honourable member for Mitchell spoke about earlier, the passage of these Bills will give the Tribunal much more scope to deal with applications for licences more efficiently than in the past. One hopes that the streamlining of that process wiIllead to those participants getting involved more readily. There are other provisions in the Bills relating to the supplementary licence set-up. Certainly the difficulties that the existing law has created in that area have been put to the broadcasting working group. The Bills go some way towards that. There are other recommendations contained in the broadcasting services Bill which will fundamentally influence that process. Again, the combination of those measures will go a long way towards meeting the concerns expressed in that particular field. As I say, I think these Bills are very positive. They will be very important for many regional areas of Australia. They will be particularly beneficial in providing the certainty that the industry has been seeking. It is all very well to say that it is all caused because of this problem or that problem, but what the industry was saying in the lobbying it did in the past was that it had a particular predicament and that it would like to see the Government enunciate its policy clearly in this area. It did not believe that these measures should wait until all the other consequential matters of the broadcasting services Bill were fully developed. I think it was right in seeking that. The Government and the Minister have acted very appropriately in bringing forward these pal1icular Bills. Hopefully they will have the effect of ensuring that the great competitive environment that can and will develop in radio is facilitated by this process. Certainly the commercial viability question, which is important in this exercise, will be dealt with more speedily. The Tribunal's role, which should facilitate efficient consideration of licence requests, will be undertaken more readily as well. For those reasons I think the Bills are a very positive step for our broadcasting policy generally, particularly when one considers them together with the blueprint for the industry outlined in the broadcasting services Bill. The community at large will have great opportunity to debate it. Certainly all the people I have heard discussing this issue are very happy to have the opportunity to have input into the deliberations on the Bill. It will mean that the final product that is developed, as occurred in telecommunications, will be one the whole industry can feel it has had input into. It is fair to say that, if the Minister had come along without a proper process and introduced this Bill and if Parliament was asked to adopt it without proper consideration, the consequential effects would have been most unfortunate for the Parliament and, more importantly, for the people of Australia, because that would not have ensured that the whole range of interest groups which are concerned about broadcasting policy and our media interests generally would have been able to contribute. Many of them have great expertise, as we found not only in the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, but even, in more recent times, in the print media inquiry. We found a lot of people there with a lot of expertise who are certainly prepared to put their views, quite forcefully on occasions. With those few words I am pleased to support the Bills before us, and I trust the Parliament will give them a strong endorsement.",168
87,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"The Bills under cognate debate tonight are the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No.2), the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill and the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill. What attracted my attention to these Bills was a provision to enable new FM commercial and supplementary radio services to become available to regional listeners more quickly under a regional radio program. I hope that such measures have a greater success rate and will be advanced at a far more significant pace than the Government initiated aggregation process. The phrase coined in rural Queensland and, I imagine, in many parts of rural Australia is that it is not aggregation but television aggravation. The Government has boasted, and persistently boasted, that aggregation gives regional viewers the same standard of television servi6e as urban viewers enjoy. In fact, aggregation has left many rural communities far worse off.",171
88,Mr COBB,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,They should just come out to the bush and have a look at it.,172
89,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"As the honourable member for Parkes said, I wish the Government would come out and have a look in the bush sometimes. I recognise that these communities are in a minority. However, I do not believe that as taxpaying residents they have lesser rights. The provision of ABC services is a clear example of the denial of such rights. Some towns are provided with the service with no associated cost, while others must install re-transmission facilities at their own cost. The Barcoo Shire Council in the far west of my electorate provides a good example. While townships south, north, east and west of the shire are provided with ABC broadcasts free of charge, the towns of Stonehenge, Windorah and Jundah, in the Barcoo Shire, are not. The Shire's commercial television service is also paid for by the residents. This situation does nothing to encourage decentralisation. A television service certainly assists in attracting and holding a more contented work force in remote areas of Australia. In 1985 the Barcoo Shire Council spent $61,722 on the provision of an ABC television re-broadcasting system. This money was spent on» service that is taken for granted and pr9v1ded free of charge to the majority of AusJralians. I ask honourable members to consider the ABC's recent advertising slogan, 'The service costs only 8c per day'. The residents of the Barcoo Shire would certainly begrudge one cent more of their income tax going to the provision of ABC services across the country, let alone 8c a day. Their 8c a day goes towards the provision of a service for which they already pay $4,200 in ongoing costs and $6,000 in associated costs every year. In 1988, $38,994 was spent on providing additional equipment for the re-broadcast of commercial television. The Barcoo Shire Council is not an isolated example. I am sure that in the electorate of Kennedy, which borders the electorate of Maranoa, there would be many towns and shires which suffer the same problems, as there would be right across all the large rural electorates. I am sure that the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) would have communities and sh...,es who are funding their own commercial television. Mr Cowan-I have people who cannot get it now.",172
90,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"Absolutely; since aggregation, which many people out there in the west are calling 'aggravation'. The ABC operates on a pay television basis in the towns of Eulo and Wyandra, along with many other small towns in my electorate. Let me tell the House that when the debate on pay television starts in the urban community, we will be able to say that we already have pay television out in rural Australia. I do not think that there will be a great debate in rural Australia as to whether we should or should not have pay television. We already have pay television in rural Australia. I was very fortunate to have the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) visit my electorate earlier this year. I know that he understands the situation out there, because he went to the town of Taroom, where we saw at first hand the costs that are associated with providing television to the Taroom community. Mr Smith-We'll fix that one day.",172
91,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"That is very, very pleasing to hear. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have here a document which outlines the costs of providing television by local councils in the electorate of Maranoa. One can see quite clearly from the document that there are six shires which have spent in capital outlays up to $366,000 in providing this television. They have annual running costs of $45,700 in continuing to provide this service to the residents of their communities. I seek leave to table the document. Leave granted.",172
92,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Me Snowdon) for allowing me to table that document. The cost of providing this service, which towns with a population of more than 1,000 get free, represents thousands and thousands of dollars, as that document will confirm. This ongoing cost is met by local ratepayers. It represents a heavy burden on very small towns. What must also be taken into consideration are the annual operating costs and associated costs of providing an ABC service to residents who are quite clearly disadvantaged by location. There are many examples of services that are offered to cities and suburbs and are either threatened or do not exist in rural areas, such as ABC television, child-care facilities and post office agencies. The lack of these services, coupled with the overall high cost of living, is a deterrent to living in the more remote areas of Australia. This situation reflects poorly the fact that 80 per cent of all of Australia's export income comes from the rural and remote areas of Australia. I refer to the fanns and those many mines which are located in rural and remote Australia. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look at that problem. I hope that he will address that in his summing up tonight. I now turn to aggregation and the provision of commercial television to remote Queensland. I have lodged petitions on behalf of concerned residents of the electorate; I have written to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; I have written to the relevant Minister-all to little avail. Many communities and properties receive poor commercial television reception or, as the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) said earlier, no commercial television, whereas previously the reception was unhindered. In the east of my electorate, the town of Texas, which is set at the foot of a large hill known as the Beacon, since aggregation and the conversion to UHF, as opposed to VHF, has had very poor commercial television reception-if, indeed, people can get it at all. A reasonable reception can be received only by the residents installing a UHF antenna costing anywhere in excess of $500 each. Prior to that they had a small antenna for $50 and were able to receive the VHF signal. People unable to afford this cost, as a of aggregation now receive only the ABCwhich is still on the VHF signal. The situation upriver at Riverton also is considerably worse, with properties unable to get a picture from the high cost antennas because of the rugged terrain. Previously, VHF transmission allowed a reasonable reception. All this has changed under aggregation. Mr Cowan-Does the Government care about this?",172
93,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"Obviously not, because the Government has not addressed it. As I have said, I have written to the relevant Minister and to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal-to little avail. The situation is still as it was months ago. The residents' only option in these areas is a $1,500 individual satellite dish-once again, pay television. Interference has also become a major problem as the signal strengths have changed from VHF and. in some cases, to UHF. Interference is a major problem in the Bauhlnia Shire in the north of my electorate. Aggregation will not be completed in this Shire until December 1992. Until such time, residents will receive the ABC and substandard commercial television reception. The community is appealing for the aggregation process in that area to be speeded up. Residents feel that they are being treated as second-rate citizens. Regardless of aggregation, commercial television is not extended to many parts of my electorate. Many communities must fund their own re-transmission facilities to receive commercial television and, in some cases, to receive any television at all. My initial cost analysis has estimated that the capital outlay of providing television by local councils in my electorate is in excess of $350,000. The annual cost of providing such a service is approaching $46,000. The associated annual costs are in the vicinity of $20,000. I greet the news of hastening the pace of providing PM radio services to regional listeners with due scepticism. I know that the preference of many people within the electorate would be to sort out the aggregationaggravation mess before proceeding with another venture. I appeal to the Government to address the inequity in providing ABC result television services across the country. I further make an appeal that the current difficulties faced by many rural communities as a result, of aggregation be addressed as a matter of urgency. There is one other subject. I would like to touch on before closing, that is the funding cuts that were initiated, out of necessity, earlier this year to the ABC. One of the fears of rural Australians was that the Country Hour may have been subject to funding cuts. The real fear was that perhaps the State segments would be cut as a result of funding cuts. I am happy to say that that did not happen. I am sure it was because of the representations of many honourable members around Australia. The Country Hour is a part of everyday life in rural Australia; it is very important to people living in rural Australia. The ABC Country Hour provides up to the minute market information, which is a vital service. I commend the Government on continuing funding for the ABC Country Hour, because in many remote areas that it services, there are no daily papers sitting on the doorstep every morning. Honourable members would be surprised where they would hear people listening to the Country Hour. If honourable members went down to the shearing sheds some day they would find the shearers listening to it. It is not only the people on the properties who listen to it; it is the whole community; it is part of everyday life; it is part of the Bible for rural Australia. If any cuts are to be made to the ABC, they should not be to the Country Hour, because it provides a vital service to rural Australia. I close by paying a tribute to the staff of the ABC because they provide a vital service on ABC radio, particularly at times of floods when the only communication link is radio service. Many of these ABC broadcasters are up before the majority of Australians are out of bed. They are getting information; they are looking at the weather for the day; and they provide an invaluable service. I tribute tonight to a broadcaster who has given in excess of 25 years service to the ABC Queensland, and that is Adrian Scott, based in Toowoomba. He is a legend in his own time. He deserves recognition, and he recourse, ceived that recognition some two years ago when he received an Australia Day award. It is people like him in the ABC who make life a little more bearable in rural Australia. should all commend the work of the ABC rural broadcasters.",173
94,Mr COBB,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"It is a privilege to follow the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who spoke from the heart about the need for proper television and broadcasting services in country areas. I would like to endorse and support his comments that the Government continue funding the Country Hour, which is listened to by a wide country audience. If cutbacks are to take place, I suggest they might be from some of the radical feminist programs that seem to be run at night on the ABC radio that I hear as I drive from one function to another, or perhaps from television programs such as the Big Gig, which is full of cheap, undergraduate humour. I cannot see much cultural significance to it or appeal to the great mass of Australians. The Country Hour is an essential program. It gives people the wool and wheat prices and the latest prices for horticultureMr Bruce Scott-Daily market prices.",174
95,Mr COBB,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"And daily market prices, as the honourable member for Maranoa says. It provides a great service. That would be the last program I would be thinking of cutting people living in back funding on. The matters I want to speak about tonight relate to what the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) calls a minor amendment in this Bill relating to public radio stations and their ability to run advertisements. I welcome the addition of this amendment in the Bill. I spoke on it initially just over two years ago. I am delighted to see that by that the Minister has taken it up. Essentially, it allows public radio stations, where there is no overlapping commercial radio station broadcasting into the same area, to be able to broadcast sponsorship announcepay ments which promote products and services. Up until now they have been able to run only in sponsorship as, as they call them, which have been able to mention only once the sponsors' name and telephone number. Of it is very hard to get people to kick in money to run these types of 'as' when they cannot have their product described properly over the airwaves. The western area broadWe casting in Bourke in my electorate, which goes out under the call sign of 2WEB, needs this kind of sponsorship so it can generate the income necessary to run the station. I understand that this particular amendment will cover only about five radio stations in Australia. There is one in Victoria, a couple in South Australia, one in Western Australia, as well as the 2WEB radio station at Bourke. There are something like 110 public broadcasting stations now operating right across Australia. Public broadcasting has been in existence since 1972. They are independent, non-profit and non-commercial. Sponsorship for these types of stations usually pays for about 25 per cent of their budget. The rest comes from the Government and some fundraising activities which they may engage in. But with 2WEB at Bourke, something like 50 to 60 per cent of its income, out of a total budget of $400,000 a year, comes from sponsorship. It is vital to them. That particular radio station has 12 people on staff and is a big employer in Bourke. Mr Bruce Scott-Including Dave Kesby.",174
96,Mr COBB,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"Including Dave Kesby, who does a wonderful job broadcasting to the electorate of Maranoa and the electorate of Parkes. This radio station pays out about $220,000 a year in wages. On its staff it has three aboriginal trainees who are sponsored by DEET. That radio station hopes to put at least one or more of them on in a permanent position at the end of their training. The only Government help it gets is through that DEET funding, as well as some Government advertising that is run, for example, with health promotion programs plugging anti-smoking or anti-drinking or if the RTA wants to plug how people should be wearing helmets-that sort of thing. Otherwise the radio station is largely self-supporting. The advertising, as I say, makes up 50 to 60 per cent of its budget. That comes mainly from small business and local community groups. It raises the rest of its money through such things as selling Tshirts, mugs, stickers and selling records. In previous years it has run concerts and outside broadcasts. Last year the station conducted a radiothon which raised over $50,000 to keep it on air. If it cannot raise this money itself, the alternative is to close down, which is unthinkable. Mr Bruce Scott-A tragedy.",175
97,Mr COBB,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"A tragedy indeed, or it would have to call on the Government to kick in with some money to keep it open. That is not something it would want to do, and nor would the Government want to do it, I would imagine. Station 2WEB operates out of a fairly new building which cost $300,000, two thirds of which was raised privately. It has a $75,000, 5 kilowatt transmitter which broadcasts on frequency 585. The area it broadcasts into is at least 60,000 square kilometres, an area the size of Tasmania. When one thinks of it, I guess people in Sydney and Melbourne do not contemplate the size. Mr Bruce Scott-They don't know what's west of the Dividing Range and the Blue Mountains.",175
98,Mr COBB,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"Exactly. The station reaches about 40,000 to 50,000 people, and 80 per cent of that audience listens to 2WEB. When we pick up the main newspapers in Sydney we see that radio stations there are struggling to get 10, 15 or 20 per cent of the audience. But this station has 80 per cent. The reason that happens is that it is the only station that puts on local news. It also broadcasts rural news that is particular to that area. It puts on Aboriginal programs for that area as well as educational community programs. These types of programs unite the people of that area. It gives them a quality of life and, as the honourable member for Maranoa was saying in his speech, it provides a quality of life that it attracts into the area such people as bank managers and teachers. A town in my electorate called Brewarrina has just had its pharmacy close down. The Government bought it out under this ridiculous program, which means that another pharmacy cannot start up for another four years, even though there is a fellow who wants to. That town does not now have a pharmacy. Mr Bruce Scott-It is called free enterprise. Mr - OBBTo attract those people, we have t6 have things like swimming pools, proper television and radio programs, which are necessary for the area. The nearest commercial station that broadcasts to Bourke would be 2DU at Dubbo, some 400 kilometres away-half a day's drive, if one can do the drive without exceeding the speed limit. Apart from Bourke and Brewarrina, which I have already mentioned, 2DU broadcasts into towns such as Byrock, Coolabah, Girilambone, Louth, Tilpa, Enngonia, Barringun, Fords Bridge, Yantabulla, Hungerford, Wanaaring, Weilmoringle, Goodooga, Lightning Ridge and Walgett. The station has a translator ABC station that relays in from Sydney and sometimes from Orange, but it has very little or no local content at all. Subsequently, while it is appreciated, very few people listen to it compared with 2WEB. The only quibble I have with clause 18 is that the sponsorship announcements will be restricted to four minutes each hour. I do not know why the Minister has included that undue restriction in the Bill. I thought that six minutes would have been much more reasonable. I see little purpose in restricting it to four minutes. Obviously, he would not want it to be 10 or 15 minutes because it would end up like another commercial station. I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) that four minutes is unduly restrictive. This amendment will be very welcome in the area. It is with some considerable pleasure that I support the Bill.",175
99,Mr SNOWDON,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"Northern Territory-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (11.13 p.m.)-It gives me great pleasure to close the debate on the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No.2), the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill and the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill. I thank all honourable members for their contributions. It has demonstrated that there is a great depth of knowledge and a great deal of interest on both sides of the chamber on this particular subject. All honourable members should be commended for that interest. It also demonstrates that in an area where there is a great deal of change, we can get agreement on that change. I feel confident that the legislation, which has been the exposure draft of the Broadcasting Services Bill, which a number of honourable members have referred to tonight, will be used wisely by people. I think that there will be a great deal of merit in the consultative mechanisms which have been put in place. I know that a number of changes to broadcasting in this country will be supported throughout the community. I do not want to address any issues in particular. I am pleased that all Opposition members were able to support the legislation. I was going to talk about 2WEB, but I have decided that the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) did such a fine job that there is no need for me to contribute. 'The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) made a number of very fine points about the difficulties which face people living in remote areas. I remind him that I have similar difficulties with areas in my electorate. I am sure he understands the implications of that.",176
100,Mr COWAN,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"I will not keep the House very long. I was surprised tonight because I thought I was the only person in the chamber who represented an electorate where some people could not receive a television signal. After the speeches tonight by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), I appreciate the fact that other parts of Australia are having problems. I raised this matter in the House a week or so ago. However, I would like to emphasise that I have many constituents in the Gloucester district and in the greater Taree City Council area who previously could always receive a signal from Prime and ABC television. Because of aggregation, there has been what is termed an upgrading from VHF to UHF in the Middle Brother Mountain area. We have been told by the ABC and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) that television reception would be available to all of the people of Australia. I was extremely disappointed to find out that, besides my own electorate of Lyne, the electorate of Parkes, Maranoa, Wide Bay Territory.",176
101,Mr COWAN,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"These areas which had previously received a satisfactory television signal no longer do so. I have received many letters about this matter. I have written to the Minister for Transport and Communications. However, his reply certainly does not satisfy the people concerned who are not receiving the reception they used to get, although the equipment has been updated with the intention of improving television viewing. Some people who were able to watch Prime Television are now not able to do so. I am pleased in a way to note that so many people on farms watch and listen to ABC television and radio. Mr Bruce Scott-The Country Hour.",177
102,Mr COWAN,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"That is right. The honourable member for Parkes and the honourable member for Maranoa spoke about this matter this evening. Country people rely upon ABC television. Not only do they watch ABC news but also they also watch the 7.30 Report and a lot of sensible programs involving such things as music. I might say that they do not have to watch any advertisements. The ABC is part of their life. Dr John Taylor, who comes from the Forbesdale area in the Gloucester district and who speaks on behalf of many in the community, has written to me about this matter. Members of old grazier families cannot work out why they are unable to receive a television signal when they are supposed to be living in a modem world. After a technician has been out to have a look at the problem, they are told, 'There is no problem here. We are going to boost it a little at Christmas time and you may happen to receive a picture'. Admittedly, some, but not all, of the area I am talking about is in a fairly mountainous region. People living in the problem areas are told, 'Righto, if you would like to buy a dish at a cost of about $4,000 you will be able to receive an improved service'. Mr Bruce Scott-Pay television.",177
103,Mr COWAN,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"As the honourable member says, that is basically pay television. I take this matter very seriously because country. Country people love to be home and sometimes watch television. With the technological knowledge in telecommunications that is available today, it is time that Australians received a better service. The other day I wrote to Mr David Hill, the Chairman of the ABC. Each year Mr Hill comes to this place and talks to members of the National Party of Australia. He gives us the opportunity to speak to him and question him. He always says to us, 'Look, if any of you have a problem, please contact me'. So I decided to write to him. Only a day or so before I did so, people from Telecom were telling us about the wonderful services that they are providing, the profits that they are making and the way in which they are catering for people right throughout Australia. I told them that some of my constituents were not able to get a reception. They said, 'Look, we are working under the direction of the ABC'. But Telecom is still the organisation with the technical knowledge that must advise the ABC. I do not suppose the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table, will be able to answer the question that I want to ask. But I want to know who is responsible? With the ABC providing the money and Telecom providing the technical knowledge, surely this problem can be worked out. I just wanted to rise to speak tonight because I am very concerned about the situation. I appeal to the Government, the Minister and the ABC: for goodness sake, if a mistake has been made, try to remedy it because many people have a confidence in TV and radio today and in the country areas they are very dependent on it.

104,Mr SNOWDON,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (11.23 p.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. These amendments deal with the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, to which the Senate made five amendments. The first amendment inserts a new part which provides for the merger of wholly owned subsidiaries of Telecom and OTC to be tax neutral in effect. An example of such a merger could be in the case of Telecom International and OTC International. The second amendment includes a new amendment to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 to give the Civil Aviation Authority power to investigate cases of damage to property caused by wake vortices. The amendment will also enable the CAA to make arrangements for compensation for people affected. The third amendment makes a minor change to an offence provision in the Civil Aviation Act. The amendment inserts the words 'knowingly or recklessly' in a provision creating an offence for operating an aircraft without an airworthiness certificate. The amendment is not strictly necessary as the offence was not one of strict liability. However, the Government is prepared to accept this amendment. The fourth amendment omits a part of the Bill which amends the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act. This change has been made following concerns raised that the amendments would remove the opportunity for civil action for defamation against television broadcasters of parliamentary proceedings where the broadcasting amounts to unfair and inaccurate reporting. The fifth amendment inserts a new part in the Bill containing amendments to the Telecommunications Act. That part contains amendments which will reduce the period that the Parliament has to disallow delegated legislation under the Telecommunications Act from 15 sitting days to five for instruments tabled in the period from 14 November to 31 December 1991. This reduction will give the new second telecommunications carrier certainty about the rules that will govern its operation before it purchases Aussat. Other amendments in that part will make it clear that a carrier has a right to have telecommunications services supplied to it by another carrier when it makes a reasonable request for the supply of those services. The new part also contains a minor technical change to the tariffmg requirements in section 194 of the Telecommunications Act. The Government accepts the amendments made by the Senate.",182
105,Mr SMITH,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"The amendments to the Transport and Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill are quite significant. I have some remarks about the amendments, in addition to those made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon). I indicate that, as the amendments have come from the Senate, the coalition supports them. We supported the amendments in the Senate so they will pass through here with the concurrence of the House tonight. There are a couple of matters I want to raise. I refer to the changes to the Australian Overseas and Telecommunications Corporation Act. Those changes relate to the concept of merger and the tax consequences that flow to subsidiaries of the principal bodies that are being merged. The Parliamentary Secretary gave the example of Telecom Australia International and OTC International. It is envisaged that those two bodies will be merged into a new entity. Of course, that remains to be seen. Quite clearly, that is a matter for the new board-that is, the board of the new amalgamated body of Telecom and OTC, which will be the largest company in Australia which is yet to be announced. I understand that a decision on the board is imminent. The merger will be a matter for the board. It is quite possible that Telecom Australia International and OTC International may stay as subsidiaries but the tax consequences, as I read this amendment, are to be neutralised so that in the event that they are merged there is not an ongoing tax liability. That is quite important. As I said, it remains to be seen whether those two entities will be merged. Indeed, one of the underpinning principles that the Government put forward for the benefits of this merger was that the international arms would be able to generate significant income for Australia. One would hope that that is the case. If one has a look at their broken down accounts, apparently that has yet to be realised. In any event, that is a significant amendment. Another significant point is that the Bill also amends the Telecommunications Act and places in the Act a broader test of reasonableness. In the event that the second carrier applies to the principal carrier-that is, Telecom; the second carrier is yet to be announced-for a right to interconnect its facilities to the network of another, that carrier has the right to have telecommunications supplied to it by! another when it makes a reasonable request. This broader test of reasonableness will be arbitrated by Austel-the telecommunications authority. It will oversee the emerging greater competitive telecommunications services that this whole proposal envisages. Where Telecom will not entertain a request, it could stymie the development of the second carrier's network and that would not be reasonable. This additional amendment has been required. As it facilitates the growth for the second carrier and entry into that market, we of course support it. It is quite clear that when we ask Telecom to enter into a competitive arrangement-that is what the legislation does-we have to expect that it will act competitively. We hope it does. Already, Telecom is showing that it is interpreting the Telecommunications Act in a very strict and narrow way. This additional test is put there to facilitate the second carrier accessing that network. In the broad, that is what this amendment is about. There are also amendments as to how Austel will operate. The Bill has regard to several matters which I will not go into and amends tariffmg procedures. An important amendment to the Bill proposes to vary the time period for the scrutiny by the Parliament of the licences that will need to be issued by the Government once it makes the selection of the second carrier. The licence conditions are central to the terms under which the second carrier will be able to compete against Telecom. Under the licensing conditions, there will be industry requirements, interconnection arrangements, environmental procedures and international arrangements. They are absolutely the centrepiece of the requirements that the second carrier will need to fulfil, when it makes its bid, to be able to operate successfully. It is proposed that these licence conditions come to the Parliament under the nonnal Acts Interpretation Act arrangements to see whether or not the Parliament agrees and, if it does not, they can be disallowed. The normal period is 15 days. This proposal collapses that 15 days down to five, and that means that there will still be parliamentary scrutiny but over a much shortened period. That, of course, will impose upon the Government-and I am sure the Government will agree--an obligation to provide the fullest, frankest and most complete briefings to those within the Parliament who seek them. I am sure that there will not be any difficulty with that. This is a major change in telecommunications that has been undertaken. This amendment, as the explanatory memorandum points out, is intended to facilitate as quickly as possible an opportunity for the successful bidder to start the roll-out of its network. The figure of $3 billion-odd over a period has been cited for rolling out a network. It is most important that, once the decision is made about the bidder, the bidder is able to undertake the work that needs to be done immediately. With the proposed sitting patterns, if this matter is not dealt with expeditiously by the Senate these vital items relating to the licences will not be dealt with until next year. As we do not resume until the end of February, that is something that all of us would not want to see. One of the key points that I wanted to raise with the Government was whether or not there was a precedent for varying the disallowance time, because I think that the disallowance provisions of the Parliament are essential for the proper functioning of a democracy. There are occasions when one would want to collapse the time frame, and I have been provided with such an example-I take it by the Attorney-General's Department. That occurred with the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Supply Act back in 1982 when the disallowance period was collapsed down to five days. But I point out that that was envisaged in the case of there being an emergency. We would not want the power to stay off to the inconvenience of the Parliament, and that is why it chose to collapse the time period. I do not think that this situation quite fits the same bill of goods in that it does not relate to emergencies, but it is a matter of fundamentally major importance that the Government take every step available to it to put in place the new competitive arrangements. It is an inferior structure, I might say, but in any event it goes down the right path and that is why the Opposition has agreed to support these amendments. Given that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) is here-I do not know whether he heard me earlier-I might just say that we would expect full and complete briefings on all the licence conditions. Also, of course, the articles of associathe tion of AOTC are to be subject to tabling as well. They are very important decisions. As the Minister knows, throughout this very complicated debate we have tried to facilitate, where we can, the Government's program of reform which is, as I have said, going in the right direction. With those few remarks I indicate that we support these amendmen-.",183
106,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Swan-Minister for Transport and Communications) (11.34 p.m.)Very briefly, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) asked for a number of undertakings on consultation. I am happy to oblige. I also thank him for his attitude. I agree that stance of the Opposition on this legislation and on the time that it is to be introduced has indeed been helpful. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported; report adopted. House adjourned at 11.35 p.m. until Tuesday, 26 November 1991. The following answers to questions were circulated: Planning and Building Approval: Reform (Question No. 803)  Housing and Community Services, upon notice, on 8 May 1991: (1) At what stage is reform of the planning and building approval process. (2) What (a) has been achieved and (b) is scheduled for 1991-92 with respect to reform of the planning and building approval process. (3) What savings are expected to result from the reform.",185
107,Mr HOWE,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Reform of planning and building processes is primarily a State and local government responsibility. However the Commonwealth Government, in keeping with its micro-economic reform agenda, is encouraging broader reforms of the planning and building approval processes. In particular the Local Approvals Review Program (LARP), administered by the Office of Local Government, has encouraged about 30 Councils, with the active support of State Governments, to participate in case studies to review their development and building approval procedures and to develop options for more efficient and effective approval practices. The Australian Building Regulations Co-ordinating Council at the request of the Local Government Ministers' Conference, is developing a Model Building Act for adoption by States and Territories as the basis for consistency in building approval processes. The project has as its major objectives: simplified, more efficient procedures minimising administrative processes to the least necessary to achieve the objectives of building regulations minimum bureaucratic intervention. The project is in its final stages and includes a consultation phase to provide for input from industry and other affected sectors. The regulatory Reform Committee will be reporting to the Special Premier's Conference to be held later this year on its reform efforts. NA (2) (a) As a result of case studies mentioned in (1) a number of Councils are being encouraged to find ways of improving their performance in the management of approval processes. It is hoped that the findings of the case studies, which will form the basis of a model approach to reform, will encourage a greater number of Councils to assess how well they perform, how their practices can be improved, and how they can monitor the continuing effectiveness of their development and building approval procedures. (b) During 1991-92 the model approaches to reform in the approvals process will be further developed in the form of a manual and a marketing strategy will be implemented to promote and encourage wide acceptance of LARP's reforms. In addition the Commonwealth/State Planning Ministers' Conference held on 20 September 1991 agreed that the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments support accelerated reform of local government approval processes, particularly in relation to approval times and decision making. Two other outcomes of the Planning Ministers' Conference were that performance based national higher density residential guidelines, to be completed by June 1992, with this code, or its equivalent, to be introduced Australia-wide by June 1993 the adoption of performance based codes modelled on the Australian Model Code for Residential Development with local government being urged to join in co-operative approaches to achieve this objective before the end of 1992. The Australian Housing Industry Development Council (AHIDC) also supports the need to make faster progress in achieving regulatory reform in the housing sector. One of the key priorities of the AHIDC is to facilitate and evaluate LARP reforms to secure the adoption of LARP proposals by December 1992. (3) In the Report ""Local Government Regulation of Land and Building""-a study commissioned by the Office of Local Government to review the local government regulatory system in Australia-it was estimated that savings in the order of $1 billion per annum could be achieved through the reform of the development and approvals process Australia wide. The potential savings were in the area of reductions in delays ($35Om-$45Om), improving approval processes ($300m-$400m) and rationalisation of development standards ($I00m-$15Om). Trade Union Training Authority (Question No. 1090) Mr Andrews asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 8 October 1991: (1) How many persons participated in programs or courses conducted by the Trade Union Training Authority (TUTA) in (a) 1989-90 and (b) 1990-91.

(4) What sum did participants pay for participating at courses at the Clyde Cameron College in (a) 1989-90 and (b) 1990-91. (5) On how many occasions and in each case for what fee was the Clyde Cameron College hired out in (a) 1989-90 and (b) 1990-91. (6) How many single union courses were conducted by TUTA in (a) 1989-90 and (b) 1990-91. (7) How many award and industry restructuring training courses were conducted by TUTA in (a) 1989-90 and (b) 1990-91.
