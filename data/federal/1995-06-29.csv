1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, Committee Report",11
2,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, I present the committee's report entitled Radio and television broadcastservice ing of parliamentary proceedings, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. The report I have just tabled completes an inquiry by the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings into future arrangements for the radio and television broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings. The context in which the inquiry has been undertaken includes the relatively poor appreciation the Australian community has of Australia's system of government, the significant investment the parliament has made in the production of broadcast quality radio and television signals of the houses and their committees, the current inadequate coverage of proceedings on the electronic media, and the emergence of new technologies which should enable an enhanced coverage of proceedings. With this background in mind, the committee has sought in its report to make recommendations that will give the parliament a better strategic oversight of the future of parliamentary broadcasting and enhance the coverage of proceedings at every opportunity. It is recognised that these strategies may not have an immediate impact. The committee's approach is a long-term one. To achieve a better strategic oversight of broadcasting arrangements, the committee recommends that a new act covering parliamentary broadcasting be drafted and introduced into the parliament. The new act would consolidate arrangements for electronic broadcasting of parliament and increase the role of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings. In addition to its current role, the joint committee would undertake a more strategic role on behalf of the parliament in advising on arrangements for radio and television broadcasting, regularly reviewing arrangements for radio and television broadcasting, and advising on the application of new technologies to the public dissemination of parliamentary proceedings. The committee wishes to see an increase in the radio and television coverage of proceedings. One way to achieve this would be to have a service similar to the C-span type in the United States established in Australia. Such a service would provide dedicated coverage of parliamentary proceedings. The committee will monitor developments in pay television with a view to obtaining channel capacity for the coverage of parliamentary proceedillgs at the earliest opportunity. Other approaches recommended by the committee to increase coverage of parliamentary proceedings include encouraging and funding the development of packages of parliamentary material for airing on radio and television, and investigating the provision of the audio and audiovisual feed of proceedings to not-for-profit broadcasters. On behalf of the committee I thank David Elder, the Serjeant-at-Arms; our dedicated committee secretary, Mr Bob Morris, who provided expert input into the deliberations of the committee; and my fellow committee members. I commend the report to the House. Ordered that the report be printed. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the report. Debate (on motion by Mr Reith) adjourned. NA Message from the Governor General reported informing the House of assent to the following bills: Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1995 Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1995 NEW BUSINESS AFTER 11.00 P.M. NA",11
3,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"I move: That standing order 48A (adjournment and next meeting) and standing order 103 (new business) be suspended for this sitting. I foreshadowed that I would be moving this motion and the reasons for it yesterday when I think the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Reith) questioned me on what we would be doing for the rest of the day. This motion is made necessary by the fact that the Senate will be considering a range of our legislation and will be wishing to pass some of it back to us no doubt in amended form. Whilst I am not necessarily anticipatingparticularly if it becomes apparent later in the day that we will be sitting tomorrow-that we will go very late tonight, there is the possibilihere ty that we might have to. Hence we need to have this particular standing order suspended. I notice the Manager of Opposition Business looking a bit quizzical on that. We need to check with the Senate constantly to see whether or not it is necessary to have a sitting tomorrow. If it becomes patently obvious that that is the case, then I think it is probably smart to adjourn the House earlier than we might have anticipated tonight rather than try to follow the Senate down to 11 o'clockwhich is when it anticipates completing its sitting time tonight. But we need the flexibility anyway. That is why I move the motion.",12
4,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"I might just briefly refer to the matters raised by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). The opposition does not in any way stand in the way of the continuation of the parliament into tomorrow to complete the business before the House of Representatives and to ensure the completion of a number of matters which are currently with the Senate. The only matter which I wish to refer to is this: as we will be here tomorrow, in my view we ought to take the opportunity for a question time. In respect of the second motion which is about to be Mr Beazley interjecting",12
5,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,You are going to adjourn the second motion? Mr Beazley interjecting,12
6,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"I thank the Leader of the House for those remarks. I restate our position, which is that question time ought to be available tomorrow if the House does in fact sit. The Leader of the House rests his argument on the claim that there are no precedents for an extended sitting to also include a question time. I have had some research done on that, and that is not in fact the case.",12
7,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,Surprise.,12
8,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"Surprise, surprise. The data on this matter only goes back to 1988. I am told it is difficult to obtain earlier information without a lot of research. I have not sought that further research because, whatever the precedent is, it seems to me that we are quite capable of making a decision on the merits and now as suits these particular circumstances. For the sake of completeness, in 1993 there were five extended sitting days-13, 14, 17, 18 and 21 December. On the last three there was no question time but, on the first two--13 and 14 December-there was a question time provided. Mr Beazley interjecting",12
9,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"You have slipped up. I am sure that in the early 1980s we had, as a general rule, a question time on the extra sitting day when that was forced on us by dint of circumstances to complete business, but I do not rest on my own memory. I am not of a mind to seek further research at great public expense when we have one precedent. That is enough for me. I say that we ought to have that question time tomorrow. There is a particular reason for having question time tomorrow. The current account deficit is usually released via the ABS on a Thursday which does give the parliament the opportunity, when it is sitting, to debate its implications for the Australian economy. I do not know why the figure is coming out tomorrow, on Friday, but as we are here and given the expectation that the imports figure will be much higher than had been expected-and that is one component of tomorrow's figures-it seems very odd to me that, on the day an economic indicator of great significance to the country is released, we cannot have some questions put to the government. Australia's current account deficit now is worse than Mexico's. It really is reaching crisis proportions. The Australian public, who basically pay for it through higher interest rates on their mortgages, are entitled to know what the government's reaction is. The Labor government has been in office for 12 years. At the next election it will be seeking a mandate from the Australian people to be in office for 19 out of 26 years. That is the request it will be putting to the Australian people. They are entitled to ask, 'What have you done? What results have we had in the 16 years you have been in office?' When Australia's current account deficit is the highest in the OECD, as predicted by the independent OECD, I think some questions on that subJect ought to be answered by the government. It would be nothing but political cowardice for you not to give us question time tomorrow. Now that your sole argument, which is that there is no precedent for question time, has been swept from beneath your feet, I will be very interested to see what your imagination brings forth as the reason why we are not going to have question time tomorrow. Question resolved in the affirmative.

10,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Air traffic control facilities Darwin International Airport The existing air traffic control facilities are operationally deficient and were programmed for replacement in the 1994-95 defence medium new works program. During design the project cost estimate has been revised and the project will exceed the medium new works threshold. As a result the project requires parliamentary approval. An audit of the air traffic control services at RAAF base Darwin identified that the replacement of radar and communication equipment is crucial to safe air traffic operations at Darwin. The report also concluded that the timing of the construction of the new ATC facilities should be advanced as far as possible to ensure no disruption to the air traffic services whilst allowing the proper introduction of the radar and communications equipment. The new equipment will provide the required international standard of air safety at Darwin airport and should not be delayed. To avoid installation delays it is necessary to complete the ATC facilities by the end of 1996. If parliamentary approval is obtained, construction can commence in late 1995 for completion in 1996. In addition, the project will be reprogrammed with a cost cap of $8.4 million. I thank the committee for its support, and I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",14
11,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Housing development at HMAS Coonawarra, Darwin. The proposal involves the construction of 30 family dwellings at HMAS Coonawarra, Northern Territory, to reduce the serious housing shortfall in the Darwin area. The site for the proposed housing is adjacent to existfor ing family units which have been completed over the past two years. Upon completion the new houses will be allocated to families of army non-commissioned and junior officers. Included in the project are supporting community facilities. The Public Works Committee tabled its report on 20 June 1995, recommending the project and an estimated cost of $6.8 million. In its report the committee also raised some issues to which the DHA provided the following responses: the matter of air conditioning allowance for defence personnel is a condition of service issue and the authority will relay the committee's views to the appropriate area within Defence; the authority shares the committee's concern regarding the need to protect subcontractors and suppliers and will ensure that its processes conform with the best practices within the industry; and the requirement to make certification mandatory will be examined in the context of industry practices and the impact of any such measures on competitiveness for authority business and price. It should be noted that in the authority'S life there has been no serious incident involving non-payment to subcontractors and suppliers. If approved, the first stage of the project will commence in July 1995. I thank the committee for its report and commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",14
12,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee of, Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Joint venture development with Delfin Property Group of The Willows for defence housing, Townsville. This proposal involves the construction of adequate housing for service families posted to Townsville. DHA, on behalf of the joint venture, successfully negotiated the acquisition of 107 hectares of land at Kirwan, known as the Willows. The DHA acquired the land subject to the approval of the Public Works Committee and the minister. It is intended that the DHA acquire approximately 25 per cent of the lots from the joint venture at a reasonable discount and thereon provide new housing for service families which has been specifically designed for the local climate. The Public Works Committee tabled its report on 27 June 1995 recommending the project. The total development costs for joint venture is estimated to million, comprising development costs of $21.3 million and land acquisition and house construction costs of $38.517 million. In its report the committee also raised a number of issues to which the DHA provided the following responses. The Defence Housing Authority notes the committee's recommendations on the size of the housing blocks and will take this into consideration in its planning. To a large extent, the size of the blocks will mined by public demand. However, the authority will not build houses for service families on blocks under 550 square metres unless this is agreed with the services. The Defence Housing Authority has noted the recommendation to retain ownership of any plans commissioned from local architects and engage tropical design experts from James Cook University to review any designs before they are accepted. The authority will examine cost benefits of obtaining all plans commissioned from local architects. It should be noted that the ority is already consulting with tropical design experts from the James Cook University in the development of its portfolio. The Defence Housing Authority, together with the joint venturer, is acutely aware of the committee's position on solar hot-water systems and is reviewing the use of these systems in the houses. The Defence Housing Authority commits to undertaking a comprehensive resource inventory including vegetation, soils, sites of cultural sites before any site works commence on the western side of the drain. Measures designed to protect endangered or rare species and any cultural sites found on the site will be implemented. The Defence Housing Authority agrees to formally brief the committee on the types and cost of houses it intends to construct at the Willows and on the sizes of blocks to be used for defence housing. If approved the project will commence in August 1995. I would like to thank the comthe mittee for its report and I commend the be $59.817 motion to the house. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",14
13,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Golf Course be deterEstate development, Palmerston, NT. The continuing increase of service personnel and their families associated with the Army Presence in the North requires provision of additional housing units in the Darwin area to accommodate defence personnel and their families. The demand for good quality family housing for the projected increase in army personnel over the next few years cannot be satisfied by the local market. In order to eliminate the significant housing shortfall, the authority is proposing to develop two sites, Palmerston Golf Course Estate and autha neighbouring site known as the Gunn Land. The Public Works Committee tabled its report on 26 June 1995 recommending the project at an estimated cost of $144.02 million. In its report the committee raised a number of issues to which the Defence Housing Authority provided the following responses: The Defence Housing Authority commits to formally briefing the committee on types and costs of houses it intends to construct on the Golf Course Estate and on the size of the blocks acquired for Defence housing. The Defence Housing Authority has noted the recommendation to include in its contract documents a clause stating that subcontractors must be paid before progress payments are made to contractors. The authority advises that it will need to assess this recommendation against industry practice and the impact of such a requirement on the authority'S operations and its legal obligations. The Defence Housing Authority has noted the recommendation to ensure that its sites have been examined and cleared of any possibility of contamination prior to referral of projects to the committee. The responsibility for determining any possible contamination and the costs of remediating the site have been accepted by the Northern Territory Government. If approved the first stage of the project will commence in August 1995. I would like to thank the committee for its report and I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",15
14,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"--:-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Refurbishment of Australian Embassy, Washington. The proposal to be referred to the committee comprises: the implication of a staged program of internal refurbishment providing tenancy conditions which meet the requirements of occupational health and safety, the replacement of outdated and obsolete equipment and the provision of office accommodation which meets current data and communications needs. Physical security protection will also be improved. The original building which houses the Australian Embassy in Washington was constructed in 1969 with an extension added in 1976. It is now in need of substantial refurbishment. Subject to the normal Public Works Committee process, the government has approved expenditure of $16 million over a two-year period to undertake a comprehensive program of internal refurbishment. The building is well located but now has many internal deficiencies. It lacks suitable fire protection and egress, major building services have reached the end of their design life and require replacement and office layouts are inefficient. There is a need therefore for a complete refurbishment of the building to ensure the protection of the Commonwealth's investment and to provide a standard of accommodation appropriate to the function of one of Australia's most significant embassies. The embassy in Washington services some 19 government departments and organisations, including diplomatic, defense, immigration and trade. It is also the hub of the communications network for Australia's diplomatic missions in North and South America. Economic evaluations have been carried out on all practical options and the most cost effective solution for Australia's representative accommodation in Washington is the retention and upgrading of the current premises. In addition, the importance of Australia's bilateral relationship with the United States is of the better reflected in a major refurbishment rather than selling the premises and moving from a prominent location. The total cost of the proposed refurbishment is estimated at $16 million on November 1994 prices. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",16
15,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of 45 apartments Embassy staff, Jakarta. Exceptionally high rents and unavailability of suitable accommodation to meet the increased Australian based staffing allocation at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta has resulted in the need to increase the owned estate. Investigations undertaken by the Overseas Property Group have shown that it is more economical to purchase land and build rather than to continue to endure escalating rents for Abased offices. Free standing leased accommodation to the Australian. standards is difficult to locate and expensive when found. Rents are increasing at the rate of approximately seven per cent annually. The proposal to be referred to the committee comprises construction of a 16storey apartment complex incorporating 45 apartments, underground car parking and recreational facilities plus a swimming pool and a children's playground. Total cost of the proposed development is estimated at $25.73 million at June 1995 prices. The project will be refinanced off budget under a deferred payment arrangement. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",16
16,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of 10 apartments Consulate-General staff, Shanghai. Leased residential accommodation at Shanghai suitable for expatriates is at a premium with lengthy waiting lists, no room to negotiate rents and a steep escalation clause of 10 per cent included in all leases. Landlords have taken advantage of the favourable position they find themselves in by increasing rents significantly on each lease renewal. Renewals in 1994 saw rents more than double on twoyear leases. On this basis of short supply and rapidly rising costs, the Overseas Property Group for undertook a review of its property strategy in Shanghai, including options for ownership. Early evaluations indicated a simple payback period for a development option in the designated consular district was less than six years. The proposal to be referred to the committee comprises construction of a five-storey building of 10 apartments, plus underground car park and associated recreational facilities including a swimming pool and a tennis court. Total cost of the proposed development is estimated at $10.529 million at May 1995 prices. The project will be refinanced off budget under a deferred payment arrangement. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",17
17,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of 20 apartments for Australian High Commission staff, Kuala Lumpur. Kuala Lumpur is fast becoming another Asian city where most expatriates can no longer afford to live in free standing houses as opposed to apartment townhouses. Existing owned accommodation is either beginning to age or has proved unsatisfactory for the postproperty requirements. The sustained demand for properties in Kuala Lumpur has made the cost of leasing residential accommodation expensive. Rents for are increasing at the rate of eight per cent annually. A free property market operates in Malaysia. There is a wide variety of condominium and free standing residential accommodation available for renting or purchasing. However, the standard of buildings generally is not good, resulting in rapid deterioration accelerated by the tropical environment. The average life span is considered to be 10 years. The proposal to be referred to the committee comprises the construction of a three storey complex of 10 apartments, including one for the deputy head of the mission, and the construction of another 10 unit development on a site to be identified. Recreational facilities, including a swimming pool, will be defined as part of each complex. The total cost of the proposed development is estimated at $11.345 million at May 1995 prices. The project will be financed off budget under a deferred payment arrangement. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Reference",17
18,Mr WALKER,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of new chancery, Geneva. The proposal to be referred to the committee comprises the construction of office accommodation capable of meeting the foreseeable operational needs to replace the present inadequate office of the Australian Mission in Geneva, which includes representation for the UN, GATT, World Trade Organisation, disarmament and environment in addition to the normal consular functions. Following a Swiss court decision in 1990, the Australian permanent mission has to vacate its current leased premises by March 1999. The total cost of the proposed construction project is estimated at $22.446 million based on December 1994 prices. The project will be financed off budget under a deferred payment arrangement. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Accounts Committee",18
19,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts I present the following report-Report 337-Review of Medicare Auditor-General's Report, 1992-93. Ordered that the report be printed.",18
20,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-It gives me Primary pleasure today to table on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts the results ·of the committee's review of 1992-93 audit reports, titled Report 337: a focus on accountability. Report 337 reviews 37 reports of the Auditor-General which were tabled in the financial year 1992-93, and is prepared in accordance with section 8(1)(ab) of the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 requiring the committee to examine all reports of the Auditor-General. . In reviewing these reports, the committee has not canvassed in detail all of the issues raised by the Auditor-General, but instead has focused on the key recommendations in his reports. The committee's review has shown that, in the vast majority of cases, agencies the have responded positively and promptly to the Auditor-General's recommendations. In some cases, however, it is clear that agencies have disagreed with the recommendations or have not taken appropriate or effective remedial action. It is these cases which are commented upon in report 337. The report is in four parts. The first part explains the scope and nature of the committee's review. The second part considers, on a portfolio by portfolio basis, each of the audit reports tabled in 1992-93. The third part considers the various cross-portfolio audit reports presented in 1992-93. The final part gives detailed consideration to a number of the issues raised in Audit Report No. 22 199293, Department of Defence, New Submarine Project. Report 337 contains 15 recommendations for further action by the government. The committee's recommendations address various matters including the need for the Department of Employment, Education and Training to take further steps to reduce the levels of debt associated with the Austudy program, which amounted to $60.3 million in early 1993-94; Report the need for the Health Insurance Commission to continue to develop and implement strategies aimed at identifying and discouraging fraud and overservicing, which have the potential to be a significant drain on Commonwealth resources; and, the need for the Joint Coal Board and the Department of Industries and Energy to clarify the method of valuing the coal board's future liability for workers compensation insurance, which is in the order of $225 million. In reviewing the audit report on the new subinarine project, the committee has taken a forward looking approach. We have not reviewed in detail the nature of the contract for the construction of the submarines, nor have we commented on the rather colourful debates that took place around the time the audit report was tabled. Instead, we have focused on some of the risks facing the project and have considered whether steps can be taken to improve the management of these risks for the remainder of the submarine project and for future defence projects. In taking this approach the committee acknowledges that the Department of Defence has managed many of the risks successfully. For example, evidence to date indicates that the project office has taken responsible steps to ensure that submarine construction and perforinance standards will be satisfied. Arguably, these are among the most significant of the risks facing the project. However, there are areas where project management improvements can be made. Some of the audit findings in relation to financial and scheduling risks, for example, warrant close attention by the department. The committee has made what I believe are a series of constructive recommendations which, if implemented, will help ensure that the submarine project and future defence projects of similar size are managed in an effective and most cost-efficient manner. Report 337 is confirmation that the Public Accounts Committee is committed to ensuring that the reports of the Auditor-General receive close parliamentary attention. By reviewing each audit report that is tabled, the parliament signals to government agencies that the process of accountability and scrutiny is continuous and proceeds beyond the tabling of an audit report. In concluding, and on behalf of the committee, I express our thanks to those people who have contributed to the review by preparing submissions and giving evidence at public hearings. I also take this opportunity to thank the staff of the secretariat for assisting the committee in preparing the report, in particular Laura Gillies, John Carter and Grant Harrison. I commend the report to the House.",18
21,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I join with the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), to comment on report 337 entitled A focus on accountability. I am sure honourable members have noted that the committee's reports now have titles. Perhaps in the near future, or possibly in the 38th parliament, the reports will be done in a more interesting colour scheme than the black and red used now. It has been a very interesting exercise to review over recent times the Auditor General's reports. The Auditor-General plays a very important role in watching the expenditure of public funds throughout the Commonwealth of Australia. Some of the reports that come through are fairly standard, basic reports that border on mundane, but others are sizeable and have an enormous impact on the outlays of the Commonwealth. One such report was the Auditor-General's report on the submarine project being conducted by the Australian Submarine Corporation. The Auditor-General was not able to dig into the contractual arrangements and see how the contractor was conducting the contract, but he was certainly able to look into how the Department of Defence negotiated the contract and how it was executed. Some concerns about this project were raised in the audit report. Concerns were also raised when the committee took evidence on the subject and visited the ASC plant in Adelaide. At the outset, the construction and purchase of six new submarines for the Royal Australian Navy represent a significant investment by the government in Australia's defence capability. The project will cost the Commonwealth nearly $5 billion. I think that figure may be closer to $6 billion. The government hopes to acquire six state of-the-art submarines. Its other goals are to achieve the capability in Australian industry to support them for 30 years, to achieve a major transfer of technology to Australian industry, to have local involvement in design construction; to have a major saving in expenditure overseas and to have significant export potential as the only useful sub-arine builder in the region. They were admIrable goals that the government set out when it embarked on this project. That is why the risk contract that was drafted was unique in comparison to other commercial contracts. That was not only due to its size but also to the in-built possibility of future benefit for reads: the Commonwealth. The jury is still out on that. We will have to wait until the project is completed and see done, what benefit an Australian company or a later partly Australian company gets from what has been developed so far. My personal belief is Committee. that not only the Australian National Audit Office but also this parliament, through the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, should maintain a watching brief on the project as progresses towards completion. One of the important recommendations with regard to the ASC in this report is recommendation No.7, which reads: In future projects of comparable size and nature, the Department of Defence should ensure contracts contain provisions which: (a) limit or prohibit the repatriation of dividends until the major project risks have been overcome; (b) require careful assessments to be made of the quantum and timing of advance payments; and (c) allow the Commonwealth to recover advance payments which have not been used in accordCorporation. ance with the contract. Due to the nature of the contract and the way payments have been made in sync with .the completion of parts of the contract, there view that at times the Commonwealth exposed to unnecessary risk with regard to the completion of the contract and the like. is why that particular recommendation made. I believe the Australian Submarine Corporawhich tion was paid too much of the contract price too soon. Some 86 per cent of the contract price had been paid by 31 December 1994. As all members would be aware, to date we have one submarine that is doing sea trials, yet 86 per cent of the contract price has already been paid out. The shareholders in ASC have received some fairly healthy dividends. ASC has invested money in a 747, which is on lease:to Qantas. On that basis, I believe the Commonwealth is bearing too much of the financial associated with this project. There is a bit too much exposure. On that basis, in· this report we have suggested that the ANAO due should maintain a watching brief. Page 167 Given the magnitude of the new submarine project, and the fact that much work remains to be it would be appropriate for the Australian National Audit Office to revisit the project at a date. It is likely that any follow-up audit conducted by ANAO would be of interest to the I am sure it will. If I and the member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who is also taking a keen interest in this particular project, are members it of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts at the time, we would be keen to revisit this project to see how it goes. In the lifetime of this committee of the parliament we may not see another contract like this. We should draw on the experience of what has happened-the that way this project has been overseen and developed and the conduct of the contract. In our public hearings, we were waiting to take evidence from Dr Don Williams, who was the chief executive officer of ASC. We found out a day later that he did not turn up because he had left the Australian Submarine Many questions surrounding that surprise resignation of the ASC's chief executive were left unanswered. It raises the question: did he have concerns about the way the contract was being managed? It would be Is.a interesting to know what those concerns may IS have been. Was the ASC becoming too competitive in the Asia-Pacific region for its That parent company, Kockums, in Sweden? Did was Dr Williams fall or was he pushed? There are some very important questions are partly addressed in report 337. As the chairman of the committee, the member for Oxley, just said, the new submarine project makes up only a quarter of this particular report, but it is a very important element because it contains nearly $6 billion worth of expenditure by the Commonwealth. As I said, the Australian National Audit Office must continue a watching brief on that project. I believe the Joint Committee of Public Accounts should also maintain a watching brief on that project until its completion. With those short remarks, I commend the report to the House. It has taken a lot of work, particularly by the staff at the secretariPublic at. I thank them for their support and their consideration in dealing with the members of the committee from time to time as well. I commend the report to the House.",19
22,Mr HAVILAND,COMMITTEES,"-by leave-I am very pleased to speak to this report No. 337 of the Public Accounts Committee entitled A focus on accountability. The title sums up the role of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and also the role of the Auditor General's office. It is clearly of the Public Accounts Committee to examine Auditor-General's reports. The Auditor General's office plays a very important role in our democracy and our public sector but there is not much use having an Auditor General writing lots of fancy reports unless the recommendations are implemented, unless someone takes notice of them. I see the role of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in the parliament being very important in ensuring that federal agencies and, indeed, governments take notice of recommendations made in Auditor-General's reports and in ensuring that they are implemented as far as possible or certainly considered to ensure that improvements to our administration in whatever agency are made as a result of Auditor-General's reports, which cost a lot of money to produce. The PAC has a very important role in that area. The particular report that I am interested is the Auditor-General's report No. 17 of 1992-93, entitled Medifraud and excessive servicing-Health Insurance Commission. I recall that report was tabled in this House in December 1992. I remember hearing about it on the radio when we were in the middle of the last election campaign. It certainly reminded me of my previous involvement in that issue, which I have spoken about many times in this House. My introduction to the activities of the Public Accounts Committee was back in 1982, 1983 and 1984 when the PAC was conducting an inquiry into medical fraud and overservicing. That is why I was quite distressed initially to hear some of the comments in this Auditor-General's report. The report refers to the fact that in the mid-80s the Accounts Committee issued a number of reports dealing with fraud and overservicing by medical practitioners and they revealed a number of problems which affected the Commonwealth health budget. The report states: At that time, the extent of fraud and overservicing was estimated by the then Department of Health to be ' ... at least 7% of the total medical benefits expenditure by the Commonwealth and health funds'. This figure 7% represented $100m in the 1981182 financial year ... a legitimate role Further on it says: The pressures on the Medibudget are just as great, if not greater today with the advent of new medical procedures and the growth of entrepreneurial medicine. Today, the same estimate of fraud and overservicing could well still be appropriate. There is no evidence to believe it has changed for the better. That was in 1992. Of even more concern to me and also to the committee, I believe, is that the report said: Since the JCPA hearings on fraud and overservicing in the early to middle 1980s, with the exception of the last 12 months or so, there has been little if any improvement in combating fraud and overservicing. Clearly this is a serious issue. If you base that seven per cent figure on annual Medicare benefit schedule expenditure figures in the 1990s, you are looking at something between $300 million and $400 million a year in in potential abuse. The report says, and I actually have no reason to doubt what the report says, that there is no evidence that that has improved. Since the Public Accounts Committee took some interest in this report, we did have the Health Insurance Commission at a public hearing at which we asked a lot of questions. The results of those questions appear in this report. I will read recommendations Nos 2 and 3 of this report No. 337. Recommendation No. 2 says: The Health Insurance Commission should continue to develop and implement strategies aimed at identifying and discouraging Medicare fraud and overservicing. Recommendation No. 3 says: The Australian National Audit Office should monitor the performance of the Health Insurance Commission in its efforts to combat Medicare fraud and overservicing. They are fairly obvious recommendations to make, but they are fairly important ones. The year of 1985 came after a fairly difficult period-the introduction of Medicare and a fairly turbulent period in relationships between the Commonwealth government and the AMA. The AMA, of course, changed its position a bit after Medicare came in and after a change of government. It changed its attitude towards the issues of fraud and overservicing and other issues to do with Medicare. It was an interesting period. We had a doctors dispute in New South Wales and major problems to overcome. One of the ways in which the government sought to overcome them was to transfer the responsibility for combating fraud and overservicing from the health department to the Health Insurance Commission. The Health Insurance Commission was given a specific mandate in 1985 to carry that out. That is why it was of particular concern that in 1992 an Auditor-General's report should say the things I quoted beforebasically, that there has been no improvement. In fairness to the Health Insurance Commission, I think it is fair to say that the legislation it has had to work with-the legislation the department of health previously had to work with-going back 20 years, was not really strong enough to enable federal agencies to effectively police or combat the abuses of the Medicare schedule or the payment of Medicare benefits. That is why I am quite pleased that the government has passed at least two relevant pieces of legislation in this term of parliament-the Professional Services Review Act 1993 and the Powers of Investigation Act 1994. There have been subsequent amendments to those acts. I am confident that both of those pieces of legislation are the best attempts yet in terms of legislation to overcome this problem, which is a major drain on the federal budget. I have always supported Medicare. It is the finest health insurance system we have ever had in Australia and it is one of the best in the world. But, of course, it does cost money. Any responsible government, or any politically sensible government, will do whatever it can to ensure that those costs are reduced while not impeding the access and equity to medical services for all Australians. To do that, we have to ensure that the best possible attempt is made to stop abuses by professionals, by medical practitioners or specialists, of the Medicare system. I believe that now, as a result of reports like the Public Accounts Committee report in the 1980s-a lot of those recommendations have taken a long time to implement-and the Auditor-General's report, and as a result of legislation introduced by this government in this term, we might finally be on the way to some real solutions and some real procedures put in place to overcome or to reduce the incidence of abuse of Medicare. I commend the report to the House. The Auditor-General' s report was, of course, just one of the reports the PAC report deals with. The PAC has a very important role. I will be keeping a close watch on the performance of the H-alth Insurance Commission in relation to this particular issue and on its progress for the rest of my time here and subsequent to that as well. I commend the report to the House.",21

JOBS ON AUSTRALIA'S HOLIDAY NA Debate resumed from 28 June, on motion by Mr Vaile: That this House: (1) recognises the work of the Mid-Coast Area Consultative Committee in establishing a comprehensive plan to develop 1000 new jobs on Australia's Holiday Coast; and (2) recognises the jobs program, the biggest in any region in Australia, is a part of the New Work Opportunities Program and has the full support of the business and community organisations throughout the region.",22
24,Mr SAWFORD,COAST,"When I was interrupted last night because of the adjournment debate, I was remarking that the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) in his motion before the House had acknowledged that the new work opportunities program is a key element in ensuring that 1995 the job compact can be delivered to all eligible job seekers, particularly if they live in areas where employment opportunities are limited. As the government's Working Nation paper points out, there is no doubt that the new work opportunities program will also be the most appropriate employment option to meet the needs of some job seekers. A crucial part of. the job compact is the facility for the new work opportunities proprogress gram to accommodate the concerns, needs and initiatives of local communities. It is important that the program be regionally organised and managed. This provides an opportunity for local communities to assist unemployed and for unemployed people to very contribute to their communities, as well as business and community organisations. There is certainly scope for innovation and since 1983. flexibility in project design. New work opportunities proposals have also been developed at the national level. These proposals will include jobs to reverse environmental degrathe dation along the lines proposed by Greening Australia, jobs in human services such as personal care of the aged and work based assistance to people with a disability, and as literacy education officers in primary schools. On this latter matter, I had the privilege several weeks ago to launch the first proposal for literacy education officers in South tralia at the South Australian Institute Teachers. Trainees for literacy education officers, who were previously unemployed nearly persons, have been allocated to primary schools, several of which are in my electorate of Port Adelaide. It is important that these literacy officers recognised. One of the great problems with unemployment is the lack of literacy and numeracy skills among some job seekers. Obviously, a child who lacks literacy numeracy skills grows up to be an adult. Those problems first arise in primary schools. Hopefully, literacy education officers can some part in addressing those issues for children who have those problems. New work opportunities projects also include specific provision for people with a disability and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander particularly in rural and very remote communities. In the few minutes remaining, I will briefly refer to the Accord as it relates to the labour market. As both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson, have pointed out, the Acmotion cord is much more than a labour market instrument; it is also an agent for industrial and a vital element of trade policy. The partners of the Accord are committed to very both growth and employment as the prime objective of economic policy. The Accord has always been about wage constraint for emthe ployment and its success is reflected in two telling statistics: two million jobs and a 40 per cent increase in household disposable income-20 per cent in per capita termsOne of the Accord's visions identifies the essential role of training to underwrite long term competitiveness in addition to improving life chances of the disadvantaged. But it importantly recognises that skill formation encourages the adoption and the adaptation of new processes and equipment, and is a princijobs pal agent of technical change, which is, in tum, a principal agent of productivity on which the nation's prosperity depends. The partners in the Accord believe unemployment represents our greatest social challenge and it Ausis a matter of great satisfaction that the of partners in the Accord have met each unemployment goal-and in this period met it a year early with the addition so far of specific more than 600,000 jobs. In conclusion, I again congratulate the member for Lyne, supported by the member be for Cowper (Mr Nehl), for bringing on this debate. It is a bit of a pity that, during their contributions, they both resorted to making negative comments like so many of their and colleagues when it comes to employment, education and training matters. Nevertheless, I wish his Mid-Coast Area Consultative play Committee every success in its 1,000 jobs campaign. Like our campaign in Port Adelaide, I am sure that-with goodwill, with business and with community organisations, for along with the members involved-they will peoples, achieve their laudable goals. By the actions of the member for Lyne and of the member for Cowper prior to framing that motion, both members acknowledge that the initiatives of the government's Working Nation programs are working. There is no doubt about that: you could not frame that unless you believed that. Importantly, Working Nation is growing in momentum not only in Australia's cities but also in important areas in regional Australia. It is, of course, great pity that the bulk of the opposition bench does not share this important national interest issue as do all government members and, I suspect, the member for Lyne and the member for Cowper.",23
25,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,COAST,"I rise to speak on this motion and, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), has said, congratulate both the member for Lyne Vaile) and the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) for bringing this matter to the attention of House. I congratulate the government for allowing this motion to be brought forward that we can debate what is a very important aspect of community life out there at the moment, and that is the employment and ment. education of our youth and of our work force. It used to be that once you had received your education you got employment. Today, there seems to be a great muddle. I think this reflects a lot on the education, the standards and the manner in which education is underon taken in Australia today. The two members have been able to secure the funds. Recognispeople ing that they are members of the opposition, I believe this demonstrates that they are prepared to give programs initiated by the government a chance. It is a lie to suggest that everything government does is automatically opposed on this side of the House. I would just bring the attention of the House the Australia people Remembers program where I would say we a would have enthusiastic members on both sides of the House being involved in a manfuture. nerMr Sawford-Unanimous.",25
26,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,COAST,Yes-in which we can address a national moment like this with the dignity it deserves.,25
27,Mr COBB,COAST,As acknowledged by the minitraining ster.,25
28,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,COAST,"Yes, that is right. on-the-job But we are now addressing another problem, and that is employment and education. First of all, we have to realise that this does thing for the local area. I have no doubt even though they have suggested-I do not a take offence to it; it is probably a device to front get the money-that the mid-north coast of New South Wales is Australia's holiday coast, I would like to suggest to them that there are other areas in Australia which regard themselves as having good Australian holiday coastsMr Sawford-Hundreds of areas.",25
29,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,COAST,"Well, I want to to mention one in particular, and that is the (Mr Whitsunday area of North Queensland and North Queensland in general. But, fair enthe ough, the money is there. The program allows for local involvement. It is always important so for governments to understand that, by giving money, they can remove a problem. They cannot do that unless they have local involveI believe that partnership is absolutely essential. The credits that both the member for Lyne and the member for Cowper paid for that local involvement were to the people who have looked at it and made submissions with their assistance. I think it reflects creditably the local population. Perhaps we ought to see more of this around Australia where local are prepared to be involved. Of course, there will be a profit for the area. If the tourism part of this package gels, the lasting effect will be that people will continue to visit that area and come in and the out of the area. Some people, in economic terms, do not understand that if a project is to successful there is a multiplier effect. If continue to visit the area, there will be chance for these 1,000 people not only over the 26 weeks of the program but into the It has a wider implication. So I congratulate those members. In this partnership, the government-and I think it is putting the cart before the horse-is educating people after they have passed through their educational program. I understand that the program comprises educational for six weeks out of the whole 26 weeks and the rest of the time is taken up in training. As has been said in this debate, it has been acknowledged that, at the end of the 26 weeks, seven out of 10 people somewill still be unemployed. They will not be that long-term unemployed; they will be shortterm unemployed. However, we should look at the positive side. We should remember at all times that three out of 10 people-300 people-will get permanent jobs. It has been mentioned that any program the government implements to absorb the unemployed has to have guidelines. There is no doubt that guidelines for past programs have been and guidelines for this program are unnecessarily restrictive and probably deny another sector of the unemployed-those who have been unemployed for less than 18 months-an opportunity to get a job even though they might have the skills for it. So, if we look at the class of participants who have been unemployed for 18 months or more, we find that it is restricted. The program does not allow for appropriate skills to be applied to the tasks that could be involved, and for that reason it is a waste-although we do recognise it as a training program. I understand that, of the 11,700 places that were to be filled nationally by this program, only 8,000 have been filled. It is great to have programs that are attuned to assisting high unemployment in certain areas-and I understand there is above national average unemployment in this area-but we must look at the effects of programs the government implements on a day-today basis to see whether this program is necessary. With Australia as young and as vigorous as it is and with as much opportunity it possesses, the most frightful statistic we have is the underutilisation of our labour resource. This is what it is about-the unemployed. We have to look at the government's failure to provide the jobs that are necessary. Before we can even embark on this, we have figures before us that nobody really understands. For instance, we talk about there being 500,000 new jobs, one million new jobs or three million new jobs, but no-one knows where those jobs are. No-one knows what those jobs replace. No-one knows what hours are involved. No-one knows whether they are full-time or part-time jobs. I believe it is fraudulent to present those figures without saying where those jobs are.",25
30,Mr COBB,COAST,Hiding the unemployed.,26
31,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,COAST,"They are hiding/the unemployed. As I understand it, a job can be classified as a job on as little as eight Hours a week. In real terms, five people are peing absorbed from the unemployment queues whereas only one job is being filled. I understand that, if a person is contributing two hours a week in a paid or voluntary capacity, that person is not described as an unemployed person. Surely that is masking the real problem. If we are going to solve the problem, we need to know what the real problem is. We are not talking about people absorbed in jobs as a result of programs such as the one we have before us at the moment. Those 8,000 people who will be given a chance as a result of this program will certainly be taken off the long-term unemployed lists but will eventually be placed back on to the short-term unemployed list. Are they jobs or are they not? Are they unemployed or are they not? From speaking to a lot of people in the education area, I know that, in relation to retention levels at school, a lot of youngsters come back to do years 11 and 12 because there is no other outlet for them. Some of them are proving to be a disruptive element for the other students in the broad spectrum of education. I come back to the point that we seem to be looking at this back to front. We should be looking at an education program where we try to teach the skills in the schools, and then after the students have finished university or other education we need to make sure there are jobs available for them to be placed in. I believe the real extent of unemployment and where the real jobs can be provided are being masked. The necessary fundamentals are not yet in place. I would like to address my remarks to where real jobs, real labour, can be provided: small business. There are many impediments to small business. At a time of a state election in Queensland, it is not uncommon to see small businesses in my area closed. They are closed because of government impositions. For instance, the difficulty employers have today in terminating employment makes them think twice about putting on people. The state's payroll tax has long been acknowledged as an impediment to employment. The stiver guarantee levy and the fringe benefits t- are add-ons to the impositions on small business to employ. Small businesses have rec9gnised there are many impediments to employing labour, such as high taxes, and they\are not employing. A farmer I spoke to the other day can hims6lf maintain a farm which harvests 11,000 tonnes of cane a year. He contracts harvesters, but on a farm which harvests 11,000 tonnes of cane a year he is the only person who needs to be employed for all 12 months of the year.",26
32,Mr COBB,COAST,Amazing.,27
33,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,COAST,"It is amazing. In my day my father had a 700-tonne to a 1,000tonne farm. We had a permanent hand and two cane cutters-and of course dad had a tribe of kids who helped out too. Taking the example of this II,OOO-tonne farm, we know society and this government have passed by the needs of small business people. One other definite impediment to small business in Queensland providing employment will be the deregulation of shopping hours. will cause all the little grocery stores and service stores on comers to collapse and allow big international supermarkets to blossom. They will not be good employers. They will not soak up those thrown out of current employment in small businesses. In that regard, I do not think the federal government, or the Queensland government, can claim any credit for creating jobs. The Queensland government is closing down railways. Public Service employees on the railways are diminishing in number-not in just ones and twos but by the thousands. Government services are also being closed down-this is true for not only the Queensland government but the federal government-such as those carried out by the CPS, police and the education sector. In my area numbers of post office staff are declining. This is diminishing the opportunities for employment in small country towns. According to the Local Government Association, these are the areas where work will be providenough. ed. Putting the Hilmer measures into effect could be the worse possible scenario for local government, particularly in country areas. We may as well close down the towns if jobs in the railways, the police force, the CPS and a whole multitude of other areas are ripped out of towns. The lack of major works projects in Queensland also worries me. They could be great employers. At the moment we have the ridiculous situation where Queensland has a huge coal resource base and powerhouses have been built in the last six years but in the future we will be forced to buy our power from New South Wales. Just think of the job opportunities going to waste. No new dams have been constructed. No programs have been put in place except the user-pays system. Again, these are areas that could provide real labour. No more roads will be built at the public's expense. Roads are now being built in the form of toll ways. Many rip through the most beautiful parts of Queensland, particularly in the south. It will be interesting to find out the reaction of Queenslanders in the coming state government election. Could I talk about tourism because that is It what the motion refers to-jobs on Australia's holiday coast. We have just completed an exercise in the banking, finance and public administration committee looking at the aspects of taxation on the tourism industry that put it at a disadvantage compared with other industries. The user-pays principle that is now coming into tourism, whether it be in regard to the use of the Barrier Reef, the use of a national park or the use of a waterway, is decimating the tourism industry. The government says that it is not putting up or introducing new taxes but there has been an abnormal increase in the aspect of how it funds its money. This is just one way. In regard to fuel tax excise the industry complains bitterly that it is not subject to a rebate because all the fuel it uses on the water is never used on a road back on the mainland. The fringe benefits tax was a particular worry. The committee criticised the government's latest moves in that regard to try to simplify it because they had not gone far Thankfully, the committee did make recommendations both on the payroll tax and the fringe benefits tax. The sales tax was a particular impediment. People in business are being asked to pay sales tax on the equipment they use on a day-today basis. Employment opportunities in the health services in Queensland are being diminished day by day. The private hospital system and the private providers are being discouraged from taking up the slack. So, while I again commend the movers of this motion, the member for Lyne and the member for Cowper, on their foresight and commend the people of their region for their assistance, I say that the government ought to go back to the fundamentals and look at where these jobs Olre being lost. It should be honest about where the new jobs are. It should be honest about unemployment and try to form some solution. (Time expired)",27
34,Mr ADAMS,COAST,"I would like to answer a couple of things that the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) had to say. The difference between each side of the House can come up in these debates. The term the honourable member used was the 'under-resource of our labour force', which true. On our side of the House we believe that with unemployment comes a great deal of social cost as well. High levels of unemployment disrupt our society greatly and cause great hardship to individuals. I guess that is why the long-term unemployed have been targeted for special assistance with some of the programs this motion deals with. The member for Dawson raised the issue of retention rates. He was missing the point. When we look at retention rates and young people staying at school and endeavouring to gain skills at that level, we find that many the jobs that the previous generation would have been engaged in have now gone. The jobs are not there. So the best thing those young people can do is to gain further skills to enhance their entry into some of the jobs that are coming on, which require many more skills than probably a 15or a 16-year-old would have required even in my day and even in your day, Mr Deputy Speaker. Those jobs have gone, so it is not a simple task to say that there should be another system and that those kids should not be at school, that they ! should be out there working. The jobs t4t they used to take up are not there any longer. If you look deeper into some of the 10grams that are starting to come into play land some of the policies of this governmellt to encourage school-to-work programs, tHen I think the honourable member would probably reach a different conclusion. The memQbr for Lyne (Mr Vaile) moved this motion yesterday in the House. He talked about new· work opportunities. He had some criticisms of the programs and labour market programs' generally, but I felt he was missing the point with his criticism that we were targeting the long term unemployed people who had been out of work for 18 months. The old argument of why we are doing that comes from statistics that show that after each recession or downturn in our economy we pick up people who have been out of work for a longer period. The recent downturn that we have had caused a high number of people to be out of work for a long period. The probiem is that, if you do not get back into the work force in is the early months of unemployment, you find it even harder to get back in after you have been out of work for 18 months. Employers do not pick up people who have been out of work for 12 months or more unless those people have a special skill. Employers will pick up somebody who has been out of work for two or three months in front of somebody who has been out of work for 18 months. The government's employment policy is targeted at assisting those people who have been out of work for a long period. The honourable member for Lyne talked about whether the employment programs were of successful. In Tasmania, 38 per cent of our labour programs resulted in people getting into work. I think that is an excellent statistic, although it could be better. The programs could work towards getting more people into work-and of course they are doing that. They also get people into the working mode by giving them a six-month opportunity to get back into a job or to get a job for the first time. It enables them to get a pay packet, get into the regular habit of going to and from work and take part in the socialisation associated with that sort of activity. rhere is no doubt that the Working Nation program has been one of the most successful programs in recent times in addressing the problems of the long-term unemployed. I think other countries have looked at that program as well. They are looking at our progtams to see how we tackle those issues in Australia. In my state there have been 6,000 outcomes for job compact clients-those are the people who are unemployed for 18 months and in receipt of the newstart allowance. That is an excellent start on solving the long-term unemployed problem in Tasmania. We have achieved an overall reduction of approximately five per cent in the total number of people in receipt of social security unemployment benefits-including the jobsearch and news tart allowances-and a 5.5 per cent reduction in the number of people on the job compact register in the last 12 months. If the program had not been instigated in Tasmania, we would have had no growth in employment. These improvements have occurred in what is still a very difficult labour market, which shows that Working Nation is on track and ahead of schedule in some parts of the state. We have a state government which has not been able to boost job growth at all. All employment has been created by one or another of the federal government programs and can be attributed to the Working Nation initiative. No investment is coming into the state. Our tourist figures are down, and no jobs are being created through the policies of our state government. The only growth in employment in the state is through the new work opportunities program, Working Nation programs and labour market programs. There has been a slight problem with the new work opportunities program in Tasmania, with some community concern that it will displace the wages and conditions of other workers. There is some resistance to training wages. I believe that these beliefs and feelings are ill-founded. There is an answer to this, and I am currently working closely with a number of the key players to try to help this program progress further. I know of many labour market programs that have helped people into training and assisted them back into the work force. Many people in my state have achieved their goal of getting back into the work force, and I can think of several of them. When the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) was in Tasmania, Incat, the ferry maker in Hobart, helped people who had been out of work for three years develop the new skill of welding aluminium. That is a high skill and those people were as keen as mustard because they were in a new field that was going to keep their work prospects alive for many years into the future. The programs have also given local government and communities an opportunity to bring forward works that may not have been done for some time, that were just on the list of work that could be done and really needed to be done. Some of those works included developing additional tourism structure and tidying up particular long-term problems, even down to our war memorials. We have restoration work being undertaken on some of those. I have been particularly keen to ensure that the electorate of Lyons has been well represented in making sure that we have achieved what we can from these programs. One such program is the wetlands project, which assisted the local municipality through an innovative program to develop a series of filter ponds for the sewage, and it used jobskills to assist it to achieve its goals. This has now become a first-class tourist feature for the New Norfolk municipality, providing a great visiting and recreation spot. The bird life is establishing there, even the platypi are taking up residence within those ponds that were created through the labour market program. Another such program was developed at Chauncy Vale, which had 15 young LEAP people working in a natural sanctuary restoring and preserving the site which was the home of one of Tasmania's great writers, Nan Chauncy. There were a few problems with this, and I think it was caused by the lack of information given to participants when they started. We have now sorted that out. I am sure it will be a very successful program. Orielton Lagoon, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) visited recently when he was in Tasmania, also had a component of 25 LEAP participants over two stages preparing the wetlands and assisting in restoring the lagoon to get it back to its original state and in getting over some of the really bad environmental problems associated with that lagoon. The Bridgewater High School farm had 15 jobskillers assisting in making the farm into a fine educational tool for training rural workers and also giving work experience in country skills to some of the tough young kids from the urban areas. There is nothing like grooming a cranky bull at 6 a.m. before a show to test the real mettle of some of those youngsters. It gets them to think about who is the strongest. Queenstown has 10 jobskills people working on their weeds to wilderness project. The Lachlan River at New Norfolk also has 15 people working on weed removal and restoration of river banks in order to restore that river to some of its past glory. As of 23 June 1995, the commencements in Lyons are 257 jobskills and 65 LEAP people. The 53 new work opportunities have been agreed to in principle, and I hope we can get them started very soon. Further places have been created and will be filled in the new financial year. I am looking for employers who can provide access to ongoing employment once the training period has finished. There are a number of industries in the electorate of Lyons that may well help us reach this goal, including the forestry industry which, with new methods of planting and caring for young trees, requires a lot of manual assistance. a good place to learn the essence of the industry literally from the ground up. People now need to have greater skills than they did in the old days. As I mentioned earlier, the timber industry is a far more precise and technical industry today than it was many years ago. You need to know what you are doing and you need to know why you are doing it. Thus job training under jobskills or NETTFORCE would ensure that young people can gain these skills on the job from the professionals while helping an industry deal with a cyclical work demand. I think members will agree that labojir market programs, such as the one mention,ed in the motion moved by the member of LY)1e, play a significant role in getting people back into the work force in Australia and also adding to their skill levels. I wish those from the Mid-Coast Area Consultative Committee well in their endeavour to create 1,000 jobs. I am sure that they will achieve that goal. From what the member has said, there seems to be some enthusiasm for achieving that goal. I also wish other members well in helping people in their electorates get back to work with the help of these labour market programs. I look forward to seeing more successes with this program. I congratulate the minister for developing this program and making it work in this country. I also congratulate him for his dedicated interest and ongoing support of Working Nation.",28
35,Mrs SULLIVAN,COAST,"I have followed this debate with a great deal of interest because my electorate of Moncrieff has a very high rate of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment and long-term unemployment. I have also followed the new work opportunities program with a great deal of interest. Unfortunately, I was not able to be present when the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) visited my electorate to launch the program simply because, as usual, I got only two or three days notice that he was going to do this. Members will understand that it is almost impossible to go to public functions It is with that sort of notice. That is what happened in my case on that occasion. It was not that I did not want to be there. However, whilst I have followed this program with some interest, I am now following it with some concern. I was interested to listen to the speeches other members have made in this debate on the motion moved by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), and I congratulate him on it. Since the debate started yesterday and the Hansard was available today, I was interested to check the speeches in Hansard to see what members said about programs in their electorates. I have to say that the story I have to tell quite different from the stories that other members have been telling in relation to their electorates. When I was acquaiNted yesterday with the fact that this motion, quite unexpectedly, would be brought on today, I sought to get some information on the matter so that I could make a contribution to the debate. I had a member of my staff contact the Department of Employment, Education and Training. I gave him no guidance, so he went through a slightly tortuous process of identifying the right person. I just told him the sort of information I needed. He was referred to the regional office in control of the Gold Coast, which is at Mount Gravatt. When he contacted that DEET office he was told that the person who was responsible for that area was on the telephone and unavailable. He explained that he was seeking general background information and requested, of the staff member he spoke to, the following information, which is what I had requested: how many new work opportunities programs are operating on the Gold Coast-by that I also meant any plans that might be in hand-what industries are involved and how many people are currently, or will be, taking advantage of this scheme? My staff member was told that the person to whom he was speaking did not know but would find out and call back. Shortly afterwards, a Geoff Green telephoned and stated that he had been advised by the Parliamentary Liaison Officer and the department that he could not provide any information. He went on to say that we would have to request this information through the minister's office and that an electoral brief had been prepared. Later, my staff member spoke to the DEET office at Southport. Southport is the centre of my electorate and it is also where my electorate office is located. Whilst my electorate has changed a great deal since it was first established in 1984, Southport has always been the core of it. I therefore have a long standing working relationship with federal government department agencies which are located on the Gold Coast-and most of them happen to be in Southport. There has never' been any is problem between me and my office and any government office within my electorate or anywhere else. Again, the sort of information that was being sought was conveyed to a Sue Horne, who is, I believe, the manager. The same sorts of questions were asked. She indicated to my staff member that the people who had the information were in a meeting and that she would call back with it. She contacted my office shortly after 5 o'clock to say that she could not supply any information without the authority of the area office and that she would attempt to get someone to telephone me with the information required. It would seem that when the people who had the information came out of their office, they told her that this information could not be supplied to me by this office. Dr Kemp-Quite extraordinary.",30
36,Mrs SULLIVAN,COAST,"Yes, it is quite extraordinary when one considers I am a member of parliament trying to find out what is happening about the long-term unemployed in my own electorate and I keep being fobbed off. This morning the matter was pursued with this Sue Horne, who confirmed that someone would be contacting my office. It was stressed that I needed this fairly quickly because the debate on the subject was scheduled for this morning. A short while after that, a telephone call was received from a Rod Booth, with whom I have a very long standing working relationship through his senior position in CES. I have always worked very closely and very cooperatively with him, and I have always found him an excellent person to work with. In another telephone call a little later, after the sort of information that I wanted was detailed to him, he informed my staff member that he had been instructed that the only way information could be provided to me was through the minister's office. He said that he had discussed it at some length with the area manager but the ruling was firm. He did not say what his conversation was with the area manager. I would hope and trust that he indicated to the area manager-whom I do not know-that I am not an irresponsible person when it comes to these matters. Dr Kemp-You are a member of parliament.",31
37,Mrs SULLIVAN,COAST,"Yes, I am a member of parliament trying to find out about public moneys being spent within my own electorate. That is what my role is. To end that story, I can say that contact has been made with the minister's office. However, the person who has the information I have been requesting is on three weeks leave. When my staff member indicated that I really needed this information and that I had exhausted every other source, he was told that they would do their best and ring back. As at the time that I came into the chamber-l1.00 a.m - no contact had been made with my office by the minister's office. Yesterday I put my name on the speakers list for this item, hoping to talk about happening with taxpayers' money under government programs in my electorate, and I come almost empty-handed. Someone may ask: why did I not contact the chairman of the consultative committee? The chairman of the consultative committee from my region is a person called Peter Lawlor. I have known Peter Lawlor for about as long as I have been the member for Moncrieff. I have been in the electorate for 11 years and I have been the member nearly that long. I have no problems with him-he is a very pleasant fellow and we get on very well. However, he is the Labor candidate for Southport in the forthcoming state election. He is not a businessman-although I suppose he is in a certain sense-he is a solicitor, but he is not the sort of person that I would have expected to be chairing the consultative committee on the Gold Coast. Some people may be aware that the Gold Coast is the small business capital of Australia. If you look at all the statistics on employelection ment, self-employment and so on from the Bureau of Statistics, you will find that the electorates of MCPherson and Moncrieff have the highest number of self-employed people, or of people employed by a very small enterprise, of all the electorates in Australia. So when I make the claim we are the small business capital of Australia. I do not do so lightly. It is an area of entrepreneurship. It is at the cutting edge of the Australian economy. Tourism, which is our major industry, is a small business industry. There are few large businesses. People tend to look at enterprises like Conrad International Hotel and Jupiters Casino, see that it is a fairly substantial employer and think that it is typical of the Gold Coast. Those sorts of concerns are absolutely atypical of the Gold Coast. We are a small business economy. One would have expected to have had as chairman someone more in line with the sorts of people we are being told about from other tourism areas. For example, the member for Lyne, who raised this matter, mentioned in his speech that the chairman of his committee is a proprietor of MCDonald's Family Restaurants in Taree and Port Macquarie. We have what is some very successful franchises of McDonald's restaurants on the Gold Coast. There are quite a few of them on the Gold Coast and some people have more than one MCDonald's restaurant. I noticed that when the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) spoke he indicated that the appointed chairman of his consultative committee was the chairman of a bank in Western Australia. Not too 'surprisingly the chairman of the committee for the electorate of Page, which is a Labor electorate, is from the North Coast Combined Unions Committee. There is nothing wrong with that. He would probably have a pretty broad experience, although I do not know what his experience of business is. The member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) told us that the chairman of his committee was a president of a football club-he is also a very prominent businessman-as chairmen of football clubs sometimes are. I think members will understand that in an climate I had some diffidence about contacting a Labor candidate. Peter Lawlor has been the Labor candidate for quite some months, since Christmas in fact. At the moment he is campaigning very hard to defeat a coalition member of the state parliament, Mr Mick Veivers, who is the shadow minister for tourism-and a very good, hard working member he has been, too. In that climate alone, it is difficult for me to be contacting him; I say that by way of some explanation. I also wonder whether someone who is a candidate for an election at the time of appointment-as far as I know-as chairman was the appropriate person for the minister put in this position. Generally, there is great goodwill in community, particularly amongst business people in the community, to do something about the unemployed. Dr Kemp-That's my experience.",32
38,Mrs SULLIVAN,COAST,"Our shadow minister ed indicates that that is his experience. It certainly been mine. Rotary, for example, a very high-powered drive-and has had for some time on the Gold Coast-for combined Rotary clubs to get their members involved getting jobs for unemployed people. They have been working very hard at it. They have thrown themselves into it with great enthusiment asm and commitment. So the commitment and interest is there. It is utterly inappropriate that there should be these political overtones attached to chairmanship of these consultative commitby tees. As I said a few minutes ago, I say with some diffidence because I know and personally like Peter Lawlor, although I will not be voting for him in the state election. am sure he does not vote for me either in federal elections-in fact, I know he does not. For this sort of program to have been put the hands of a Labor Party candidate was not wise. Given the experience that I have had in last 24 hours-the obfuscation, the runquestion around, the blocking, the dry gullies, office has been trying to find out what is happening in my electorate with taxpayers' money on this-I am very much inclined to agree with the statements by the member Goldstein, who has very recently and very properly pointed out the shortfalls in Working Nation programs and raised the question: is this just another way of fiddling the figures prior to an election? We all know there is a federal election imminent. We only disagree on how immiearly nent, whether it is a matter of weeks or months away. All of us who contested the last election remember how the unemployment figures were bodgied by transferring a whole his lot of people from unemployment benefits into training programs and the governm-nt to then saying that meant unemployment had fallen. What it meant was that recipients of the unemployment benefits had fallen. However, they had only been transferred to another type of unemployment benefit which was called something else. Frankly, the 'don't knows' that I have had and the muddle that appears to have surroundthis particular program seems to be of a has piece with the shortfalls that have already has occurred in other Working Nation programs. I say that with quite a degree of sorrow. I am pleased that the member for Lyne was able to in detail when speaking to his motion the type of cooperation and success that he has encountered in the efforts to reduce unemployin his electorate. I just wish I had the information to give the House to be able to say the same in relation to Moncrieff.",33
39,Mr GRIFFIN,COAST,"Corinella) (11.20 a.m.)the We are here today to debate a motion moved the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), sponthis sored also by the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), on one of the programs under the Working Nation initiative: new work opporI tunities and use of the area consultative committee process in the mid-coast area. It is also an opportunity to discuss in general, as in many speakers have, the question of the operation of Working Nation and the question of, I suppose, the development of initiatives the on behalf of government to assist with the of unemployment, with what can be as my done from a government perspective. The role of government in a practical sense has changed significantly in the last 15 years in relation to job creation. Historically, job for creation from government usually meant major public works or increased public sector the employment through existing departmental channels. The attempts at assisting private sector employment through government programs were minimal and often inapproprivery ate. As a response to the recession of the 1980s and the continuing above average levels of unemployment that followed during the recovery-that is, above average given our postwar experience of the 1950s and 1960s-the government started to develop a range of programs and subsidy arrangements to assist people to gain skills and to assist business to employ. The success of these initiatives was mixed for a range of reasons. Firstly, the implementation of some programs proved to be extremely costly, making the unit costs prohibitive. Departmental structures and personnel were often not well equipped to handle problems dealing with long-term unerpployed people or with the private sector that would be employing them. The Department of Employment, Education and Training and its forerunners were never really designed for the task they have faced over the last 15 years. The massive increase in unemployment levels led to increased resourcing for the department, but real difficulties have continued with respect to having the right structure to respond to the challenges faced, the ability to react quickly and with innovation to changing demands, and getting enough of the right sort of staff to perform the various roles required. For example, working with small business people and convincing them of the scope available for assistance via government programs is not a role many public servants would be comfortable with. Administrative competence comes secondary to role of advocate and salesperson on these occasions. The private sector also had a general suspicion of government. By that I mean that many business people, particularly in small business, were unwilling to believe that the government could actually be there to help them. Visions of bureaucracy, red tape and armies of clerks and accountants were difficult to overcome in terms of convincing employers that real practical assistance was available. Some programs just were not successful or, rather, not as successful as was hoped when dealing with diverse areas of labour market demand, both in terms of the opportunity for sustainable employment growth and also regarding the skills required. Government has found it difficult to accurately predict and anticipate regional needs and provide appropriate program delivery. The role and interaction between the three levels of government have also been problematic with respect to some programs. Parochialism and political partisanship have at times hampered practical policy outcomes. Most of these difficulties can also be related to the problem of developing policy nationally for implementation locally. By that I mean that any employment generation policy that seeks to practically influence diverse local labour markets has to be able to not only appeal to the vagaries of a particular area but also understand the psychology of the various players involved; for example, prospective employers, the unemployed· and the various bureaucrats at state, federal and local level. The 1980s and early 1990s have seen various initiatives being tried with some being discarded and others refined. The government's white paper, Working Nation, essentially builds on the experience of the last few years. In terms of labour market programs and the role they can play in job creation, the emphasis is on subsidy support for employers to employ. This occurs via traineeships with the continuation of jobstart and also under the job compact with the new work opportunities program. The nature of these programs is to encourage employers to employ, to give them an opportunity to tum a marginal job opportunity into an ongoing position via government subsidy. The subsidy provided assists while a new employee is being trained and helps minimise the economic cost to business of employing new staff. Attempts are also being made to assist the unemployed to establish their own businesses under the new enterprise incentive scheme, known as NElS. Under NElS, managing agents accredit training in small business management and planning skills. Participants also receive business advice, mentoring and an allowance during the critical first year of establishing their businesses. The emphasis on improved training programs and practical on-the-job training seeks to ensure potential employees have relevant skills in terms of labour market opportunities that are available. This has always been the aim with training programs. However, with better business links, improved coordination, greater flexibility around what courses are available-when they are available-and how quickly they can be developed, better outcomes are expected. One of the most important themes in Working Nation in terms of its practical initiatives is its localism. By that, I mean the consistent approach of trying to structurally address the difficulties faced by national policy being implemented at the local level. For an employment generation policy to be successful, it has to be adaptable to local circumstances and be capable of implementation by those responsible. The government is doing this in a number of ways. Firstly, the government is doing this through the co-option of industry and union representation at all levels. This occurs through national bodies, such as NETTFORCE; through industry related activities, such as industry training boards; and at a local level, via DEET area consultative committees and the boards of regional development organisations. The intention is to ensure that initiatives are implemented with broad support because there is broad agreement on their appropriateness. This will help to make sure that initiatives are successful and, hopefully, undermine the suspicion of government's role at the local level. Attempts are also being made to improve the service delivery options available to government. The CES is being revamped, with an increased emphasis on outcomes through the individual case management approach for the unemployed. This should help ensure unemployed people get better, more effective advice and assistance with respect to appropriate training and job opportunities. In addition, private sector providers are also being introduced to provide case management services. This will provide an alternative to the CES and is already placing pressure on CES staff to improve their game. Area consultative committees should also assist CES management to be better in touch with the needs of the area they serve. One initiative that I believe could be very successful is the use of CES officers to lobby local employers to put people on. Although the CES currently has business service centres whose role is to perform this task, they tend to concentrate on larger employers. By dedicating staff to knock on doors and convince employers that they can afford to employ someone, I am confident that many small employers can be convinced, and the net increase in employment could be significant. The success of the strategy I have briefly outlined is difficult to quantify accurately, but the available information is encouraging. For example, the success of NElS is demonstrated by the fact that 84 per cent of NElS participants are still in employment 15 months after starting their NElS businesses. NElS businesses also create jobs by employing additional people. For those on traineeships, the retention rate in unsubsidised employment is 84 per cent some three months after the subsidy period is completed. It is also possible to compare the success of labour market programs for participants with the circumstances faced by those who have not taken part in any program. Evaluations of jobstart, job clubs, jobtrain and skillshare, which accounted for about 75 per cent of all labour market program commencements in 1994, showed that they greatly improve the chances of getting a job. Participation in a training program increased the likelihood of getting a job by 50 per cent, while participation in a wage subsidy program doubled the chance of getting a job. Importantly, the programs have had an even greater impact on the job prospects of the long-term unemployed. For example, for jobstart people who had been unemployed for 12 to 24 months, there was a 60 per cent outcome rate; but for people not in jobstart who had been unemployed for 12 to 24 months there was only a 27 per cent outcome rate. Preliminary data on former jobstart participants shows that outcome levels for the long-term unemployed are sustained for at least a year after program participation. However, I believe that the development of a comprehensive and effective system is an ongoing process-and that process is continuing. In their speeches on this motion, the member for Lyne and the member for Cowper congratulated and recognised the work of the Mid-Coast Area Consultative Committee. The member for Lyne though was keen to make clear that his congratulations and recognition were an endorsement of the local area committee's work rather than ail overall endorsement of the program. In his speech yesterday the member for Lyne said: . . . this motion is not a ringing endorsement particular government program but a recognition of local people being innovative and entrepreneurial in .an attempt to strengthen a major local industry He continued: The jobs program, which this group of regional leaders has put in place, has the unqualified endorsement of business and community groups throughout the region, as the motion says. Essentially, what has happened in the midcoast area is what is happening allover Australia through this program. In the debate on this motion we have had the Mid-Coast ACC mentioned by the members for Lyne and Cowper; the Perth Area Consultative Committee was mentioned by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith); the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) pointed out yesterday that he thought the Gold Coast ACC was 'on the right track', although there were some concerns raised about who might be the chairman; the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) talked about the Northern Rivers ACC and the work it was doing towards job creation in that area; and the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) spoke in some detail about the development of worthwhile programs in the Port Adelaide area. So examples in New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland and South·Australia were raised through the debate in this House. They are part of some 60 area committees that are in place. You just cannot drop them on the ground and get them going. Obviously, it takes time to get them to work properly and successfully. It is occurring all over the country on a regular basis and the improvements are there in the statistics for us to see. Members of parliament from both sides are recognising that those programs are successful in their areas. The government's overall target in Working Nation is to reduce unemployment to five per cent by the year 2000. We still have a long way to go. As someone who has been unemployed in years gone by, during the last recession, I know that it is difficult for people who are in that situation to see that there is a chance in the future. Since the release of of this Working Nation we have seen the rate of unemployment drop from a peak of 11.2 per cent to 8.5 per cent. You also have to look at what Working Nation is about and what the role of area consultative committees is. It is a question not only of generating employment but also of ensuring that we do not have a situation that occurred in previous recessions where the long-term unemployed were left behind. If you look at the last recession and the recovery that came after that, you will see that with employment growth there was minor impact on the number of long-term unemployed. If, say, 430,000 people went back into employment, only 10,000 or 12,000 were long-term unemployed, because they were left behind. The circumstances resulting from this recovery are very different. Now about 25 per cent of the new jobs created have gone to the long-term unemployed. That is a major endorsement of the rationale and the strategy behind this program. We have also seen a major drop in the number of long-term unemployed youth-an issue close to my heart-of close to 30 per cent over this period. Again, that is an area that is a key to this. When we are debating this issue we also have to look at the coalition's record in these circumstances. The recent headland speech from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) made no mention of employment, education and training. Even The Things That Matter farce that occurred some months ago had a whole chapter devoted to that, but it has now dropped off the agenda. In the last two years, we have created over 600,000 new jobs through the government's policies and through the overall economic recovery. When the current Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer in the coalition government, the record was 262,000 jobs created in 5Yz years. A big part of it all is productivity improvement, which also has an impact on the economy in an overall sense. We have had four per cent productivity improvement in the labour force, while the best the coalition achieved when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer was 1Yz per cent. There are clear differences there for all to see. Although it is some years ago-and that is often the point made by the opposition-the fact is that it is the only record we have on which to judge the performance of the Leader of the Opposition, because for so many years he has been isolated from real power, even within his own party. On the question of area consultative committees, we are also talking about the issue of regional development-that localism that I mentioned earlier-how you develop a real local identity, process and energy to develop agreements on a local basis. Yesterday the member for Page talked about the memo that was produced by the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) on the question of regional and rural development. It was very insightful of the actual process being followed by the coalition. He talked about the need to have big figures and the need to try to set an agenda which was based on statements rather than on action. He stressed the fact that, after an election, one can always back away from it. The government's policies have been endorsed by the OECD. The minister has spoken about that on a regular basis. The situation we have here is that we are doing something. It is working and it should be commended by the House. (Time expired) Question resolved in the affirmative. NA GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 1995 Senate Message Message received from the Senate returning the bill and acquainting the House that the Senate has agreed to the bill as amended by the House. NA Republic Debate resumed from 8 June, on motion by Mr Beazley: That the House take note of the paper.",33
40,Mr CAMERON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I welcome the opportunity to debate the topic of a republic. It is a topic more relevant to our children and the generations to follow than to us. For that matter, notwithstanding our respect for and consideration of the views of our older Australians, we must bear in mind that the decisions we make regarding the constitution will be for our younger Australians, and our decisions should be in their interests. Despite being a young nation, Australia has a long and proud history. Since Federation in 1901, we have endured, among other things, two world wars and a depression. In spite of this, our nation has remained a united and free democracy, the envy of many nations throughout the world. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) pointed out in his reply to the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating): Australia has been one of fewer than 10 countries that has been continuously democratic for the whole of the 20th century. It cannot be denied that our stability is due, in part, to our stable constitution. Our constitution has rewarded our nation with continuous democracy, freedom for our people and stable government for our nation. However, I should point out that stable government does not give us honest government, and the members opposite are a testimony to that. The Prime Minister's statement outlined his republican agenda. He tried to give the impression that his statement was based on the recommendations of the very expensive Republic Advisory Committee, but the speech we heard from the Prime Minister was his republican agenda, and his alone. In April 1993, the government established a Republic Advisory Committee headed by Malcolm Turnbull. It was made up of an elite group chosen by the Prime Minister and, I should add, it was a group certainly not representative of mainstream Australia. It is ironic that, when the Leader of the Opposition announced that the coalition would allow the Australian people to be involved in the process of constitutional reform and that we would hold a people's convention-the make-up of which would be 50 per cent appointed and 50 per cent elected, and 10 per cent of those appointed would be in the age bracket of 18 to 25-the member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland) questioned the fact that we would appoint half the membership. He questioned the fact that half the people's convention would be appointed; yet the Prime Minister's advisory committee was 100 per cent appointed, unrepresentative of mainstream Australia and lacking in representation of young people. The question must be asked: did the member for MCEwen question the Prime Minister about his appointing the whole of the Republic Advisory Committee? In his speech, the Prime Minister outlined his republican agenda. The major characteristics of the Prime Minister's plan are for Australia's head of state to be appointed by a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of houses of parliament; that that person is nominated by the Prime Minister after consultations with the opposition; that the head of state has the same powers as the Governor General-however, those powers will not be codified-and, finally, that no serving or former politicians are eligible to become head of state until five years have passed since their departure from parliament. One characteristic of the republic debate is that the Prime Minister seems to think that this debate is about whether we want an Australian as head of state. He gives the impression that anyone who supports the present constitution is a lesser Australian than he. Nothing could be further from the truth. Many supporters of the present constitution fought for our nation, risked their lives for our nation, and if the Prime Minister is going to suggest that he is a better Australian than they simply because he wants an Australian head of state then he ought to think again. This debate is not about whether we want an Australian as a head of state. If we were writing the constitution today, it would be inevitable-probably the first point-that Australia's head of state be Australian. The fact is, though, that we are debating a constitution that was prepared last century, we are dealing with the complexities of change that are associated with that constitution which was written all those years ago, and therefore the topic of debate is not how do we just delete any references to the Queen but, if the Australian people are not adverse to changing the constitution to deleting references to the Queen and her heirs and successors, how do we find out if that is what they want and, if it is what they want, how we do it while giving them the same or better certainty, stability and freedom that exists with our present constitution. On that point, it should also be remembered that over the past 30 years the Governor General has become Australia's constitutional head of state. That position has been occupied by an Australian since 1965. I cannot foresee any future government, so long as we have the Governor General, appointing anyone both other than an Australian to that position. The government, and I note various elements of the media also, have condemned the coalition for advocating a people's convention. I take exception to their criticism. Firstly, the government's Republic Advisory Committee, on which the government's position is based, does not represent mainstream Australia. A people's convention will. Secondly, the government Republic Advisory Committee only looked at the minimalist approach of constitutional change. It did not, as the Leader of the Opposition said, consider items such as the basis on which new states, in particular the Northern Territory, would be admitted; whether we should introduce fouryear terms of the parliament; and the allocation of legislative and executive powers and functions between state and federal governments, including areas of overlap and duplication. These are issues which are pertinent to Australia becoming a republic and which were ignored by the Keating committee but which will not be ignored by a people's convention. Finally, a people's convention will ensure that if the people want constitutional change then the constitutional changes which are proposed will be those decided by the people and not the Prime Minister, his office, the Keating committee or the Australian republican movement. The Keating committee was expensive, considering it was a smokescreen. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were expended by the government on the Keating committee, and there is little evidence from the Prime Minister's statement of him taking note of their recommendations. For all we know, the statement could have been prepared before the committee commenced any deliberations but only made by the Prime Minister afterwards. A people's convention will give the people the constitution they want, not the constitution the Prime Minister demands. The Republic Advisory Committee is hardly a people's convention. Look at the 22 public forums it held around the nation. In a population of 18- million people, a mere 1,479 persons attended the public forums held by the Republic Advisory Committee. That is an average of 67 people per meeting-hardly representative of mainstream Australia. Because I truly want to hear the people's view, I organised a public forum within my own electorate of Stirling. We had an attendance of 200-three times the average attendance the Keating committee could manage. A people's convention will ensure the will of the people shall prevail. The Prime Minister wants a referendum on his proposal, not the people's-and that is the only question that will be put at a Keating referendum. Looking at all the referenda held in our nation, one thing is perfectly clear: referendum proposals will only get through with bipartisan support. The coalition will not support the Keating proposals until there has been further, more detailed consultation with the public. Our view is-and this is what we will do when we win government-that a people's convention should be held to debate the various aspects of the constitution and what changes, if any, should be made. That way, if there is a strong consensus for change, we know that the referendum question put to the people will be supported because it will be their referendum proposal, not the proposal of a megalomaniac sitting in isolated imperial renaissance splendour in the Lodge here in Canberra. Our approach keeps the people involved at the beginning, at the middle and at the end. It lets them debate the constitution the whole way through-not after the Prime Minister has put forward his proposal at the beginning and said, 'This is what I'm offering you. It is that or nothing.' If there is not general consensus from a people's convention, the various options which were preferred at a people's convention is what will be offered, including the status quo which many in the community maywant. Presently, if the Prime Minister had his way and put forward his proposal and it was rejected, there would not be any constitutional debate for many years under the guise that the public have recently considered the topic and do not support another debate. The message to the Prime Minister, therefore, is: if you really want to change our constitutional head of state, allow the people to decide the approach we take to doing this, from the beginning to the end. If you try having your way, it will be rejected. The Prime Minister does not want the proposed new head of state's powers codified. The thing is that the people might. In fact, I am sure the people would. If we take the Keating approach, the opportunity of considering codifying the head of state's powers and how that would be done will not be presented because we are having only the Prime Minister's agenda followed and not the people's. We are debating probably the most significant and historic change to our constitution, indeed to any law, in Australia's history. The changes we are debating seek to change our constitution and, for that matter, the running of government. The great thing about our present constitution, to the credit of our forefathers who wrote it, is that changing the constitution requires the support of the majority of Australians in a majority of states. Therefore, for Australia to become a republic, we need the support of the people. That will come about only by involving them in the process of change, from the beginning to the end. The Prime Minister's proposals are only his. A people's convention will put forward the proposals of the people for the people to vote on. It will ensure any referendum which arises from that carries bipartisan support, ensuring the referendum has maximum support and ensuring that, if we do change our constitution, it is the people's changes that are made. I will support only constitutional changes that carry the support of the majority of Australians after they have had the opportunity to consider all options throughout the whole debate, and that can be done only through a people's convention as proposed by the coalition.",37
41,Mr GIBSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I listened with great interest to the contribution by the member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) to this debate. In the interests of the good order of the House, I exercised great restraint during some of the comments he made. One needs to take up a few of the points the member for Stirling and I know many of his colleagues are running in this debate. First, the member for Stirling, like all of his coalition colleagues, keeps trying to avoid the fundamental question-a question that has been asked of those opposite for quite a while now and which the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), has failed to answer and continues to fail to answer: does the coalition believe that an Australian should be our head of state? That is the question opposition members must answer. The fact is that we on this side of the House do believe that. We believe that an Australian should be our head of state, that we are an independent nation entitled to have our own head of state from our own people. That has been the essence of the debate on the republic since the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) first raised the issue in 1991, and that is the question the coalition continues to refuse to answer. No amount of obfuscation, delaying tactics and avoidance rhetoric by the member for Stirling, the Leader of the Opposition or any of their colleagues on the opposition benches will hide the fact that the people of Australia are asking for an answer to that fundamental question. The attempt to hide from the question by saying that Australia has been selecting its own governors-general for the last 30 or 40 years and that they have been Australiansmost of them have been outstanding Australians and have done the job very well-does not answer the question. The Governor General is not our head of state; the Governor General is the representative of our head of state. According to our constitution, the head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, and her children and grandchildren will hold the position as our head of state. I, as a democrat, believe that we the people should choose our head of state and that noone should have a right to be our head of state because of the family they were born to or who their parents are. I fundamentally reject the concept of a monarchy because I am a very strong democrat and I believe the people should choose our leader and our head of state. I believe fundamentally that the people of Australia, when they get the opportunity to directly participate by voting in the referendum that will be held in 1998 or 1999, will make that decision as well. They will show they believe in having an Australian as our head of state. At the moment, whenever our head of state travels overseas, she travels as the Queen of England. She represents British industry, British commerce, British people's values. She does it very well. She is an outstanding representative for the people of Britain, but she does not represent the people of Australia. When she went to Russia or when she went to Canada or when she went to Europe, she did not go there saying, 'I am the Queen of Australia. I am here to tell you that Australian goods and services are great and you should be buying up more of these things and you should come and visit Australia.' She goes there representing the people of Britain. When Bill Hayden travels overseas",40
42,Mr FILING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,As he does frequently.,40
43,Mr GIBSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"As he does frequently, and does it very well, too in all the regal pomp and splendour that the Governor General is able to muster",40
44,Mr FILING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Senator MCKiernan doesn't think so.,40
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Mr Andrew)Order! The member for Moore might exercise some restraint. The member for Moreton is entitled to be heard in silence.,41
46,Mr GIBSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"That's right. I did exercise great restraint during the contribution of the member for Stirling, so I think the member for Moore should do the same.",41
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Order! I do not think the member for Moore intends to reflect on the chair's decision.,41
48,Mr GIBSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"When the Governor General travels overseas, most countries do not understand what his actual status is; they are quite confused about him. Is he the head of state or not the head of state? By our constitution, no, he is not. He is not the. head of state. He is the representative of the head of state. It is something of great confusion. You just have to ask the Governor General yourself and he will tell you that. When the Governor General has travelled in Asia and in other places around the world they are unsure what his actual status is because he is not really our head of state. He is doing a great job as Governor General. He is an outstanding Australian and I have the utmost regard for his work and the opportunities that he has advanced for Australia in his work as Governor General, but he is not there in his own right. He is there as the Queen's representative. So that is the first question to be answered by the opposition. I will be interested also to hear from our newly independent member, the member for Moore, as to whether or not he has more courage than the rest of his former coalition colleagues and whether he is prepared to stand up in this chamber and make the clear statement that he believes that an Australian should be our head of state. That is the challenge that the member for Moore has to answer, and that is the challenge for all members of the coalition, his former colleagues, who treated him in such a dastardly way by dumping him for preselection. It will be interesting to see whether he has the courage now as an independent member of this parliament to be truly independent and to say, 'Yes, I agree an Australian should be our head of state.' The Leader of the Opposition has attempted to confuse the question by pulling the stunt which he pulled out of the former opposition leader's bag of tricks called a people's convention. He is saying, 'We will have this people's convention and that will be the most democratic way that we can determine the process of reforming our constitution.' Let us look at the question of the people's convention because the member for Stirling was raving on that this will be the will of the people; that this will be an expression of the views of the people. I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker, but 400 members out of a population of 18 million does not to me represent necessarily the will of the people any more than this parliament represents the will of the people. This parliament is a far more democratic process for representation of the will of the people than the people's convention will be because the Leader of the Opposition intends to appoint half the members of the people's convention, whereas all the members in the House of Representatives and the Senate are elected by the people of Australia each three years, or each six years for the senators. So they actually do truly represent the will of the people. We are here to express the views on behalf of our constituents in our electorates. The parliament is the appropriate place to have the debate about what form the referenthat has dum should take and whether or not we should move forward with constitutional reform. The reason we had to have people's conventions in the 1890s was that we did not have a national parliament. We did not have a properly constituted national body representing the will of the people to go through the process of debating a constitution. It did not exist. That is what the people's convention was about-creating those structures and forms to enable the democratic will of the people to be expressed continuously over the next few centuries. We do not need a people's convention. We certainly do not need a people's convention which is half appointed by the member for Bennelong, should he become Prime Minister. That would not represent the democratic will of the people. The process would be just as exclusive as the one used to select the parliament, but it would be much less democratic because half the members of the people's convention would be appointed. The people will have ample opportunityand I hope they will partake of all the opportunities over the next few years-to participate in the debate on this question. This is about Keating's republic, as the obsessionists-Ied by the member for Stirling-try to make out. Opposition members are absolutely obsessed with one man rather than with talking about the issue. They constantly attempt to move away from the real issues that are under consideration. No amount of name calling or grand description of the Prime Minister in those colourful phrases that the member for Stirling uses is going to hide the fact that the question of the republic is the issue that we are on about-the question of whether or not we want an Australian as our head of state to take us forward into the 20th century as a truly independent nation. That is the issue the people of Australia will be talking about. We will give them that opportunity through a referendum, which is the most democratic way the will of the people can be expressed. Our constitution makes it very clear that we need a majority of Australians to express that view. It is not going to be decided by a very narrow result-such as 50 per cent plus onebecause our constitution says that we need a majority of people in a majority of states to have a successful referendum. That ensures that, to decide a referendum question, a clear majority of all Australians needs to make the same decision. I have yet to have anybody tell me why we need this people's convention. I believe that it is just a delaying tactic and an avoidance mechanism by the Leader of the Opposition, because he refuses to come clean to the people of Australia and tell us what he actually represents. There has also been some considerable public discussion about the recommendation in the Prime Minister's statement on the republic that the president should be elected by the parliament, not by a direct election involving all the people of Australia. Some people have confused the issue by saying, 'Why should politicians pick one of their own or one of their mates to be the president? We the people want to make the decision.' On the other hand, they are saying, 'We certainly do not want a politician as our president. We want somebody who is a great leader, somenot body who attracts widespread support across the whole spectrum of society.' We on this side of the House definitely want that. We do not want to go through the process of having a political campaign to select the president, but that is what we will have if we have direct elections. If we had a popular election, we would have an enormously expensive campaign, with candidates barnstorming around the country in an effort to be elected president. I can assure you that, if we have a popularly elected president, the Labor Party would put up a candidate, the National Party would probably put up a candidate, the Liberal Party would want to put tip a candidate, so too that would the Greens and the Democrats. We would have five, six or eight candidates running around the country spending tens of millions of dollars bombarding people in their newspapers and on their televisions, saying, 'Please elect me for president.' Having that type of campaign would be the most divisive way we could ever select a president. If we were to go down that path, it would totally undermine the fundamental structure of our parliamentary system of government. It would be totally anathema to the Westminster system that we have in this parliamentwhich says that the parliament is paramount, the Prime Minister and the government ace accountable to the parliament, and the parliament, through the election process, represents the will of the people. If we have a fully publicly elected president, who has his or her own mandate, barnstorming the country saying, 'If I'm president, I will do this and this,' we will have a divisive campaign with people having to choose between whatever party's candidate they want for president. Once we have elected a president, we will have this individual with a mandate he or she has gained through that popular election. The Prime Minister and the government in the two chambers of the parliament will have their own mandate because they would have been elected at a different time. There would be massive confusion and conflict between those two institutions. That is not the way the Westminster system of government operates. If we were to have a popularly elected president, it wOlIld totally change the political structures of the national government of neighbours Australia. That is why we do not want to have a popularly elected president. We want to retain for the role of president role as we have for Governor General-that is, a formal role as head of state having· the reserve powers that our constitution puts in place, and the conventions which are put in place, which determine that the president has the role to administer the legislative program and to supervise the operations of the parliavast ment but does not have his or her own manretain date.

49,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I am pleased to speak. in this debate in response to the statement on the the model for an Australian republic by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is vital that this side of the House inject some common sense and perspective into this discussion about the future of Australia's constitution. It is equally important that the debate is not hijacked by those, such as the Prime Minister, who are pushing the republic for their own selfish, political objeche tives. We must not lose sight of the real issues and how well the existing constitution has served us up until now. The overwhelming issue is what system of government will best deliver a united, stable and tolerant Australian nation. It is also about what constitutional billion. arrangements Australians feel most comfortable with. We on this side of the House recognise that attitudes in the Australian community are changing, and that attitudes towards the constitutional monarchy are different from those which existed 30 or 40 years ago. change is to occur, it is important that it occurs in a united, not a divided, fashion. It is essential that if the Australian people reject change the issue is not allowed to fester and to detract from the matters that should really concern this nation such as the economy, our standard of living and the future opportunities for the next generation of Australians. It is also important that any change occurs for the right reasons. In this context, many of the arguments put forward by the Prime Minister do not pass the credibility test. The suggestion that our Asian are less likely to respect us, or to even trade with us, because of our constitutional system, demeans our trading partners the same and the Prime Minister. The problem is that the Prime Minister suffers from constitutional cringe. That is his problem, not the nation's problem. Similarly, the Prime Minister is mistaken, or just downright disingenuous, when he implies that the majority of, Australians who want to the monarchy do so because they want to retain constitutional ties with Britain. This demonstrates that the Prime Minister has no understanding of the role the monarchy has played in Australia's constitutional system and its traditions. Many generations of Australians have respected and cherished the role that the constitutional monarch has played in their daily lives and those of their ancestors. This has provided a role model for the Australian nation. If the Prime Minister is really concerned, as pretends, about Australia's independence, he would do something about our critical balance of payments situation. There are many people who believe that, no matter what our constitutional set-up, Australia cannot see itself as truly independent if it continues to labour under its enormous level of foreign debt, which is currently in excess of $160 We also have the outrageous situation where the Australian democracy continues to be overridden by international treaties, which automatically become part of Australian law and have been used in that manner. This is a far greater threat to our independence than the If Australian constitutional monarchy, which has, in fact, helped to guarantee the freedoms that we take for granted. The Prime Minister is also wrong in criticism of the origins of the constitution. July 1993, in his speech to commemorate centenary of the Corowa conference, the Prime Minister described the constitution as 'complex, legalistic and virtually impossible to relate to contemporary Australian life'. This is simply not true. The Australian constifor tution continues to provide the nation with effective system of governance-a system the Australian people are remarkably reluctant to tamper with. If there are problems, they result from inability of politicians to agree on solutions problems such as the imbalance in revenue raising and spending powers and on where specific functions should lie. The Prime Minister went on to say that the constitution 'was framed as a routine piece of 19th ry British imperial legislation' . In July he told a group of school children that the constitution was designed by the British foreign office to look over the Australian government's shoulder. The Prime Minister not even averse to misleading school children on this issue. What he told them is untrue. I can do no better than to refer to the opinion of Ms Anne Twomey; the author of the Parliamentary Research Service publicathis tion The constitution:· 19th century colonial office document or a people's constitution? In this publication she wrote: While the Colonial Office did exert some influence on the Constitution, it is still the case that almost could all the Constitution was written in Australia, Australians and for Australia. We have learnt to expect no better from the Prime Minister. His knowledge of Australian history has proven time and time again to be parliament. defective. Have we ever heard him say that the constitution has served us well? I chalthat lenge those on the other side of the House tell us when he has said that the constitution has served us well. I do not think they could find a single instance when he has said that. Has the constitution ever failed to deliver us stable government, a safe democracy for all and a cohesive federation of states? The main test for a constitutional system is whether it promotes democracy. The AustralAct Ian system passes this test with flying colours. states. his We have witnessed 95 years of freedom, In political stability, cohesion and tolerance that the other countries envy. A nation should not tamper lightly with this remarkable heritage. It is tragic that the Prime Minister has tried to use the republican debate his own political purposes. Only he could an turn a constitutional debate into a point that scoring exercise. The Prime Minister has misled the Australian people about the difficulties inherent in moving to a republican system. According to him, this momentous the step can be taken by changing a few words into the constitution. This is simply not the case. Eminent constitutional lawyers of the calibre of Sir Robert Garran, H. B. Higgins, Professor Geoffrey Sawer and Professor Colin centuHoward have raised grave doubts about 1994, whether a referendum under section 128 of the constitution can create a republic. The constitution is itself clause 9 of an imperial enactment, the Commonwealth of Australia is Constitution Act 1900. While clause 9-that is, the constitution-can be amended by referendum, the other clauses in this act, which envisage the continuation of the monarchy, may not be amenable to amendment in manner. This includes the preamble to the act, which refers to the agreement of the people of the various colonies to unite in one indissoluble federal Commonwealth under the Crown. In the past, these covering clauses probably have been amended by an act by of the United Kingdom parliament. However, quite properly, this possibility was removed with the passage of the Australia Act in 1986 by the United Kingdom and the federal . The effect of this legislation appears to be all state parliaments will be required to to agree with any proposal for a republic. The difficulties of securing this agreement should not be overestimated. Another issue is the possibility that some states might choose to retain their monarchies. Each state has a separate crown, legislature and judiciary. Each state constitution is preserved by section 106 of the Australian constitution. The Australia preserves the monarchical system of the Some state constitutions have provlSlons designed to make changing them very difficult. For example, Victoria requires an absolute majority in both Houses, Queensland requires a referendum, and Western Australia requires both of these. Under the Prime Minister's preferred model, it is up to each state to decide how it would appoint its head of state. The prospect that Australia might end up a federal republic with one or more of the states continuing links with the monarchy is not an outcome that would be in the overall interest of the Australian nation. Nevertheless, it is one that the Prime Minister appears comfortable with. The Prime Minister has underestimated all of these obstacles to change. He has also taken for granted that, if we were to have a republic, Australians would support his preferred option of parliamentary election of a President. On this, like so many matters relating to the republic, his position is badly flawed. In the latest poll, 74 per cent of Australians support popular election of a head of state, while only 16 per cent support the Keating model. Those Australians who are assessing for themselves the merit of Australia moving to a new constitutional framework are affronted at the shallowness and insincerity of many of the Prime Minister's arguments. Quite obviously, much of his rhetoric about the reasons for change are just wrong. The coalition does, however, recognise that many Australians are attracted to the idea of a republic-most of them not for the reasons put forward by the Prime Minister. To enable the issue to be addressed by the people for the people, the coalition in government will establish a people's constitutional convention. If a consensus emerges from the convention, that consensus will be promoted by the government at a referendum. If no consensus emerges, the Australian people will be asked to vote on a series of options for constitutionthe al change to establish which of them they desire. These options will include electing the president by popular vote or by parliamentary vote, or any other method of election that emerges from the discussion process. The option of retaining the present system would be included in any vote. The Prime Minister's first priority in pushing the republican cause is to cement his place in history. However, the partisan and ingenuous way in which he has handled this issue will only cement his reputation as the most divisive Prime Minister in this nation's history. If the Prime Minister were really interested in fostering a national consensus on the question of the republic, he would immediately stop tampering with the symbols of our current system of government. Many of these, while the Labor Party has been in power, have been fiddled with to the direct detriment of this nation. I am pleased to make a contribution to the statement by the Prime Minister on a republic. There is a great deal more I would like to say about the issue. Time prevents me from doing that. I am interested to hear, though, the comments of a former minister of the Crown, the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who is going to follow me in this debate. Having been a former minister under the Crown, I am sure he will be an independent arbiter of the worth of the Prime Minister's statement. I hope he is. I look forward to his comments on this subject.",43
50,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Like the member who preceded me in this debate, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in a debate which will be one of the very significant rungs in the development of Australia's nationhood. At the end of the first century of the six colonies which made up what became known as Australia, those six colonies decided that the time, 1 January 1901, was appropriate for them to join together as the Commonwealth of Australia. In the process of Australia developing its national character, its nationhood, Australia continued as a constitutional monarchy with head of state the Queen of England. Subsequently, as a result of legislative changes, the Queen was identified as also being the Queen of Australia. I believe the response on the part of the Australian people is such that there is overwhelming support for the proposition that we use the tum of the next century as a symbolic occasion to add further to the national character of the Australian Commonwealth and determine firmly that Australia, like the overwhelming majority of countries of the world, will have one of its own as its head of state. Let me emphasise that, whatever else might be said about this question, there is one core issue which must be addressed and which must be answered. It is central. It is fundamental. That question is this: is Australia sufficiently mature, proud and independent, and does Australia have sufficient sovereignty, self-pride and dignity, to have one of its own as its head of state? Or is Australia to continue, as it has now for over 200 years, as six colonies for the first 110 years, and subsequently as the Commonwealth of Australia, to have as its symbolic head of state a person who belongs to another country? That is the simple question. Members of the opposition have not answered that question. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) did not answer that question. Those opposite continue to avoid the question because they know that the sentiment of the Australian people is such that they believe we are sufficiently proud, we are sufficiently developed, we are sufficiently independent and we do have sufficient self-dignity to say that the Australian head of state should be one of our own. It is simply appalling, to my mind, that anyone could ever possibly assert to the contrary. I repeat the first question. The core question we must answer is: do we want an Australian as Australia's head of state or are we so fawning as to require a person from another country to be the top symbol of Australia as a nation? Once we have answered that question in the only way we can; the next question automatically falls into place. You cannot have an Australian head of state unless you have an Australian republic. It is as simple as that. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) quite correctly said that he and the government would support a minimalist approach. That is the approach we all endorse as well. There would be no fundamental changes in the way in which Australia operates, except that we would have as our symbolic head an Australian. There would be no other fundamental changes. That is the essence of the minimalist approach. The approach which has been suggested by the opposition would create fundamental, far-reaching and very significant changes in the way in which our parliamentary system operates. This point was made by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who spoke earlier for the government. When we refer to that minimalist approach, we mean that the simple change that would be enacted would be that the Governor General, in effect renamed a president, would replace the monarch as Australia's head of state. The Commonwealth of Australia would continue to be the Commonwealth of Australia. It would not even be renamed the Australian Republic. The powers and responsibilities of the head of state would remain exactly the same as they are at the present time. There is not even any intention on the part of the government to seek a codification of the reserve powers of the Governor General. It has been indicated that that attempt will not be made. That is an approach I endorse absolutely because of the intractable problem of codifying those powers--of defining them, of clarifying them, of making exactly clear how and in what circumstances they are to be used. There will be no change in the powers. I emphasise a point which has not always been made. Let us be perfectly clear about it. At the present time, the Governor General is appointed by the Prime Minister-full stop. The Prime Minister has that single exclusive right, that single exclusive power and authority, to nominate to the monarch the person who will be Governor General in Australia. What has the Prime Minister proposed? He has proposed that, instead of one person in Australia appointing what the opposition chooses to call our head of state, the Governor General, the election of a president will require a two-thirds vote of the combined numbers of the House of Representatives and the Senate-people who are elected by Australian electors to represent them. That is the essence of the Prime Minister's proposal. Obviously, the position is not, as has been suggested, that the power to appoint a president is being grabbed by politicians. In fact, the opportunity for the elected representatives of the people to participate in deciding who that head of state should be is being broadened to require election by two-thirds of the combined numbers of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The 148 members of this chamber and the 76 members of the Senate would sit together, with at least two-thirds of them being required to vote in support of who was to be president. It is obvious that, if we are to have two-thirds of the combined numbers of the national parliament determining who the head of state should be, there would need to be discussions, negotiations and agreement between the opposition and the government. If we have agreement, we have a bipartisan decision-and we would not have a political figure becoming the president of Australia. I know that the opposition would not approve of Gough Whitlam, nor would we approve of Malcolm Fraser. But we might approve of a Ninian Stephen, a Zelman Cowen, a Lois O'Donoghue or a Dick Smith. The head of state would be bipartisan. But if the proposal of the opposition were adopted, we would have a vote over the whole of Australia by 11 million people. In those circumstances-and let us be perfectly clear about this-the Labor Party will nominate its political candidate, the Liberal Party will nominate its political candidate, the National Party will nominate its political candidate, as will the Democrats, as will the Greens, as will any of those very rich AustralOpposition ians who could afford to finance their own individual campaigns. But I will tell you what: there will not be a Ninian Stephen or a Zelman Cowan among them, because neither of those two gentlemen would ever have access to the funds that would be necessary to fund a political election campaign across the whole of Australia. But we will nominate our political candidate-let us be perfectly clear about it-and the person who is elected will be a political president. That is precisely what we do not want. What about the authority of a political president, a person who is elected by 11 million Australians? What if we were to say to that person, 'Look, we want you to do for Australia what the Queen does for England and what the Governor General has been doing for Australia; we want you to be a symbolic figurehead.' That president would say, 'Hey now, listen, you just hold on a minute. I've been elected by 11 million Australians. The Prime Minister has been elected by his colleagues within the parliament and by a maximum of 80,000 people within his own electorate.' The president would say to the Prime Minister, 'My mandate is a national mandate; yours is a single electoral mandate. Don't you tell me that I have no powers. My authority rests with the nation.' Perhaps the president would say to Mr Keating, ' Mr Keating, your authority rests with the electors of Blaxland; my authority, Mr Keating, rests with the nation.' If we want a fundamental change in the way in which this system of government operates, we would adopt the absurd and dangerous proposals that have been. put forward by the opposition. Quite apart from the fact that they are dangerous, they are not genuine. What have those proposals been? First of all, the Leader of the Opposition said that they would have a people's convention in order to determine the nature of a possible future republic. But he said that he would appoint 50 per cent of that people's convention and that the other 50 per cent would be elected. I am not real smart at mathematics, but I know arithmetic. If the Leader of the cannot control a convention when he appoints 50 per cent and another 50 per cent is elected, he is not even trying. He also said that, once that convention considers all of the issues, if there is consensus, if there is general agreement, that a republic should be established, he would be prepared to pursue that. He was asked, 'What does that mean-51 per cent of the people in the convention?' He said, 'No, that is not enough.' When asked how many was enough, he replied, 'Oh, at least 60 per cent.' So he would appoint 50 per cent of the convention and the other 50 per cent of the convention would be elected. He would control it absolutely-and he still says, 'Unless there is 60 per cent supporting the proposition for a referendum, we would not proceed with it.' He was then asked, 'If the convention cannot come to a consensus about a republic, what will you do?' and he replied, 'We will have a referendum.' When asked what the questions would be, he said, 'We will give the people multiple-choice questions.' Mr Bruce Scott-That is democracy.",45
51,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"A democracy! You will get a sheet of paper as long as this building with all the multiple-choice questions and you will have to fill in the boxes. Someone said it is a pick-a-box system of determining our system of government. The Leader of the Opposition said about his proposed convention: . . . it can examine a number of issues. It can examine the role of the head Ian constitution, including implications of change for the role of the states. It can examine the allocation of legislative and executive powers and functions between federal and state governments, including areas of overlap and duplication. It can examine the use of the external affairs power of the constitution. It can examine the question of whether we should introduce four-year instead of three-year terms for the federal parliament. It can examine the basis on which new states, in particular the Northern Territory, would be admitted to the federation. It can examine any other matters which the convention members would themselves determine. That is a deliberate, appallingly cynical and fraudulent proposal because he knows as well as everyone else that such a convention would get bogged down. I do not have time to go into all of the quotes supporting my claim, including one from Zelman Cowen, who is not a member of the Labor Party, but a former great Governor General. The Leader of the Opposition's proposal for a convention is obviously a sham. (Time expired)",48
52,Mr FILING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to speak on the republic statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Before I make any comments on his statement, I make a couple of observations about some public comments that have been made about two of our existing vice-regal representatives-the Governor General, the Hon. Bill Hayden, and the Governor of Western Australia, Major General Michael Jeffery. It seems a little amusing that the very same people who leapt to Bill Hayden's defence and said that Bill Hayden ought to be able to speak out on issues on which he feels strongly-I agree with that, although I heartily disagree with his comments about homosexual adoptions and euthanasia-have been very critical of the Governor of Western Australia, Michael Jeffery, for making comments of his own. I must say in order to be consistent that I agree with some of the things that Michael Jeffery says and disagree with others. I make the point that I agree with the sentiment that governors-general and governors ought to be able to make observations and public comments so long as they do not bring their offices into disrepute. I would like to defend the rights of both gentlemen to make those of state in the Australstatements. May I make a couple of observations about the so-called republican debate. Republicanism in its latin usage means the public thing. In the final analysis, there is not a great deal of difference or, for that matter, a great deal of effect being proposed by either side in the republican debate, because the real nub of the dilemma facing Australians in their political system in the 1990s is the domination of the parliament of the people by the executive. It is my view that all of the issues that have been raised in the republican debate-the consequences, et cetera--ought to be put back within the confines of that important debate; that is, the struggle of the Australian people to become sovereign again in their own nation. Quite clearly, as we have seen the development of the Australian model of the Westminster system, we have seen, particularly over more recent years, the extraordinary domination of the political system by the executive, to such an extent that the Prime Minister or the state premiers have all the powers to rival medieval princes in their standing vis-a-vis the parliament and other facets of our political democratic system. It is important to bring the whole debate baok into that context, because not to do so is to betray the interests of the very people to which we are referring-the Australian people-and their rights, responsibilities and duties as Australian citizens. It is also important to reflect that many of Australia's instituexecutive tions are already essentially republican instituia tions. The debate revolves around the question of whether the head of a state should be a constitutional monarch-in our case, the Queen of Australia and her vice-regal representative, the Governor General. In the final analysis, will the change that being proposed by the Prime Minister in his statement make a great deal of difference to the power and, I suppose, the rights of the people of Australia? I would say, 'No, it would make very little difference.' I see the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) nodding-in fact, the Prime Minister conceded that this is a minimalist difference. The people of Australia are not going to get much out of this at all because, in essence, there will be no change to the essential relationship between executive power and the people of Australia. In other words, the people of Australia will continue to become more and more oppressed in that relationship to such an extent-as we know within this particular chamber-that, as much as we care to debate about the issues of the day affecting our nation, at the end of the day the real decisions are made in executive cabinet. The decisions can be made at the whim of the Prime Minister who enjoys the majority of support within that cabinet room. That makes debate in this chamber less and less relevant to the decision making process. By making parliament-the House of Representatives and the Senate-less and less relevant to the decision making process, it is progressively withdrawing the power and the authority of the people of Australia. The people of Australia have been referred to in this particular debate but, unfortunately, only in an abstract way. In a way, their relationship with executive power is less definable but, at the conclusion of the Prime Minister's proposal, it is probably no different from the situation in which they find themselves right at this moment. I am indebted to Professor Patrick O'Brien from the University of Western Australia for his observations on these matters. I point out that the best illustration about the abuse of power occurred in Western Australduring the 1980s. Professor O'Brien wrote: It is now clear that former Premier Brian Burke and his cabinet established almost complete control over parliament, over wide sections of the economy, and over the public purse. Nearly a billion dollars of taxpayers' funds were lost on extraordinary and mainly secret business deals involving is donors to the Labor Party. Parliament was never infonned of the truth; decisions were made on the run and in concert with conclaves of favoured business people at late-night meetings in private offices and homes; cabinet documents were altered; crucial departmental files either disappeared or were shredded. And that is not all. Secret funds donated by grateful entrepreneurs were used to make large WA contributions to Labor federal election campaigns; in the '80s, federal Labor out-advertised and outcampaigned the coalition at every election. Secret funds were also used to invest tens of thousands of dollars in stamps, gold and property. Burke and several of his ministerial colleagues spent the money solely at their own discretion, and acts of parliament were changed to give ministers power over the boards of all government agencies In theory, parliament is supposed to be master and the executive the servant. The system no longer works that way, and hasn't for a long time. In reality, premiers and their cabinets-not to mention prime ministers and theirs-now fonn a sort of ""elective dictatorship,"" with vast, and often unchecked powers. When it comes down to it, much of the talk about the consequences of the changes proposed by the Prime Minister and, for that matter, the responses from the opposition have not addressed the significant problem, the dilemma facing the Australian people: how to restore their sovereignty; how to get back people's power in the Australian democratic system; and how to restore the power of the people in particular to this body, the parliament of Australia. As I mentioned earlier, if you look at the relationship now between the people, the parliament and the executive, it is quite clear that the executive is the master while the parliament and the people are its servants. I would also like to highlight some of the irrelevancies that have occurred in the republican debate-in particular, the so-called sentiment of the Prime Minister that somehow by Australia's becoming a republic, or his talking about it, people will take him more seriously. I ask honourable members: at a time when one of the oldest republics in the modem political world-the republic of France-is thumbing its nose at the views of Australia and treating Australia in a very offhand and dismissive manner, did President Chirac for one minute consider the proposal by the Prime Minister and allow that to alter his point of view? Of course not. It made no difference whatsoever, and neither will it. Much of the talk about somehow increasing Australia's standing by becoming a republic is not only irrelevant but also ludicrous. That sort of talk is patently absurd, particularly when the Prime Minister talks about improving our standing in Asia when we know that many of our surrounding nations have monarchs as their heads of state. I suppose they must look in wonder and bewilderment when the Prime Minister uses overseas trips in order to publicly criticise Australia's institutionsin countries which may well respect the institutions he is dismissing as irrelevant or out of date. Changes need to be made to our system to make it a more democratic and responsive system. At this stage, I wholeheartedly support the proposal by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) for a people's convention. But this ought not to be merely a people's convention to determine who ought to be the head of state. This must be a people's convention to look at the fundamental ways in which we can make the Australian people more powerful in their own political system. We must look at relationships of the parliament, the executive, the balance of power, checks and balances and also political parties. As we know, political parties were not mentioned in the Australian constitution when it was written. However, in the evolution of the Australian parliamentary system since the constitution, we have seen the political party system become more and more entrenched within our political processes. There are some advantages to that-and· I have no doubts about that-but there are some substantial disadvantages. We have seen them in the context of the Western Australian Labor Party and the WA Inc. years. We saw how the political process, entrenched and dominated by the executive, fed and nurtured by the political party system, was able to give the Burke and successive governments unfettered executive power at the expense of the people. There is also a fundamental responsibility on the part of the great political parties of this nation to ensure that their processes are democratic, constitutional and relevant to the people. If that unfettered power is going to be given to political parties-and I must say· that I want to see that change-then, in order for the system to be democratic and relevant to people's interests, the political parties must also make themselves democratic and relevant to people's interests. We need to look at political parties in recent years. I have already mentioned the WA Labor Party. I could also mention the New South Wales Labor Party and some of its excesses in the early part of the 1980s. Mr Bilney-What about the Western Australian Liberal Party?",48
53,Mr FILING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I would also like to mention the Western Australian Liberal Party-a subject dear to my heart-because recent history of the Western Australian Liberal Party has shown conclusively that it is undemocratic, irrelevant and thoroughly in need of reform. The people's interests lay in having political parties that are democratic, constitutionally run-not illegally run-'-and in a way that allows full participation in the policy making process and, in particular, the most relevant to the processes of parliament, in the selection of candidates. It is my view that the sooner we get to a system of a plebiscite of members of parties in order to be able to determine candidates the better. I believe that system is the most democratic and the closest to the people. I am a constitutional monarchist. I am a person who believes our system has worked very well to the extent-I qualify this-of the development of the Westminster system. In overall terms, looking at the large picture, the Westminster system has provided Australia with it stable, democratic, essentially decent and civilised society. That is a good thing. Winston Churchill once spoke of the British system. He said that it was the worse system in the world apart from all others. That was a very telling description. It means there are a number of faults and a number of things need to be changed but, at the end of the day, it is a system that outranks and beats most of its competition around the world. Before I conclude, I want to make a few comments in relation to the Prime Minister's proposal. I might also add some matters relating to the people's convention. It is critical that we reform the abuse of executive power and, through that, the use of the external treaties provisions of the constitution to change legislation in Australia without recourse to the people. We need to thoroughly overhaul the relationship between the executive, parliament and the judiciary to make this a system that more closely resembles the checks and balances that are useful in the United States system. I am not advocating a total movement to that sort of system, but that system would allow for a check and balance between the various components in our system. The system between the executive and the parliament obviously needs to be looked at, in particular the way in which we select ministers from the body of members of parliament. That means that those members who might have very strong views about the relationship between the executive and the parliament may well have those views subsumed on their way to becoming members of the cabinet or the shadow executive because of course they then become committed to the executive. At the end of the day if there is to be a proposal for the election of an Australian president, the list of candidates ought to be prepared by the Australian parliament with a two-thirds majority. There ought to be strict qualifications on those entitled to be on that list. Candidates ought to be over the age Of 40 years and not have been an MP for the last five years, and there ought to be no participation by political parties in a national election to elect a president. Partisan activities in the election should be restricted or prohibited by law and public funding should be allowed to ensure all those candidates are able to run for election in a fair and equitable manner. (Time expired)",50
54,Mr HOLLIS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"This has been an interesting debate, and I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution. To say that I support the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of 7 June that Australia's head of state should be an Australian and that Australia should become a republic by the year 2001 is somewhat of an understatement. I overwhelmingly endorse it. For me, it is the realisation of a dream I have always had. From an early age I could never understand our system of having a foreigner as our head of state. I have always believed that not only should Australia be a republic but we should have an Australian as our head of state. Anti-republic people always think that being pro-republic is in some way being antiBritish. That is certainly not so in my case. I lived for 12 years in the United Kingdom. I went to university there and, dare I say it, some of my closest friends are British. Indeed, I am a frequent visitor to Britainalthough, I must say, to enter Britain now I must go through the gate marked 'aliens'. So much for those Australians who want to enter their so-called motherland. Being pro-republic does not equate to being anti-British. So much of our culture, our heritage and even our traditions in this place stem from the Westminster system. Those traditions will always remain. It angers me somewhat that those opposed to a republic somehow question one's loyalty. No-one has a monopoly on loyalty. I have never been a flag-waving person who constantly talks about loyalty to Australia or anywhere else. That does not mean that I am not loyal. I just do not parade it all the time. I have always been very suspicious of those who find the constant need to wrap themselves in a flag and go on and on about their loyalty. Why are they so unsure about their loyalty that they have to constantly talk about it? Those who would choose a foreigner, however charming, gracious and kind, to be our head of state must have a problem regarding their own royalty because, try as they might, Mrs Betty Windsor is not Australian. Not by birth is she Australian, and, to my knowledge, she has never been naturalised. She does not reside here. The final irony is that she is now paying British taxes. She does not even pay Australian taxes; she pays British taxes. So Mrs Betty Windsor is a British citizen and a British taxpayer and in no way could it be claimed that she is an Australian. When the Queen goes abroad for holidays or on a bit of a sales promotion tour, it is Australian goods and services that she is promoting, but British goods and services. I have absolutely no argument with this but I wish people could accept that she and her wayward children are not Australian and do not represent the hopes and the aspirations of Australians. Show anyone in Finland, Chile, China, Japan or any other place a photograph of Mrs Betty Windsor and ask: 'Who is this lady?' and the immediate reaction will not be, 'She is the Queen of Australia.' I suspect the immediate reaction will be: 'She is the Queen of England' or, to be more precise, 'She is the Queen of Great Britain.' The point is that noone abroad and few in Australia except older Australians belonging to National Party branches and, I guess, the CWA represent her as the Queen of Australia. It is time that Australia and Australians believed in themselves, in their own identity and had an Australian as their head of state. Since the Prime Minister presented the government's preferred option to the parliament, the old campaign has been waged by the defenders in this place of the constitutional monarchy. We have all been told that life as we know it, our society, our system of government, our institutions, will all somehow be completely uprooted and changed. Australia's constitution, our system of government and our institutions will change very little because the government has preferred a minimum of constitutional change. The government on 28 April 1993 established a people's advisory committee to prepare an options paper which would set the minimum changes required to create a repub-. lic. Since that committee reported to the government, the republic has been widely debated and discussed in the media, in this place, in schools, in universities and in various community groups. All Australians are being exposed to this debate. In the process many Australians believe that the time is right for Australia to become a republic. Importantly too, many Australians believe that Australia becoming a republic is inevitable. Like most honourable members, I have met not and talked with hundreds of people about this issue. I have heard, read and talked with many Australians who are totally opposed to Australia becoming a republic. I have asked each of them: 'What possible reason do you have as an Australian to oppose a fellow Australian holding the position as this country's head of state?' I have never received a satisfactory answer to this question. I do not believe that I ever will receive it because no fair-minded Australian can oppose a fellow Australian occupying this country's most important position. Today, if we were charged with the brief, as the founding fathers were almost a century ago, of establishing this country's constitutional arrangements, there would be no thought of having as Australia's head of state someone who resides in another land 12,000 miles from our own. We would not give a second thought to ensuring that, Australia's head of state would be an Australian. So what is the difference now? In proposing that our head of state should be an Australian, the government is proposing nothing more than the obvious. At the moment, under the constitution, the Queen is Australia's head of state, and her heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom. Any fair-minded Australian should shake in anger at these words. They are not appropriate, they are not representative and in my view they are offensive. It is often said that the thing the Americans pride themselves on most is that anyone can hold the most important position in that land; anyone of them can become President of the United States, the head of state of the United States. Why should Australians not pride themselves on the very same thing? Why should it not be possible for an Australian citizen to hold pride of place in Australia's highest national office? The simple fact is that it is not possible because of words: 'Australia's head of state is the Queen and her heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.' These words should be changed, and I believe they will be when the Australian people vote in the referendum in either 1998 or 1999. The changes announced by the Prime Minister show that Australia is ready to complete a historical cycle. A century ago the founding fathers put together a collection of colonies to make up one nation. Throughout this century, Australia evolved from a collection of British colonies. We became a single nation with somewhat limited independence. From there, we became a dominion in the British Empire and, finally, we became a sovereign nation in all circumstances, except that we allow another country's head of state to also be our head of state. I am old enough to remember the debates when the Governor General ceased to be a representative of the British government in Australia and became a representative of the British monarch only. I can well remember the debates about the abolition of all remaining rights of appeal to the Privy Council in London. It was only in 1986, with the introduction of the Australia Act, that Australian courts became the final arbiters on Australian law. With the passage of this act, the British parliament finally relented the last of its powers to make laws applying to Australia. I can also remember when it was suggested that an Australian occupy the position of Governor General. The debate was almost ridiculous-just as this debate about whether or not we should become a republic is. All of these issues caused some kind of controversy. They were peddled by those who still long for the return of the empire, by those who say that an Australian republic would be the end of the world as we know it. That is the same kind of scare campaign that the opposition is running around with now. Twenty years down the track, people are wondering what is happening now. I remember the debate about whether an Australian was fit to become Governor General. People were saying, 'We should have some minor, illegitimate lord from Britain as our head of these state.' Twenty years from now, people will look back on these debates and laugh. They will roll about with laughter at the ridiculousness of us wasting the time of the Australian parliament and the community with all this nonsensical debate about something which will be inevitable anyway. It really is inevitable that Australia will become a. republic with an Australian as our head of state-as it should be and as it should have been a long time ago. As I said earlier, the changes the government seeks are minimal. The essential constitutional conventions, principles and practices will remain untouched and in operation. I suspect that, under a republic, this place will operate much as it operates today. The only difference perhaps will be that Mrs Betty Windsor's photographs about the place will be removed and replaced with photographs of the new Australian head of state. I believe that the role of this chamber and the Senate will remain largely unchanged. Australia will be a republic and continue to be a member of the British Commonwealth of nations. The only area we seek to change is the wording of the constitution. We would change 'Governor General' to 'President of the Commonwealth of Australia', ensuring that the person who holds this office is an Australian citizen. This president will perform much the same duties as the Governor General. As happens now, these duties will be carried out on the advice of the government of the day. The president will perform ceremonial duties around Australia and represent Australia abroad. The president will also retain those few powers now held by the Governor General which may be exercised without, or contrary to, ministerial advice. The so-called 'reserve powers' - the power to appoint the Prime Minister and the power to dismiss the Prime Minister and the government-will remain untouched. There has been some argument about why we in the Labor Party should support this. We support the fact that those reserve powers are there, because we realise that it would be in only the most extreme of circumstances-as it was in 1975 when they were illegally used-that those powers would be used. There is some debate about how the head of state should be elected. I favour election by parliament, but I can see merit on both sides. I can see the merit of the president being elected by the people like, say, the Irish President and the French President, and I can see the merit of the president being elected by the parliament. So I am not going to the wall over this one. But I do think that, if we are going to have a non-political person in that office, it is inevitable that he or she be elected by the parliament, because once there is a campaign, as we saw in the recent French election campaign, the president becomes a very political person-and it is a political act electing that person. We as members of parliament are elected by the people. I think that a president who is elected by the parliament would be elected with the agreement of both sides of the parliament. As with the appointment of governors-general, it takes that political aspect away from the role of the president. If we want people in that position who command the respect of the majority of the population, I believe that it is only by having them chosen by a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting of the two chambers that we will get that. We, the members of parliament, are elected by the people and in that way we would be representing the people. I cannot for the life of me see how a constitutional convention of 200 elected people and 200 appointed people can be seen to be reflective of the Australian point of view. The 200 appointed people would obviously be reflective of whoever appoints them. The real difficulty that the opposition has in this whole debate is that fundamentally it does not believe that an Australian should be this country's head of state. I know there is some division there, but in the main its problem is that it does not believe in an Australian occupying that position. Australia is making its way in this complex world.

55,Mrs BISHOP,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Mackellar) (1.02 p.m.)The question of an Australian republic is not something that is new on the agenda. It has been around since the time that Federation itself was considered. It has been to date a concept which has been rejected on a basis of argument that has been both logical and . sensible. From my own point of view, I have always asked two questions of those who would bring about change to achieve the end that they desire. The first is: what is the nature of the change that those people who propose it wish to have? The second is: how will that make Australia a better place? From my own perspective, I have heard no sensible answer to the second question, and only recently have we heard from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) an answer to the first. Having heard his answer to the first, I am still of the opinion that our present system serves us very well. But, if we are to have a debate-and I am never one to run from a debate; I am always anxious to take part-I think we have to have a fulsome debate and look at what flows from the possibility of change. I do not have a crystal ball, I have never pretended to have a crystal ball, so I do not know what may happen in the future and I do not know what event may act as a catalyst for change. I do know that at the present time we have not got one, and when you bring about change in a vacuum you usually get it wrong. If you bring about change when there is a catalyst, you can usually see the direction that you ought to follow. Had we lost World War II and not been the victors, we would be operating under a very different system indeed. We would not be the constitutional monarchy that we are today which ensures freedom of speech for individuals, which ensures the right to achieve maximum potential and enables us to conduct ourselves as a truly multicultural society where the contribution of every individual is acknowledged and important. I have not seen any riQts in the streets by people saying, 'We haye to:bring about change to our constitution because, we are. not free.' I have heard the arguments put forward in a manner that reflects, I think, prejudice of a different sort, perhaps in the manner of one of the speeches we might have heard earlier this day. The proposal that has come forward starts from a premise which is fundamentally flawed. The opening premise is that a very small change-a minimalist change-can be made and nothing else will change. The system will continue to function as it is. That is a flawed proposition. It will be argued that there can be an election by the parliament: that is, a collegiate election of a head of state and that this person somehow remains above the political process. Nonsense. Once that person is elected-it does not matter whether the election is by collegiate system, as in the United States of America where the president is elected by a college of votes, or whether the head of state is elected by the people in a plebiscite-the bottom line is that the head of state is an elected person, and an elected person always has a mandate. Under our current system, appointment by Her Majesty the Queen is the method by which we select a head of state who is truly above politics. Very simply, the Prime Minister of the day selects an individual and makes a recommendation to the Queen. That nomination may be rejected-convention has it that it is not-and the appointment is duly made. Bill Hayden, when he was appointed to the position, acted up until that moment entirely as a political person. After he was appointed to the position he has behaved, as have all governors-general, in an apolitical way and has carried out the responsibilities in a non-political way. The other day, when the Governor General chose to speak his mind on a number of subjects, his remarks were of interest for people to read, but they had no political clout because he is a man without a mandate. Had the same person been an elected president and made that speech, it would become politically relevant. The difference is quite substantial. To' say that there can be a minimalist change and that all things will continue on as they are is like saying that you can be a little bit pregnant. You cannot-things flow from the change. If the time comes that there is ever to be an elected president, my view is that the people should do the electing. That is the view that the rest of Australia seems to have-if the polls are any guide. Although I do recall that in 1988 we were faced with a referendum to change the constitution and in the opinion polls, about 80 per cent of people said, 'Yes, this change is excellent and we must have it,' but once we got into the detail of it and what it was really entailing not one single state passed the referendums. It is important that we look at the detail and what is really involved. Let us suppose that the people had their way. If there were to be a change and a president were to be elected by the people, what would flow from that? Currently, we operate under what we call the Westminster system, although I suggest that under the current government we do not. Under this government we see instances where ministers who have been found wanting and in error have refused to resign until they are virtually forced from office-for example, Mrs Kelly over sports rorts or Graham Richardson over the infamous Marshall Islands affair. There have been many instances where people have not behaved in accordance with the Westminster principle. Under the Westminster principle we should have an apolitical Public Service; that is, a public service which merely serves the government of the day to the best of its ability with the best research and effort that is possible. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case either. Although there are first-class, splendid public servants who wish to perform in that way, through the influence of the current government we have public servants in senior positions who are very political in the way they behave. So we look at what is an alternative to Ii Westminster system should we have an elected president. One model we can look at is the congressional system in the United States. There it has a true doctrine of the separation of powers, not as we have here. Here, although we have the judiciary separate from the legislature and the executive, we do not separate the executive and the legislature. Our ministers come from the legislative body, in this chamber and across the way, but under the congressional system, where there is a true doctrine of the separation of powers in operation, the executive comes by way· of appointment by the president from people outside the elected congress. It may well be that, if we were to move to an elected presidential system, the people of Australia may also consider that to move to an appointed executive outside the elected membership may be a better way to proceed. It is often heard in debate from people who criticise the calibre of the ministers-and anyone who sees this chamber on B-day when the B-team is in can see it-that there is a lot lacking. The point is this: if we are to embrace the thought of change and have a true debate, we need a forum where it can be held honestly. This is not the place for that debate because here, under our Westminster system-altered and perhaps corrupted as it is-we still have the system where the Prime Minister, the person who says he has a majority in the House to support the passage of the appropriation bills through both houses of parliament, is given a commission to form a government by the head of state, the Governor General, Bill Hayden; and he looked pretty Australian to me last time. I took a look. That government then consists of the people chosen by the Prime Minister, the man to whom the commission is given. He currently selects about 30 people to become members of the Executive Council. Those people and those people alone form the government. The Labor Party backbenchers are no more members of government than I am. Their responsibility is the same as mine; that is, to provide laws which are for the peace, order and good government of the people of Australia. Their positioning on the right-hand side of the Speaker's chair is merely to indicate that they are giving support to the government to ensure the passage of its legislation and particularly the appropriation bills-the granting of supply. We saw in 1975 that it is the Governor General who is the head of state in this country, who holds the reserve powers, who has the power to sack the government of the day, which simply means he or she withdraws the commission that has been given because that government can no longer carry out its undertaking to ensure the passage of supply. So that is the way the system works. But, if we are to have the change to the president, we could see the situation where the president of the day has been elected by two-thirds of the parliament, as the Prime Minister would wish, and he sends his legislation up to the head of state and the head of state says, 'Veto.' The Prime Minister says, 'You can't do that to me.' 'Yes, I can,' says the president, 'just watch me. Now get two-thirds of the parliament to sack me.' It might be a piece of legislation like the new 12 per cent wholesale sales tax with regard to building materials that might be chosen to be vetoed, and two-thirds of the parliament might think that is a jolly good idea. There are lots of questions that have to be addressed. There are lots of queries and uncertainties that need to be debated, and the place to have that is in a people's forum, because in this place it is only the government of the day that can introduce the bill for the referendum. It is only the government which would have input into what goes into that bill and it would be a take it or leave it scenario. But, if you have a people's convention, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has proposed and given an undertaking to have, the people who are not truly represented in their view, as they see it, will have a say. The government of the day has said it will only offer a president who is elected by the parliament, and the people of Australia have shown that they do not want that, and it is only the government of the day which will have a say as to what goes into that bill that brings about the referendum. However, under our system, there is even a fail-safe mechanism. There is the people's convention, and then there is a plebiscite. The plebiscite would have the following options: elected by the parliament, elected by the people, status quo, et cetera. So a whole range of things could come out of that. Depending on the outcome of that plebiscite, the referendum would then be formulated. It would not be formulated by the government of the day. It would not be formulated by the now Prime Minister saying; 'I, me, myself, personally, Paul Keating, am going to dictate that that is the choice you will be given,' but by the option being given to hundreds of Australians to have the opportunity to take part in the discussion process. I have always said that, once we got into the detail, the nature of the debate on the republic would change dramatically, and it has. We are now looking at the detail in earnest. We are looking at the ramifications. We are looking at what we want-from now and forever more-as our system of governance. The government has answered the first question by putting up a proposal. It is one which I reject. The opposition offers a more acceptable alternative. The second question-how it makes Australia a better place-remains to be answered by those who say they want to bring about the change as manifested in the Prime Minister's greater wish. As we debate this, we know that the option is one of choice. The government offers none. The option is to take what the Prime Minister of the day wishes it to be or to allow the people of Australia to have a say in what happens to their constitution. The bottom line is that the constitution of Australia belongs to the Australian people. It does not belong to the Prime Minister or to the government of the day. It is not their plaything.

56,Mr CLEELAND,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,MCEwen) (1.17 p.m.)The honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) should know that no-one suggests that the Australian constitution is anything the property of the Australian people. For any person in this House to suggest that any member of this House has a different view is an outrageous lie. It is simply not true.,57
57,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Mr Andrew)I think the honourable member for MCEwen should,57
58,Mr CLEELAND,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"If it offends the House, then I withdraw the expression 'lie' and I will say that it is an 'untruth'.",57
59,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I would be grateful.,57
60,Mr CLEELAND,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I withdraw 'outrageous lie' and say 'outrageous untruth', which is within the forms of the House. It is an untruth. It is a nonsense to suggest that a constitution of the type that Australia has is anything but the property of the people. It is the same as suggesting that this parliament is owned by the politicians who inhabit it. It is not. It is a product of the will of the Australian people. I reject the nonsense spoken by some members on the other side of the House. The honourable member for Mackellar has, like other members of the opposition, put up this furphy that the Governor General is the head of state of Australia. It is an absolute nonsense. Either they do not understand what the Australian constitution is or they have not read it. The Australian constitution is, in fact, a bill of the British parliament. It clearly defines that the head of state of Australia is the monarch of Great Britain whom, in some strange way, we call the Queen of Australia. However, the reality is that the British monarch is simply that-the British monarch. Queen Elizabeth II is a fine and upright woman. I have met her, and I have nothing but admiration for her. Nevertheless, she is the monarch of Great Britain. By some strange legal reasoning, Australia has decided to adopt her and call her the Queen of Australia. Clearly, the head of state is the British monarch. So no-one in the coalition should try to promote this nonsense that somehow the Governor General is the Australian head of state. The Governor General's role in the Australbut Ian constitution is as a representative of Australia's head of state. The role of the Governor General is to represent the Queen in Australia and to be the representative of Her Majesty in the Executive Council under the formulation and the rules which exist in the Australian constitution. When we have a debate such as this, the lack of understanding in this House on the nature of the Australian constitution is also something that worries me. The constitution is a document which is vacant on most of the important things that matter in running this parliament. For example, most Australians do not understand that there is no such thing as a Prime Minister mentioned in the entire Australian constitution. It is not mentionednot once. It is a convention that there is a Prime Minister. It is not written into our constitution. It is a convention, because we understand that without the conventions operating we would not have a constitution which would work. So the Australian constitution is lacking in almost everything that a modem constitution needs. We are only talking about one part of it-a minor part of it. I must say that, if I my way, I would rewrite the entire constitution, because it is a terribly deficient document. Can you imagine having a constitution which does not recognise the position of Prime Minister? It does not mention the word once in the entire documeqt. It operates only on the basis of what we call conventions. Conventions are simply unwritten rules which people in the political system accept as being proper and reasonable so that the system can in fact run. Without the recognition of the conventions, we would not have a parliament that would work. That is how bad the Australian constitution really is. To some members opposite it is some sacred document written in blood-something magical and special. The fact is, of course, that when it was written it was written in conflict. It was a compromise. It is not a perfect document. It was a compromise between six competing colonies who were not particularly interested in a federation. They wanted to maintain their own separate political identities. There were free traders and protectionists. Again, I do wish some people in this House would actually pick up a book on Australian history and read it. I do wish they would actually learn the background to how the Australian constitution came into existence. The vast bulk of conventions, so-called, were held to draft the Australian constitution were not elected. Only one was elected-the last one. But the conventions that actually drew up the constitution were not elected because, in most locally held referenda, the Australian people did not want to federate. It was the leaders of the day, who understood the great need for Australia to become a great nation, who led the arguments and brought the general feeling of the people with them. That is what needs to be done in changing a constitution. You need leaders. You need all people to stand up and put a proposition to people and say, 'We believe we need change and this is the change we believe we need.' That is called leadership. It might be that the Australian people reject that view. Nevertheless, the fact that it has been brought into the public domain, that it is now a topic which is had being publicly debated, is only because there is a leader-the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It is not the sort of thing we would ever get from the other side of the House. There is never any leadership from that side in terms of change. The Australian constitution was developed by people such as Deakin, despite the general lack of will in the then colonies to federate. We eventually got federation because there were leaders back then who were prepared to carry the people, take some political flak and run the argument. So it is important that the argument be put. It is important that we debate it. It may well be that the end result of change to the Australhm constitution may not be what I necessarily agree with because, ultimately, it will be Australian people who make the decision-not me, not this parliament, not the Prime Minister, but the Australian people. However, it is proper that views are put on what sorts of changes we, collectively or individually, see as necessary. I have probably given more oaths to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors to title than most other Australians. From the cubs, the scouts and the venturers, to the police force, the citizen's military forces and local government, as a justice of the peace and on being admitted as a barrister and solicitor of Victoria and of New South that Wales-I have given oaths to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors to title so. how many times that I have lost count of them. Why? It is because she is the nominal head of state. But, as an Australian, I have always wondered why I am being asked to pledge my loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II of England. She is a nice person. Mr Hollis-Likes dogs.",57
61,Mr CLEELAND,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Likes dogs, corgis. I have got no beef with her. I have been privileged to meet with her on more than one occasion. On the other hand, she is not an Australian citizen; she is a foreigner. That is an unarguable fact. She does not have Australian citizenship. She is a foreigner. I have often wondered when I have taken multiple oaths over the years why I was being asked as an Australian to give an oath of loyalty and allegiance to a British monarch. I am pleased that finally I am getting the chance to say in this parliament that I am an Australian first, an Australian second, an Australian third, and I would like to have an Australian head of state. There is nothing wrong with that. Some people can disagree with it. Some people can say they are happy to have a British citizen as the head of state of Australia. That is an acceptable view if that is what they want. But I am an Australian, and I want an Australian head of state. I do not want to be represented by a foreigner-be that foreigner British, American or whatever. If people want to criticise me for that, let them. If they want to be represented by a foreigner, let them stand up and say that. That is the major issue that has to be first answered: do Australians want an Australian head of state or do Australians want a foreign head of state? We can debate all of these things, but until members of the opposition answer that principal question we will not get to first base because their proposals, quite frankly, avoid the issue. The whole philosophy behind the approach of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) of having a convention of which 50 per cent would be elected and 50 per cent appointed by him-no doubt, as Prime Minister-is to avoid the issue. It is to avoid having to put a question to the people in the first place. It is the way the conservatives of this country want to avoid the debate. It puts it away, puts it aside, and does not solve the issue. Why is there a fear of the debate? Are the conservatives of this country and in this parliament frightened of the debate because they have not got the numbers out there? Is that the reason they would go for this quite nonsensical approach of having 50 per cent appointed by the Leader of the Opposition, no doubt, and 50 per cent elected. We do not know how they are going to be elected or what the franchise would be. We do not know anything about how the other 50 per cent would be elected. We do not know what reference the convention would be given. We do not know what they would be asked to discuss, what the details are of what the convention would be asked to do. Assuming this convention accepted the view that Australia should change to an Australian head of state, we have no guarantee at all from the opposition that it would do it. If the opposition is elected, puts up its convention and, despite having 50 per cent of its members appointed so 'that it can control them, the convention recommends that there be a referendum, a minimalist position, and accepts an Australian as an Australian head of state, there is no guarantee a conservative government would put it to the Australian people. It is a nonsense. What is' their fear? Why are honourable members frightened of asking the Australian people? I frankly do not understand it. I do not understand why anyone in this parliament would be frightened of the Australian people having the choice. The proposition put forward by the Leader of the Opposition denies that choice, takes it away from people and stifles the process. I am totally baffled as to why the opposition is frightened of the Australian people and frightened of why they should not have that choice. I noted that the member for Mackellar was talking about the Public Service in Australia and the apolitical nature she thinks it should have. The implication of what she said is that the Public Service in Australia is politicised. That was the allegation she put to the House in this debate. If there has ever been a politicised body in this country it was wh-n Barwick went to the High Court, as Chief Justice Barwick. When Barwick was the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia the Australian taxation system was totally tom asunder. Under section 260 of the tax act, a very simple section-I would say a five-year-old child could tell you what it meant-tax avoidance was illegal. That is all it said, but somehow or other the Barwick court managed to rule that that did not mean anything. Under Barwick, people of privilege and people of wealth were given the option of paying no tax. Professor Russell clearly demonstrated in a report to this House that, under Barwick and under this apolitical system that the honourable member for Mackellar suggests applies when the opposition is in government, the taxation system was destroyed. Who was the Treasurer who did nothing to stem the rapid outflow of revenue at the time? The now Leader of the Opposition. Let us have none of this nonsense, this waffle, from the member for Mackellar about this government criticising the Public Service. We know full well how it is done because over the years we have seen just how good the opposition is at destroying legislation through its mates getting the jobs. I support an Australian republic; I have long supported an Australian republic. My ancestors came here in 1776; they were British; they married into Irish stock on my father's side. No-one has better credibility this debate, and I support a republic. (Time expired)",59
62,Mr COBB,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The speech of the previous speaker, the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland), was somewhat lacking in credibility when he was starting to presume what the opposition position is. It is quite clear that a people's convention will be called and that it will decide which questions go to a referendum. The Australian people will have the chance to decide whether we remain a monarchy or move to a republic. Nothing could be clearer than that. I find it quite bizarre that we are having this debate in the chamber for most of the day when there are other issues out there that are concerning my constituents more than this. We have a debt in this country, for example, that is greater than Mexico's. It is unbelievable that we have been reduced to that status under this government. A debt· greater than Mexico's is something that we ought to be ashamed of, something that we certainly should be doing something about, and the government will not even allow us to have a question time tomorrow to talk about the current account deficit figures when they come out, let alone have a debate on the debt that this country is carrying, which is now greater than Mexico's. In this country we have public hospital health queue numbers which run to six figures, the federal government has virtually halved federal road funding, and we have three-quarters of a million unemployed. We are just, hopefully, coming out of one of the worse droughts in history arid, while farmers are still being denied a basic, civilised type of welfare system because of a government that could not care less, it seems, about people who are destitute, even though they are people who are contributing to the country, we are here today having a debate on the republic. A debate on the republic will cost the parliament, depending how long it goes, something like $200,000 or $300,000 today alone. I would like to have that money, for example, for three kilometres of bitumen between Bourke and Wanaaring. I am sure in my constituents out there would prefer that. But why are we having this debate? We are having it because the government is using it as a diversionary tactic from the problems, some of which I have just mentioned, that are besetting this country, and apparently because of the apparent paranoia of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about anything that is British. In the 11 years that I have been a member of parliament I have not had one constituent come to my office and request that Australia move toward a republic. I have not had one person telephone me and I have not had one letter on the subject. I do not deny.that there may be people out there who hold this view, which is quite right and proper to have in a democracy, but it is obviously not a burning issue with them. There are 80,000 voters in my electorate and 110,000 constituents when you count those under 18 years-and never in 11 years has anyone approached me on this particular matter. They certainly are not tossing and turning in their sleep about this issue; I can assure the government of that. Despite that, this government is going ahead with the proposal. The referendum alone is going to cost about $50 million. doubt literature will go out to every hold in Australia putting the for and against case beforehand and that will cost several million dollars more. We have a debt worse than Mexico's debt and yet these are the sorts of things being proposed. Why are the Australian people not demandbehind ing that this happen in the same way as the government is demanding it happen? The that reasons are that they have other problems which they give a higher priority to and that they are relatively happy with the system that we have in this country. We have a stable system of government that is envied by the rest of the world. We live in a very free country, a very tolerant, multicultural country. We have a system that has delivered a very high standard of living. It is a country that has allowed us to express the unique AustralParkes Ian characteristic that this continent has bestowed on all of us. We are even a member of the Commonseem wealth of Nations and it is interesting to note that 22 out of the 51 members are still monarchies; the others are republics. It is a little ironic to me because I have always felt that in a sense Australia really is a republic. know we call it a monarchy but to all intents and purposes, given the way the system works in this country, we already are a republic. not know what the percentage would be but Australia would be very close to 99 per cent a republic anyhow. We have only got this little bit tacked on the end, this one per cent, this monarchy bit tacked on the end, and it totally harmless. It gives the Queen no tive power whatsoever over the running of this country. If the Queen had some power to the time. direct us how to conduct the laws of this nation or our daily lives, I too would be arguing that that link be cut. But the Queen has no power whatsoever to direct us in how we conduct our business in this country. Even if she did, while we might listen we would look not respond. Concerning this little bit tacked on the end, the poms pay for it anyhow. It is not as though it is a cost to us, for heaven's sake. They pay for it. It seems to me that we are getting the best of both worlds. We have the No best of both systems. We have the best of a houserepublican system-which essentially we the are-and the best of a monarchical system because of this little bit tacked on the end. I can cast my mind back to the experiences that I have had. Two or three years ago the Queen came to Dubbo. I was walking a step her for most of the day during the activities and I was staggered at the welcome the people on the footpaths gave her and the emotion they showed. It amazed me. A year or so ago, Prince Charles had some dreadful difficulties in his private life. At that time, he visited Parkes and Forbes for a day. I was curious to see how the public would react to him after all the adverse publicity he had received. However, it did not seem to make any difference. There were crowds the size of which had never been seen before in and Forbes, and those people were all willing to wish Prince Charles well. I thought, 'This costs us nothing. The public seem to love it. Why deny them the pleasure they to get from this sort of thing?' In the mid-1980s, when I had been a member of the House for a short time, I attended a peace conference in Bulgaria. In those days I Bulgaria was probably the most repressive communist country in the world. It is a wonderful country and, fortunately, that I do system has now gone. I had never been to a communist country before, and apart from the stark, colourless concrete buildings and streets everywhere, and the people with blank looks on their faces, the thing that horrified me the is most was that on the buildings were enormous effecphotos of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Todor Zhikov, who was the president of Bulgaria at The monarchy had been banished in Bulgaria. It had been made illegal. Religion had also been outlawed. It dawned on me for the first time in my life that the average man and woman in the street likes to have someone to up to. It can be argued that it is illogical. It is illogical, but the average man and woman in the street likes to look up to someone. If the monarchy is banished and religion is banished, all that is left is the politicians. What could be more unhealthy than to have people looking up to politicians in that way? I found it quite repulsive. The system we have in Australia-even though I have said that it is essentially a republican one already-allows us, because of this little bit we have tacked onto the end, to avoid the worse elements of a republic that exist in many other countries. Those elements are ugly, costly and colourless, even in the world's great countries. I have recently returned from looking at the political system in America. When I was visiting the White House, President Clinton drove past. I was standing on the footpath with hundreds of people when he drove past. Some women standing in front of me were almost swooning because the President had driven past. Yet he is an elected representative. It was not an edifying spectacle. It is wrong that elected representatives should be looked up to in that way. It is best to have non-elected representatives fill those positions. It needs to be asked, if we have a republic-and to be frank, I do not lose any sleep over it one way or the other-what will it give us? I dare say it will give a warm inner glow to those on the other side of the chamber. If that is something that they cherish, then good luck to them, but it is not going to affect my life much one way or the other. It is no guarantee that things are going to get better. Let us examine republics around the world. One that we would have admired-France-is letting off nuclear explosions. Germany does not have a system that I admire. I would not like to transplant America's system here, having just had a look at it. The system in other republics-such as Russia or Ethiopiais not for me. The system we have today, with this little bit tacked on, reflects our history. I do not want to deny our history. I am proud of it. The system of justice in this country emanates from Great Britain. The system of democracy that we have in Australia, which I think is the finest in the world, comes from Great Britain. The system of education in this country, which we cherish so much, comes from that part of the world. The language that we speak also comes from that part of the world. This country has the best systems in the world. Yet the government says that we have to become mature, take that final step and totally cut the links with Great Britain. I can see some logic to that argument. But it is a little like a child leaving home who refuses to have his or her parents come and visit once in while, or to let them have any influence whatsoever, even of a symbolic type. I think it is a sign of maturity, not a sign of immaturity, that we still have this. It adds colour to our lives. I just gave the example of the socialist republic of Bulgaria, which was totally colourless in the mid-1980s. If we want to take away the system that we have got now, well and good, but I think we will be at least a little diminished by it. There will be significant changes, even down to the trivial things. I just looked at my local telephone directory, which is mainly based on Dubbo, and found there were 24 royal prefixes in the telephone book. In the Sydney phone book, there were 189. I see that Senator MCMullan, in a press release of some time ago, said: It is inappropriate for national organisations to be seeking to add themselves to the list of those with royal titles. This is the sort of directive, no doubt, that will be emanating more rapidly from the government when we do become a republic. Is it such a crime that we call a yacht club 'The Royal Yacht Club', or a blind society 'The Royal Blind Society'? What are we are going to change the name of the flying doctor service to? Will we call it the 'Republic Flying Doctor Service', instead of the 'Royal Flying Doctor Service', so we can keep the same initials and not add the cost of changing the emblem? Mr O'Keefe-What's wrong with calling it the 'Australian Flying Doctor Service'? What is wrong with you people, for heaven's sake?",60
63,Mr COBB,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"There is nothing wrong with calling it 'Australian'. If the people, of their own free will and volition, choose to call it that, what is wrong with that, in a democracy? What is wrong with that? To be frank with you, it does not trouble me much, one way or another. But here is the government giving directives that one must not call the flying doctor service the 'Royal Flying Doctor Service'. I think it is a farcical stage that we have reduced ourselves to. What is next? Are we going to change the name of Queensland, for obvious reasons, or change the name of Victoria because it resembles 'Queen Victoria'? Presumably, New South Wales will be next, because it resembles somewhere in Wales. Where do we end with this? Is the Prime Minister embarrassed when he is overseas, because we have a so called queen as head of state? Is he going to be embarrassed to go into a pub to have a beer because it is called the Royal Hotel? Is that what the government has next in line for us? What a farce. One wonders where it will all stop. The solution that the government has put up is the Tippex solution: we will cross out 'governor-general' and write in 'president'. It is much more complicated than that. I am sorry I do not have time to elaborate on those arguments. (Time expired)",62
64,Mr LATHAM,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Werriwa) (1.47 p.m) My first memory of the monarchy comes from 1 May 1970, when, as a nine-year-old student at Ashcroft Primary School, I lined the street to watch Princess Anne pass by on her way to opening the Green Valley Community Centre. I was there because the school had made it compulsory. For me, it was a curiosity. For a schoolboy standing on the streets of working-class Green Valley, nothing could have been more curious than the idea that we were, in any way, associated with a familythe royal family-founded on the worse traditions of social hierarchy, elitism and class distinction. For a schoolboy born in Australia, knowing nothing of Britain other than from school books, nothing could be more foreign than the idea that we were in some way affiliated to Britain. For Australians of my generation, without memories of or emotions for Britain, Australian independence is a natural feeling. That is what makes the Republic so inevitable: the natural feeling of Australian independence. This is what makes this debate, and the historic statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), so compelling. There is something special about feeling proud of one's country. In most respects, national pride is at the heart of this debate. To feel proud of Australia-to feel strongly about this country-is to want Australia to be strong. We are stronger when we stand on our own two feet, when we do things our way and when we express ourselves in an independent way. Let there be no doubt-we would be stronger; as a people and as a nation, if the Australian head of state were an Australian citizen. Indeed, the move to the republic is part of Australia's growing maturity, and part of our passage from adolescence to adulthood as a nation. If I can continue the analogy further, the formulation of the Australian constitution from the 1890s led to Australia's birth as a federated nation in 1901. In this debate it is very important to get a feel and appreciation for the national mood and the politics of that era, now 100 years ago. Australia had, as its earliest and strongest emotion-this goes back as far as 1788-the need for protection, the need to shelter the colony, as it was at that time, from what was regarded as a vulnerable place in the world. It is not surprising, if we consider how insecure those early Australians would have been at the thought of being part of a penal colony. Two hundred years ago Australia was a convict colony at the bottom of the world, isolated from what, at that time, was the homeland in Europe. As a result of those feelings of insecurity at the very first time of white settlement in Australia, this feeling of protection was woven into our culture, our institutions and our system of government. The sense of insecurity and the need for protection was given expression through tariff protection, the attempt to shelter Australian markets from overseas goods. It was expressed through the White Australia policy which enjoyed bipartisan political support for so long, giving expression to the feeling that we needed to lock out people from other races and other nations, particularly in Asia. The sense of insecurity was expressed through our foreign policy: our reliance on the protection of, firstly, the Royal Navy and, during and after the Second World War, the United States of America. It was also expressed through the cultural cringe: the feeling that the only worthwhile items of culture and expression could come from Britain. Robert Hughes, in his outstanding book, The Fatal Shore, captures the mood so well: The idea that whether or not England should feel ashamed of creating the [convict] system, Australians certainly had cause to be proud of surviving it and creating their own values despite it, was rarely heard. In Australia at that time, and indeed for more than a century, Britain was seen as the only source of social respectability. Again, according to Hughes: Nothing could be allowed to diminish the gratitude Australians were meant to feel for the imperial umbrella. The essence of colonisation was that they could claim no history of their own . . . educators played their part, with the result that it became impossible to find in any history book in any Australian schools up to the mid-1960s, a satisfactory or even coherent account of penal Australia. In this respect, British trade, British arts, British literature, British symbols, British institutions and, most of all, the British monarchy, were used by Australians for so many decades of our early history as part of the search for respectability. For the tories of that time-and for the tories of this time-it was all about touching the hem of the British monarchy, that feeling of cultural insecurity and cultural cringe, and the search for what was regard as social respectability. The popular culture of those years of course reinforced the view of the British as a superior race of people. The royal family stood at the pinnacle of that system. The republic is about breaking the cultural cringe for all time. It is about recognising, for all time, that Australia should assume in all aspects of our social and cultural fabric the responsibilities of an independent and mature nation. The cultural cringe extended far beyond the realm of the arts. For so many years, it made the country wary of assuming proper responsibili ties. But we have broken free and matured and picked up responsibilities in so many areas. We show confidence in the way we have internationalised our economy; we no longer feel insecure about pursuing a place in the world economy. We have matured and picked up responsibilities through an independent defence and foreign policy. We have picked up responsibilities through transport and communication improvements which have integrated Australia as a nation. We have picked up responsibility in culture, in the arts and letters, with a distinctive and . a very proud sense of Australian cultural identity. We have picked up our proper responsibilities towards Aboriginal people with the historic decision of the High Court and the legislation of this parliament for native title. The republic and constitutional change in the 1990s' is about topping up that process, breaking the cringe for all time. In our constitutional arrangements we should exercise the proper responsibilities of a mature, independent nation by making an Australian our head of state. Breaking the cringe says something about Australia's identity and our sense of worth. The republic in many respects should be seen as a celebration of the Australian achievement. Far from cringing, we should be telegraphing it and informing the world that we are very proud of what we have achieved in this nation, to settle a harsh country and build economic prosperity. To do it within a tolerant, progressive, egalitarian society is one of the great achievements of the Western world, and constitutional independence can top it off. Constitutional independence would be the full expression of nationhood and the ultimate celebration of the great Australia achievement. The Economist magazine said it well in June of last year: Only colonies continue to borrow the monarchies of other lands. I would urge the Liberal and National party representatives in this house to take a look acr?ss the Tasman, where a small trading natIon at the bottom of the South Pacific, led - n that instance by a conservative government, IS breaking free of the colonial mentality. Jim Bolger, the New Zealand Prime Minister, is trying to advance the cause of a New Zealand republic. Let me quote Bolger: I see it as completing the journey from colony to nationhood. New Zealand is in similar circumstances to Australia in the broad sweep of history. Its Prime Minister, a conservative Prime So, - inister, sees the republic as completing the Journey from colony to nationhood. As it in New Zealand, it should be in Australia. More than that, the republic represents great opportunity to rectify some of the problems with the constitutional monarchy. the end of the day, in a modem, liberal, Bill 1953: progressive, egalitarian society, the monarchy can be regarded, and I think broadly is reThe - arded, throughout Australia as unrepresentatIve and undemocratic. There across the nation to filling public offices in a fashion which relies on inheritance. It is contrary to the belief that all people are born equal in status, dignity and opportunity. rules of succession for the monarchy as we have them in Australia discriminate on the basis of religion, sex and birth. Section 116 of the Australia constitution prohibits the imposition of any religious test as a qualificaAustralian tion for any office under the Commonwealth, yet our head of state, the British monarch also serves as the head of the Church. Further, our own Sex Discrimination Act would render the rules of succession unlawful in Australia, because they discriminate activea ly for men and discriminate against women. Fo- - ustralians interested in social equality, relIgIOUS tolerance and equal opportunity between the sexes, the monarchy has become an unrepresentative, unsuitable, divisive institution in our society. It has been used in the past to show that Australians were of British stock. That is clearly no longer the case. The monarchy is perhaps well suited a class ridden society like Britain, but it totally unsuited to Australia's egalitarian traditions. Francis Adams in his Australian Essays put it best as long ago as 1886: The people. in Australia breathe free. They do not feel the weIght of the great divisions of the middle class that is above them, the well-to-do and the gentlemen. Working men here do not go slouching down the streets, as they do in England, crushed under - e sense of their inferiority ... This is a true republIc, the truest, as I take it, in the world. In England the average man feels that he is inferior: in America he feels that he is superior: in Australia he feels that he is equal. That is indeed delightful. if we have had in our social status, in our social fabric, this feeling of republic egalitaris ianism, it should be fully confirmed now in the 1990s in Australia's constitutional arrangements. For once, on this matter I can a a-ree with the founder of the Liberal Party, SIr Robert Menzies. He said in the second At reading speech on the Royal Style and Titles plain truth is that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second sits on the throne not because of some law of Australia but because of the law of the is an objection United Kingdom. Menzies thought that was acceptable because he regarded himself as British, as of British The stock. But now, when Australians no longer regard themselves in that fashion, it is no longer suitable for the Australian head of state to be determined by British law. The Australian head of state should be one of us. The head of state should be determined by Australians under Australian laws passed by this parliament and confirmed at a constiAnglica- tutional referendum. The truth of the matter is 'that an Australian citizen, under the current arrangements, can never be the Australian head of state. That is decisive breach, an unacceptable breach, of Australian sovereignty and independence. It is interesting to note that Prince Charles himself acknowledged as much in June last year when he said that, as an heir and successor, he would rather be seen as a defender of faith than a defender of 'the faith'. That is, he acknowledged that all citizens are equally important irrespective of religion. It is divisto ive for the monarchy to be associated with is just one form and one expression of faith. Prince Charles also said that it is absurd the monarch should be prevented from marrying a Catholic. So if Prince Charles believes the monarchy, as presently structured, does not represent all Britons, how can it represent all Australians? Prince Charles is saying that the head of state in Britain must be representative of British society. In Australia, surely that means the head of state must be an Australian. A republic is a state in which sovereignty is derived from people, not from inheritance, and in which all public offices are filled by persons ultimately deriving their authority from the people. The only Australian office incompatible with a republic is the monarchy, and the only change required to overcome that shortcoming is to remove the monarchy from our constitution. When the Queen visits Australia she is seen more as the Queen of Britain than the Queen of Australia, otherwise she serves as an absentee head of state. When the Queen visits other nations, she is seen as the Queen of Britain .. Australia does not have a head of state who can represent this nation overseas and be seen by foreign citizens as our head of state, as an Australian. That, in their eyes, makes Australia look like a colony. Some of the comments of the British head of state when she travels overseas could potentially contradict Australian foreign policy and trade interests. The truth is this: not only is the monarchy unrepresentative and undemocratic by the standards of the 1990s but also the royal family itself is discredited. I noticed in the Australian newspaper earlier this month that the British Scout Association has decided to disaffiliate itself from Prince Charles, saying, 'It will be hard for some people to promise'that is, to swear-'their allegiance of duty to an adulterer.' What a telltale sign-that the British monarchy in the 1990s cannot sustain the support of the British Scout Association. For the monarchy as an institution, particularly in this country, it is five minutes to midnight. Time is up for the monarchy. It is time for Australia to express itself as a mature, independent, egalitarian and progressive nation. It is time we had an Australian as our head of state. We need to make sure that our head of state is one of us.",63
65,Mr VAILE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is an interesting debate that has been taking place today with regard to the speech made on an Australian republic by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The state of play between the political parties involved, as far as that goes, is the main area I want to address in speaking on this matter this afternoon. At this stage, it has predominantly been a political debate. It is far too important an issue to contemplate it being controlled by politics. Mr Latham interjecting",66
66,Mr VAILE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"It is. You have had your go. We should be empowering the people of Australia to participate in the whole process of developing the models if we are going to go down this path. The government of today will present to the people of Australia the option that they vote either yes or no on how to go about this, how to develop it, how to structure this move. As has been indicated in the polls, the majority of people in Australia do not agree with that system either. The government should be very cognisant of that fact. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), served a fairly lengthy time in local government, where people demand a say. I also have a background in local government. He was probably elected to the mayoral position, which he held before he came into this place, by popular vote as well. It is the absolute basis of the democratic process of Australia. You cannot devolve the power any lower than to give all the people a say in who leads them or in what happens in the country. It is interesting to note that the government speakers in this debate today have been running the line that the Prime Minister has been running-that is, we want an Australian as our head of state. That is an interesting argument when the occupant of the position of Governor General has, since 1965, always been an Australian. That is the political angle that the government is trying to put on this debate. It is trying to generate a bit more antiBritish emotion. Earlier this year I had the opportunity to visit the United Kingdom with a group of young Australian people from the Labor Party, the National Party, the Liberal Party and the Democrats. When talking to different people throughout the United Kingdom, the one dominant question was: is the government's push or the notion of moving towards a republic in Australia purely born out of a hate for the British? That is the feeling that they are getting in the United Kingdom. We had to dispel that myth and point out that it is not born out of a hate for the British. We pointed out that, unfortunately, that is the line the Prime Minister of Australia is running. We have heard this line from some of the government speakers in this debate. There are a lot of people in Australia who believe that we should be moving towards a republic, but who do not hold the same views as the government. Some people hold the view that maybe Australia has reached the stage where it is going through puberty blues or a change in identity and therefore it is time to revisit the issues. It is really the people Australia who should be having an input. It should not be the 148 representatives in this parliament who make a decision and make this into a political debate between now and when the Prime Minister decides he wants to hold his referendum and ask the people of Australia whether or not they are prepared to accept his option. The coalition's position is that the people of Australia should be involved in this discussion from the beginning. We believe that they should be involved all the way through. The people of Australia should make the decision when we have the constitutional referendum before the tum of the century. What is wrong with giving the people of Australia a decent dose of democracy? It is about time that a few more people around this placeparticularly those on the government siderecognised that we do live in a democratic society and that we should be giving the people of Australia a dose of democracy in relation to this issue. What are the positions at this point? The government has declared that Australia should become a republic by the year 2001. It keeps running the line that the head of state should be an Australian. The opposition says that since 1965 the Governor General, as the Australian head of state, has been an Australian. The key proposal advanced by the government in terms of the establishment of a federal republic is the election of a federal president. It says that the president should be an Australian and elected by a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting of both houses of parliament on the nomination of the Prime Minister and cabinet. The government also believes that the question of Australia becoming a republic should be put to the people in 1998 or 1999. What is the coalition's position? The coalition proposes the establishment of a people's convention in 1997 which would examine not just whether or not Australia should become a republic but other important issues as well. One of the issues is the role of the head of state in the Australian constitution. Another issue is the implications of a change in the role of the states. There is an underlying of complication in this debate which relates to the states. The conundrum could arise where the Commonwealth as a whole wants to head down a certain path but one of the states does not. Other issues that should be addressed at a people's convention are the allocation of legislative and executive powers and functions between federal and state governments, including areas of overlap and duplication; whether we should introduce four-year instead of three-year terms of parliament; and the basis on which new states, in particular the Northern Territory, would be admitted to the federation. Other matters which the people's convention would determine itself would also be discussed. The people's convention would consist of 50 per cent of members who have been appointed by the government of the day, 10 per cent of whom would be between the ages of 18 and 25, and 50 per cent of members who have been elected. The arguments for a people's convention, as put forward by the coalition, include enabling a range of community views to enable proper examination, gauging the mood for change in the Australian community, and providing a forum which unifies rather than divides the community. As I said earlier, we need to devolve power to the lowest possible level and empower the people of Australia with the ability to participate in the development of this debate from start to finish. This provides a forum which unifies rather than divides the community. The Prime Minister says that you are either for the republic or you are against it. He says, 'Either you stand over there or you stand over here with me.' That is not unifying this nation. If that is what the republican debate today is all about, I do not believe it is going down the right path. We should allow the people of Australia to decide the questions and the options for the referendum. We should involve all Australian people at the beginning, the middle and the end of the process. This would create a unifying position for the people of Australia. We should have a broader group of people than the government of the day deciding the arguments for and against, putting the propositions for and against, and developing the questions to be asked in the constitutional referendum. The crux of this whole issue relates to how much say and how much democracy the government is prepared to give the people of Australia. By 'say' I am not just referring to what is written in the newspapers; I am referring to constructive criticism about this whole debate and the direction we are heading in. The current constitutional arrangements have served Australia well, delivering great stability, cohesion and tolerance. Those points cannot be undermined or debated by the government. Australia is one of the most stable countries in the world today, and this is because of our constitutional arrangements. The Prime Minister's comments about an Australian head of state are an attempt to imply that anyone who opposes a republic is a lesser Australian. The reality is that, over the past 30 years, the Governor General has become Australia's constitutional head of state. That position has been occupied by an Australian since 1965. It is unthinkable that anyone but an Australian would occupy that position in the future. Despite the success of the present constitution, many Australians are attracted to the idea of a republic. The coalition believes that the matter should be fully debated and that ultimately a vote should be taken on the issue before the tum of the century. In government, the coalition will in 1997 establish a people's convention to debate the whole issue. Other matters will be discussed at the people's convention. However, the issue of Australia's head of state will be debated first and separate from all other issues. If a consensus emerges from the people's convention regarding the head of state, that consensus will be promoted by the government at a constitutional referendum. If no consensus emerges, then the Australian people will be asked to vote on a series of options for changes to establish which of them they desire. These options for change will include that of electing the president by direct popular vote as well as by a parliamentary vote as proposed by the Prime Minister. Another method of election could also emerge as an option from the whole process of discussion. Naturally, the option of retaining the present system would be included in any vote. The fact is that the government, particularly the Prime Minister, is facing a bit of a problem at the moment. As has been indicated in some of the polls that have been conducted since the speeches of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) on this issue, the level of support around Australia for a republic is about 50 per cent. Yet there has been another interesting element to the poll; that is, the question of how we arrive at that position, whether directly via the Prime Minister's approachcome and vote on my development for a republic, on how I want to have it-or via the Leader of the Opposition's process of a people's convention, having a broader base of discussion and debate. It is interesting that 38 per cent supported the approach of holding a people's convention to discuss constitutional reform compared with 36 per cent support for the Keating republican blueprint. What does that tell you? That tells you that, although there is a view across the nation-as yet not a majority view-that Australia should head down the republican path, the people of Australia want to have more involvement in the early stages of the debate. They do not want to be just dished up with a yes or no answer, whether you have this type of republic and we will select or elect the president this way or the head of state this way. They want to be involved in formulating the arguments on both sides of that debate. They want to be involved from the start, through the middle and towards the finish of that debate. I think it flies in the face of everything we stand for in this place as members of this federal parliament, as representatives of the people of Australia, to deny the people of Australia that democratic right in what could possibly be, and arguably will be if we do end up at a constitutional referendum, the most enormous change that we are going to make to the way this country runs, to the constitution of this country, since Federation. I do not believe that the government has the right to deny the people of Australia from having that broader input into that debate in developing those questions. The challenge is there. The cards are quite clearly on the table. On the one hand, there is the proposal by the government of the day, the Prime Minister's blueprint for a republic, to push towards a constitutional referendum in the latter part of this century. On the other hand, there is the very clear position of the coalition-that in 1997 we head for a people's convention so that we can devolve the debate, devolve the power, and empower the people of Australia to have a much broader input into the development of the arguments for and against the question, and the development of the debate, as to whether we should go towards a republic, whether the head of state should be selected and elected by a two-thirds majority of this parliament, or whether the head of state should be elected by everybody in Australia. The people of Australia have the right to have that decent dose of democracy dished up to them, so they can have input in this debate from the start, through the middle as well as at the end.",66
67,Ms CRAWFORD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Forde-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development) (2.18 p.m.)-I start with the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating): ... we are all Australians. We share a continent. We share a past, a present and a future. And our Head of State should be one of us. We have heard much in this discussion about a republic, and it seems that some people feel the very fabric of Australian society is being challenged. Let me say to you that surely the issue of an Australian head of state does go to the heart of the Australian government. It that is surely an issue about equality. We need to look at the role of the constitutional monarchy and ask ourselves: who is a monarch? Where do monarchs come from? What gives them authority to rule? What gives them authority to rule is an accident of birth. I think most of us now would recognise that there are values and attitudes within the British monarchy that most of us as Australians would not wish to emulate, nor would we wish to espouse. When we look to our own nation as an Australian we see the kinds of things that make us Australian. At the heart of it is the issue of equality. At the heart of it is the right-more importantly, the obligation-of all Australian citizens to exercise their democratic right to vote. There is no question of a notion of birth, of where one comes from or of who one is. It simply states that as Australians, as citizens of this nation, we have equality before the law and in the role of this government. It is interesting to hear members of the opposition talk about the notion of stability which comes from a constitutional monarchy. I suggest to members of the opposition that one of the great things that leads to stability within the Australian democratic process is the fact that we all participate, that there is a role for each and every one of us. Contrary to very many other industrialised nations in which small groups of people who happen to be better educated, happen to have more money or happen to be able to buy votes are the people who rule, all Australians vote and we in this parliament represent our electors. In fact, once that election has taken place, we then represent all of those people who reside within that area. I say to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), who was talking about doses of democracy, that he should run his own discussions on the constitutional monarchy, that he should represent the kinds of views he believes are abroad in his electorate. I suggest that he will find more than half the people with whom he mixes are enamoured of the idea of an Australian head of state and an Australian republic. We have also heard comments by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) on this notion of a people's convention. The coalition is the same lot of people who say, 'Get government off our backs' and 'Don't have government interfere.' Suddenly the role of a people's convention, to which it appoints 50 per cent of the people, is now some sacred cow. It is an extraordinary claim that a people's convention to which it appoints half the delegates will be the forum for open and free discussion. What a lot of nonsense. If we are talking realistically about the notion of a head of state being elected by two-thirds of both houses of this parliament, we can say almost categorically that that person will not be from the field of politics. If, however, we are to have a universally elected head of state, we can absolutely and categorically expect that that person will be either party political or extraordinarily rich. We will be looking at someone who has to gamer the votes of 8,000, 9,000 or 10,000 Australians and who needs the wherewithal and the financial capital to do that. If that person is not a member of one of the two major political parties, which have the structures within our community to do that, that person will have to be a media owner or some other person who is extremely rich. We have seen what has happened in places like Italy where this universally elected president has, by definition, to be somebody who is extraordinarily rich. Look at the American President. He is someone who needs to be extraordinarily rich or have rich and powerful friends. The election by two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the Senate means that the president will not be a member of either of the major political parties. This person will be chosen in a bipartisan manner. The potential president will also be somebody who is looked upon in the light of the checks and balances which operate within this community and within this parliamentary process. It will also be somebody who then gets his or her that power from the elected members of the parliament. The Australian citizens as a whole, who elect all of us here, then have their representation and can move the issue along. This notion of a people's convention is particularly extraordinary. Firstly I draw people back to the 1890s conventions which were proponents of change. They were concerned with only one question: how to create, from separate Australian colonies, a Commonwealth of Australia. More than half of the Australian population were non-participatory in that early people's convention. Most people will know that no female had any role in any of those conventions. Indeed, school children upstairs in the gallery may be interested to know that women were required to sit up there and watch the proceedings while the men decided what the Commonwealth of Australia was to be about. I am not suggesting that a people's convention as proposed by the Leader of the Opposition would exclude women, but I do know that he is appointing half the delegates. In my summation, that means, 'I have control of the numbers.' I find it quite extraordinary to dress this people's convention up as something which is open and free to all people if 'I am appointing half the people'. To me, a convention is no sacred cow. I see the 1890s convention as having brought about the Commonwealth of Australia but having excluded me and all those other women who go to make up the other half of the Australian population. I look at the 1973-85 conventions in Australia and I see that none of them were able to come to any conclusion at all. All of us here know the jokes about committees. I believe that the proposal for a people's convention on this issue represents the attitude: if you cannot come to a decision, you have a committee. Indeed, that is precisely the path which the Leader of the Opposition is taking. He cannot I,""·.lke a decision. He does not want an Australian to be head of state. He does not want Australians to determine who they are and where they are in the 21st century. What an extraordinary state we have got ourselves into: we have a monarch in Britain making decisions about us when, in fact, in many aspects of our lives we no longer have very close ties with Britain. If an Australian were to be head of state in an Australian republic, it would not deny the fact that very many people in Australia trace their roots back to Britain-England, Scotland and Wales. Some of us trace our roots back to Ireland. Now, many Australians trace their roots back to other places which are much closer to home-the Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam, parts of eastern Europe, Romania, and so on. All those people claim Australia as their own and look to Australia and the Australian government to provide them with their own head of state in a system which gives them a say. Many people who have come to Australia's shores are being provided, through their taking up of Australian citizenship, with the right to vote for the first time in their lifetime. That is important; it is at the heart representative government. We are here representing people and offering leadership. We often hear tell of the role of the Prime Minister-about the need to lead our people, the need to offer direction. The Prime Minister of Australia is talking of an Australian head of state in order for all Australians to share a future together. But now, somehow, that is not about leadership but about telling people what to do. How far from the truth this is. Republicanism and an Australian head of state are simply saying to the world, 'We are Australian, we rule ourselves, we make our own decisions.' Quite simply, in a society which espouses equality and diversity, how much more correct is it for us to have an Australian head of state? The kinds of spurious arguments we have heard on the constitutional monarchy pale into insignificance when we look at the nature of the British monarchy and when we look at the kinds of checks and balances which operate within this parliament and within this parliamentary system to ensure that there is stability and representative government. I say to those opposite: if we are to take and if you are to take representative government seriously, then it is up to each and every one of us to represent quite clearly the views of the 70,000 or so people who are in our electorates-not our personal views on this matter, but the views across the spectrum of what is happening. As I move about my electorate, I find that the majority of people are in favour of a republic and an Australian head of state. Some people are in favour of a republic but not a change in the flag. Some people are confused about the notion of a republic and some other symbols which go with that. Some people stand for the monarchy, although the number is very small and diminishing; by and large they tend to be somewhat more elderly. Young Australians and the young Australian population with whom I mix and meet have a very clear view about who they are, about the kind of government they want and about where they are going in the 21st century. They are joyful about the Sydney Olympics. They are joyous in the notion of being part of a great industrial democracy. They are joyous of in being part of a country in which representative government gives them a whole range of opportunities, and checks and balances. They are joyful in the notion that at last there are people who will stand up and say, 'Being an Australian is something of which to be proud.' This is unlike what happened in the 1950s and 1960s when people cringed over to Britain to seek their education, to seek their artistic talents, to seek publication for their works or whatever else. No, the height of joy is here in Australia in a dynamic community and in a healthy artistic society-a society which people can be proud of and in which opportunity is very much part of the role. At the heart of all of this is the notion of who we are, where we are going and who we represent. I know that all Australians agree that in future our head of state should be one of us, with the checks and balances that being elected by two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the Senate will bring to the role of an Australian president in an Australian republic in the year 2001.",69
68,Mr WILLIAMS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Tangney) (2.32 p.m.)Listening to the member for Forde (Ms Crawford), one can see that the republican debate has a long way to go. There will be plenty of time to debate the serious and important constitutional issues involved in the proposals for a repUblic. In my short contribution at this stage I do not want to delve too deeply into that, but I do want to ask a few questions about the methods and motives of the government in pursuit of its republic, particularly about the actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). To change the constitution it is necessary to go through all the formalities under section 128 of the constitution. This means that there must be a referendum proposal passed by a majority of this House and of the Senate, and that it must be put to the electors. It will only be passed if it is approved by a majority of electors in a majority of states and by an overall majority of electors voting. Since Federation, some 42 proposals have been put to referenda, but only eight of those 42 have passed. None of the eight has involved major constitutional change. In fact all the larger proposals for change have failed. No proposal which has been seen by the smaller states as a threat to them has been approved in a referendum. Very few referendum proposals involving an increase in Commonwealth power have been approved by the people. When we look at what is involved in a referendum proposal for Australia to become a republic, the changes involved to the Australian constitution are massive, even on a proposal that seeks to effect least change. In addition, it must be borne in mind that the Crown is also the symbol of each of the states. Each state has a constitution and, in order to change those constitutions, whatever is required under the respective state constitutions must also be gone through. In effect, in seeking for Australia to become a true republic, you are asking for seven sets of changes-all of them major-to be effected simultaneously. It would be very easy for such proposals to be defeated if there is any significant sector of the community which does not support it. There has been no referendum proposal passed since 1977. The most recent attempt, in 1988, failed because the proposals did not have bipartisan support. It is highly unlikely that any proposal put to a referendum would pass if it did not have the support of the major parties. It is highly unlikely that it would pass if it did not have the support of all of the states and, in particular, if it is seen as a threat to the smaller states. In the light of that, one might wonder why the proponents of an Australian republic do not seek to make the issue a bipartisall one, because it is only if it becomes bipartisan that it will be approved. The Australian Labor Party has had the subject of an Australian republic as part of its platform since 1981. So far as I am aware, absolutely nothing was done between 1981 and 1992, except in 1987 when the platform was amended to set a target date of 200 1. The matter seems first to have been raised by the Labor Party in the public arena during the 1992-93 election. It was raised in a very odd situation--obviously, a partisan situation where the parties were contesting an election. The Prime Minister came up with the extraordinary proposition that it would be good for the economy if Australia were to become a republic. I fail to see any relationship between the nature of the constitutional arrangement at the pinnacle of our government and economic conditions. Subsequent to that election, there commenced what was referred to-erroneously, in my belief-as the republican debate. It was somewhat pointless because it seemed to raise the question: do you want Australia to become a republic? If not, why not? It did not descend to the question: if yes, what sort of republic do you want? That debate went on, promoted by journalists, for some considerable time until April 1993 when the Prime Minister decided to appoint a Republic Advisory Committee. . The Republic Advisory Committee might have promoted a bipartisan approach had the question of the appointment of the committee been approached by the Prime Minister in a bipartisan way, but it was not. He pointedly appointed a former Liberal Premier who was a pro-republican to the committee, invited the then Leader of the Opposition to nominate one person to a lO-person. committee and required the states, each of which has a different and significant interest, to appoint one representing larger states and one representing smaller states. The result was that there was a committee which was seen right from the outset as being the subject of a partisan appointment process. The Prime Minister seems to have thought it was also a relatively simple question to determine how to become a republic because he gave the committee a very short time frame within which to report. In fact, it could not report within that time frame and got a one-month extension. The government received the report in October 1993. The government then said, 'Well, we won't be announcing what we are proposing immediately. We will do that early in 1994.' However,the Australian public waited in vain for the whole of 1994 for a government response. In October 1994, the coalition proposed that there be a people's constitutional convention convened in 1997. That would have been to consider, among other things, whether there should be a republic, and, if so, what form that should take. The response of the Prime Minister to that was hardly bipartisan. He was asked a dorothy dixer in question time in this House in November last year, to which he answered: Let me say this to the Leader of the Opposition: the government will be holding no dialogue with the coalition until it declares a belief in the for an Australian head of state-none whatsoever. If you do not accept the need for an Australian head of state, there will be no constitutional convention and no contribution and attendance at it by us. There the Prime Minister is foreshadowing what he sees as the simple question for the resolution of the republican question: do you want an Australian head of state? The republican debate will not, in my view, be advanced while arrogant, censorious comments of that sort emanate from the government and generate a partisan approach. The government must not have found it very easy to develop a response to the Republic Advisory Committee report, because nothing emanated from the government until 7 June. So it took all of 18 months and heading towards the better part of two years for a response from the government. The timing of that really raises another question. The response was given at a time when there was frequent and loud talk of the prospect of an election. The response by the government, to promote a head of state elected by the houses of parliament jointly, is no doubt a valid proposal worthy of consideration by the Australian public in the course of the republican debate that will no doubt continue for some time. But there are partisan aspects to the proposal. First, the proposal does not deal with the situation of the states. It would be ludicrous to contemplate an Australian republic without the states being involved in the transformation from a monarchy to a republic. Second, in the context of public opinion, the proposal adopted runs strongly counter to the public's substantial majority view that the head of state should be elected by the people. Third-and I have already mentioned thisthe response to the Republic Advisory Committee was not quick and it was not done in the course of 1994. The response from the government was not put until as late as this month in the context of a possible early election. In the course of announcing the government's proposals, the Prime Minister also said that what we have is a simple question. He need asserts that the only question involved in the republican debate is: do we want an Australian head of state? He camouflages the real issue, because in order to get a true Australian head of state-the Governor General effectively being an Australian head of state-we have to ask how we get one. It is not, therefore, simply a question of: do you want an Australian head of state? It is: do you want an Australian head of state elected by the Australian people? Do you want an Australian head of state elected by the parliament? Do you want one appointed by the Prime Minister? Do you want one who is elected by the state governors, or is one of the state governors appointed to serve for a limited time, as has been seriously suggested? Mr Bevis-This is obfuscation and you know it, Daryl.",72
69,Mr WILLIAMS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"No, it is not. It seems to me to be highlighting the fact that this proposal is being put in an election context. The Prime Minister is reported by people in the press gallery as having said that he can win an election on the republic issue. If that is his have to do. attitude, I am very disappointed, because the issue is far too important to be treated like that. But so many signs are pointing to that being the way the Prime Minister in particular is approaching it. In the few minutes I have left to speak I will contrast the coalition approach. As foreshadowed in October last year by the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) when he was the Leader of the Opposition, the coalition will, on being elected to government, convene in 1997 a people's constitutional convention. Half the delegates will be elected; half will be appointed. They will be elected on state and territory bases, with parliamentarians disqualified from running for election. The election process will recognise that young people, women and people from non-English-speaking backgrounds are currently underrepresented in decision making processes. Strenuous efforts will be made to encourage them to stand for election. The remaining half of the delegates will be appointed from federal, state and territory parliaments. The Prime Minister, premiers, chief ministers and attorneys-general will be delegates. Federal and state oppositions will also be represented. There will also be representatives from local government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Ten per cent of those at the convention will be in the age group 18 to 25. If a consensus emerges from the people's convention as to what should be done about a head of state, the coalition has undertaken that that will be promoted by the government at a constitutional referendum. Mr Bevis-What do you think?",74
70,Mr WILLIAMS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, who is at the table, asks me what I think. I am one of 17 million people. I believe, as the coalition does, that the question ought to be asked of the people, the issue debated at this convention and the consensus that emerges be put to a referendum. We have in contrast the government approach, which is that we as a government have decided what we want to do and we will tell the people that is what they . The coalition also provides for the possibility of there being no real consensus, just as there is in the community at the moment, on a particular form of republic. In that event the coalition would put a series of options to the people for them to vote on. Those options would be put in the form of a plebiscite, not a referendum, and if a consensus emerges from that it would be put to a constitutional referendum. That is a two-stage process. The virtue of the coalition approach is that the people will be consulted. It makes sense in the context of the need for a constitutional referendum, bearing in mind that so few constitutional referenda have been passed by the Australian people. They apparently treat their constitution very seriously, and proposals for change-they have been for only small changes-have been treated very seriously to the extent that most of them have failed. (Time expired)",74
71,Mr ADAMS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I believe it is about time Australia had its own head of state. We are approaching the 21st century and our centenary of nationhood, and it is about time we made our own way in our region and in the world. At a time when we are attempting to become closer to our Asian neighbours through trade and culture, they are amazed that we still have a sovereign head of state who lives 10,000 kilometres away. Some of these people are pretty amazed that, when the Queen of England visits Malaysia, for example, she is usually assisting or leading a delegation of English trade people who are working on trade balance for England-certainly not on trade balance for Australia. It is time we showed our own colours and our own way as a nation. The Queen of England has been with us for a long time, and it is now time we are able to elect our own Australian head of state. That is what this debate is really about: Australians having their own as the head of their nation. The Queen of England in reality now only acts in her role as Queen of Australia when she is in Australia. That is not very often these days. Most of the time in touring other countries she is the Queen of the United Kingdom. When talking about those interests she is talking about the interests of England and the trade of England and the economies of the United Kingdom. That is fine. That is the way it should be for her as the head of England, but it should not be that way for the head of Australia. When we have a head visiting another part of the world that head our country should be promoting this country, Australia. When our head of state visits those countries, it should be an Australian. We may ask why we have hung onto these remnants of the past for so long. There are a lot of reasons. Our history, our early European population, was British based. The economy was geared to the European market until relatively recently and certainly until postwar in Australia. Maybe it was tied too close, maybe we should have broken the ties earlier. Our population is English speaking, with an accent somewhat equivalent to cockney English. Therefore we were seen as an easy place for English migrants to settle. We do have some strong ties, and some of us have strong memories. My wife is English born, so my mother-in-law is English-a great woman. She came to live in Australia in 1983, was naturalised in 1984 and at 78 now firmly believes that Australia should have its own head of state, should be able to state its own case with its own head and should be proud of the fact that it has a head of state born and bred in Australia. As Australia's population has grown through its migrants, especially its postwar migrants, through those changes Australia has come away from the European economy. Many more nationalities have settled in Australia and we have changed from our early roots. Those changes in trade were very easy to see in Australia in the 1950s and 1960s when England went into the Common Market and basically destroyed the Tasmanian apple industry. It was the right thing for England to do but it certainly did not do anything for Australia's trade and it certainly did not do anything for a major industry in Tasmania. In England now the Prime Minister is having a few difficulties in convincing his more conservative colleagues in his own party that England should be going into the European Union in a fully fledged way, as all the other nations are. That is probably right for England and that is probably where it should be in its trading bloc, endeavouring to gain the best out of that. But Australia's future is in the Asian region, the Pacific rim. That touches everything from South America to the of Americas, North America and Canada right through Japan, right down to China, right around Asia and even across to South Africa and the Indian rim. We have great trade opportunities emerging in those areas in the future. To make the most of them we need to have someone who can go there as the head of Australia, someone who is an Australian. I believe we will be seen to be a country that has finally reached its full maturity. Our early relationship with Britain, our heritage and our affection for that country do not need to change. We have grown up with them. I personally have many English friends who will not change a bit when Australia becomes a republic. They will still be my friends. I will still enjoy their company and be proud to know them. The head of state in Australia should embody and represent Australian values, traditions, experiences and aspirations for the future. We should incorporate the dreams and aspirations that the indigenous people of Australia have for our nation. I would like to see us becoming one Australia, but it will rely on a decision of the Aboriginal people-will they help us develop our nationhood in a way that is acceptable to their people? That is something that I do not think could ever happen under a head of state who was born somewhere outside Australia. Every Australian should be able to aspire to be the head of state, chosen because of a particular achievement or outstanding service. There is no reason why we should not look forward to having an Aboriginal as the head of state some time in the future. Many Aboriginals have contributed to building our great nation, and many more will do the same. Under the current constitution, the head of state is the Queen. Most of her responsibilities are carried out by the Governor General. The only power she retains is the appointment of the. Governor General which, by convention, she does on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day. The historical aspect of that in 1933 the Governor General ceased to be the representative of the British government in Australia and became solely the representative of the Queen. In the same decade, it was accepted that the British monarch would act on the advice of the Australian government, not the British government. Also Australia assumed responsibility for its own external affairs-its foreign affairs as we call it today. In 1980 all remaining rights of appeal to the Privy Council in London ceased. Australian courts became the ultimate arbitrator of Australian law. There has been a move towards our becoming a republic over the years, and we have divested ourselves of a connection to British law, its courts and its appeal system. In the Australia Act, the UK relinquished the last vestiges of power, making only Australian law apply to Australia-a small but. important step and the last in a process which began about 100 years ago. If we take the minimalist approach, the only thing that we will need to change is the position of the Governor General and how he or she is appointed. All the constitutional principles and practices will remain the same. The role of the House of Representatives and the Senate will be the same, and we will still have a federation of states. The functions of the head of state will be that of the Governor General---except in the most external circumstances-although we will still have this ongoing debate about the reserve powers and that aspect of control. I know that the polls have shown that within our country people would like to vote on the head of state. I think as we emerge from this debate-although I am sure there will still be a lot of debate before there is a referendum-people may come to realise that changing the way we electthe head of state from a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament would require a major change to the power structure that we presently have in this country. Hence, we would have to rewrite and change the power of the Senate. We would have to look at the power of the Prime Minister, the Executive Council and the executive government. A major change would have to take place, and that process would is that involve enormous changes to the power structure. If we had a popularly elected head of state, we would need to change the power structures that we presently know in our country· today. An example could be that people would be able to make representations to the president-whether or not he is popularly elected-to override government decisions. If a president tried to pursue an issue like that, it could bring us into a constitutional crisis.",74

74,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the member for Blaxland. I refer the Prime Minister to Senator Evans's claim in the Senate yesterday that he had asked Indonesia privately to rethink its plan to appoint a military figure who supported the Dili massacre as its new ambassador to Australia. In light of the Prime Minister's close personal relationship with President Suharto, has the Prime Minister raised any concerns .about General Mantiri' s appointment with President Suharto?",76
75,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I have not. It is the right of governments to select their ambassadors and to propose them to the country of their service. The record would show that governments receiving ambassadors rarely reject them and only do so under the most extreme circumstances. As far as the Dili question is concerned, Australia has made its position very clear on the Timor massacre many times over. I myself have done so to President Suharto. There is no doubt about where Australia stands in respect of this. It is talked of frequently in the Australia-Indonesia relationship. No doubt the President, in nominating General Mantiri, does so as a senior military figure in that country. I can see no circumstances on which we would or should reject his nomination by the President. Accord Mark VIII",77
76,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed . to the Prime Minister, and it concerns Accord Mark VIII. Will the Prime Minister inform the House of the benefits to Australia of the signing of Accord Mark VIII?",77
77,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are seeing again the value of an agreed basis of income determination between the work force and the government of the day. It is best demonstrated by the fact that since Accord Mark VII we have had 630,000 jobs created in Australia and an inflation rate between one per cent and 2Y2 per cent, or in some cases under one per cent, during the cycle of that accord. Dr Kemp-And look at the level of unemployment.",77
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Goldstein will not interject today.,77
79,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"After eight accords over 12 years-each accord covers a period of about 1Y2 to two years-with Accord Mark VIII we can see for the first time the development of a permanent perpetual wages system whereby, having used the accords to move away from the centralised wage fixing structure, we are now moving to a decentralised wage fixing structure. In that decentralised wage fixing structure, enterprise bargaining is growing apace throughout the community. Those working Australians who cannot avail themselves of an enterprise bargain will be protected by the safety net being proposed by the government. In other words, we have had accords which dealt with award restructuring and flexibility within awards and we have had accords which were predicated on the amalgamation of major unions under a system of award restructuring. That now largely having been accomplished, we can focus on a permanent wages system with low inflation. I imagine that it is a matter of some substantial comfort to the community that the AeTU, on behalf of the work force, said that, for the period of this Accord, the wages system will be based on an underlying inflation rate on average of two to three per cent over the cycle. I ran into an employer's representative yesterday and he said to me, 'I grew up with automatic wage indexation. For my whole working life there has been automatic wage indexation.' To see an underlying rate of inflation of two to three per cent-in other words, running the wages system, including the enterprise bargaining stream to produce two to three per cent inflation-is a quite remarkable and revolutionary change. It means that we can run the Australian economy faster than we would otherwise be able to were we relying simply on interest rates to curtail inflation. In those countries where we have seen only a reliance on fiscal and monetary policy we have generally seen a much slower rate of employment growth and economic growth than in Australia. Having the three instruments of policy-fiscal, monetary and wages policy-with some weight on each rather than a heavy preponderant weight on anyone really means that we can run the economy much faster and more safely in terms of inflation and, at the same time, spread the benefits. I told the House last week that since 1983 we have had an increase in household disposable income of 40 per cent or, in per capita terms, an increase of over 19Y2 per cent. There have been over two million jobs created. That is a fairly remarkable record. We have a system which takes account of the core need for competitiveness. We hear a lot from the opposition about the current account deficit. It is now the only thing that those opposite harp on. Mr Costello-You are going to hear more too.",77

Competitiveness, which promotes that ever growing level of exports, is the thing which in the end will deal with the current account, as will the savings changes that the government has put in place. I have talked in this House before about debilitating effect that double-digit inflation that we had for 15 years had on this country. I have made the point that people could not save at the levels they were when inflation was tearing the quality and value out of their savings. With low inflatison and an accord of this kind we are also seeing a very great reduction in industrial disputation and we have seen a much greater promotion of industrial peace in the period.

The government has told everybody what its policy is. It is in the Accord. It is in the eighth one. It has been published. People can see it. They know what the consultative processes were and they know of the consultations we had with the industry groups, including the MTIA. It is the better way.

Can the Prime Minister also confirm that in the first of these letters he did not make any mention whatsoever of Australia's about the possible resumption of French nuclear testing.

153,Mr QUICK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Can the minister inform the House about the benefits to workers and the economy of Accord Mark VIII? Can the minister also inform the House about the contribution the Accord and the Industrial Relations Reform Act have made to the decline in industrial disputes?,81
154,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There can be no doubt that Accord Mark VIII is a framework for another four years of low inflation, high growth and high productivity for the Australian economy. It certainly continues our tradition of industrial harmony-the one we are so pleased and proud to boast about. And what better day to show it off than the day the ABS statistics have been released, showing that for last year, 1994, the lowest number of industrial disputes in any year since 1940-the lowest number of industrial disputes for 55 years. What a sensational performance! Just have a look at what we inherited in 1983 and compare it with what we have today as a result of the Accord. Here we have the graph. Here we have Everest. Who was presiding over the economy then? Who was right up there, scaling the dizzy heights? The Leader of the Opposition, the then Treasurer of Australia. His former Prime Minister has left the chamber, I notice. Where are we today? Right down here, with the lowest level since 1940. These reductions have been even more dramatic as a result of the conjunction of the Accord process and the 1993 Industrial Relations Reform Act. It was only a few days ago that the publication Workforce published an article dealing with this question of industrial disputes, days lost and protected bargaining. What it had to say is very revealing. Workforce said: The introduction of a legal right to strike has failed to produce an upsurge in industrial action, confounding employers' predictions that the new laws would create industrial turmoil. In fact, in the 12 months following the introduction of the new federal laws allowing unions to stage protected industrial action, the number of working days lost due to industrial action declined by more than 46 per cent. It went down in that first year by more than 46 per cent! All of this is great news for Australian business. It is great news for Australia's exports. It is great news for Australia's economy. Of course, it is all thanks to the Accord and it is all thanks to those industrial reforms that this government has driven home. There is no doubt that, under Labor, that exceptional performance will continue. Accord Mark VIII, after all, guarantees it. All working people in Australia have their standards fundamentally guaranteed through the four safety net adjustments provided under Accord Mark VIII, the $8 increase from Accord Mark VII and the three annual adjustments-$9 to $12 for each of the following three years, 1997 through to 1999. In the case of low paid workers, it is a bigger increaseAustralia recorded from $11 to $14. Consistent with the budget, there is a better retirement income guaranteed under the Accord for all workers through the introduction of employee superannuation contributions, contributions which will be met, dollar for dollar, by this government. We have improved this area. We have driven home the reforms. We have provided additional assistance for families. We have a comprehensive package we can truly be proud of. That is in stark contrast to the promise of what members of the opposition have in store if ever they are elected to government in this country. There is no comprehensive award safety net under them whatsoever. There is an absence of a no disadvantage test against which enterprise bargains can be measured. There are no safety net increases. There is a single miserable hourly rate of pay. How do we know this when there has been no release of the federal policy? It is worth noting that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition went to Queensland and released the Queensland state opposition's IRpolicy. It provided all of these things-each and every one of them. The approach of the opposition to industrial relations.is no different now from what it was in 1993. It destroys all workers' protections. It would return us to the industrial turmoil, shown here so graphically , of the early 1980s. Indonesia: Diplomatic Representation",81
155,Mr MACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, some two years ago, in reflecting the concern of a substantial section of the Australian community, I indicated to the House that, regrettably, you were coming dangerously close to becoming the Neville Chamberlain of South-East Asia in respect of our relations with Indonesia. Does not the agreement of the government to the appointment of Lieutenant General Mantiri as Indonesian Ambassador to Australia, whose view is that the Dili massacre was 'a quite proper response', reinforce the view that the government is following a policy of appeasement to a military dictatorship? Given the fact that this appointment flies in the face of Australian public opinion since 1975, why have you allowed this ambassadorial appointment to humiliate this country in the eyes of the world and to hold up to ridicule any human rights statements this country may make in world forums?",82
156,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am at a loss to understand the reference to Chamberlain. Does the honourable gentleman think that Indonesia is about to declare war on Australia? Does he think we have a relationship of that character?  Mr Smyth-You want peace at any price.,82
157,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt and the member for Canberra.,82
158,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is our nearest largest neighbour of just on 200 million people. It is a country whose fortunes are inextricably linked to Australia's, and ours to theirs. a relationship which is absolutely central to Australian foreign policy. For that relationship to be operated only on the basis of a for-lgn policy relationship, or one that takes .the opportunity of simply expressing exclusively an Australian view or a sectional Australian view as the basis for the operation of tl1at policy, would be doing the wrong thing by Australians. It is more the pity that, for a very long period of time, so much of the AustraliaIndonesia relationship has centred around Timor; it has because of what has happened there. Australia has made clear that it has condemned the denial of liberties and the denial of human rights in that province and has sought a better order in that province. But it wants to conduct that conversation about East Timor in the context of a broader conversation with Indonesia about the totality of the relationship and our relative importance to one another. That is now what has happened. We now have a broad relationship with Indonesia that sits on many foundations, whereas in the past it was exclusively a foreign policy relationship where, were that to crumble, the whole relationship would have crumbled. I can only repeat what I said earlier: we have made our views very clear about Timor. We are constantly saying to the Indonesian government that there needs to be an approach to the development of Timor to give the people of that province opportunities and to give them, in their own view, a role in the way in which their province and their society functionMr Cleary-Are you going to write a letter to the ambassador to tell him that he is wrong? Mr .SPEAKER-Order! The member for Wills!",82
159,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And, as a consequence, try to see that this does not remain the issue for the East Timorese people or the issue in this relationship. I think we can see that there has been a substantial change in the way in which Indonesia accepts the Australian view, deals with It is the Australian view. One should remember also the changes which are taking place in Indonesia. About eight years ago 65 per cent of Indonesians lived below the poverty line; that is now 15 per cent. There has been a substantial distribution of the wealth in Indonesia. 'One can see the changes taking place there perpetually. Asa consequence, there is a lot of improvement in living standards and, with it, the general human condition in that country. They are advances which I think Australia should encourage and applaud. So, while we will always take the view that wherever liberties are constrained or human rights violated we will forcibly put our view'::"""""":which we have done and will continue to do with Indonesia-that we do' want to maintain a broad relationship with that country. I do not see the character of General Mantiri's appointment being such as to rupture that relationship. In saying that, I say that in the broad interests of the Australian people. Mr Cleary-What about the racial vilification bill?",82
160,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not an errant section of the Victorian Far Left, which is your view. Mr Cleary-A massacre is a Far Left interpretation, is it?",83
161,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Wills will not engage in debate.,83
162,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There has to be a totality in the relationship, and there is. I think that balance has been struck. Both the foreign minister and I, in the course of keeping that balance, will never fail to put Australia's views about democracy, liberty and human rights. I do not see General Mantiri's appointment by President Suharto as the Indonesian Ambassador to Australia as in any way curtailing our capacity to put that view. Constitution",83
163,Mr HOLLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister outline to the House the government's view of the value of a people's convention as an instrument of constitutional change?,83
164,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no more effective way of giving expression to the will of the Australian peopleMr Nugent- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This matter is on the Notice Paper at the present time, so it is an invalid question. I ask you to rule it out of order.",83

168,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Opposition members interjecting Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. There is a clear precedent in this House that you give the call to either side. That question was ruled out of order after you gave the member the call. You are now obliged by precedent to give the call to this side of the House. Mr SPEAKEll - The honourable member raises that it is precedent. In the spirit of fairness, I was giving the opportunity for those on my right to ask a question. I had given the call to the member for Port Adelaide. Mr MCGauran-Fairness! Ha, hal",83
169,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will then give the call to the honourable member for Barker. Mr MCGauran- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.

173,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If it is on the same matter, there is no point of order. Mrs Bishop-You have said again and again in this House when dealing with points of order that we are to be referred to the House of Representatives Practice and writings on the history of the standing orders. Very simply, the Practice says that you must follow the precedent. That is the way that the rules governing the House are built.",84
174,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. I have already ruled on this. I have said,84
175,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order: under the arrangements between the government and the opposition 14 questions are provided, which means that the opposition gets its questions. It is not a matter of the opposition being denied a question, whatever the sequence.",84
176,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a valid point there. As I have said, I am prepared in the spirit of fairness to give even-handedness and calls each way. I call the member for Port Adelaide-and let's get on with it. Consultation",84
177,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister able to advise the House of the principles which have underpinned government policy formulation since 1983? Is the Prime Minister able to assure the Australian people that his government will continue to involve the Australian people in all aspects of policy development and implementation?,84
178,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Virtually from day one the government changed the model of governance in Australia by a process of consultation. This began with the Economic Summit in 1983, the prices and incomes accord, and consultation with employer groups and the peak union bodies under the Accord to curtail prices and to see wages come back to be within affordable levels. That process has continued right down the years, and Accord Mark VIII is a further development of that process of consultation. You can see it again more recently in the consultations that the government had with the peak farm bodies last year and iIi the consultations we are still having in relation· to such questions as land management and soil and water conservation. By and large, the government has believed that, on a basis of talking and listening to interest groups, one can secure policy solutions which advance the country more rapidly and more fully. As a consequence, we advance ourselves in a way that we might not otherwise. In the last two months, the government has delivered a number of profound reforms. In fact, I doubt whether any government has been quite so productive in such a short period of time, and the process of consultation that we have had has encouraged it. Let me remind the House that the budget delivered, amongst other things, a budget surplus, a new maternity allowance and a revolution in national savings via 15 per cent being put away for Australians in award superannuation. Since the budget we have seen the Justice Statement; we have seen the completion, at last, of our oldest national goal-a standard gauge rail link linking the mainland capitals via Melbourne-we have seen the beginning of a national civics education program; we have seen the government's proposal for an Australian republic with an Australian as our head of state; and we have seen Accord Mark VIII which was delivered last week",84

180,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Mitchell!,84
181,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have already told the House about the benefits to Australian workers and to the economy flowing from that statement. Opposition members do not enjoy this modality of policy making, just as they did not enjoy the other achievements of the past three years. They hated the One Nation statement; they hated the white paper on employment; and they hated Creative Nation.",84
182,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We hate your debt.,84
183,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am sorry they find all reforms so unpalatable.,85
184,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let the children pay.,85
185,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,85
186,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Perhaps the game was given away when the member for Bennelong said that he thought the 'nation had reform fatigue'. These recent achievements stem from the government's fundamental belief in policy: a belief that governments should lead, that they should address the potential of the country and that they should have faith in the people's capacity to embrace the necessary change",85
187,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You cannot tell them the truth.,85
188,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for O'Connor!,85
189,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to take people into the government's confidence and encourage them, along with our own processes, to reach the higher levels of policy prescription. It also means that we recognise there can be no honesty in government without policies. There can be no credibility and no trust between the government and the people-or a political party and the people-without a process of development of policies. Mr Reith-What about l-a-w?",85
190,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,85
191,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is why the opposition's claim that it is somehow in touch with people is so laughable. Opposition members say they are in touch but they will not, on any basis of trust, tell the public what their policy prescriptions might be. It seems to me that it is an antithesis of the argument of being in touch. You are so out of touch that you do not believe the public should know what your policy thinking is, and you will not bring them into it. You will not even tell your own backbench. I heard the interjection from the member for Flinders. When his GST proposal was unveiled in the last parliament, it was, of course, again without consultation with the public or even with his own party.",85
192,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,85
193,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,85
194,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But here we have it from the horse's mouth. A report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 28 June 1995 stated: The Opposition Leader, Mr Howard, has called a special party room meeting for Fridaythat is tomorrowto head off any concerns over lack of backbench involvement in policy and strategy decisions for the Federal election. This ""brainstorming session"" ... is to allow MPs to air their views on the Coalition's electoral tactics. However, senior figures stressed that the meeting would not canvass detailed policy areas. Oh, no, there will be no trust for the MPs and certainly no trust with the community-no trust, but they are in touch! Mr Costello-When did you tell your backbenchers about the Commonwealth Bank?",85
195,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition! Mr Costello-What about the Commonwealth Bank?,85
196,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition! Mr Costello-Half an hour before you announced it.,85
197,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,85
198,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Howard is too frightened and too devious to even release his policies to his own backbench for their scrutiny and approval. But this is not because the policies have not been prepared. Senator Robert Hill had this to say about their policies, published in The things they said: As chair of the coalition's policy review committee, I can tell you that we now have in place draft framework policies for almost every portfolio, including my own area of responsibility-education science and technology, he says. The finer detail of that policy will be the subject of ongoing debate over the next few months. The full policy will be released in the lead-up to the election at a time of our own choosing. But this stand should not be misinterpreted as an unwillingness or an inability to engage in policy debate. In fact, it is time to intensify the debate. In other words, the opposition has, as Senator Hill says, its draft policy fram-work in place. We saw a bit of the quality and morality of the draft policy framework when Senator Ian Macdonald talked about introducing policies he had no intention of actually proceeding with. In today's Australian-I do not usually quote many journalists in here, and I do not want to make a habit of it- Mr Megalogenis said: Macdonald's briefing paper to shadow cabinet contained what must rank as one of the dumbest passages ever drafted by a politician. It was not so much dumb as an outbreak of honesty, an uncharacteristic outbreak of frankness. Let us make it clear that we are now well within 12 months of an election.",85
199,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Twelve months?,86
200,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Twelve months of an election. What are we seeing from the opposition? We are seeing policies that are prepared in framework, but not to be released-not to be shown to the public. Yet the Leader of the Opposition will tell us that the opposition is in touch with the public-the same public he will not share his secrets with, the same public he has no trust in and the same public who have no relationship of trust with him. The opposition has no process of consultation, no accord, no discussion with bodies like the peak farm bodies and no discussion with the employer groups, as the government has. Mr Howard is either too scared or too embarrassed to release his policies. The point I want to make is that the country has advanced by frankness. It has advanced by consultation. It has advanced by sharing information. It h-s advanced by taking the public into the government's trust. This has not happened with the opposition, which claims to be in touch with the very people it believes it cannot trust. Hindmarsh Island Bridge",86
201,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Is the minister aware member of today's TV appearance of Matt Rigney, the chairman of one of South Australia's three ATSIC regional councils, in which Mr Rigney confirmed Doug Milera's earlier statement that it was men who came up with the idea women's business and it was men who told version the women about it. How could the women's business be secret if it had been not only discussed with men but also-as now confirmed by Mr Rigney-initiated by men? Will you now admit that your administration of this issue has been totally incompetent? In the interests of all Aboriginal people, will you urge them to cooperate with the South Australian royal commission?",86
202,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Few things are certain in public life, but one of them is that, whenever Channel 10 runs a report in relation to Hindmarsh Island, the member for Barker will speak from his political grave, with the active support of the Leader of the Opposition, in an attempt to try to take this issue just one step further. Let me refer to the Channel 10 report that the honourable member for Barker speaks about. The Channel 10 report begins with an introductionMr Richard Evans-A good starting point!",86
203,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me tell you about itin which it says: Matt Rigney is the most senior elected official in South Australia's Aboriginal community. Wrong! That in fact is Yami Lester, the elected ATSIC commissioner from South Australia. It then go-s on to say, just in the introduction, that the Ngarrindjeri Heritage Commission secretary is a Mr Doug Milera. Wrong! In fact the secretary is a Miss Liz Tongerie. They are the errors just in the introduction. Mr Downer-Get on to the quote.",86
204,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,86
205,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will go to the quote. The fact is that in this very short Channel 10 report there is a great deal of internal inconsistency.,86
206,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So what has that to do with it?,86
207,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have already warned the for O'Connor.,86
208,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Among the things that are said in that report is a suggestion by the journalist concerned that Mr Rigney 'maintains that no lies have been told' . He goes on of to say, 'Everyone has been telling their of the truth.' I wish to table a letter from Mr Rigney addressed to me dated the 7th of this month; in which he states: It is most disappointing that some of our Ngarrindjeri people have spoken out about fabricated, stories. He goes on to say: These are not the views of the majority of Ngarrindjeri people. It is our view that those who spoke out about fabricating the women's stories are politicising Aboriginal heritage. He says: My Council and I commend youthat is, meon your stance and assure you that my Regional Council stands with you in a show of solidarity against those-Mr Downer-He seems to have changed his mind now.",86
209,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Here's your tum in the lettervalueless politicians who are using Aboriginal people for political point scoring. I table the letter. This House and the parliament-in fact, the people of Australia-are most grateful to Mr Michael Gordon of the Australian for his recent feature piece in which he told us of the exploits of the Leader of the Opposition at, would you believe it, the Caboolture golf club. Mr Snowdon-Where?",87
210,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"At the Caboolture golf club. We find in the Australian a detailed account of the way in which the opposition is seeking to use this issue in a most divisive and improper way, trampling on standards of proper behaviour in a way it would never deal with or treat the spiritual beliefs of nonAboriginal Australians. The Leader of the Opposition said in his speech that the government-that is, me-was responsible for economically 'bashing up ordinary, decent Australian citizens'. That is what he said. What the member for Bennelong did not tell the good people of Caboolture is that one of the two developers that he so unstintingly praised without any kind of equivocation is in fact facing criminal fraud charges in the state of South Australia. The member for Bennelong did not tell those people that, and he ought to go back there and",87
211,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You say this under parliamentary privilege.,87
212,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the member for Bennelong doubts what I say, he should have regard to the Adelaide Advertiser of 22 April in which it is quoted that the developer is charged with misappropriating $70,000 from two estate trust funds. The article states: Chapman, 54, of Hindmarsh Island appeared briefly in the Adelaide magistrates court. I suggest that the opposition leader then have regard to a report in the Adelaide Advertiser of 10 April.",87
213,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is that sub judice?,87
214,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister' is getting very close to sub judice.,87
215,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No; I am simply reading,87
216,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No; I suggest to the minister that he look very carefully at those quotes if he is going to read them.,87
217,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will respect your wishes, Mr Speaker. Let me tum to some more facts that the Leader of the Opposition conveniently failed to put on the public record at the Caboolture golf club. Mr MCLachlan- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",87
218,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am not surprised.,87
219,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will resume his seat for a moment. Mr MCLachlan-The point of the question, which the minister simply will not address, is that, if it is not secret",87
220,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER Opposition members-Sit down!,87
221,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Barker has the call for a point of order. The Prime Minister can speak to the point of order in a moment. Mr MCLachlan-The point of the question was: if the business was initiated by men, how could it possibly be secret?",87
222,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, no! You are now debating the issue. Resume your seat. The minister has the call. He has been entirely relevant to the questions asked of him.",87
223,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Despite the fact that the member for Barker enjoys the unrestrained confidence of the Leader of the Opposition, that is not a view shared on this side of the House.",88
224,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, I am devastated!",88
225,Mr TICKNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition, in his speech at the Caboolture golf club, talked at great length about the developers, the nature of the deal they were involved in and how it was all so dreadfully proper. What he did not tell the people at the Caboolture golf club is that the former Leader of the Opposition and now Premier of South Australia likened the deal to which they are a party as 'the State Bank revisited'. That is what the Leader of the Opposition did not tell the people at Caboolture. The member for Barker asked whether I would come into this House and give some active support to that Star Chamber royal commission convened by the South Australian government into the spiritual beliefs of a group of South Australians. I will do no such thing. It is very strongly my view that the royal commission in that state is in breach of the spirit, if not the letter, of the Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act and the Commonwealth is seeking further advice on that question, as are others. In case the Leader of the Opposition is in any doubt about how far out of step he is with the middle ground of Australian public opinion in endorsing the royal commission as he has, let me also table statements in the form of media releases issued by the Catholic Church. in South Australia, the Uniting Church in South Australia and the South Australian Council of Churches. We in the Australian Labor Party stand with them. Fiscal Policy",88
226,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Treasurer aware of proposals to loosen fiscal policy? Treasurer, can you tell the House where these proposals have come from and what their implications are?",88
227,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of a continuing stream of proposals to loosen fiscal policy which keep coming from the opposition. We saw in the reply to the budget from the Leader of the Opposition that the opposition was determined to oppose various tax measures, which would have meant a loosening of fiscal policy to the tune of $1 Y2 billion this year and $2Y2 billion the subsequent year. Since then the opposition has proposed one expenditure measure, that is, in relation to non-work related child care. Now we see another, in relation to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The opposition is taking the view that various measures proposed by the government to stop the rapid growth of one of the fastest growing expenditure items in our whole array of outlays should be opposed. The opposition has taken the view that in regard to our attempts to clarify the eligibility criteria and to prevent various claims which have been made on the basis of an application of the law which we never intended, such as, for instance, to diesel fuel used in maintaining council parks and gardens or in quarrying activity, there should be no retrospective application of that legislation to prevent claims being made on a basis which the government never intended them to be made. That is, the opposition wants the companies which are making these claims to be able to get money out of the government on the basis of an application of the law which was never intended by the legislature. The money involved in this is substantial. It is about $160 million, if all the court decisions were to go against the government. That is the amount of money at risk and that is the addition to outlays which would come from the opposition being successful in its attempts to prevent the government from restricting outlays in this area. It does not stop there. The opposition is also trying to prevent us from eliminating quarrying prospectively as an area which would not qualify for the diesel fuel rebate. That would cost an extra $20 million per annum approximately. So what we are looking at here is, across the forward estimates, something in the order of $240 million of additional outlays-that is, $160 million for the various claims and an annual $20 million for the inclusion of quarrying. It should also be noted that of the $160 million of claims, $90 million would go to three companies. Those three companies, of course, have charged their customers in the past for the full amount of their costs, including the diesel cost without the rebate. Do you think those companies are going to hand back the $90 million to their customers? If you do, you have another think coming. If you really believe that,you are totally naive. This will just be $90 million straight into the pockets of three companies, to their benefit and to the benefit of their shareholders. What we have had in this budget debate so faris opposition members opposing outlays in the order of $400 million, and thereby trying to increase outlays to that extent. That is just on two measures-the only two outlays measures that have so far come before the parliament. At the same time, we have this ranting from opposition members about the need to tighten fiscal policy. The fig leaf of respectability they have had on this issue has produced this response: 'You should not be doing it through tax measures; you should be doing it through outlays.' But that fig leaf has been torn away by your own actions, because you keep opposing the outlays measures. The naked truth is that this is an opposition without any policy credibility whatsoever. This is supposedly the alternative government, but it totally lacks policy credibility. It is trying to have the argument at the macro-level by saying, 'We support fiscal tightening.' At the same time, it is opposing all the measures at the individuallevel-even, incredibly, the outlays measures. How could anyone take such an opposition seriously? How could anyone believe that this is an opposition with credibility and decency and with any policy ideas? By God, you need that brainstorming session tomorrow. Sales Tax on Building Materials",88
228,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Now that your new 12 per cent sales tax on building materials has been defeated, do you stand by your desire to tax building materials for the first time? Is it the case that at the next election a vote for the Labor Party is a vote to increase tax on every new house, every renovation and every extension to a family home in Australia?",89
229,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,In line with the opposition's policy of trying to loosen our fiscal policyand totally contrary to its supposed policy of being concerned about taking the pressure off interest rates and tackling the current account-it is taking action on every individual measure to try to prevent the interest· rates pressure coming off,89
230,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What is your policy? Tell us your policy, Ralph.",89
231,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition is not helping.,89
232,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"By doing that, it is showing to the nation that it has no policy credibility. It is a fact that the opposition has been successful in getting the minor parties in the Senate to give it support in relation to building materials, with the result being that the that Senate has rejected that budget measure. When that measure comes back here, the government's position will be that we will accept that Senate decision. Opposition members-Ah, hal",89
233,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Because we know that we will not get it back if it is returned to the Senate. Mr Costello-Youdon't want an election on it, do you?",89
234,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That does not mean to say that we think there is any decency or appropriateness in the opposition's action-quite the contrary. If you had any sense of responsibility or policy credibility, you would have supported that measure. Mr Costello-You don't support it any more!",89
235,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,89
236,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Simply because, every timeMr Downer- Mr Speaker, on a point of order relating to the question of relevance: the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked what the government's policy was. The minister is refusing to outline the policy, which leads us to conclude that the government has no policy.",89

240,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, any pretence from opposition members that they are concerned about the level of interest rates or the balance of payments can be disregarded, given the policy that they have pursued in relation to this budget. Mrs Bishop-You cannot argue that way after what you have just said.",90
241,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Mackellar.,90
242,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The opposition has attacked, opposed and tried to prevent all of the measures of substance that· have been put in this budget to try to tackle the interest rate and balance of payments issues. When you say that you have those concerns, there should be horse laughs around the country. You have demonstrated by your actions time after time after time that you have no such concerns. You are quite prepared to see interest rates go up. You do not give a damn about the balance of payments or the current account deficit, because you oppose all the measures that are being put forward to tackle those issues. Budget 1995-96",90
243,Mr KNOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Is the minister aware of claims that the government should reduce its expenditures more significantly? Can the minister provide the House with information regarding the economic impact of those concrete measures regarding government spending which have been proposed? Mr BEAZLEYI certainly can. The Treasurer answered a question related to this, and I have further information. Although I am able to provide the honourable member information on the constant stumbling over the hurdles of this alleged opposition I said that we ought not to be addressing any element of the revenue side on this budget. We should, as they said, reduce expenditure significantly. Also, in a statement a week or so ago from the opposition spokesperson on treasury matters, it was stated that substantial massive measures were required in the expenditure area to address, in his terms, the current account deficit. I have a small piece of good news, but a small piece of good news only, for the Treasurer. His statement that every single item of expenditure restraint that had thus far gone before the parliament had failed in the Senate with the opposition opposing it has to be amended as from late last night. Their opposition to the changes in the export market development grants scheme pursued once through the Senate was not pursued a second time. However, having retreated in the face of the blandishments of the government in the course of the last week, Senator Parer could not let it go. He said in the Senate last night: Finally, I would state on behalf of the coalition that, on election to government, the coalition would recognise tourism as our largest single earner of foreign currency; and it will give tourism the same access to export market development grants and to any other facilities as are applicable to any other industry. This is a coalition commitment which will be delivered; it is not an empty ... promiseThat is what Senator Parer had to say. That would constitute something like a 71f2 per cent increase in the expenditure in this area to provide opportunities for free tickets or subsidised holidays for foreign tourists coming to this country, as though an industry which is now upwards of about $7 billion actually requires the additional assistance that this proposition puts forward. When we had a detailed consideration of these matters-unlike the way the opposition makes policy-it was pointed out that all the funds and resources that were going into this 'area were, to a substantial degree, creating competition between particular tourist destinations, facilities and operators in Australia as opposed to enhancing tourism to Australia. The opposition nevertheless says, 'In our giveaway show, we will whack in another 71f2 position, per cent there.' That particular proposition comes on top of the opposition's propositions that we had occasion to mention here earlier in the week. The hurdle those opposite fell over-as opposed to how they stumbled, got up, ran round and jumped over again in the case of the export market development grants scheme-was in the area of the restriction to non-working mothers of a very generous 12 hours a week subsidised child care. The opposition spokesperson said that I had been mistaken. I tum now to the relevant press article, which has not been denied by the coalition. It states: The coalition will go to the next election promising non-working mothers up to 50 hours a week subsidised child care. The article goes on: The coalition believes stay-at-home mothers should be entitled to up to $94 a week child-care assistance, even though they receive a $30 a week home child-care allowance to stay at home and care for their children. That has not been denied by the opposition, and we cos ted it. The cost was $1 Y2 billion. It is a $1 Y2 billion promise that you find yourselves committed to. As far as the increased diesel fuel rebate outlays issue is concerned, which was referred to by the Treasurer earlierMr Costello-This is not a personal explanation, you turkey.",90
244,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have never got up and specifically denied that.,91
245,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the House will not respond to interjections and there should be none anyway.,91
246,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As far as the increased diesel fuel rebate outlays issue is concerned, is it not interesting that those opposite walk around this place talking about $6 billion worth of cuts. They do not put anything on the revenue side; they do not in any way hit for revenue anyone whom they regard as their strong supporters. They put it all on the outlays side. As far as the rebate is concerned we are talking about an outlays option not a proposal that actually imposes a tax retrospectively. Nobody would collect, if that decision were to go through, an amount of money off anybody. In fact, it would be a donation. Big hearted Arthur across the chamber would make a donation of $160 million to highly profitable companies, with no obligation on those companies to pay it across to people that they have already charged to cover that tax. Those opposite do not worry about them, but they get stuck into the safety net and they get stuck into the battlers in society to make up for the $400 billion worth of outlays that they are prepared to add on. Sales Tax",91
247,Mr ATKINSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the member for Blaxland. I ask the Prime Minister: is it a facrthat after your next sales tax increase on KST day-Keating's sales tax day-this Saturday, 1 July-Australians will",91

250,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,-'-I am always fair.,91
251,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,recognise that there is a lot of liberal incorporations in this House and it would not be in accordance with the spirit of fairness if the question were to be ruled out of order.,91
252,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the spirit of fairness, I refer the Leader of the Opposition to my remarks yesterday where I asked one member on my ""left to change the question because it was not really in the spirit of fairness. The honourable member for Isaacs can certainly ask a question as long as it is couched in the appropriate terms.",91
253,Mr ATKINSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I understand what you are saying, but I suspect that the sales tax increase is not in the spirit of fairness either. Is it a fact that the total sales tax slug for Australia will be $14 billion, which is equivalent to $785 per person per year or $60 for every four-person family per week?",91
254,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will check the statistics, but if the member wants a precise answer he should stick it on the Notice Paper.",91
255,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,92
256,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,92
257,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will round up the answer with a couple of points. The key point is that this is the second lowest taxed country in the Western world. This comes from a member of parliament who, in the last parliament, wanted to put a 15 per cent tax on everything-that is, food, clothing and the very same goods that he now refers to. Mr Richard Evans-They are all going up.",92
258,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,92
259,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Here is the graph.,92
260,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is that for wholesale sales tax? Coming back from Sydney in the aircraft today I picked up a copy of this week's Time magazine. Mr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145 relating to relevance. I asked the Prime Minister a fairly simple question. It does not require him to pull out a bulletin that he has read on a flight. It is a simple question: is it a fact that the sales tax increase is going to cost the average family $60 a week?",92
261,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There is no point of order. I again refer the honourable member for Isaacs, as I do all members in this place, to the discussion paper that was put out by Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Procedure. I refer members to pages 8 and 9 where it refers to the relevance of answers. I again say that, if members have some concerns about the issue, they should respond to this committee.",92
262,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition was holding up some charts about Australia's debt, making a point about the state of the Australian economy and the state of Australia. I was reading this article called 'Tough tests'. It says: The Maastricht criteria for ED countries joining a single currency require a budget deficit of no more than three per cent of GDP and government debt of less than 60 per cent of GDP. Then it is marked in yellow that: Only three nations make the grade. This is in Time magazine. Those nations are Luxembourg, Germany and Ireland. The question for those 15 European nations is effectively what the dowry is to join in partnership with the German mark; what dowry is needed to marry yourself to the German mark. Australia would have come in second. With a budget surplus-no other country would have had a budget surplus; not one-we would have come in first. Mr Costello-Are we going to join the ERM?",92
263,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, your indulgence has run out. You will not interject.",92
264,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am just making the point: the opposition can hold up charts and talk about debt. But on the test that matters most in Western Europe, on the bulk of the largest conglomeration of economic states in the world in Europe-that test is to join the single market-Australia would have been one of two or three countries able to join on the basis of its budget surplus and its government debt. Government debt of Ireland is 85 per cent; of Germany it is 58 per cent. From recollection, government debt of Australia is 16 per cent. If we want some measures about how Australia is doing, we would have come second out of the 15 states in respect of joining the single market. Let us keep these things in some general context. Let me make this clear to the honourable gentleman: is he saying that he will repeal the wholesale sales tax measures were they to become the government of Australia? Is that what you are saying? Will you repeal them? Mr Atkinson-Answer the question.",92
265,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Isaacs!,92
266,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know. You are not saying that. You are not saying you will repeal them, are you? Mr Atkinson-Through more tax.",92
267,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Isaacs, just take a breath.",92
268,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are very solemn and very quiet about that. You are not saying you will repeal them. The opposition talks about the growth in the wholesale sales tax in this country. That is in part because the economy has grown so much in 12 years. You get more tax from more growth. Is that not funny? Is that not a revelation?,92
269,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,93
270,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Otder! The House will come to order. Those on my left!,93
271,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is that not a revelation? Mrs Sullivan-And you are taxing them more.,93
272,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Moncrieff!,93
273,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You get more tax from more growth. The more people buy whitegoods or some of the other items of manufacturing equipment or other substances or other things whiCh are sales taxed, the more tax they pay. That is why the sales tax rises. The general point that Australians are interested in is the total tax take-not the wholesale sales tax. In respect of the total tax take, Australia is the second lowest taxed country in the world. That was not always so. It was not true under the member for Bennelong when he had his sticky fingers in the Treasury till. It was not the case then. It has been the case in declines of government spending under this government. When this government came to office, government spending was 30'12 per cent of GDP. It is now around 26 per cent of GDP, and it is heading back to 23.8 per cent. It is a full six per cent of GDP smaller spending than when John Howard was last a minister and Treasurer of this country. And, Mr Speaker, guess what? If you spend less, you need to tax less. That is why there has been less taxation under a Labor governmentOpposition members-Ha, hal",93
274,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,93
275,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me remind people: what was the top tax rate under J. W. Howard? Sixty per cent. He was Mr 60 per cent. What is it today? Forty-seven per cent. What was the bottom tax rate under Mr Howard? Thirty per cent. What is it now? Twenty per cent. Mr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: understanding order 145, I think I have been reasonably tolerant, and so have you. The Prime Minister has covered everything else except the answer to the question of why families are paying $60 a week extra in sales tax.",93
276,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister has been talking about sales tax. As far as I understand, he is still talking about tax. I would invite him to bring his answer to an end.",93
277,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We will have to send him down to the comer to play with the cars again. The bottom rate has dropped from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. The top rate has dropped from 60 per cent, under John Howard's treasurership, to 47 per cent tax, and the tax-free threshold has risen. When we look at the revenue and, therefore, the tax levied on Australians, we see that this is a lightly taxed country. This would not be so under a high taxing coalition government. The high taxation specialist is the coalition, the Liberal and National parties-the super tax merchants. We saw it at the last election, we have seen it in the past, and were they in office we would see it again. Media Ownership Laws",93
278,Mr SIMMONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask the Minister for Communications and the Arts: will he advise the House about recently announced changes to strengthen media laws? Is he aware of alternative proposals? Is he able to advise on the implications of these proposals for ownership and control of major mass media assets?,93
279,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The cross-media ownership rules passed by this parliament are designed to encourage diversity of ownership in the media. The changes which the government announced on Tuesday night will strengthen and buttress the cross-media ownership rules, and that is something which we believe will limit cross-media holdings, whether it be print, television or radio. These changes are a considered response to the report to the government from the Australian Broadcasting Authority. Despite claims by the Leader of the Opposition, they are not directed at any individual because the 15 per cent cap applies just as much to News Limited's investment in Channel 7 as it does to Channel 9' s investment in Fairfax. What it does is provide more certainty for the industry because it provides, for the first time, a tightening of the net for the definition of 'quasi equity' and puts the cap at 15 per cent and also maintains that control test for less than 15 per cent. For all of these reasons, the government believes that these changes are the right policy response to the ABA's report. That can be contrasted with comments that have been made in the last 48 hours by certain members of the opposition. Senator Alston, the opposition's official spokesman for communications, was asked on Tuesday night whether a coalition government would reverse these changes. He said, 'Well, there's not much here to reverse.' Yet on Wednesday morning the Leader of the Opposition said,  He said, 'It's just a KO Kerry exercise.' But the previous night, according to AAP, Senator Alston said our proposals were expanding the types of shares covered by the act and that was overdue. But on Wednesday morning the Leader of the Opposition said that this was Packer specific and prejudiced, biased legislation. But on Tuesday night Senator Alston said, 'It's a step in the right direction.' On Tuesday night what was long overdue and was, according to Senator Alston, a step in the right direction, was, by Wednesday morning, according to the member for Bennelong, prejudiced, biased legislation and  ing to feel a bit sorry for Senator Alston. Is it any wonder he gets tangled up when the opposition, after 12 years, still does not have a media policy? So is it any wonder that Senator Alston is getting confused? The only firm statement we have on crossmedia owership from the opposition is the Leader of the Opposition's commitment to abolish the cross-media ownership rules. He thinks we should only rely on the Trade Practices Act-the Trade Practices Act that he weakened and the member for Holt had to strengthen. And when the member for Holt introduced the changes to strengthen it the Deputy Leader of the Opposition opposed the changes. So the Leader of the Opposition says that we should only rely on the Trade Practices Act, even after the chairman of the Trade Practices Commission says that means there are no limits on cross-media ownership.",93
280,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I wonder how he will vote on the amendments.,94
281,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It will be very interesting to watch how you vote on those amendments. All of this could be cleared up for Senator Alston, to stop him getting into these tangles, if the Leader of the Opposition would answer just one question: would a Howard government permit someone to own a newspaper and a television station in the same city? You had the hide to be interjecting on the Treasurer, 'Tell us your policy.' We have been waiting for three months for you to tell us whether a future Howard government, if it is ever elected, would let someone own a newspaper and a television station in the same city. You have refused to answer for three months. All he ever says to us is that all will be revealed at a time of his choosing.",94
282,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That's right. You've got it right.,94
283,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Our information is that, when all is revealed, all we will get is some vague promise for an inquiry or some vague promise for a review-maybe even some vague promise for a people's convention to decide media policy. The Leader of the Opposition will do anything to avoid a decision. He will do anything to avoid showing some leadership on this. He will do everything to avoid telling us whether or not he thinks someone should own a newspaper and a television station in the same city. Prime Minister",94
284,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My questionMr Leo MCLeay-Tell us! Tell us now!,94
285,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,94
286,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will start answering questions in this place when you come second after the next election. My question is addressed to the member for Blaxland. As this is the last question time this session, I remind the member for Blaxland of his promise on his first day as leader of the Australian Labor Party when he pledged to 'deal honestly with the people', to 'tell them the truth', and to 'resist the temptation to gild the lily'. Will he concede the truth to all Australians today that his prime ministership has delivered tragically high levels of youth unemployment, massive pressures on home buyers, uncertainties amongst elderly people, long waiting lists for public hospital treatment, a more unequal society, heavy burdens for families and small business and a current account deficit that is worse than that of Mexico? Is it not a fact that, when it comes to the Prime Minister telling his version of the truth, Australians have simply stopped listening?",94
287,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There was one principal commitment on which this government was re-elected; that was, to bring down unemployment. That is what the government did. It has brought down unemployment now to under nine per cent-down to 8lh per cent from over 10 per cent. In the last 12 months we have had the largest fall in unemployment on record. As a consequence, we have had job growth of 630,000 since the last election. That was the principal issue of the last election campaign-employment. It is on this that the government kept complete fidelity with the Australian people. Not only that; the other thing I said on election night was that we wouldn'tMr Richard Evans-Infidelity! Infidelity!",95
288,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Cowan has been warned constantly this afternoon. He will cease interjecting. He has been given a formal warning now.,95
289,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On election night I said we would not leave the unemployed behind. We introduced a $1.6 billion policy in Working Nation to deal with long-term unemployment. The success we are having to date is now that just on a quarter is going to the long-term unemployed. They are the facts. That is what, for a start, wipes the Leader of the Opposition's question away. The Leader of the Opposition talks about the burden on home owners. We have had massive falls in interest rates· over the period.",95
290,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Twenty-seven per cent.,95
291,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will have his chance in a moment.,95
292,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The housing affordability index is now up again for people to buy a home. We have seen sustained falls in interest rates. We have seen housing interest rates fall in this very week and last week with fixed rates again under eight per cent. As a consequence of that, we are seeing housing affordability rise and the level of home ownership rise. The Leader of the Opposition also talked about uncertainty for the elderly. These are the same elderly people he left at under 22 per cent of average weekly earnings. We now have the age pension at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, a very large free area which is now removed totally from the tax system, plus huge increases in rent assistance for pensioners renting privately. I point to the hide of the Leader of the Opposition to even dare mention these categories of people, when he saw their real standard of living fall, when he was prepared to see the real value of the age pension rot, when he was prepared to see his massive interest rate policies lead to a tremendous burden on home owners, and when he was prepared to see over 11 per cent unemployment with no prospect of repairing it. That is the government's record, and the government stands very proudly on that record. In this parliament, on this side of the House, we believe in those dual aims of high employment growth and reasonable wage remuneration. I refer the parliament to what was said by Robert Reich, the US Labor Secretary, about the United States, about high employment growth and falling real wages for 15 years; or Europe with high real wages and terrible employment growth. This government has brought Australia up the middle, with high employment growthMr Costello-And low wages.",95
293,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,and affordable growing levels of remuneration. Mr Costello-That's not true.,95
294,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The very burden of the question is about the incidence of the weight of government policy on people, yet the questioner, as I said before, has opposed every wage increase since 1981, bar two. He supported a $16 wage increase in 14 years; that is all he has ever done. Yet he has the temerity to get up and talk about battlers, he gave himself away in saying, 'We've been battling for battlers for a week' when the Labor Party has been battling for them for a century. When we introduced in the budget the occupational superannuation change to give Australian working people the right to put away and have for their retirement 15 per cent of their income and to add to national savings, what .did he say? He would crimp it at where the SGC now stands and give them tax concessions. When tax concessions were the order of the day there was· only a 40 per cent coverage, and there is now a 90 per cent coverage. Not only would this be a bad thing to do in economic terms, in national savings terms, but it would be a very harsh thing to do to Australians, who finally under a Labor government have got themselves the right to a decent retirement income by accessing the superannuation provisions-which the Leader of the Opposition, never learning, now says he wants to crimp and leave the SGC. On those big brush issues-employment; complete fidelity by the government with the long-term unemployed; support for families by increases in family support, the guardians allowance, maternity leave,the home childcare allowance, the generalised child-care rebate-these were all specifics in the last election campaign and they have all been delivered. On top of that, the thing that we did not promise people but happily have been able to give them is 15 per cent occupational superannuation by the year 2002 for the rest of their lives, so that no Australian will be able to go into retirement worried about their income. Also, in Accord Mark VIII, in this last week, we have seen the payment of decent increases under enterprise bargainingand a safety net for those who cannot access it-of $10 to $12 a week, and $11 to $14 for those on awards only. . In this area of the social wage, economic growth and opportunity, leaving aside the other great things like access and equity in health and education, and these high participawell. tion rates, the government has stayed completely faithful to its creed of a century: to and make its policies relevant and helpful to the Australian working people. That is what it has done and that is what it has been very proud to be able to do. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",95
295,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS ON NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on 9 March 1995 I asked questions Nos 2203 and 2204 of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, which asked those ministers how many formal functions associated with their ministerial responsibilities had they attended outside the parliament since 20 February 1994 that necessitated their absence between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. during meetings of the House. As these questions have considerable significance to the conduct of this place and have not been answered, could you please take action understanding order 150 and write to those ministers requesting an urgent answer?",96

I ask you to reflect on what has happened and if you could give the House a statement at the appropriate time. We do not, however, accept the practice that was followed today. In our view, if a question is totally out. of order you have no choice, on the basis of precedent, but to pass the next question to the other side.",97
301,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I will give you my answer now. In the course of the afternoon whilst question time was going on I did give some thought to it and I find that the member for Flinders generally has raised a valid point. I will endeavour to act accordingly. Question Time,97
302,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"My question is on the exact same point as that raised by the member for Flinders. I recently asked a question of the Special Minister of State in question time and he took the point that it related to matters outside his ministerial responsibility and was, therefore, not within standing orders. If the precedent applied today to the question of the member for Throsby, which was outside standing orders, is applied, then I or any coalition questioner who asks a question of a minister which is outside his responsibility is entitled to ask a replacement question.",97

305,Mr BEAZLEY,PAPERS,"1 present papers on the following subjects, being petitions which are not in accordance with the standing and sessional orders of the House: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament The petition of certain citizens of Australia calls for the immediate release of the Gari Fourteen, a group of buddhist nuns from Gari nunnery, unjustly imprisoned by Chinese Authorities in Tibet. Furthermore, we ask that the Australia government exert maximum pressure upon the People's Republic of China in order to secure their immediate release by: (a) sending an official representative from the Australian Embassy' in Beijing to take up their case with the appropriate Chinese authorities in Tibet. (b) raising the issue of the Gari Fourteen as a 'matter of urgency' with the Chinese Ambassador presently residing in Canberra. (c) committing the Australian government and its respective agencies to placing the issue of women political prisoners on the agenda for discussion at the United Nations 4th World Conference on Women to be held in Beijing in 1995. We, the undersigned, humbly request that urgent and strenuous efforts be made to develop a nursing home for the Mossman area. With a large and increasing aged population, the Douglas Shire already has a pressing need for dedicated nursing home beds and Mossman Hospital simply is not funded for such care. Consequently all nursing home type patients must be placed outside this area with considerable distress to families and to patients, many of whom have lived in Mossman all their lives. Due to travel time and distance they face a loss of contact, reduction in quality of life and severe difficulty for their lies in maintaining support and contact. We request that urgent consideration be given to specific funding of a nursing home facilitY'in our ShireTo the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the need for changes to the Family Law Act of Australia and to the Child Support Scheme. Your petitioners therefore request that the House support the following changes: 1. That the existing Family Law Act be scrapped and replaced by a more simplified version together with the minimum of rules and regulations necessary. 2. That The Family Court be replaced by a Tribunal and that all matters resulting from divorce and family breakdown be heard before, and determined by a panel; the panel to be made up of persons qualified in matters arising from family breakdown. 3.

To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament. The Petition of Certain Citizens of Australia draw the attention of the House to: In 1994 over 2,500,000 Pension cheques were paid into banks. Banking services, like clean water, electricity, Food and Housing are a basic need, NOT a luxury, in this day and Age it is impossible to live without a bank account. Two thirds of Australians 1.64 million Aged Pensioners live on less than $200 a week, with fewer resources and greater levels of disability, they are the hardest hit by fees and charges for famiover the counter services. Older People on Low Incomes can ill afford these extra costs imposed by banks on low account balances. We strongly oppose any call from banks for the Department of Social Security to provide a subsidy to meet the cost of bank fees for pensioners. With $19 Billion per year, Pensions paid into banks, plus $3.4 Billion in Pensioner Deeming accounts and latest bank profits $5.2 Billion, profits up 81 per cent. We call for the banks to be directed to provide access to a basic banking service NA LICENCES' We call for Federal and State governments to take steps to reduce the burden of these iniquitous taxes immediately, we, your Petitioners humbly pray. NA Prime Minister",97
306,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, nameiy: The failure of the Prime Minister to understand the real concerns of Australians and to recognise the pain inflicted by his Government on families, individuals, communities and the nation. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",98
307,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If anybody in this parliament were to ask Australians to sum up the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), they would invariably come up with one word. They would not come up with the word that he would like them to come up with, and that is the word 'leadership'; they would come up with another word that he finds distinctly uncomfortable, and that is the word 'arrogance'. He has arrogance of a personal kind; he has arrogance of a political kind; he has arrogance of an economic kind; and he has arrogance of an offensive un-Australian kind, which sits like stigmata on the head of the entire Keating government. It was with arrogance that the Prime Minister of Australia, after only five minutes of economic sunshine, told the Australian people that 'this is as good as it ever gets'. He wonders why, through the length and breadth of Australia in 1995, he is regarded as an arrogant man. Yet having gone through the worse recession in 60 years with stilI a tragically high level of youth unemployment, with Australian home buyers now seeing 27 per cent of median family income devoured to pay off a home versus 19 per cent in 1983 and with Australians recognising that they and their families are labouring under a foreign debt that has increased by 600 per cent since 1983, he wonders why he is called arrogant. He wonders why so many Australians have now simply stopped listening to him. Mr Costello-Why isn'the here?",98
308,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition interjects, 'Why isn'the here?' Of course, the Prime Minister's reply is: 'Well, you lot finished second.' I have got news for the Prime Minister: whenever the next election is held it will not be us who finish second; it will be the mob over on the other side who finish second. The reason why, above everything else, they will finish second is that the Australian people have caught up with the Prime Minister. The Australian people have caught up with the fact that he is an arrogant person. After 12 years they have got rather tired of all the empty promises, of all the empty rhetoric, of all the lies, of all the deception and of all the misleading of the Australian people. They have caught up with the fact that he promised them things before the last election that he was not able to deliver. increasingly arrogant style, what does the Prime Minister say? He says, 'The Australian people respect the fact that I get the mail through.' Let me say to the Prime Minister: yes, he does get the mail through but the problem is that only his mates get the cheques while those in mainstream Australia have letterboxes full of junk mail and bills. He can talk about getting the mail through; he can talk, in his typically arrogant style, about how he will answer questions when it suits him; and he can talk about people who come second. But, unfortunately for him, and unfortunately for many of his colleagues who hold marginal seats, it is the Australian people who feel that they are coming second under his stewardship. The Australian people feel that after 12 years they are entitled to something better than bluster, insult and arrogance. After 12 years they are entitled to wonder why it is that this country has the worse current account deficit in the industrialised world. I can think of few things that are more humiliating and insulting to the proud Australian nation than to be told that our trade deficit is worse than Mexico's. I can think of few things that are more offensive and more insulting than to be told that. There is an interesting atmosphere around the parliament today. There is an atmosphere that something that was meant to come to a climax did not come to a climax. I wonder whether it is due to the fact that the plan of the Prime Minister was to have an early election. When you actually go through it, you get a very interesting scene. To use military parlance, you have fired all those 25-pounders, but somehow or other none of them has hit their target. Let us go through them. You had the disaster of the Canberra by-election-it is a fascinating study in political combat and political science-that brought our colleague over here, the member for Canberra, (Mr Smyth), into the House. It was not just the average by-election swing; it was the biggest by-election swing in modern Australian political history. That was achieved in the In his heartland of a town that was regarded as welded onto the Labor Party and he secured a swing of 16.7 per cent. It was a very great result. What was the reaction of the government? The government said, 'Right, we are going to take this seriously. We are now going to keep our nose to the grindstone. We are now going to govern in the interests of all the Australian people.' Do you know what it did? It produced the budget. The first shell out of 25-pounder was the budget. That was meant to demolish the opposition. But, somehow other, it did not quite work like that. I smiled to myself today when the Prime Minister said that we would not let him into our confidence about what our policies were. I say· to those sitting opposite: do you that I knew what the government was going to do with the Commonwealth Bank a long time before you did? I, in fact, predicted the government was going to do with the that Commonwealth Bank the weekend before the budget. Do you know when you were told Minister about the sale of the Commonwealth Bank? You were told at 6.30 on the night budget. You were told an hour before the budget was released when the Commonwealth Bank was going to be sold. The budget did not quite hit the mark; something went wrong. Maybe the Australian people are a little cynical of somebody who for 12 years said that it is akin to burning down the gum tree to sell the Commonwealth Bank and then suddenly, because he wants the dough and nothing else, he marches in and says that it is an inspired piece of policy. struck a very discordant note. The Australian people thought to themselves that that is not really fair dinkum. If the bloke was really opposed to selling the Commonwealth Bank, if he really believed in public ownership, really believed in the legacy of Ben Chifley, whether he needed the dough or not, he would have held onto the Commonwealth Bank. There is something cheap and tawdry about a man who gets into paroxysms of principle in opposing the sale of the Commonwealth ment. Bank but, when it really comes to the crunch and he needs the money, he capitulates and he parades his free market credentials. I think the Australian people see through a hypocrite and a humbug-and they have got one now as a of Prime Minister. I think they see through him, and that is one of the reasons why the shell that came out of that 25-pounder did not the mark. Then there was the really big one-the republic. That was really going to wipe the smile off every face over here. With the the almost unanimous support of· the federal parliamentary press gallery and with· the or unanimous support of every newspaper around Australia-we might have noticed, just in passing, some a little more than othersMr Costello--What about the Australian?",99
309,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No. The government know paraded that one out. This was going to demolish us. He thought the great line was, 'Don't you favour having an Australian head what of state?' Do you know what the subtext for was? It was that they over there are better Australians than we are. What the Prime of Australia was basically trying to do was to set Australian against Australian in of the that particular debate. I would say to those who sit opposite that the reason why that one did not find the mark is that the Australianpeople once again saw through that. The Australian people know very well that, no matter who wins the next election, they are going to have a vote to determine the constitutional future of this country. They know dam well that, if they vote for the Liberal and National parties, they will have a greater range of choice than if That they vote for the Australian Labor Party. It is ironic-many of those who sit on the Labor Party side must feel a little uncomfortable-that was going to be your king hit if he issue, wasn't it? You were really going to wipe the floor with us on this issue, but somehow or other that did not work either. The big 'R' word did not really bring home the bacon, did it? It is a bit like many of those failed budgets of the past: it just did not quite work. Instead of it splintering the opposition, it has turned sour on the governAustralians all around this country know there are passionate Australians on both sides of the constitutional argument. It is not a test who is the better Australian; it is a test of what is the better system of government for the future benefit of all Australians. Then hit something happened along the way to the secretary-generalship of the United Nations. Mr Costello--Gareth Gareth.",100
310,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He is not called 'Gareth Gareth' for nothing. Something happened. Ever so faintly, he said, 'Please, monsieur. Don't let off ze bombs.' There was no stridency. There was not the strength of a foreign minister who walks with power, fervour and passion on behalf of his countrymen. Government members talk about nationalism; they talk about independence; they talk about Australian sovereignty. If ever a man failed the test of robust Australianism, it was Gareth Evans with his pathetic performance in Tokyo. He really failed to match the nation's need. All you lot opposite have done since then is play catch-up politics. That is all you done. It is always 'me too, please', 'don't forget me' and 'please include me in your acknowledgments'. The Prime Minister has been reduced to nothing more than a pathetic letter writer to French newspapers. He has never displayed any leadership on this issue. He has said that, because we supported the American nuclear deterrent in the 1970s and 1980s throughout the Cold War, in some way we have no right to express our opposition to French nuclear testing. He lies about the attitude of the member for Mayo (Mr Downer) and he lies about my attitude",100
311,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will withdraw that remark.,101
312,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, then, he misrepresents us. He is deceitful to the Australian people-this is more explicit and more precise-about the attitude of the member for Mayo and my attitude. Our position is very simple. Of course I supported the American deterrent during the Cold War. Every sane Australian did. There are a few insane ones opposite who did not. Now that the Cold War is over and now that the Soviet Union has disintegrated, we are living in a completely new world. It seems as though the only people who have not realised that the great majority of the . Australian community felt that are the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). Ever since that fateful press conference in Tokyo, which has buried for all time Gareth's prospects of ever leading the Australian Labor Party-he knows that; his crest-fallen countenance ever since is a very good illustrationMr MCGauran-Kim likes this.",101
313,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Kim is pretty happy. He is a new man. Look at those colourful ties. The Right took a collection and bought him a suit. May I say, I respect his relative sartorial splendour. I think it is terrific. Something has happened. We had this marvellous sort of intention. I think the whole idea was to fire off all these 25-pounders, demolish the opposition and send us packing have in disarray. And then what were they going to do? The Prime Minister was going to trot out to the viceroy, as Gough Whitlam used to call him, and get a dissolution. Something has happened. Somehow or other there has been a disconnection between the will of the government and the wishes of the Australian people. The Australian people are saying very clearly to all of us in parliament, 'We the Australian people have stopped listening to this man and we the Australian people think that after 12 years he should have done a little better as he has had his hands on all of the levers for all of the time, as he never tires of telling us.' He is a remarkable Prime Minister. He keeps saying that he has all the hands on all the levers, yet somehow or other things keep going wrong. The Australian people say that after 12 years we should not have a worse current account deficit than Mexico's. They say that after 12 years we should not be paying more to service housing loans than we were paying in 1983. They cannot understand that after 12 years our foreign debt has gone up by 600 per cent. They cannot understand that after 12 years the average unemployment rate is higher than it was under the Fraser government. They cannot understand why real interest rates are now double what they were during the Fraser period of government. They cannot understand why the Australian dollar has sunk to such abysmally low,proportions. They cannot understand that we have a 27.4 per cent youth unemployment level and, above all, they cannot understand why the Prime Minister of Australia is so arrogant and out of touch with the wishes of mainstream Australia. Arrogance would be bad enough if he had something to be arrogant about, but if ever a man has nothing to be arrogant about, it is the Prime Minister after what he has done to this country over the last 12 years.",101
314,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Once the proud boast of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was that he was the most conservative politician that had ever led the Liberal Party. Once it was the proud boast of the Leader of the Opposition that he provided the intellectual leadership of the Liberal Party and of the nation. He would be the person who would put in place a raft of Liberal Party policies that would overcome what he thought was his humiliation in the period that he was Treasurmore er of this country, from 1977 to 1983, at Malcolm Fraser's hands. He would be the man who would put it all together. He would be the man who would deregulate our economy. He would be the man who would send Australia down the road to a new future. What has he become? He has become timid, presenting as small a policy ball to kick around as he possibly can, and hoping that Australians are sufficiently ahistorical not remember either his record in government or his record as Leader of the Opposition. His record was one of the most vehement hostility to the life and prospects of the ordinary Australian in this country. He set a test for this government. With great rhetoric and to the applause of his backbenchers he said, 'What a humiliation-Australia with a current account deficit behind that of Mexico.' Let me inform the Leader of the Opposition, if he regards that as the most massive national humiliation ever imposed upon this nation, that the year he became Treasurer of this nation Mexico's current account deficit was half the size of Australia's. The year he left the Treasury, booted out as Treasurer by the Australian public, the Australian current account deficit was half the size of Mexico's. If that is what the opposition leader puts down as a criterion for whether or not we ought to re-elect this government and as a lodestone by which we ought to measure the achievements of governments present and past, on his own test in government he most miserably failed. That was his position on that. He has been wandering around the country talking about five minutes of sunshine. We have had four years of growth. We have had in the last three years 630,000 jobs. We have had a continuation out of recession and through into recovery of an inflation rate of three per cent-something you could never hope to achieve. Interest rates for the average householder in his term of office did not fall below the level to which they have now risen. If you want to take those comparisons-which he is always terribly reluctant for us to do, to have regard to history; those opposite have talked a bit about history and I will have to say about that later-let me go through them. The bank housing rate when John Howard left office was 12.5 per cent. The current bank housing rate is 10.5. The building society rate when Howard left office was 13.9 per cent. The current building society rate is 10.5. The bank housing loan rate was 13.5 per cent in December 1982 and the building society housing loan rate was 14.8. He sneers at that to achievement on jobs. The fundamental promise that the Labor Party made at the last election was that we would reach out our arms to the unemployed and give them an opportunity-630,000 jobs later-to continue our record which has seen, since we have been in office, the annual growth rate per year in jobs in this country at 161,000. Under John Howard as Treasurer, the average annual growth rate in jobs was 51,000. Our level of growth is more than three times that achieved by the Leader of the Opposition when he was in office. John Howard talks about whether or not this is a government for the battlers. He sneers at the fact that he thinks I buy my suits in circumstances that most Australians buy them. He sneers at the fact that he thinks the parliamentary Labor Party provides me with tiesMr Stephen Smith-We do.",102
315,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will own up to the fact that one member of the parliamentary Labor Party has provided me with the odd tie, but others have not. Nevertheless, this great defender of the battlers has to contemplate his record on things that are serious-such as the social wage. The social wage, which includes all those things that relate to the family support measures that have been put in place-and we have introduced many of them while we have been in office, but some were already there as hangovers from the Whitlam government when it was in power-fell 17 per cent in real terms while John Howard was Treasurer, and he made a virtue of that. Under us, and in a period of extraordinary restraint, the social wage has risen by something like 70 per cent in real terms since we have been in office. Mr Gibson-Seventy-eight per cent.",102
316,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am corrected; it was 78 per cent. The Leader of the Opposition has become a small policy fur ball-the sort of thing you cough up every now and then, but you do not dissect. He does not want any form of dissection of his policy positions. He does not want any dissection simply because he thinks it is a clever political tactic. It is not that. He does not want any dissection because he knows that, if you crack open the Liberal Party policy bank, you will find a series of unpalatable policies that will not work. You will discover an opposition too tired to come out with a sensible set of propositions to take the country forward. He realises that the views he held were tried around the Western world in the 1980s and produced a massive thumbs down around the Western world in the 1990s. He has nothing further to add. He speaks with pride about his idea of a people's convention. His idea of a people's convention is to avoid a decision. Let me quote from an interesting article written by Alex Mitchell in the Sun-Herald recently. It reads: Two years ago, I had a private discussion with a very senior Liberal. At that time, Prime Minister Keating had nailed his republican ideals to the mast and I asked how the Liberal Party intended responding. ""No worries. We can kick the whole thing into touch by calling for a people's convention. The people's convention is a perfect talking shop. It will keep the issue off the party political agenda and the election agenda. With a people's convention up and running, the Liberal Party would not have to say or do anything about the republic. It would effectively bury the issue for as long as we want it."" I really wonder who that senior Liberal was! Later on in the conversation, the senior Liberal said: I am a monarchist. I was born a monarchist and I will die a monarchist. I would bet London to a brick that that senior Liberal whom he had a conversation with was none other than JWH. He talks with pride about his people's convention. Let us see how that people's convention emerged. John Howard produced the most tired response conceivably possible to the vision that the Prime Minister presented. His first response included the statement: 'We are going to have a people's convention. What we are going to do with that people's convention is not put anything on the republic; we will put to the people's convention whether or not we should change the external affairs power which protects our environment and protects people's wages.' That is what he said he would put to the convention. Having said that that was the only issue he wanted to put to the people's convention, he found he had to retreat from that position. He said, 'Perhaps we will put a republican issue to the people's convention.' He was asked, 'What if your rigged people's convention didn't work it out?' He said, 'Then we would put a policy proposition on a republican convention to the people in two bites-one a consultative referendum and the other a constitutional referendum.' Since when has any proposition on the constitution been carried by a party that put it forward and opposed it? Since when has any proposition on the constitution ever been put up by a party that decides that what it will do is put it forward and then oppose it? Alan Ramsey summed up the value of the Leader of the Opposition based on the performance which provoked that extraordinary retreating reaction. He said: His speech two nights ago was that dreadful it was facile, contrived, pedestrian and disingenuous. It had no commitment, no passion and no clarity. It revived all the flaws that brought him undone that first time six years ago. It marked him perhaps fatally as truly yesterday's man. It exposed him more brutally than ever as a leader locked into past; as a politician of indecision, no courage, guile, no ideas, no true understanding of his own country in the 1990s and no feel for the future. it wasn't complete humbug, it was absolute political disaster. Indeed, it was. That absolute political disaster produced a three-day gallop, and he revised policy on the convention. He had one advanthe tage from that gallop: he did not have defend exactly how the people's convention would be created. The people's going to be started by having 50 per cent appointed. The old government of the day is going to make absolutely certain that it is a well and truly rigged people's convention. If those opposite were ever to get into office and put a republican proposition to the people, it would be bowdlerised in such a way that no-one with any common sense oldest would support it. This is a man and a party which have, in the course of the 1980s, moved from attempting to come to grips with higher principle, have walked back from all develop policy. of that and are now desperately asking the public, 'Please, find everything you can conceivably object to about the government. Vote in a hollow shell of a leader, vote in hollow shell of a front bench.' When we got into office in this country, every single member of the Labor Party front bench was a household name because they election had developed policy and had been prepared get to test and argue it with the public-and Barry Jones was one of them. There is not one member of the Liberal Party front bench-outside the Leader of the Liberal polls, Party and his deputy, and now the foreign affairs spokesman-who can be named by more than 10 per cent of the Australian population-not one. That is because there no intellectual leadership. They are a tired crew. It is an unbelievable thing to say but it leader. is nevertheless true. After 12 years in office, the government's front-bench is on average two years younger than the opposition's front-bench. It is an extraordinary statement to make but it is true. As far as I can see, the only role the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) performs is to lower the average age of Liberal Party front-bench. He has had nothing the to say about economic policy. He has develno oped no economic policy. If he were removed If from the Liberal Party front bench, that twoyear difference would go up to something like 2Y2 or three years. They are a totally tired policy-free zone. There is only one element of the Leader of Opposition's tactic which I think is to sensible-that is, when he develops his policies he does not confront the Liberal Party convention is backbench with it. Mr MCGauran-Laurie Oakes caught you on Tony Blair.",103
317,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, he did not. The only thing I would agree with him on is that I would not bother consulting the Liberal Party backbench on a matter of policy. They are the pack of time servers, a total bunch of . wasters. Leave them alone. Leave them out there. Unfortunately, the demands of democracy are that you get up on your hind legs and You should do the sort of thing Tony Blair does. This is a good role for oppositions. Tony Blair does exactly what we did in the a early 1980s: he restructures party policy, gets his party spokespeople to come out with policies well in advance, discusses them with the British people and refines them down to day. It is not a matter of, 'You will our policies in the election.' It is a matter of, 'You get our policies straight away . You have an opportunity to interact with those policies.' When the time comes to go to the that emerges as a platform. That is what Tony Blair does. I know that and Laurie Oakes, I am afraid to say, did not. Helen Trinca got that analysis of Tony Blair wrong. is Tony Blair happens to be a genuine opposiold tion leader, not a tired, recycled opposition The Leader of the Opposition objects to the fact that we are not calling an immediate election after his having said for the last few months that all we ever wanted to do was call an early election. He objects to the fact that no early election is being called and that it was never foreshadowed by this govern the ment-for one reason and one reason only. What on earth is he going to say for the next nine to 12 months? You can make yourself a fur ball and roll around the ground for a few months, but there is no chance whatsoever that you can make yourself a fur ball for another nine to 12 months. You will not get away with that. This MPI comes from a tired old fellow and we need take no notice of it. (Time expired)",104
318,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That was a somewhat disappointing speech from the new Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley). I remind the Deputy Prime Minister of one policy area where Labor has completely failed and that is in the area of uranium policy. None other than former Prime Minister Mr Bob Hawke has described your uranium policy as illogical, yet you persist with that illogical three mines uranium policy. This is another example of Labor's policy vacuum. In relation to the republic, it is the coalition which has a legitimate policy to include people in the review of our constitution a-ter its operation for some 100 years. Our polI-y involves looking at the path that AustralIa correctly pursued in the 1890s when it originally formulated the constitution for the Commonwealth of Australia. It involves a fair dinkum people's convention and a fair dinkum set of questions being put to the people by way of a referendum. The coalition will have a referendum on the question of whether Australia should become a republic. Contrast that with Labor's approach that we have to cop it sweet, we have to cop its model of the republic, we will get no input i-to what th.at model will be and we can take It or leave It.",105
319,Mr HOLDING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,You don't believe in a repUblic.,105
320,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I concede that the member interjecting might be a full-on republican, but he will be endangered by that process. That is the wrong way of putting a fair set of questions to the people of Australia. The House is debating a matter of public importance which relates to the failure of this Prime Minister to understand the concerns of Australians. His failure was revealed very starkly again during question time today. The Prime Minister said, on assuming the leadership of the Labor Party, 'I will tell the truth.' He said at the time of the 1993 election, 'What I am promising is not to put up taxes.' The budget papers detail that real growth in taxation revenue will increase by 10.3 per cent this financial year, which finishes tomorrow. Next financial year there will be an additional increase of 9.3 per cent in the tax take. This federal Labor government continues to grab more and more by way of taxation. From Saturday 1 July, sales tax will go up. Not only will the rate go up but there are other factors involved as well. In relation to rate increases, it was revealed in the 1993 budget that the wholesale sales tax rate will jump from $435 million to $585 million to $1,207 million to $1,345 million over the four financial years to 1996-97. What we have is a government that is getting bigger and bigger on the backs of blue-collar workers. It is doing that in a very unfair, unjust and unreasonable way. It is getting bigger and bigger on the backs of families who a-e battling to survive in very tough economIC times. If members would like an insight into this problem-and perhaps government members are so out of touch that they need to be reminded-I remind the House of what the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures said today in a survey report. It stated: New South Wales manufacturers say they expect to shed about 2,600 jobs in the next 12 months because of a severe downtum in business, according to a survey released today. The NSW Chamber of Manufacturers and State Bank June quarter survey found any improved conditions in early 1994 had evaporated and manufacturers put the blame on higher interest rates, increases in sales tax and a slump in the building industry. Listen to this: The NSW Chamber's chief executive, Philip Holt, said the survey highlighted the difficulties facing the manufacturing sector. ""The picture painted by the survey demonstrat-s the dilemma faced by the government and AustralIa ""While the current account deficit careers out of control, we have lost control of interest rates-the single most important barrier to investment in manufacturing. "" Mr Holt said Chamber members had told him they feared another recession. State Bank chief economist Hans Kunnen said the survey showed a clear downturn in the economy. That is from the real world where Labor members hesitate to venture. That article was about a survey released today. I want to examine the government's lack of performance and take up another challenge of the Deputy Prime Minister. He was extolling the virtues of the government's front-bench team. I concede that sometimes those of us in the lower house forget to look across the corridor to the Senate and to examine the other portion of the Labor government's front-bench teamthe Senate ministerial team. When we examine the monumental lack of leadership coming from this government, what do we find? The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) is enduring his worse fortnight ever in politics. He is enduring it through dint of his own lack of effort over a range of issues. If you want a manifestation of what the government thinks of Senator Gareth Evans, may I remind you of what happened last week. You will recall that the government altered by 24 hours the date of election of the new deputy of the Labor Party when the member for Batman (Mr Howe) suddenly handed in his resignation to ensure that Gareth Evans was caught overseas and was unable to attend the caucus meeting. Minister Evans has really failed with regard to French nuclear testing. The way in which he failed to raise our concerns in key correspondence was shameful. His response to the decision of President Jacques Chirac has been weak; it has been late; it has been timid; and it has been lacking in leadership. As a consequence of that and other factors, we face the prospect of some horrific French nuclear testing in the next 12 months in the Southern Hemisphere. Minister Gareth Evans has failed again with regard to a certain matter involving Australia and Indonesia. I will not dwell on that due to time constraints, but it is there to be seen. Then you might turn to the magnificent Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley). Do you remember Rosemary Crowley? Have any of you heard of Minister Rosemary Crowley? She got so excited a couple of Christmases ago that she tried to cut out Christmas carols. That was the sort of leadership she provided to the Senate and the nation. More recently, we have the Minister for Trade (Senator MCMullan). He really is in the B-grade team. Yesterday, he was very effectively exposed in an article which showed that he has totally got the APEC strategy wrong. As a consequence, he has run up the white flag on a key dimension of Australian trading policy. He has left Australia exposed in what is a very unlevel international playing field. The coalition recognises that and has devel,. oped policy to respond to that. The government's Minister for Trade, Senator MCMullan, still cannot get it right with respect to a nondiscriminatory approach with regard to APEC and future trading arrangements and a discriminatory trade approach. Mr Anderson-What about Minister Faulkner?",105
321,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Then we have the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner). Well might the Deputy Leader of the National Party refer to him. He was the one who relied on environmental extremists rather than objective scientific endeavour to evaluate Australia's forests of environmental significance. He was totally humiliated when the cabinet steamrblled his submission, making him look like a lobbyist rather than a minister. Mr Anderson-He looked like Ros Kelly.",106
322,Mr TIM FISCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Remember the list. Ros Kelly's whiteboard was bad enough, but Minister Faulkner's list of coupes, including everything from airstrips to quarries, wa- a total dereliction of duty, determination and leadership with regard to that key important environmental portfolio. Then there is the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook). He has just had a spectacular performance on a piece of industrial research and development legislation which has now been exposed by coalition senators in a way which has severely embarrassed him. They are just five of the other team up there which is failing this government, and you know it. You admit it in your hearts. We often do not have much direct exposure with these ministers. I just thought it was timely, as we debate the leadership in this government, that we expose its B-grade team here today. I say to the House that what this country wants is fair dinkum leadership, in touch leadership. What it has, sadly, is the Prime Minister, a leader who goes around saying, 'This is as good as it gets.' Fancy making that comment a few weeks ago when this day the Chamber of Manufactures has found that it has the need to speak of a further recession arising from the results of its most recent survey. I have to say this is not as good as it gets. It will get a whole lot better when we have John Winston Howard in the Lodge and a coalition government providing real leadership for this country-the sooner the better. (Time expired)",106
323,Mr OCONNOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This motion should be seen for what it simply isa shabby attempt by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), 12 years after the crime, to try to expunge the guilt of his own assault on families, communities and the Australian nation during his time as Treasurer. Throughout question time we have observed the coalition wallowing in the worse kind of hypocrisy. It has been very hypocritical over French nuclear testing. It has been hypocritical over economic policy by its failure to tell the Australian people its own policies, and now we have this motion criticising the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I note with some degree of interest that the honourable member for Bennelong said that it is sheer arrogance for the Prime Minister to come into this House and defend the rights of workers. We have that criticism coming from a second-rate leader who has been rejected three times by his own party and the Australian people. I think it is the height of arrogance for the Leader of the Opposition to come into this House with an appalling economic record from his own time in opposition and make these charges against the Prime Minister. It is even more arrogant coming from a man who cannot even bring himself to countenance an Australian as an Australian head of state. The Leader of the Opposition completely forfeits any right to speak on this particular matter of public importance before the House today. He has levied the charge against the Prime Minister and the government that the Australian' people are coming second under the Prime Minister's stewardship. Is he talking about the long-term unemployed, who have been the recipients of the caring resources that have been put at their disposal to bring them back into the work force by the Prime Minister and the government through the Working Nation program? Is he talking about the Aboriginal people, who can now walk with pride in the wake of the Mabo legislation, which has been brought to this House by the government and opposed at every step by a weak-kneed leader who could not keep the rednecks in Western Australia under control? Is he talking about the pensioners whose living standards have increased over the past 12 years? Are they the people that he says are coming second under the stewardship of the Prime Minister, or is he talking about the low paid workers who will receive benefits under the Accord that the Prime Minister announced in this last sitting of parliament? Are they the people who are coming second under the stewardship of the Prime Minister and the government? Let people in this House have no illusion about the leadership qualities of the people who lead the government and the opposition. There is not anybody on the other side of the House, nor on this side of the House, who really holds the belief that the Leader of the Opposition would have had the wit, the courage, the intellectual depth or the political resolve to restructure the Australian economy while at the same time maintaining the social cohesion and advancing the living standards of Australians. Is there anybody in this House who really believes that the honourable member for Bennelong could have constructed the Mabo legislation and guided it through the houses of this parliament? Is there anybody on either side of this House who really believes that the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition, could construct the Accord process which will deliver Australian workers low inflation over the next four or five years? Is there anybody on the floor of this parliament, or outside of this parliament, who honestly believes that the honourable member for Bennelong could have constructed APEC or that he could have delivered the great social wage that Australian workers-the individuals, the families, the communities and the nation---enjoy? The honourable member for Bennelong refuses time and time again in this House to answer the challenge of the government to table the policies of the opposition. It is going to be a really interesting brainstorming session tomorrow without the brains. There are no policies on the table that the Australian people can judge. We know exactly how the Leader of the Opposition is handling the policy debate. It was done in Victoria by Jeff Kennett. Kennett made a promise to the Victorian work force and to individuals, families and communities that are the subject of this MPI here today. He made the promise that no worker would be worse off when the Kennett government came to power. After a massive assault on the social wage and on the living standards of workers, represented by an increase in taxes of $1,200 per family, we finally found out the real policies and the real agenda of the opposition. It gets worse than that because the honourable member for Bennelong will not even tell his own backbenchers. How can you hold a brainstorming session when you have nothing on the table and you will not even tell your own backbench what the policies are? The Prime Minister is a family man. He has successfully raised a family of four while devoting his political life to the welfare of working people of this nation. What possible construction could the opposition put on this MPI accusing the Prime Minister of causing pain to Australian families and Australian communities? During his whole political life, the Prime Minister has been the architect, the weaver of the fabric, of the social wage, which has been the rock of support on which low income earners and working families have pinned their hopes for a decent standard of living in this country. Australia, because of the efforts and the leadership of the Prime Minister, is acknowledged as being one of the great social democracies in the world. That has been the hallmark of the Prime Minister's life-an untiring and unswerving dedication to the improvement of the living standards of all Australians. That concern was reflected in the budget that he, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) crafted recently, which was delivered to the Australian people and the nation. The government delivered a prospect of economic security taking us beyond the year 2000, a gross domestic product improvement of 3% per cent, business investment rising by 13 per cent, employment growth of three per cent, over 240,000 jobs, a fall in the unemployment rate, an increase in the real disposable household incomes of people, continued low levels of inflation and decreasing interest rates. Are these the hallmarks of a government that is attacking the working families of this nation? While I am on the subject of families, I say that we introduced a range of measures designed specifically to improve their living standards. What of the prince of pain? What of the Leader of the Opposition, whose record in office condemns him in the eyes of every economic commentator and in the eyes of the Australian people? While he wines and dines with the desperate tories of the Melbourne Club, he ought to tell us about the pain working families would have suffered by virtue of getting a miserly $16 rise over the last 12 years. While he sits on the cocktail circuit on the North Shore, he. might tell the working people of this nation· how he plans the the most massive assault on. their wages and conditions with the aiding and abetting of his state leaders in New South Wales and elsewhere around this nation. The Prime Minister of this country has constructed a social wage which has supported the working people of this nation. But the Leader of the Opposition has a record where, over his time in office, that social wage declined by 17.5 per cent. The Prime Minister has been the consistent defender of the wages and conditions of workers and their families while the Leader of the Opposition lies in the grass, waiting to rip and tear at the heart of the wages and conditions of working people in this country. It is the Prime Minister who has delivered the lower levels of taxation for families and individuals in this nation; and it is the of the Opposition who, while Treasurer, let the tax bludgers send their files to the bottom of the harbour and skive away-those spivs and tax bludgers who got away with $2 billion. The Leader of the Opposition deserves the universal condemnation of this House. (Time expired)",107

338,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEES,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (5.27 p.m.)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposal No.7 (1995), and Excise Tariff Proposal No.3 (1995). The tariff proposals which I have just tabled contain alterations to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1987. The changes are operative from 1 July 1995. Excise tariff proposal No. 3 introduces measures announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) in the budget on 9 May 1995. Firstly, it amends the definition of 'fuel oil' in order to exclude light fuel oils from that definition. Secondly, it increases the rates of duty on aviation gasoline from 17.233c per litre to 19.08c per litre, and on aviation kerosene from 1.497c per litre to 2.38c per litre. Customs tariff proposal No.7 (1995) introduces similar alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. The revenue collected from these increases will be used to contribute to the funding of aviation safety regulation and the recovery of airway services costs in 1995-96. Customs tariff proposal No.7 also inserts in chapter 73 an additional note to confirm the tariff classification of razor wire. The new additional note implements a decision of the World Customs Organisation that this wire be classified in tariff heading 7313. Summaries of the alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Reith) adjourned. NA Publications Committee",109
339,Mr HORNE,COMMITTEES,"I present the 24th report from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies of the report are being circulated to honourable members in the chamber. Report-by leave-adopted. NA Motion (by Mr Elliott) agreed to: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until 30 June 1995, at 10 a.m. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Motion (by Mr Elliott, for Mr Beazley)as amended by leave-proposed: That: (1) so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the business for consideration on Friday, 30 June 1995, unless otherwise ordered, being as follows: (a) Messages from the Senate returning or transmitting legislation. (b) Notices and orders of the day, government business. (c) Presentation of papers. (d) Any motions for a special adjournment of the House or for leave of absence to all Members. (e) Private Members' business, order of the day for the second reading on the Sydney Airport Curfew (Air Navigation Amendment) Bill1995; and (2) standing order lOlA (interruption for question period) be suspended for any sitting on Friday, 30 June 1995.",110
340,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"The coalition will not seek a division on the motion before the House, but I bring to the attention of members of the House that the motion fails to include the provision for question time to be held tomorrow. When I first raised this matter with the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), the answer I got was, 'We don't have a question time on this extended day because it is not the precedent of the House to do so.' He was rather lost for words this morning Report when I pointed out to him that there is a precedent for holding question time on extended sitting days of the House. The significance of that is that, when that further point was put to the Leader of the House, he was left with no alternative but to confess that there is absolutely no reason whatsoever why the parliament should not have the benefit of question time tomorrow. It is important that question time be held tomorrow. There are important statistics Friday, coming out tomorrow which will reveal the latest accumulation in Australia's foreign debt, courtesy of the current account figures which will be released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I suppose, for many Orders Australians, when you say 'current account deficit', their eyes tend to roll over. It has been revealed in the last week or so that Australia's current account deficit is now worse than Mexico's and is the worse in the OECD. The implication of that is that, because the country has a massive debt, a huge mountain of debt, the rest of the world requires us to pay more interest. The effect on the average family, rather than glazing your eyes over, should make your hair stand on end. If you have a mortgage, if you owe money on your bankcard or if you owe money on your overdraft, then you are paying more as a result of the massive indebtedness which has been built up by the failure of this government's economic policy over the last 12 years. As the figures are released tomorrow, a lot of Australians would like the government to answer some basic questions about why it is that, after 12 years, Australia has racked up this massive and still accumulating debt. Australia's debt when Malcolm Fraser left office was about $23 billion. Today it is around $160 billion or $170 billion. We have a massive debt, and as a nation we are now borrowing to pay our interest bill. Think of that in your own family circumstances. If you got a notice from the bank saying that you owed $1,000 or $900 on your bankcard, think of the difficulty you would be in if, to pay your monthly bankcard bill, you had to go down to the bank and get a loan to meet the outstanding liability. If you were borrowing to pay your bankcard bill, you would not need to be an accountant to work out that you were in serious financial problems. They are the circumstances facing our great country. After 12 years of this Labor government's mismanagement, the truth of the matter is that, as a nation, we are borrowing to pay our interest bill. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I have heard this speech by the member for Flinders three times today",110
341,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,What is your point of order?,111
342,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Do you mind! I am listening to the Chief Government Whip.,111
343,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,If he would be quick,111
344,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,I decide whether he is going to be quick or not. You are delaying it. He has taken a point of order. I am listening to his point of order.,111
345,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,Come on.,111
346,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"No, I say he can come on. You do not have to encourage him. I do that. Mr Leo MCLeay-I must say that I am surprised to hear the member for O'Connor and the member for Flinders say that we should not preamble points of order. I will recall that when we come back in August. The point of order that I raise is precisely what the member for O'Connor raisesstanding order 145, relevance. The member for Flinders's speech might be relevant to a whole lot of things, but it is certainly not relevant to the order of business for tomorrow.",111
347,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,You are saying that we can't raise these subjects.,111
348,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Order! I make that decision, not the honourable member for O'Connor. There is no point of order. We have all heard the member for Flinders's speech three times today; nevertheless, he has got every right to make it. I hope he does not make it the fourth time. There is no point of order.",111
349,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker: I will keep on making it until the point finally reaches the inner recesses of your understanding of these issues",111
350,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,It is not my understanding; it is other people's understanding. Mr Leo MCLeay-Don't attack the chair.,111
351,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"If he would be less partisan in his rulings about my speeches, then I would be more polite and courteous in response.",111
352,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"Look, just get on with making your speech. That is all you have to do. Mr Leo MCLeay interjecting",111
353,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"I've had a few wins today, as a matter of fact. I conclude by making this point: we suggested that there should be a question time tomorrow. The government's answer was, 'No, you can't have question time because it is not the precedent of the House to do so.' I have since demonstrated that there are precedents. It is difficult to get out the material because it would require a lot of research to go back to the early 1980s. I do not need to because I have one example anyway. It is certainly my experience that, in the early 1980s when we had an extension of the sittings, we always had question time. In fact, it was the Labor Party that put an end to that practice. When the parliament is sitting, when the taxpayers have paid good money for us to be in parliament, as we will be tomorrow-and, let us face it, we will basically be hanging around waiting for matters to come back from the Senate, so it is a clean-up operation, important as that might be-there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that there will be time tomorrow for question time. Mr Nehl-There's no roster of ministers either.",111
354,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,We will have no help from the honourable member for Cowper.,111
355,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"Well, he does make a very good point by that interjection.",112
356,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"He may, but he does not have any right to. You make your point and wind it up. .",112
357,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"It would be a return to better practice both if we had a question time tomorrow and if all the ministers turned up. This week, for example, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has only been here two days for question time. Yesterday he was on a rostered day off and on Tuesday he was also on a rostered day off. I think that is outrageous. Former Prime Minister Fraser was in the chamber today. When he was Prime Minister, whenever a question time was on he was man enough to tum up and answer the questions put to him. I cim assure you-and I give this undertaking on behalf of the coalition and particularly the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard)-that, when the coalition is returned to government, when the parliament sits and we have question time, all of the ministers and the Prime Minister, Prime Minister Howard, will attend every day and answer the questions from the demoralised opposition that we will then face. The government by its silence reveals that it has absolutely no reason whatsoever not to hold a question time tomorrow. We should as a matter of common practice return to the practices of the past. A practice which is in the interests of the people is that, when the parliament sits, the government should be able to be held accountable by questions put by private members during question time. I appreciate that the government will just bulldoze these remarks as if they count for nothing. But I can assure the House that the coalition will certainly institute far better practice when we are returned to government. It says a lot about the contempt and the arrogance with which these people treat this parliament that an opportunity for question time tomorrow goes begging.",112
358,Mr LEO MCLEAY,BUSINESS,"Watson) (5.40 p.m.}I was very interested in what the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) had to say. As I said earlier, we have heard him say this a few times earlier today. I think the member for Flinders is trying to get us to believe the old saw that one swallow makes a summer. But the real part of that saw was that one swallow does not make a summer. The member for Flinders says he has found one instance in the years between 1988 and now in which we have had question time on a day when parliament has sat after the normal time. He found one precedent. That is one time we have done it. There have been many times in the past when we have not done it. What the member for Flinders ought to remember, and what the Australian public should know, is that the only reason we will be here tomorrow spending the Australian taxpayers' money is the slothfulness, laziness and downright opportunism of his colleagues in the Senate. In his remarks, he said that we will be here tomorrow only for a clean-up operation. That is right. The reason the House is sitting tomorrow is that the Liberal and National senators, at the behest of their leader and the member for Flinders, will not do their job. They spent the first part of this week mucking around with everything, and most of last week just talking about their own internal problems. We had a three-quarter of an hour diatribe one day from Senator CrichtonBrowne on why the member for Flinders, as deputy leader, was no good and how he was going to see the member for Flinders off. This is the way the National Party and the Liberal Party want to spend time wasting the taxpayers' money in the Senate. So the House of Representatives has to sit another day to wait for important legislation to come back. We are here tomorrow because of the outright laziness and stupidity of opposition senators in the Senate. I think it is unfortunate that we have to be here tomorrow. Obviously, if members from both sides were not here tomorrow they would be able to do things in their electorates, which, I am sure, their constituents would prefer they did. The member for Flinders says that we should go back to the good old days when former Prime Minister Fraser was sitting in the chair that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) is sitting in. Unlike the member for Flinders, 'because he was never actually here when Mr Fraser was Prime Minister, Ire call Mr Fraser being here as Prime Minister. For anyone to suggest that he spent a lot of time in this chamber answering questions is a joke. What Prime Minister Fraser used to do was to turn the Prime Minister's chair 90 degrees so that his back was turned to Speaker Snedden, whom he despised, and he would then look around the chamber. When a member of the opposition asked him a question, he would point to one of his blockheaded ministers, and that minister would get up and answer the question-not the Prime Minister. When we were in opposition, we used to say, 'We want to hear from the butcher, not the block.' But every time a question was asked, the block would get up and answer the questions because the butcher would just sit here. They were all dead scared of him. But he was never going to answer questions. So I do not think any of us would like to go back to the good old days of Prime Minister Fraser who treated the parliament with an arrogance that we had never seen before and will never see again. The member for Flinders made a point about the reasons for us being here tomorrow. His own party could have overcome the problem. If opposition senators had done their job, we would not have to be here tomorrow. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) will get up and try to remind us of something that happened between then and now that even he has probably forgotten. The simple fact is that the government had hoped that we would have been able to get the business done in the allotted time. Mr Reith-For all your huff and puff, what's the reason?",112
359,Mr LEO MCLEAY,BUSINESS,"The reason we are not going to have question time tomorrow is that we are here waiting on business from the Senate. We want to be in a position to be able to deal with it as soon as it gets here, so we can expedite the business of the parliament and catch up with the work the Senate has delayed. It is a disgrace that it has done that. I commend to the House the motion moved by the parliamentary secretary. The member for O'Connor looks as though he is sitting on a spring. I had better let him have his say. Before I do, I mention that the government wants to point out the serious reason we will be here tomorrow: it is because of the slothfulness of the people in the other House who are encouraged in that slothfulness by the member for Flinders and his colleagues. If they had got down and done their job, the parliament would have risen tonight and taxpayers would not be burdened with the extra costs of running this place tomorrow to, as the member for Flinders said, sweep up after the Senate.",113
360,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"O'Connor) (5.45 p.m.)First, I think we need to get a couple of facts on the record. The coalition is not complaining about being here tomorrow. We have had such a good time here in the last fortnight that we would stay for another week. We have really had a good time. Mr Leo MCLeay-That's why you've all got pairs, is it?",113
361,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"It is interesting that the government whip mentions pairs. I was paired today so I could be present when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) fare welled a group of veterans who were being sent to New Guinea. Although it is a quite expensive exercise, I believe it is a very generous gesture and I am very supportive of it. It is interesting that, having made that gesture, the Prime Minister hardly got a round of applause after his speech. One would have thought the mere fact that those people were being sent on that trip would have been enough to get an applause. The member mentioned the situation with pairs. I just want to put it on the record that it was the coolest reception I have ever seen a Prime Minister get, let alone when he is sending people on a freebie to New Guinea. But the point is that we are not debating whether we should sit tomorrow. We welcome it. We are asking that this government conduct the orders of the day in the proper and traditional fashion, and that is by including question time. Also, as it is certainly not one of the Prime Minister's rostered days off, we would like to think he will give this place the courtesy of attending with his full front-bench. After all, we are going into recess and it seems to me it would be a particularly good time for the Prime Minister to set an example for us for when we all come back. He should, firstly, attend with his full front-bench and, secondly, answer at least one question in a manner that might be understandable to the people of Australia. Question time is not, as the Prime Minister previously described it, a privilege extended to the coalition or the opposition by the governing executive. It is a process by which the government of the day, whatever its political persuasion, is kept honest and answerable to the people of Australia. That is what it is there for. As such, every day this House sits, the government has a responsibility to the people of Australia to extend that privilege to them so they can go to bed at night with some confidence that the government has been put under proper scrutiny and is conducting its affairs in an acceptable manner. The member for Flinders (Mr Reith) took great pains to point out the growth in our and the substantial speculation in the community, the business community and the financial community that we will have another massive blow-out in the figures when they are announced tomorrow. One would have thought that the Prime Minister of the day would be concerned enough to come in here and explain this in the parliament to the Australian people. That, to me, makes sense and is proper. I would like to underline the word 'proper' because that is what we are talking about: the proper process in this House. That process has been driven into the ground. One of the ways that has been done is through this constant process of rewriting history. We cannot rewrite history in this place because it is all on the record. The government whip, the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), just made a statement that Malcolm Fraser had a practice in this place whereby he referred all questions delivered to him to his front-bench. I was here for 2Y2 years of that period and I remember that happening once. What I do not remember happening is a question being directed to a frontbencher and the Prime Minister showing so little confidence in that person as to take the question himself, which I have observed on numerous occasions here since Mr Keating has been the Prime Minister. He has shown an absolute lack of confidence in his ministers and has taken questions himself. One of the ministers sitting at the table, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), might have suffered that ignominy on one occasion. But certainly there was an occasion when the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) was not allowed to open his mouth in this place. The Prime Minister, as you will note, never lets him in the place other than on the days when the Prime Minister is here. Now the government whip has made· the point, I remember betting him a carton of wine on a previous occasion on a matter and I never got the wine. I am pretty sure· I was proved right. I challenge him to get out the Hansards of the 10 years or whatever it was of Fraser's government and prove to us how debt many times it happened. Your words, !think, were that 'every time' we gave a question to Malcolm Fraser he diverted it to one of his ministers. That is a simple question to be answered. Get the Hansards out. Mr Leo MCLeay-'Many times'.",113
362,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,I tell you what; I challenge you on the basis of 'many times'.,114
363,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Mr Hollis)Order! No debating across the table.,114
364,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"I say that when you go back to the Hansards you will be unable to prove that. In 2Yz years, which was nearly a fifth of his incumbency, I saw it happen once. It can often be appropriate. Mr Leo MCLeay-Rubbish!",114
365,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,You can prove it. All you have to do is get the Hansards out and count the number of times it happened. You work on the Goebbelistic principle of standing· up here and saying things that cannot be substantiated by fact. This is what you are at again. I wanted to touch on this- .,114

I need protection from this constant attack on me from the other side, from these government· heavyweights who are trying to attack and demoralise me. I assure you that I am not going to let that happen. Anyway, we have to get this thing straightgovernment. ened out. It is proper that the Australian people be entitled to answers from the government tomorrow on serious matters, more particularly on the current account situation. If the government thought it was going good, government members would be rosterprivatisation ing themselves at question time. I hope they can get their dorothy dixers a bit better organised than today. You would think the Prime Minister's department above all others would know standing orders to the extent that they would not be handing out questions as dorothy because dixers to people on a matter that was actually under debate as we adjourned for question time. I am sorry, Sir, that you were the person who was the victim of that poorly designed question. I felt very sorry for you because know the discipline in the Labor Party is such that you get your dorothy dixer and you just have to ask it. But on our side in the Fraser period I well remember the dorothy dixers being passed along those extended benches consti tuency . we had in the old place because people in our party felt that back bench question time just that, and that we should be testing own government on behalf of the people in our electorates. Mr W alker-When did a backbencher over there last ask a question?",115
370,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"They never asked many when you were in opposition, let me tell you.",115
371,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Order! We will not have a debate across the table. We will continue with the debate now.,115
372,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"You are quite right. I just wanted to update the minister on that particular fact. I can assure him from my personal experience, having been there when he was in state parliament, that the attitude of the backbench of the Fraser government-and it was tolerated and to a degree supported by the front-bench-was that we were there to ask questions relevant to the interests of our electorates; a privilege denied to you, just as all you were denied the privilege to decide whether or not the Commonwealth Bank was going to be sold. Those sorts of actions would never have been tolerated under the Fraser We were kept totally in the confidence of our leadership. Isn't it funny? I tried to think of the word, and it took me a while to recover it, but the word 'obscenity' came to mind. In the old to be days every time we raised the issue of your then leader, Mr Hawke, used to refer to it as an 'obscenity'. Today those obscenities appear in this place day after day. I defend my colleagues in the Senate. The the Australian people go to bed every night thankful for our constitution and our Senate that is the only protection they have. It is a pity that you have not managed to get up there and convince your own senators to take your views on the Commonwealth Bank because it is only the discipline of your party I that is seeing the thing sold. You know very well that, if you had been entitled to a vote on it, you would have voted against selling it. But even your senators up there have not got the guts to represent the interests of your own I know that a few members of your party was would have voted to sell the Commonwealth our Bank, but I think the majority would have voted against it. You were told at 6.30 on budget night that it was to be sold. That is unbelievable: the Commonwealth Bank is an icon of Labor history, but the government is going to sell it based on the decision of two people. And you say that your caucus is different from ours ! You tell us that that is the way our party room used to operate yet, in my 15 years of parliamentary life; it has never operated like that. We would not tolerate that sort of party behaviour on an issue as serious as this, and sometimes you laugh at us for that. I am proud to belong to a party where consultation and where we are able to express a view. If we find our party's view totally abhorrent, we can turn around and vote against our party. In other words, we put our votes where our mouths are and we put our constituents first. I am proud of what the senators are doing with the budget bill. They are doing one simple thing: they are keeping this govern which ment honest. We went to an election where the choices were very clear. One party was saying, 'Here are 601 pages of how the taxation system will work.' It was balanced and it was neutral. The other party went the election and said, 'You don't want any of that. It is terrifying and horrifying, provide you with tax cuts without any change in the taxation system.' What have we got? We are about to get tax impositions that were brought down in a budget two years ago-immediately after election. It is unbelievable government thinks we should not have a question time. I have to agree that question time does little good-because we do not get answers to the questions-but at least we get the opportunity to raise issues on behalf of the Australian people. That is why there should be a question time tomorrow. It is ridiculous to suggest that we want a question time because the Senate, in moves designed to save people, is refusing to pass sections of the budget. Please remember, as you so often remind us, that it is the indirect taxes which impact hardest on the poor. If you added up the revenue from your indirect taxes, you would find that it would have exceeded our estimates of the proposed revenue from a GST. You would be piling in the money. Mr Elliott interjecting",115
373,Mr TUCKEY,BUSINESS,"No, because you have to committee's take the fuel tax and the sales tax togetherthe we were removing the sales tax. The simple fact is that you did not keep your promises ati the last election and the Senate has the responsibility to do its best to keep you honeSt. I address that issue only in the context of the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourthere is able member for Watson. The simple fact is that we welcome tomorrow's sitting. We will continue to oppose those measures which we believe you have no mandate for, but we think the people of Australia are entitled to the tradition of a question time. I think it is a shame on the government that there is such an arrogant disregard of question time and its normal proceedings. We ask ministers questions embarrass them on one day and, the next day, they are not here to follow up their answers. That situation is unbelievable-:-we were promised that it would not happen. Putting that aside, we should have a question to time tomorrow. In closing I want to ask the government one simple question: what are but we can you frightened of?

375,Mr BARRY JONES,COMMITEES,"On behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies, I present the report entitled The workforce of future, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",116
376,Mr BARRY JONES,COMMITEES,"by leave-The committee's inquiry into the work force of the future has reviewed demographic and labour market trends to draw attention to the future challenges and possibilities for Australia. Challenges and possibilities have been forced upon us by changes in demography, technology and the development of a global market, a market without frontiers. It will be futile for governments to fight rearguard actions against change, but there can be substantial benefits in seeking to understand the directions where already apparent trends are leading. The committee's report on the work force of the future examines demographic, economic and labour market developments and makes recommendations for government to assist workers and employers to adapt to structural and social change. The past 21 years have been marked by striking changes in the composition of the Australian labour market. For reasons that are not entirely clear, the year 1974 stands out in international labour force statistics as marking a sudden end to what has been called 'the golden age of full employment' which ran for 30 years from the end of World War II. A variety of explanations have been put forward including the impact of the oil shock of 1973; general use of the contraceptive pill, which changed the whole pattern of fertility and led to increased female labour force participation; a loss of confidence in government intervention, Keynesian style, in the economy, leading to a revival of neoclassical economic theory and practice; and a clear indication of the postindustrial phenomenon with sharp declines in manufacturing employment, now down to 14 per cent, and demand for manual labour. Before 1974 Australia's unemployment rate was one of the world's lowest, far lower than that of the United States or Britain. Since 1974 it has generally been higher than that of the US, and sometimes higher than that of Britain. However, our wage levels have maintained value better than in the US. The committee emphasises that the composition of the 1995 labour force is radically different from that of 1974. Since 1974 female participation in the labour force has increased from 41 to 51 per cent. The postwar Beveridge-Chifley concept of full employment being defined as 'one adult breadwinner per family' has been overtaken by events. Another important development has been the growth of part-time work. In 1973 only 12 per cent of workers were employed part time. By 1993 this had doubled to 24 per cent. A high proportion of part-time jobs are performed by young people between 15 and +4 years of age and by married women. The number of jobs created in Australia between 1973 and 1993 was 1.8 million, or a growth of 32 per cent. However, over a million of those jobs were part time, which was an increase of 164 per cent in part-time employment. Largely due to these factors, Australia, in common with most OECD nations, is now experiencing the unprecedented phenomenon of high employment and high unemployment simultaneously. It sounds like a contradiction in terms. All it means is that many of those, mostly males, who were traditionally in work are now out of it and unlikely to return while those, mostly women, who were traditionally not in work are now in it. Apart from the high employment-high unemployment paradox, the age and gender composition of the labour force has changed dramatically. So has the length of working life, at a time of increasing life expectancy in Australia and most comparable economies. The 35-year working lifetime is likely to become the norm, replacing the 50-year model. Many more jobs have been created but, at the same time, labour force participation rates have never been greater. At 63.7 per cent, they have stayed close to their historic highest levels since 1974. While the composition of the labour force has changed, a revolution in the work force has also occurred. Far more people work with telephones and computers than with traditional tools. Technical innovations have transformed every area of work from manufactur-. ing processes to transport, warehousing and retailing, transforming the range of tasks performed. The regional impact of employment changes is extremely varied. Along with changes to tools and techniques, there have been far· reaching shifts in the leading employment sectors in Australia. Since 1974, the fastest growing employment sector has been the information related employment sector-including the whole range of media and entertainment, market research, consulting, administrative, management, clerical, education and financial services. This sector is estimated at 42.5 per cent of the labour force. The second fastest growth has been in domestic and quasi-domestic work including 'hospitality' and tourism, essentially paralleland ing work which used to be carried out at home without a wage. These sectors between them now employ the bulk of services employment. Services in total comprise 79 per cent of the labour force. These developments have been lost in the statistics produced by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The committee accordingly recommends that the government request the Australian Bureau of Statistics to review the appropriateness of its existing data collection methodology and to indicate significance of information and domestic or quasi-domestic service employment. The committee took on Peter Drucker's important argument about the decline of hierarchical work, that management structures have been flattened out. He argues that the coming post-industrial society is 'the first in which not everybody does the same work. This is far more than a social change. It is a change in the human condition'. In a knowledge society, having a hundred or a thousand people performing the same task, as was characteristic of agriculture or manufacturing, would be pointless. The committee also drew attention to the formation of dual labour markets. The primary labour market is characterised by high skill levels, comparative security of employment and a full range of award related working conditions. The secondary labour market· may be characterised by insecure work, low skill levels and a deteriorating range of award coverage. There is also increased wage disparity between the primary and the secondary labour markets. The domestic services and tourism and hospitality sectors are where most new jobs are now being created. Some 55 per cent of all work is estimated to be unpaid or informal work, once almost exclusively done by women, now increasingly outsourced. Evidence to the committee indicated that an additional two million potential jobs were waiting to be created by outsourcing services such as food preparation and ddivery, home maintenance and gardening, cleaning, security child minding. Of course, such outsourcing would be dependent on the restoration of the two income family with higher levels of discretionary spending. Australia is now exporting a range of services, including tourism, educational, financial, legal, marketing and management consultancy services. But we still import more services than we export. Other areas where employment growth and wealth generation may be expected to occur include a number of industrial sectors such as construction, mining and value added manufacturing, together with agricultureespecially value added horticultural exportsinformation technology, knowledge related information services, health related services and tourism. The unprecedented growth of the information and quasi-domestic services sectors of the economy has led to the displacement of one group of workers and its replacement by another group. There is now a relatively high demand for skilled and professional workers and a relatively low demand for unskilled workers. Across a wide variety of white-collar occupations, new computer technology enables some workers to attempt more creative or intellectually demanding tasks. There are now fewer opportunities for process related and middle management white-collar workers. During the 1980s, for example, many traditional clerical jobs have been lost in the banking and financial sectors, but now new financial products are creating employment downstream. . There has been high growth in the low skilled part-time hospitality and tourism sectors of the economy. Structural award conditions in these industries have resulted in substantial cost .advantages for the employment of part-time labour. In 1993 nearly 80 per cent of all part-time workers were employed in services. The changes outlined in the committee's report have caused substantial dislocation in the lives of many workers. The challenge for any government is to ease the impact of the process. As we said in paragraph 1.21, recognising that outsourcing will be a major contribution to employment, the committee recommends the government examine measures which may facilitate tendencies to outsource work from the home, government administration and industry, including primary industry. There is general agreement on the part of political parties, employer groups, trade unions and industrial tribunals on the basic objectives of work force change, but not the same degree of consensus on the range of measures needed to improve Australia's penetration of global markets. As we wrote in paragraph 2.31, one of Australia's greatest economic problems, although insufficiently recognised, is the inventory problem. This is the conspicuous lack of an inventory of brand name goods for which there is international recognition and demand, leading to a willingness to pay a premium price. Canada also lacks such an inventory, which is in significant contrast to Sweden, with Volvo, Saab, SKL and L. M. Ericsson; Finland, with Kone and Nokia; the Netherlands, with Philips and Shell; and the Republic of Korea, with Hyundai, Gold Star and Daewoo. All of those countries have such an inventory. I have already pointed to the tendency towards labour force demarcation between high skilled jobs with high pay and low skilled jobs often with low pay. High skilled jobs require an educated work force that is adaptable and flexible and which can acquire new knowledge quickly. Not all workers can possess those qualities. Governments must ensure that those who do not are not marginali sed and are provided with opportunities to participate in the economy in a productive way. Access to information technology for all is essential if Australia is not to be divided into the information rich and the information poor. The committee repeats its 1991 recommendation that the government adopt a national information policy which sets out a series of principles which anticipates the social, economic and cultural implications of the information revolution rather than having decisions made piecemeal, on the run, responding to situations such as the adoption of new technologies or changes in ownership suddenly arising. The committee notes that those countries which have moved to a high-tech knowledge based economy have also been most successful in creating employment. According to EPAC and the Hilmer report, at present Australia's efficiency levels in the business sector are 10 to 15 per cent below the average for OECD countries, and the average Australian enterprise operates at 30 per cent below world best practice. It is recognised that the priority for industry must be to improve competitiveness and productivity in order to succeed. At the same time, Australia must stimulate market demand for its goods and services by building up a high value added inventory. The cover of the report reproduces a famous photograph of Charlie Chaplin on the wheels of a huge machine, wielding a spanner, and is taken from his film Modern Times. As one of the committee members thoughtfully observed, the cover should not be taken as evidence of a weakened commitment to work safety. I take this opportunity to thank members of the committee, especially the deputy chairman, the member for Cook (Mr Dobie), for their contributions to understanding this vital subject. I also thank all those who made written submissions, gave evidence or took part in workshops, and especially the admirable but depleted staff of the committee-Dr Margot Kerley and Ms Helen Collins. We owe them a great debt for their professionalism and dedication.",117
377,Mr DOBIE,COMMITEES,"by leave-Perhaps this is the last report that I will help to present to this parliament. It is fitting that it should be a report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies, which has maintained its independence since Prime Minister Hawke created the committee in June 1990 with the proviso that the chairman would have to be the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). Having presented many reports to this federal parliament, as I have said, it is appropriate that I should be speaking for only a few minutes on this report. Because of the valedictory nature and atmosphere for me after-I might tell the chairman-42Y2 years in the work force, I would like to pay a tribute to the chairman of the committee. This is not just a formality; it is my deeply felt attitude. At all times, since the committee was created five years ago this month, the chairman has sought, and I believe has always obtained, a parliamentary attitude to whatever subject we were studying. This may not mean much to new people in the parliament but, before the present government assumed office, all parliamentary committees decided by themselves what they would report upon. Prime Minister Hawke allowed this committee to be independent, and we have chosen our own references in the last five years. I believe that the quality of our reports reflects this. I believe that, in the next parliament, whoever wins-I will not be here-will come back to the position that parliamentary committees should always report on what they believe is significant, not what has to be referred to them by this chamber, therefore the government, or by a minister in charge of a subject, which we have had in other committees I have served on-with disastrous effects, I must say. I hope there is a change in committee attitudes in the next parliament. No government can survive if it determines what parliamentary committees shall talk about. I am not trying to forecast the result of the next election, but you will understand my hopes in this regard. While I am paying tribute to the chairman, I would like to pay tribute to Dr Margot Kerley, who has at all times shown a professionalism, which I think many other people in the parliament building should follow. It has not always been easy for her because our committee consists of people with changing views and changing attitudes. I commend to the House this committee report, which has this splendid cover that the chairman has referred to. I will not go over the issues he has raised. There are just a few he has not. Recommendation 2.35 states: The Committee acknowledges the increasing importance of service employment to the future economic development of the nation ... The chairman talked about that at great length. I think we have to enhance the training of the work force, as the report says, and the further development of its export potential. Recommendation 5.40 states: The Committee recommends the setting up of a peak body for TAFE, analogous to the Australian Vice Chancellors' Committee ... I commend members of the House to read the whole background to this recommendation. The recommendation that impressed me, though I had nothing to do with the writing of this particular one, is recommendation 6.25, which states: The Committee recommends that the concept of mandatory retirement (with its implications of 'statutory senility'which I do not have",120
378,Mr CAMPBELL,COMMITEES,That's debatable.,120
379,Mr DOBIE,COMMITEES,"We have never spoken in all the years you have been in this parliament. Isn't that strange? Now you make a comment which is insulting in a speech. Recommendation 6.25 states: The committee recommends that the concept of mandator! retirement . . . be abolished, but that voluntary retirement for both males and females should be possible without reference to gender differentiation. I think that is a very significant point to be made. The other point to be made is in recommendation 7.42, which states: The Committee recommends that policies be qeve10ped to recognise the significance of the 'third aged', to assist them to maintain their independence outside institutions as long as possible, and to promote the contribution of volunteers. These are significant recommendations because there is sound work in the report to support them. Recommendation 7.61 of the report states: The Committee recommends that the Government investigate ways to enable workers to be able to phase down working hours before retirement without loss of superannuation benefits. Again, I commend this report not only to members of this House but to people who work in this building, to see how significant these recommendations are. It has been a pleasure serving with this committee, and I hope it continues until March 1996.",120
380,Mr BARRY JONES,COMMITEES,by leave-I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Motion (by Mr Walker) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Request for Information Member for Moncrieff,121
381,Mrs SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Moncrieft) (6.20 p.m.)Earlier today, I spoke to a motion moved by the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile). In the course of my speech I detailed the extraordinary difficulty I was having in getting any information at all with respect to a particular government program operating in my electorate. I said that the trail of trying to find out what was happening in my electorate-a perfectly reasonable request for informationended with the office of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), where I had been directed by the department. . When, as I had been told to, I asked a certain person for this information, I was told that person was on three weeks leave and that the minister's office would follow up and let me have the information. That request was made some time prior to 10 o'clock. As at 11 o'clock when I came to the House to speak, no call had been received from the minister's office. I subsequently received a message, taken in my office, at 3 o'clock this afternoon, from a Ms Susan Smith, who I understand works in the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon). I was informed that my request for information, for details about new work opportunities programs in Moncrieff, had to be put in writing to the minister and then I would get an answer. Put in the context of the speech I gave today, people will see just how extraordinary that request is. There is another subject. I feel a little diffidence about raising but, since this is probably the last adjournment debate before the parliamentary recess, I would like to put the record straight on-a personal matter. I emphasise, for the record, that I am not saying this in a 'heavy' way. I have been aware for some weeks now that there has been a story circulating in my electorate that I have a serious health problem. The story, put simply, is that I have a terminal disease and it is expected that I will resign from parliament in a certain period of time. I want to assure my constituents that that story contains absolutely no truth whatsoever. I treated it as a joke for some time. However, I was rather disturbed today to hear the story from someone who lives in Victoria and to discover that this story has apparently spread well past my electorate. The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) laughs, and that is certainly my reaction too. The only comment I make is that, when I told my husband, he did not laugh. He was very angry indeed, because one could ascribe some quite evil motives to a story like that. When I was told the story and I laughed, I said, 'They are going to be disappointed when· I don't die, aren't they?' That was my reaction to it. I say that just to make the point that I am not being heavy about this. However, when I realised the story had a widespread currency, I thought it was time to reassure my constituents that I am in excellent health. Mr Richard Evans-Full voice.",121
382,Mrs SULLIVAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Full voice, as has been commented by the member for Cowan. I have never been in better health and, contrary to this rumour, I am not 'returning to hospital' this recess. I have not been to hospital, so cannot return. I look forward to many years representing the very worthy residents of Moncrieff-in government. Member for Cowan",122
383,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"On Tuesday I asked in this place ago, whether the member for Cowan would deny that his preselection was the subject of three-month review. In today's West Australother Ian, in an article entitled 'Liberal MP on trial: Labor', the matter is reported as follows: Liberal sources yesterday conftrmed there was an agreement on Mr Evans but refused to elaborate. He encouraged Mr Smith to put forward information he had . . . I so do. I understand that on 11 April 1995 the member for Cowan met with Mr Colin I was Edwardes, husband of the Western Australian Attorney-General and a man who is active the Liberal Party in Cowan. I understand Mr Edwardes demanded and received from the member for Cowan an undated, letter of resignation as the endorsed Liberal candidate for Cowan. The next day, 12 April, the member for Cowan met with Mr Edwardes; Dr David Honey, the President of the WA Division of the Liberal Party; and the President of the Cowan division of the Liberal Party, Mr Halligan. At that meeting it was agreed that, in light of the undated letter resignation, the member for Cowan would be preselected unopposed, subject to a review of the performance of the member for Cowan after three months. I encourage the member for Cowan to confirm or deny that the Liberal Party thinks so highly of him that it has placed him on probation for three months. On 12 July, the letter of resignation be dated or shredded? Minister for Human Services and Health:",122
384,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,"I have just come to the chamber after taking a phone call from a constituent of mine who lives in Castlemaine. I do not wish to name the constituent; it will simply suffice to say that it is Mrs Joy H. She made a complaint to me I that she had recently learned that the Minister more for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) was about to receive legal assistance to enable her to appear before the royal commission. This lady who contacted me said that she had applied for legal assistance some years that at that time she had three children and was on social security, but that she was a found to be ineligible for some reason or for any form of legal aid. She told me that she had to borrow money to pay for her legal services. In fact, the money which she received as child endowment went straight to pay back her loan for those legal services. She was very distressed, and I can underany stand why. Her question to me was: why are there two sets of rules-one set for people who are in power, and another for people who in some way or another are disadvantaged? I was at a loss to understand this myself, and certainly at a loss to explain it to her. In fact, many people in the community are in asking the very same question-that is, how that the federal government can provide legal assistance to someone when the matter is in signed a state jurisdiction. I can understand the thoughts of my constituent. I see that a man of much legal standing is at the table, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker). I understand that he is a Queen's Counsel. Perhaps after the adjournment debate he could enlighten me on the circumstances surrounding this of issue. This lady was most distressed to find that someone in that position would be getting legal assistance when she, in fact, with three children and on social security, could not get any legal assistance at all. Love, Mr Brian",122
385,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"In Western Australian journalistic circles it is well known that there are some journalists who receive leaks, preferential leaks, from Mr Ayton or Mr MCKechnie: to that matter. Margot Lang of the West Australian, Alison Fan from Channel 7 and, of course, Tony Barrass also of the West Australian. Tony Barrass had a very snide article in the inside cover of yesterday's paper in reference to a document which I lodged in this parliament on the previous day. His account is full of inaccuracies and it clearly indicates that takes the matter about which he wrote very lightly. I might add that he quotes Mr Love's brother completely out of context, appears that Mr Barrass thinks it a matter of lightness and jest that a man spends three years in gaol for a crime he did not commit. The tabled document to which I have· ment referred does not reveal any new evidence simply goes to existing statutory documents. By combing those documents, it is proved beyond doubt that Mr Love could not have committed the crime of which he was, in fact, convicted. Mr Barrass also stated that this man appealed to the Supreme Court and the whatsoever. High Court, and that the charges stuck like glue. That too is not true, as a lot of his evidence was not even admitted in the High Court. He also tried to paint a disparaging picture of a man whom I hold in the highest regardamongst David Macdonald, who did this painstaking work for me. He has many inaccuracies there too. Mr Macdonald resigned from the police force. Out of the blue, two days resignation was due to take place, he was charged with five offences going to corruption and stealing. When these five cases went to court, he was simply viewed as having no case to answer by the magistrate, who threw the whole lot out and had some very caustic things to say about the charging. It was example of the very thing I have been complaining about in Western Australian circles. It does Mr Barrass no credit at all that is so disparaging about that document, obviously he is peddling the convenient line. This is a very serious matter. I had the reviewed. I went to the man who was Les Ayton's boss and who reviewed the charging of Mr Love, and he told me categorically on reviewing the documents, he believed no charges should ever have been laid in regard Nuclear Testing in the Pacific Bail, Mr and Mrs C.",122
386,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to make a couple of comments on the protests and sentiments of many Australians, particuhe larly those in my electorate, about the French nuclear tests. I was interested to hear the comments of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr and it Campbell) last sitting. Obviously, as has been conceded in the recent statements of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), the governhas conceded that the efforts it has made but to convince the French government of the protests and the opposition of the Australian community to the resumption of French nuclear weapon tests have failed miserably. It is quite clear that the French do not consider those protests to be of any significance However, by and large Australians are heid in pretty high regard in France. In fact, for a long time, Australians have enjoyed a fair amount of popularity when the subject of Australia and Australians has been raised ordinary French people. It is interesting to note that, when one visits France or speaks to French people, they do generally feel that Australians and French have a before his number of empathetic views. There is a tremendous opportunity for the protests of the Australian community to be brought home not just at the very high level of President Chirac and the French government but also more closely and more directly to the French people themselves. In view of an this high standing that Australians have . enjoyed, and the tremendous standing in which Australian sports men and women are he held by the French community, and reflecting and on the contribution made by· Australian servicemen and servicewomen during the First case World War and the Second World War on French soil, one can see that there is an opportunity for the Australian government to that, initiate a comprehensive program within France itself of informing the French people of the opposition of the Australian people to these tests. It is my view, on a positive note, that the Australian government could do this by initiating a program of public relations within the French media, both print and electronic, to show just how strongly the Australian people feel about the tests. It is something that can be done relatively cheaply, and in a little more compelling and influential way than has been the case in dealing with the French President himself. On a local note, I would like to congratulate a couple in my electorate who have just enjoyed their 50th wedding anniversary. The reason for bringing them to the attention of the House of Representatives is that they have been very prominent community activists for a long time in the electorate. I refer to Charlie and Beth Bail, who were amongst the first people to settle in the new suburb of Heaththe ridge some 15 to 16 years ago. Since then they have played a very important and subpolitical stantial role in the local community, particuitself larly in the activities of the Red Cross and raising money for the Australian Red Cross in the local area. I know that from time to time opportunity in the adjournment debate to congratulate and talk of local people and contribution they have made to their local community. But, in the case of Charlie and Beth Bail, they have been very strong piogreat neering participants in the northern suburbs my electorate. When the area of Heathridge was being developed-an area at the northerly tip of the northern suburbs-they played very important role in establishing a closepolitical knit community. I would like to warmest congratulations on their 50th wedding anniversary last Friday. I would also pass on my thanks to their daughter, Margaret Long, for keeping me informed of this imwould portant event in the community. Nuclear Testing in the Pacific",123
387,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Bass) (6.34 p.m.)Tonight I too wish to speak briefly in regard to the French nuclear tests in the Pacific and the reaction to that announcement in my legislation electorate of Bass. There is no doubt that will of Australians is starkly against the resumption of this testing. A rally was held in Civic Square, Launceston last Saturday against the resumption of these tests. At this rally I circulated a petition with the following wording: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the widespread community outrage throughout our nation at the decision of the French government to resume nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to note and endorse the concerns expressed in this petition and convey to the French parliament in the strongest terms Australia's opposition to this decision. We ask further that the House call upon the government of France to reverse its position and abandon completely any further nuclear tests in the South Pacific. That petition, with its 312 signatures collected in a very short time at that rally, has been submitted by me today and will be tabled in House at our next sitting. That rally and this petition were things which united all interests in Launceston. The rally was organised by the Tasmanian Greens in and, although Bob Brown's speech was a plea to elect him to the Senate, at least it was an issue which he cared about and which Launthere is an ceston cared about. My own petition was in fact signed by the none other than my political opponent Warwick Smith. I can assure you that the battle for Bass is a tough one. It must have taken a deal of effort for him to bring himself of to sign a petition of mine, but nonetheless he did. I commend him for it. The point I make is that Australian abhorrence to French nua clear testing cuts across all-I repeat allboundaries. In the electorate of Bass, pass on my this is no different. Competition Policy Reform Legislation",124
388,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"I like to advise the House in this adjournment debate that tomorrow I most certainly will be voting against-I have officially informed the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer)-the Competition Policy Reform Bill, which I think is one of the most pernicious pieces of that I will see in my lifetime come the into an Australian parliament. I seem to be very isolated in that viewpoint on both sides of the House, although I suspect that there are many people sitting opposite who would agree very strongly with my point of view. I suspect there are a number of people on my side of the House who would oppose very strongly the legislation. I am in fairly good company-Trevor Sykes, probably the best writer on finance Australia today and the editor of Bulletin magazine for many years; Tom Fitzgerald, who gave the Boyer lectures in 1990 and also the finance editor at the Sydney Morning Herald for some 17 years; Bob Santamaria; Doug Anthony; Malcolm Fraser; and, for those sitting opposite, Ben Chifley and Ted. Theodore, those great Labor leaders, who would tum in their graves if was happening-in opposing the passing by a Labor government of the Competition ed Policy Reform Bill. We have seen how the BBOs have worked. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) comes in this place and skites about the BBOs. It appears to me to be a mechanism by which the wages of the average Australian will be driven down. We continuously hear the phrase 'world best practice' in this place and in other places. Quite frankly, world best practice is South American and South African wage dropped levels. A lot of people that are imposing this upon us are companies and corporations that have mines in South Africa, employing South Africans who come over here, and American companies that are now operating in Australia. When people talk about world best practice and they put into effect mechathe nisms such as the BBOs, may the Lord help the workers of Australia. In my home state, we have already seen rates massive strikes. We have seen the worse strike in the last 20 years in the sugar industry and the worse strike in the last 20 years in the mining industry. These were through BBOs. Disruptions are taking place. In Queensland we have seen average weekly earnings down in the last three years, which is probably the first time since the Second World War. They were already the lowest in Australia. Queensland is particularly susceptible to the deregulatory policies of this government. A statutory marketing authority as an arrangement is an industrial award for farmers. We have seen those smashed to pieces right across the board. Let us have a look at these wonderful, clever people who are imposing this bill upon the Australian public. All of the conditions, pay and arrangements that have been fought in over for 20,30,40, maybe even 100 years of Australian history are being swept away. Statutory marketing of wool was swept away was and we saw the income from wool drop from $6,000 million a year to about $2,500 million a year. We lost $3,200 million per year in the wool industry alone, including about a third of our wool growers. The nation's greatest asset was the sheep herd, and now a third of they saw what that asset has gone. Another area of the economy we deregulatwas petrol marketing. It was estimated by the MTAQ at one stage that around 500 service stations a year were closing. Most certainly, over 1,000 service stations and small proprietors went broke and went out of business in that period of time. So the small businessmen were wiped out and, as a result, the oil companies had a far greater grip on the Australiat:t marketplace. The net result has been that, although the world price of oil has by half, the price in Australia, in the same period of time, has more than doubled. That is costing the Australian public about $5,400 million per year every year-another South great victory for deregulation. In his book Bold Riders, Trevor Sykes estimated that $28,000 million was lost out of banks in a period of four years. Of course, that does not account for the estimated $70,000 million to $100,000 million that was taken off the Australian public, with interest in excess of 20 per cent, to try to rescue the banks for the money they threw away under the deregulatory policies of this government. So the dead are many. If this proceeds, the pharmacists, taxi drivers, rriilk vendors, newsagents, hoteliers and sugar farmers will go be wiped out. (Time expired). (;reen - ove-ent - r ADA-S (Lyons) (6.42 p.m.)-It is about time people realised that the dark green groups who have dominated the Australian environment debate have no room for compromise. As one can see by their comments after the Pedder report findings were handed down, it really would not have mattered what was said. If they do not get their own way, they just want to bag the result and stop talking to those who might be able to influence process. The editorial comment in the Mercury on 28 June was well made. It sums up the view that many of the darker greens have to umpires and to compromise. Simply, it is that umpires are people whom other people are expected to obey and that greens take notice of only when the decisions go their way. Compromise is what the other side is required to do to make a democracy work, but what the greens do only as a temporary measure to allow the regrouping of troops and energy. These are the words of the Mercury editorial, but I thoroughly agree with them. The dark greens display the same ruthless attitude when it comes to the forest argument. Look at the press articles on 24 June. The Herald Sun broadcast the fact that 30 green groups had withdrawn from consultation with the federal government on regional forest agreements. That is great, is it not? When they cannot get everything their way, they take their bat and ball and go home. They cannot even be bothered to listen to other people who might-just might-have an equally valid point to make. Dark greens say plantations are the only way to go for timber supply, and everything else must be locked up. That is their line. There is no thought for anyone who may have a little knowledge that might dispute some of the wilder statements made. There is no consideration of the alternatives to the ways forest harvesting can contribute to forest conservation. I remind people that not all greens are dark greens. There are some sensible and forwardthinking green groups, who, I believe, should be part of the debate to help us deal with those issues that are environmentally sensitive. International organisations such as Greenpeace and the World Wildlife Fund, which are much more scientific than some of our parochial Australian groups, should be brought into the debate. I thank the World Wildlife Fund for this comment-at least there is some thoughtful being out there: WWF does not see the need to completely end logging in native forests. In particular, WWF believes that well managed secondary forests, with a sustainable harvesting regime, should be of higher conservation value than the sterile ""tree-farms"" so familiar in much of Southern Australia. I could not agree more. Let us hope that we have people in Australia who still wish to preserve their living environment and who wish to take part in the broader debate. Qantas-Cowan Essay Competition",124
389,Mr RICHARD EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to briefly touch on the comments made earlier by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) about some agreements I might have. I have many agreements with many people. I have an agreement with my wife called marriage. Part of that agreement is to develop a family. She will be developing our family further on 22 August this year, so honourable members will have to excuse my non-attendance on that day. I also have an agreement with my electorate, which voted me in in the last election in the hope that I would represent it better than its former member. I am doing that. Part of my role is serving my constituents better, and I am serving my constituents better than the member for Perth is serving his. In continuing my role I have great pleasure in presenting a continuation of last night's speech about Quenton Peake, who is the winner of the Qantas-Cowan essay competition this year. Honourable members would know that for the last two years I have brought young students to Canberra who have won essay competitions sponsored by Qantas, a good airline. This year's topic was 'Australia's future as a prosperous multicultural society depends on the development of a new national ethos'. Last week Quenton Peake of Woodvale, a year 12 student from Kingsway Christian College, was on work experience in my office. I hope he enjoyed himself. This year's topic is quite relevant to this period, especially when the Prime Minister (MrKeating) and the government have announced their preferred republic model for Australia. The Prime Minister might be interested in what a young Australian has to say about his society. Quenton starts his analysis of Australian society by stating: Reference to traditional Australia and the distinguishing spirit which embodied the population conjures images of survivors, people who would continue struggling against the elements. National pride resides with explorers, pioneers and those who fought for Australia's independence, providing the romantic yet tragic picture of those at Gallipoli who were willing to die for their mates. On these qualities has Australia been built and to the courage and personality of previous populations we owe our modem lifestyle as we know it. Success and prosperity has been achieved through not simply the battlers, but their unifying distinctive disposition which forces future generations to acknowledge the presence of and benefits of emulating such traits. Quenton continues: In the light of a changing society, resulting alterations to ethics and standards, and new international directions, one significant aspect of Australia's population is multiculturalism and the continuing expansion of this trend. This raises intriguing such as whether the traditional Australian ethos exists and functions in a modem urban, multicultural society, whether the state of our society dictates the need for a reviewed and updated ethos or whether the individual successfully contributes to the nation's prosperity without the need for a linking characteristic between races, religions and cultures. I hope that all young Australians are thinking about their future and where Australia is headed. Their opinion should be sought by many people within this place. I try to do that. I have a youth advisory committee in Cowan. Quenton continues: The diversity of cultures present in Australia's society has led to governmental policies granting equality as a right all citizens should be able to claim. This played a significant role in improving the attitudes of society towards all races, most significantly towards Australia's indigenous people, the Aborigines. An increased awareness towards inter-racial relationships helps towards a peaceful established level of functioning in which society should be a representation of national law.",126
390,Mr WALKER,ADJOURNMENT,I think we should give Quenton preselection.,127
391,Mr RICHARD EVANS,ADJOURNMENT,"He will be working for me, I can assure you. Quenton concludes his essay by stating: Multiculturalism ... benefits to the nation should constitute the need to preserve, but also put into effect, the qualities of honesty, integrity, equality and hard work. The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), who is at the table, I guess should note those words. Quenton continues: The development of Australia's society has seen new racial awareness, granted new opportunities to Aborigines and all non-Europeans, with new steps in land rights and the scrapping of the white Australia policy. Future change will have its greatest chance to work for the good of the society if the traits on which the nation was built are not denied. The utilisation of national standards, practices and ethics to incorporate all cultures is a challenge which must be acted upon by each member of society if they desire to create a functioning and thriving basis from which Australia's future will not be constricted. Mr Speaker, I think you will agree that the comments of Quenton Peake, a young Australian who obviously cares deeply about his country and its future, deserves attention, as issues do the hopes and fears of all young Australstill ians. I thank the secondary schools in my area for being involved in this project. I thank the Wanneroo Times, the Eastern Suburbs Reporter, and particularly Qantas-I think there has been some bad news about Qantas recentlywhich has supported this competition for two years. (Time expired) TAAATS Project",127
392,Mr HOLLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Throsby) (6.51 p.m.)Yesterday under parliamentary privilege Mr Dick Smith made a scathing attack on Ian Macphee. To his credit he repeated these comments outside the House and challenged Ian Macphee to sue him, which I hope Ian Macphee will do. As a person who called for the inquiry into the whole business that Ian Macphee was involved in and having myself been criticised by Dick Smith, 1 want to put a few things on the record. The Public Works Committee, of which I am the chair, was dealing in 1992 with The Advanced Australian Air Traffic System project. It was very controversial, between two competing tenders, Hughes from the USA and Thomson from France. We were getting all sorts of information. Mr Speaker, as the chairman of a committee you know that you get all sorts of information. I was getting anonymous telephone calls day and night and letters. All sorts of accusations were being put before me. We had the CAA before us. In my eight years of chairing a parliamentary committee I have never witnessed a more incompetent and disgraceful exhibition. The then chair of the CAA wrote me a letter saying that I had exceeded my authority-the most impertinent letter I have received as a member of parliament. Dr Edwards, who also lost his position there, was the most incompetent witness I had ever experienced. We held hearings in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth and two in Canberra. Many of these hearings were in camera. The two hearings in Canberra were in camera. In Perth I warned the witnesses that I considered that they were in contempt of parliament. I went as far as to threaten to bring them before the bar of the House. In Brisbane I let the witnesses know I was not happy with them. But we kept trying to get information. We were dealing with a project worth, from memory, something like $160 million of Australian taxpayers' money. We never actually said that there was anything wrong or that anyone was getting a take from the tendering process. What we did say was that the impression we had was that the normal procedure had not been followed. In the end, it became clear to my committee that we were going to get absolutely no information out of these people and in that way we could not make a recommendation to parliament. The inquiry went from April until June of 1992. On 3 June I stood in this House and said that my committee, the PWC: . . . has decided to take the unprecedented step of recommending that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Cook) set up an independent panel to carry out a thorough review of all aspects of the awarding of this contract to Thomson. This review should be completed as a matter of urgency so that the CAA can appoint a final contractor with a minimum of delay. The Public Works Committee stresses that this issue is too important for it not to be settled as soon as pos- 1988. sible. The committee feels that, because of the serious concerns it has regarding the T AAATS project, it cannot report to the Parliament until this review is completed. Dick Smith always opposed that. He opposed an independent inquiry being set up. One of the reasons he opposed it was that the very people whom we were inquiring into were people he had appointed to positions. At some other time, I will go into more detail about that inquiry. As I said, those appearing before us, including Baldwin, Edwards and others, were the most incompetent and worse briefed witnesses who had ever appeared before the Public Works Committee, and we, have dozens of hearings every year. I think Dick Smith has exceeded all the bounds of propriety and decency in making this totally unwarranted attack. I hope that Ian Macphee sues him for as much as possible. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 6.56 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Leo Mcleay to move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Sydney Airport Curfew (Air Navigation Amendment) Bill 1995 and the following additional and specific matters: (a) what measures could be considered to reduce the number of jet aircraft movements at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport between the hours of 11 p.m. and 12 midnight and 5 a.m. and 6 a.m.; (b) the appropriateness and quantum of the penalties contained in clause 25K of the Bill in light of current Commonwealth criminal law policy; and (c) measures to improve community consultation prior to any changes to the curfew at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airportbeing referred to the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure for consideration and an advisory report to the House by 31 August 1995.

Mr Cameron to move: That this House: (1) acknowledges that industrial hemp is not a drug; (2) acknowledges the environmental and economic benefits of hemp as an industrial resource; (3) recognises the investigations being held by various State governments into the viability of hemp as an industry and supports those States in their investigations; (4) calls on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts to convene an inquiry into the viability of a hemp industry in Australia and what changes a federal government must make to permit such an industry developing and that the Committee also liaise with State inquiries to ascertain how a federal government can assist the States in proceeding with the development of a hemp industry, or trials for such an industry; and (5) in the event of the States proceeding with a hemp industry, calls on the Government to consider taxation incentives so that such industries can progress and be a competitive industry both locally and internationally.
