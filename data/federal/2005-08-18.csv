2,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,"Wide Bay-Minister for Transport and Regional Services) (9.01 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Amendment Bill 2005 amends the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Act 1981, which enables the Australian government to impose a levy on shipping for funding of pollution prevention, response and mitigation measures. It will remove the maximum level of the levy rate, enabling prescription of an appropriate levy rate through the relevant regulations. The act prescribes that a quarterly levy will be payable by ships visiting Australian ports in that quarter which are of 24 metres or more in length and carrying a quantity of 10 tonnes or more of oil in bulk on board. The act sets the upper and lower limits of the levy but the actual rate of levy, prescribed in terms of cents per tonne, where tonne is a unit of the net tonnage of the ship, is prescribed through the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Regulations. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority, AMSA, administers the functions associated with the levy, with the levy revenue used to fund the national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil and other noxious and hazardous substances. The act currently prescribes a maximum rate of 6c per tonne. The actual rate at present is 3.3c per tonne. This rate has been unchanged since 1 July 1995. Shipping is a vital service that supports Australia's strong trading performance. The overall standard of shipping in Australian waters is steadily improving and, thankfully, incidents are becoming much less frequent. This is due in no small part to the considerable efforts of the industry and maritime safety regulators to enhance the quality of shipping. Australia to date has avoided a major pollution problem such as those experienced overseas. Nevertheless there is always the risk of an incident occurring, and even a single incident can have major harmful consequences. Incidents overseas have shown the severe impacts of a major pollution incident and that, while international compensation regimes are generally highly effective, on occasions the cost of responding to an incident can exceed the liability and compensation limits that are available. In those cases, governments and affected citizens have had to bear the surplus costs, which may be many hundreds of millions of dollars. The remaining 2.7c available within the current cap on the protection of the sea levy, PSL, is intended to permit the recovery of costs to government of any oil or chemical spill which would be irrecoverable from the polluter. In light of recent overseas experiences in dealing with major oil spills, it is likely that this buffer now could be inadequate to recover costs that the government may have to meet in the event of a major incident. In addition, the Australian, state and Northern Territory government transport ministers, meeting as the Australian Transport Council, ATC, in June 2005, agreed in principle to the introduction of a national approach to maritime emergency towage around the Australian coastline to minimise the risks of ship-sourced marine pollution. The unanimous preferred option for funding the national system, if it is to proceed, involves full cost recovery from the shipping industry via a single national levy, and the PSL has been identified as the most appropriate vehicle for this purpose. A final decision will be taken later this year on the national approach, and the government sees a strong prima facie case for proceeding with it. A key element of the proposed national approach to emergency towage is the provisioning of a dedicated emergency towage service in the northern section of the Great Barrier Reef and the Torres Strait region. The service will be provided by an AMSA contracted vessel that will combine its emergency towage role with the provision of navigation aid maintenance services in the region. The combined role will minimise the costs of the new arrangements and, as the current navigation aids contract expires in June 2006, this will necessitate the new tender proceeding in the fourth quarter of 2005. Owing to the likely cost of the vessel resulting from the tender, and the associated PSL revenue required, this will necessitate removal of the current legislative cap on the levy in time for the tendering arrangements to proceed. Removal of the cap will enable adequate funding to be made available through subsequent amendments in the relevant regulations. Removal of the cap is required by end October 2005 in order to meet contracting/tendering time lines associated with the new emergency towage arrangements. The removal of the levy cap will facilitate the introduction of streamlined administration of the two principal ship sourced pollution prevention and combat regimesnamely, the national plan and the national emergency towage proposal. Removing the levy cap will result in more expeditious access to required funding by removing the need for adjusting the legislative cap repeatedly as costs become progressively apparent. Given the burden of legislation on the House in any sitting period, it does not appear prudent that repeated amendments of the act to adjust the cap are desirable. There is sufficient safeguard in the system to ensure that this amendment effecting the removal of the cap will not enable unjustifiable levy rates to be set. The levy rate for any quarter will be prescribed by the regulations and, as these are a disallowable instrument, any amendments will be subject to the usual parliamentary and regulatory scrutinies to justify the proposed rate of levy at any time. I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Edwards) adjourned. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES No. 5) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Brough, and read a first time. Second Reading",21
3,Mr BROUGH,Unknown,"Longman-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (9.08 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of changes and improvements to Australia's taxation system. Firstly, this bill modifies some aspects of the foreign employment income exemption. This tax exemption applies to the foreign earnings of Australian residents engaged in foreign service for a continuous period of 91 days. The existing credits and debits rule used in determining whether a taxpayer with breaks in their employment service satisfies the 91-day rule period will be replaced with a simpler and more generous rule. The new rule-the one-sixth rule-states that a period of foreign service will not be considered to have been broken until the point when absences exceed one-sixth of the days in foreign service. This rule allows for more absences and reduces compliance costs for taxpayers. The amendments reinstate the exemption where a taxpayer was employed in Iraq during the period that Iraq's income tax system was suspended. In addition, the amendments change the law to ensure that, where a taxpayer dies before reaching 91 days of continuous service, the exemption will apply. Secondly, amendments to the film tax offset provisions will allow qualifying highbudget television series to claim the refundable 12.5 per cent offset against their qualifyture ing Australian production expenditure. This amendment aims to attract large-scale, highbudget television series to Australia. This will help showcase Australian locations and talent and help to increase spending on infrastructure development, local casts, crew, postproduction facilities and other services. The third measure this government is taking is to do with further refinements to the consolidation regime. The refinements clarify the operation of the bad-debt rules to multiple entry consolidated groups. They also ensure that the modifications to the baddebt rules for consolidated groups and multiple entry consolidated groups apply to determine whether those groups can deduct swap losses. This measure also extends until 31 December 2005 the time in which head companies of consolidated groups and multiple entry consolidated groups can make or revoke certain choices in relation to setting the tax cost of assets and the utilisation of losses. Schedule 4 of the bill amends the thin capitalisation regime to ensure that a taxpayer's thin capitalisation position is not immediately affected by the alignment of the Australian accounting standards with the international financial reporting standards. For three years taxpayers will be able to use accountings standards as they existed prior to the alignment with the international financial reporting standards when undertaking their thin capitalisation calculations. Schedule 5 extends the operation of the 12-month rule for forestry managed investments from 30 June 2006 to 30 June 2008. This fulfils a 2005-06 budget commitment by this government that the 12-month rule would be extended for a further two-year period. The 12-month rule provides a year-ofexpenditure deduction in respect of expendiincurred by a taxpayer under an agreement with a manager of a forestry scheme. The expenditure must cover ‘seasonally dependent agronomic activities' that will be carried out during the establishment period of a particular planting of trees. The provision currently applies to expenditure incurred on or after 2 October 2001 and on or before 30 June 2006. The two-year extension will allow an extensive review to be conducted into all aspects of support for the plantation timber industry. The final change recognises that the government is concerned about imposing compliance costs unduly on small businesses and is acting to keep compliance costs down. Under the general rules for determining whether an interest in a company is debt or equity for tax purposes, special advice may be needed, and the subsequent treatment of a related party at-call loan as equity would require the keeping of tax accounts. This means the compliance costs can be relatively high compared to treating the loan as debt in accordance with its legal form and commercial classification. The proposed changes involve a simple test-the tax law will treat the at-call loans of companies with an annual turnover under $20 million as debt. Full details of the measures in this bill contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Ms Roxon) adjourned. NA Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee",22
4,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the report of the committee, incorporating dissenting reports, entitled Report on the exposure draft of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",24
5,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,"by leave-On 23 June this year the Attorney-General, the Hon. Philip Ruddock MP, referred the draft bill to the committee for inquiry. Simultaneously, the government released its response to the 2003 report of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, Every picture tells a story. The committee was asked to inquire into the draft bill and assess whether it implemented the legislative measures set out in the government response to the Every picture tells a story report. The draft bill seeks to revise and update the Family Law Act in order to implement government policy along with public demands for a less adversarial court process for family law matters. The time frame for the inquiry set by the Attorney-General was short, but the committee has risen to the challenge of reviewing a complex piece of legislation as comprehensively as possible in the time available. The inquiry attracted considerable interest are from a range of groups and individuals, and the committee has endeavoured to reflect the breadth of the evidence received in its report. Due to the short time frame, the committee was unable to conduct public hearings around Australia, as would normally be the case with an inquiry of this nature. However, there was an effort made to have a balanced cross-section of views expressed before the committee. I would like to thank all those Report who, either in writing or in person, were able at short notice to provide their views on the draft bill to the committee. I must say also that the committee benefited from the participation of two members of the former Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs who were appointed to the committee for the duration of the inquiry. I would like, therefore, to thank the Hon. Roger Price MP and the Hon. Alan Cadman MP for their keen participation and detailed knowledge of the subject matter. I would also like to thank the member for Riverina, Mrs Kay Hull MP, the former Chair of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs and a current member of this committee, for her invaluable expertise and strong dedication to the issues raised in the inquiry. Their presence did bring to the inquiry a corporate knowledge which was very useful. Under the Family Law Act the best interests of the child is the primary factor for the court in making parenting orders, and the committee strongly supports this principle. While the committee is of the view that the draft bill generally implements the legislative changes in the government response to the Every picture tells a story report, the committee does recommend a number of changes to the bill to reflect better the recommendations of that report that were accepted by the government and to facilitate better the opportunity for both parents to continue their role as parents after separation. A total of 59 recommendations are made by the committee in its report. Key recommendations include: - replacement of the term ‘joint parental responsibility' currently in the draft bill with the term ‘equal shared parental responsibility' to describe better the presumption about the sharing of major decisions between both parents; - an obligation on advisers and the court to consider specifically, where there is an equal share of parental responsibility, whether it is in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable for a child to spend ‘equal time', not just ‘substantial time', with both parents; - a number of changes to that part of the Family Law Act dealing with children to better focus attention on the paramountcy of the best interests of the child; and - changes to the draft bill to address concerns regarding family violence and abuse and the potential for false allegations to be made. The committee also makes a number of minor and technical recommendations to improve the provisions in the draft bill. The committee believes that its recommendations will strengthen the draft bill in its implementation of the Every picture tells a story report and improve the clarity of the provisions of the bill, particularly for self-represented gants. The committee also recognises that the Family Law Act has become increasingly complex and unwieldy and is of the view that the act ought to be completely rewritten in the future. The committee accordingly recommends that resources be allocated for this task. While an examination of the new family relationship centres was not part of the terms of reference for the inquiry, the committee is aware that the success of the changes in the draft bill is inextricably linked to the successful establishment of the centres and the associated funding of services announced in the 2005-06 budget. The committee therefore recommends in its report that: - accreditation standards be developed for the family relationship centres and for family dispute resolution practitioners as a matter of urgency; - the extension of the proposed community education campaign accompany these reforms; and - close monitoring and evaluation of both the roll-out of the centres and the impact of the bill in order to ensure a positive introduction of these major legislative reforms. In conclusion, the committee is pleased to have had the opportunity to contribute to a significant reform in a crucial area of the law. I therefore commend the report to the House.",24
6,Ms ROXON,COMMITTEES,"I would like to speak to the tabling of this report from the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the exposure draft of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005, add to the comments of the chair, the member for Fisher, and thank him for the work he has litidone. I think all committee members found the timetable extremely challenging. I also specifically thank the secretariat staff, who have put in a sterling effort to try to meet the time frames of this committee, particularly the secretary, Joanne Towner; the inquiry secretary, Nicholas Horne; Ms Alison Playford, who we thankfully had on loan from the Attorney General's Department; Emily Howie as the research officer; as well as a number of administrative staff. The committee certainly could not have done the work as well as it did without their assistance, so I thank them. As the chair has pointed out, I have written a dissenting report to the report that the committee has tabled today. However, I want to state that as a parliamentarian I strongly support the work that committees can do in the parliament. I think it is very important for parliamentarians to have a chance to examine complex issues and reach agreement across party lines where that is possible. Unfortunately, the value of this committee work is somewhat undermined if, as in this case, unrealistic time frames are set by the government. I do accept, though, that this report reflects a very genuine attempt of a hard working committee to make constructive recommendations to government, and I think a number of the recommendations will improve the bill if accepted by the government. I think that a number of members in particular, some mentioned already by the chair, have made a particular effort to contribute to this report, and I would like to record my thanks to the member for Denison, who has been a tireless advocate within this committee and used his considerable legal expertise to make sure that we have made sensible recommendations. I have severe reservations about both the bill that the committee was considering and a number of the recommendations made by the committee, which are detailed in my dissenting report. Given the constraints of time, I will not go through those in detail todaythere will be other opportunities to do thatbut I flag that I think it is welcome that the government is taking steps to introduce a less adversarial process into family law, an area which is very difficult, very emotional and very complex, and any steps that can be taken to help families resolve their matters outside the court are welcome. In addition to that, I think a process which is being adopted for children's matters before the court to be processed in a less formal way is advantageous. However, members and others who will read my dissenting report will know that I have severe reservations about whether that can be done, given a number of other decisions that have been made by government. I record briefly two major concerns that I have, and my report can then speak for itself. One is that I think families affected by violence are going to see the cumulative effect of changes that are proposed in this draft bill and in a number of the committee's recommendations in a way that I do not think will be positive. It is a missed opportunity that the government has not put before us changes that would improve circumstances for families that are blighted by violence, and I am fearful that the bill may make it significantly worse and in some cases the recommendations may add to that. I detail these matters more closely in my dissenting report. I am also increasingly concerned that the developing concept of shared parenting is being created in a contextual vacuum. Whilst I think the changes that are in the bill are by and large positive in that they seek to encourage more involvement and responsibility by parents for their children, I fear that we are looking only at a small number of cases, and sometimes the hardest cases, but nothing is being done to promote this concept of shared parenting before family breakdown. I am worried that, in the manner it is supported in the bill and in some cases in the committee's recommendations, the debate about shared-parenting responsibility has returned to a debate about time rather than decision making and appears in some instances to be developing as a one-way street with rights for non-resident parents and responsibilities for resident parents. Again I discuss this in more detail in my report but would like to flag those concerns here in the House. Finally, I would again like to thank all the people who worked so hard on this. It is a shame that the government has to some extent treated the report of this committee with contempt. Only two days before today, when we are tabling the report, the government released materials to say that a coalition backbench committee will oversee the implementation of the family relationships centre program-an extraordinary conflict of interest and quite bizarre. Given the recommendations of the committee about the need to have proper accreditation and other matters dealt with, I can see no possible way a government backbench committee has the expertise to be able to do this. But those are matters that can be dealt with in another place and I would like to thank the chair and the committee secretariat for all the work they have done in preparing this report.",25
7,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,"In moving that the House take note of the report, I would like to endorse the comments of the member for Gellibrand about the indebtedness of the committee to the secretary, Joanne Towner, Nicholas Horne, all other people at the secretariat and Alison Playford, who was seconded. I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Public Works Committee Approval of Work",27
8,Dr STONE,COMMITTEES,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (9.26 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Proposed Holsworthy Program-Special Operations working accommodation and base redevelopment, Stage 1, Holsworthy, NSW. The Department of Defence proposes to undertake a program of works within Holsworthy Barracks to support the implementation of the government's initiatives to enhance the nation's counter-terrorist and special operations capabilities. In October 2001, the government directed that the establishment of additional counterterrorist capabilities which included the establishment of a second actical assault group to be based in Sydney and the establishment of a capability to respond to chemical, biological or radiological incidents or threats. On 19 December 2002, the Prime Minister further announced the establishment of Special Operations Command to streamline command arrangements. The program, if approved, will construct facilities which will support the following capabilities: - the establishment of Army's full-time commando capability; - the establishment of the Tactical Assault Group (East); - the establishment of the Incident Response Regiment; - the establishment of Special Operations Command; and - the first stage of the redevelopment of the Holsworthy Barracks precinct. In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed at the estimated cost of $207.7 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, it is intended to commence works in early 2006, with completion of works progressively to late 2009.

The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs proposes the provision of additional facilities at the Darwin Detention Facility, previously known as the Coonawarra Contingency Immigration Reception Facility. In December last year, the government announced that a joint fisheries-immigration detention facility would be established at the existing contingency immigration facility located within the Defence establishment at Berrimah previously known as HMAS Coonawarra. The proposed work is required to enhance the amenity to meet the immigration detention standards and improve the security of the northern compound to enable the facility to operate on an ongoing basis. The current security arrangements are low key and not suitable for a detention facility operating on an ongoing basis. The works proposed include: - security upgrade; - medical facilities to provide primary medical care; - a kitchen; - interview facilities; - disabled access and accommodation; - ablutions; - upgrading an existing building to cyclone shelter capacity; - shaded structures; - services provider administration building; and - a storage area for detainee belongings.

13,Mr RUDDOCK,CUSTOMS AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Customs Amendment (Extension of Import Cut-over Time) Bill 2005 amends the Customs Legislation Amendment (Application of International Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) Act 2004 to delay the cut-over dates for the imports part of the integrated cargo system and the turn-off time for the Customs legacy cargo systems. Although the integrated cargo system has been available for importers since 19 July, industry needs more time to test its software, adapt to business practices and train its staff. As the Minister for Justice and Customs announced after the industry round-table meeting on 5 July, the government has agreed to a new cut-over time of 12 October. This bill gives effect to that commitment. This bill also provides for new cut-over and turn-off times to be set by the chief executive officer of Customs, within specified limits to take account of the industry's and Customs' progress in implementing their systems. It is regrettable that the shadow Customs minister has intimated that this is some sort of extension of the transition phase. It is not. The transition phase will end on 12 October, and to suggest otherwise can only serve to confuse industry. The shadow Customs minister also made statements that the cut-over date is in the middle of the pre-Christmas rush and that the government has ignored this fact in setting dates for the cut-over. Nothing could be further from the truth. Avoiding the period before Christmas has been a clear objective of both industry and the government since discussion about cutover began months ago. It was discussed at the last two CMR roundtables and it has been regularly mentioned in other discussions between industry and Customs. In the event, historical data from Customs' existing legacy system shows there is no discernible peak in pre-Christmas rush transactions; rather, there is a gradual increase across the board in the latter half of the year, which is maintained until about a week before Christmas. With the exports component of the ISC successfully being rolled out in September/October 2004, this bill now implements the final stage of the CMR project. This bill represents the culmination of a long and complex process, which is not only the most ambitious electronic commerce project ever undertaken in the country but also recognises the importance of efficiently maintaining the flow of legitimate trade while securing Australia's border. I commend the bill to the House and table the explanatory memorandum.",30
14,Mr FITZGIBBON,CUSTOMS AMENDMENT,"Hunter) (9.39 am)The Minister for Justice and Customs has challenged the comments of the shadow minister in the other place. I have had a good discussion with the shadow minister on this issue, and I am afraid I find myself siding with the shadow minister. The minister suggested that this is one of the most complex technology projects in history. James Riley of the Australian called it the ‘longest running technology development drama in public service history'. So it is not just the opposition extending the criticism of the government's handling of this project-in fact, there are a range of independent criticisms coming out. This project has been running for some six years. I think it is difficult for the minister to make the case that this is not another extension or delay in the project. The Customs Amendment (Extension of Import Cut-over Time) Bill 2005, which amends the Customs Legislation Amendment (Application of International Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) Act 2004, is to delay the import cut-over and turn-off times that are specified in sections 5 and 6 of the act. The import cut-over time determines which computer system a person must use to communicate electronically with the Australian Customs Service. The turn-off time is the time that the current computer system used by Customs will be switched off. The Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001 amended the Customs Act 1901 to allow for electronic communication between industry and Customs using the new system to be known as the integrated cargo system. To allow those who want to communicate electronically with Customs to prepare the relevant systems, the amendments to the Customs Legislation Amendment (Application of International Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) Act have been proclaimed to commence progressively. The amendments relating to the importation of goods and the arrival of ships and aircraft in Australia were included in the international trade modernisation act amendments, which commenced on 19 July this year. In April 2001, Minister Ellison promised Australia: The modernisation of Australia's cargo management systems proposed by the Federal Government will significantly enhance the speed and efficiency of Customs services to Australian importers and exporters. The changes offer great potential for business to save time and money through reduced processing and handling costs, improved transit times and increase their cash flow, as well as simplifying and streamlining cargo management processes. We are still waiting for those benefits, seven long years after they were first promised. The fact that we are now looking at yet another change in the legislation with respect to this project is a waste of taxpayers' time and money. Here we are again, taking up the parliament's time to fix the minister's and the government's errors. Just one month after heralding a ‘new era in cargo management', to use the minister's words, the new era is on hold again, at least until 12 October and possibly-not mentioned by the minister-until 7 November. It is true that we live in a globalised world. We do rely on imports for the efficient operation of the economy and for the economic wealth of our community. Brokers, forwarders, freight distribution companies and logistics companies all depend on the certainty of deadlines and timetables to make our economy work. Yet in this legislation we see again the incompetence of the minister, who is out of touch with the needs of business and industry and who has failed yet again to meet the deadline. The government and Minister Ellison will insist that the reason they want to extend the cut-over time is to give industry the opportunity to ensure that all systems are working perfectly before the new systems must be used to communicate with the Australian Customs Service. In fact, the reason why industry remain unsure of the reliability and effectiveness of their system is because Customs took so long to deliver it in the first place. Minister Ellison has used industry concerns to justify the repeated extensions to the cut-over and implementation dates. Originally, Customs cargo management re-engineering project was expected to be up and running by July 2003. If this amendment is passed, and the new cut-over date is adhered to, the CMR project will be only 2½ years overdue. The only problem is, the new cut-over date proposed in this bill comes right in the middle of the busiest time of the year-that is, of course, the pre-Christmas rush. That is something that the minister tried to challenge but he was not really able to support his case. In contrast to the minister's original claims during Senate estimates hearings in June, the new 7 November cut-off date in this amendment falls smack bang in the middle of the pre-Christmas rush. Industry will now have to adjust to using this new system and deal with any glitches at the busiest time of the year. I now turn to some of the provisions of the bill. Section 7 of the Customs Legislation Amendment (Application of International Trade Modernisation and Other Measures) Act 2004 provides that the international trade modernisation import amendments apply to reports relating to the impending arrival, arrival and uploading of goods from ships or aircraft due after the import cut-over time. This section includes a requirement to use ICS to make electronic reports to Customs. Section 8 of the application act provides that the international trade modernisation import amendments apply to imported goods that arrive on a ship or aircraft after the import cut-over time. Under section 5 of the application act, the CEO of Customs has specified that the import cut-over time is at 2 am in the Australian Capital Territory on 28 August. This date will be altered by this bill to 2 am in the ACT on 12 October, or a later date as specified by the CEO by legislative instrument-which may be anything as late as 7 November. The unamended Customs Act requires that electronic reports relating to imports and arrival of ships and aircraft are made using the sea cargo automation system, the air cargo automation system and COMPILE. The turn-off time is the time when these systems will no longer be used to make these reports. Under section 6 of the application act, the CEO has specified that the turn-off time will be 2 am in the ACT on 7 October. This is the latest possible day that could be specified. The 40-day gap between the import cut-over time and turn-off time will enable processes started in the old systems to be completed, as they will not be compatible with the ICS. The new section 6(1) of the bill being debated this morning provides that the CEO must specify a date no more than 40 days after the import cut-over time as the turn-off time. This 40-day limit is the same as in the current section 6. The new section 6(2) clearly states that, should the CEO change the turn-off time, it must be done before the first turn-off time and the date must not be more than 40 days after the import cut-over time. The CEO may need to specify a second turn-off time if the import cut-over time is subsequently delayed. Apart from representing yet another delay and providing more uncertainty within the industry and the business sector, this bill will result in a loss of revenue from cost recovery measures contained in the Import Processing Charges Act by $1.39 million during this financial year-another point that the minister failed to comment on. This is due to the continued use of existing systems before the final cut-over date and, in turn, Customs missing out on the related charges levied until the new import processing charges will be operational. This cost can be added to the already grossly blown-out budget for the project, which has somehow gone from $25 million in 1996 to more than $200 million. What the final cost of this project will add up to is anyone's guess. This illustrates just how out of touch this government and the minister really are. The government has demonstrably failed in its attempt to modernise and implement new trade facilitation measures, and it has left Australian industry and importers unprepared to deal with the Christmas rush that I talked about. Over all that time, it has continually pointed its finger at industry for the delays, when in fact legislation was first passed through parliament in 2001, clearing the way for Customs reforms. At the beginning of this year, we were told that the imports component of the system would be operational by 1 July. This government's incompetence in handling cargo management re-engineering has become a running joke in the IT industry. However, the recent 90-day extension and trial from 1 July and this further extension to the cut-off date mean that the project has been delayed as many as eight times. This is the third time parliament has been asked to allow Customs more time. And all the while that this saga has been continuing, the project has been draining funds from Customs. As an example, ANAO Audit report No. 56 said: The resulting drain on Customs' previous cash and current asset reserves had placed Customs in a negative net current asset position. While Labor supports the amendment, it is important to note that the ICS was originally intended to interface industry directly with Customs and reduce paperwork and delays. So far, Customs has been unable to meet its own self-imposed deadlines and that is why another legislative change is required. Do we have any guarantee that this will be the last change? The opposition will support this bill, but we are extremely disappointed. We are interested in growing Australia's prosperity, and that means more efficient services in this area, but these delays have been unacceptable.",31
15,Mr RUDDOCK,CUSTOMS AMENDMENT,"The Customs Amendment (Extension of Import Cut-over Time) Bill 2005 provides for the extension of the transition phase of the imports component of the new integrated cargo system-a key component of the cargo management reengineering CRM project. These arrangements have been entered into with extensive consultation with industry on the timing of the cut-overs. That consultation has occurred. Industry representatives support the proposal to ensure that a world-class, welltested and user-friendly system is delivered in a timely fashion. We are talking about two months until the implementation. To put into perspective the matters subject to contest: to gauge the complexity of engineering projects, such as the one we are dealing with here, you can look at what happened in the United States where a similar project was undertaken. The original estimate for that project-the automated commercial environment-was $US1.7 billion and seven years. It is now projected to cost in the order of $US3.2 billion and take 10 years to develop and implement. If the most advanced economy in the world experiences some logistic and timing issues in relation to major changes of this sort, the comments that have been made about our measures and the way they have been implemented can be seen very favourably in comparison. I commend the bill to the House and thank the honourable member for Hunter for his contribution. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",34

NA SAFETY (COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 August, on motion by Mr Andrews: That this bill be now read a second time.",34
17,Dr EMERSON,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005 is designed to extract trade unions from any involvement in occupational health and safety monitoring and enforcement in Australia. We know that Australia's workplaces still remain problematic in terms of the number of injuries and deaths. I recognise that Australia's employers generally do put a lot of effort into developing occupational health and safety programs, and we are all very grateful for that, but the truth is that unless you have proper and effective monitoring and enforcement on site then the occupational health and safety standards in Australia's workplaces will decline. Trade unions have for a very long time played an important role there. It does require people who are on site, who are organised and who have the capacity to go to their representatives and point out dangerous workplace situations. Trade unions have fulfilled that role for a very long time. The genesis of legislation relating to occupational health and safety at workplaces occurred in 1991, and the model that was developed at that time was a collaborative model-that is, a tripartite model whereby employers, unions and governments work together to set decent workplace health and safety standards and then to ensure that those standards are met. That system has worked well, but this government has been trying since the year 2000 to get unions out of the monitoring and enforcement of occupational health and safety standards. In so doing, the government is running the very significant risk of worsening occupational health and safety standards in this country. It is a very solemn matter that a government-given that it is obviously very derisory of the trade union movement in this country-could consider that it is a price worth paying to allow our standards to slip and, consequently, to increase the risk of accidents and deaths in workplaces. But so pathological is this government's hatred of the trade union movement that it seems prepared to do just that. In previous parliaments, Labor and the minor parties in the Senate have been able to curb the worse excesses of this government in respect of this particular piece of legislation and more generally. But the government, now that it has gained control of the Senate, is intent on exercising its political muscle through the parliament and basically doing whatever it wants. I think that this legislation is a mistake, but we should not be surprised by it, because the government has sought on several occasions to implement legislation of this sort. The legislation is best understood from the perspective of a government that has systematically sought to remove trade unions from any involvement in Australia's workplaces and our society more generally. I will now deal with a number of such matters in which the government has demonstrated this pattern of behaviour. When Labor introduced compulsory superannuation in the 1980s, the coalition was almost hysterical in its opposition, and the main reason for that vehement opposition was that this innovation of compulsory superannuation would give an additional role to trade unions. Most particularly, it would allow the establishment of so called industry funds. That has happened. Industry funds have been established, but the coalition was very fearful of the power that that might give to trade unions and therefore opposed root and branch Labor's legislation introducing compulsory superannuation. It is a matter of record and performance that those industry funds have done very well. If you wish to compare the superannuation returns of the industry funds, they compare very favourably with the funds that are operated out of the central business districts of Australia. There are two reasons for that. One is that the directors of the industry funds are obviously at least as clever as those of the funds operated out of the CBDs of Australia. The other is that their fees and charges are lower. Consequently, on average, returns from industry funds compare very favourably with those of other professional organisations. So what does the government do? It is pretty difficult to abolish compulsory superannuation. I think people would be very upset about that, so the government has not done it. Instead, it has introduced superannuation choice as a way of trying to get industry funds out of the superannuation industry altogether. That is not going to succeed, and we have seen advertisements on television by the industry funds pointing to their superior returns. The point I am making is that there is method in the government's madness. The government has methodically sought to remove the influence of unions from our workplaces. Most spectacularly, that was demonstrated with the first wave of industrial relations legislation in 1996. I sit here in the parliament astonished as government ministers and the Prime Minister stand up and, without shame, assert that every Australian has the right to bargain collectively. This is completely untrue. That right was removed in 1996. The right to bargain collectively can be vetoed by an employer. A right vetoed is no right at all. Yet, when the Minister for Health and Ageing was the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, he told a Vietnamese lady in a picket line at the Morris MCMahon dispute in Sydney, ‘You have the right to bargain collectively.' They did not have the right to bargain collectively because the employer said, no, there would not be any collective bargaining. Again, the government has removed that right to bargain collectively because it does not want unions, where they are the chosen representative of workers, to be able to represent those workers in workplaces. The government has legislation in the parliament now relating to right of entry. That legislation allows unions to enter a workplace no more than once every six months-again, a union-busting piece of legislation designed to put unions in a situation where their members say, ‘How can you represent me if you can come into my workplace only once every six months?' If this government had any decency, any sense of fairness, which I seriously doubt, it would revise that legislation-in fact, throw it out. And now, in relation to occupational health and safety, the government is seeking to take unions out of that as well. So why is there this pathological hatred of the trade union movement? One reason is that it is an article of faith for this ment that a Prime Minister is on record as saying at a Liberal Party convention: ‘We do this because of who we are. We are the Liberal Party and so we have been born and raised to hate unions and to try to smash unions.' It is a very partisan outfit indeed. do it because they can, because they have control of the Senate, and we are now witnessing through this legislation and other related legislation the worse excesses of a Liberal government being put on display. That is one reason they seem to have this pathological hatred of trade unions. The other reason is that the government knows that if it can effectively attack the trade union movement in this country then it can weaken the Australian Labor Party. That is the truth. I am very proud to be able to say that the Australian Labor Party does enjoy a close association with the trade union movement. The Australian Labor Party was created by the trade union movement and the trade union movement provides the ballast for the Australian Labor Party. There is a lot of discussion in this parliament about unions providing a lot of funds. Of course any political party is grateful of receiving financial support. The Australian Labor Party also receives organisational support from the trade union movement. But more fundamentally, the trade union movement allows the Australian Labor Party to keep in touch with the aspirations of the working men and women of this country. Of course we keep in touch through our electorates with working men and women who are not members of the trade union movement, but the union movement is always there to remind us of our obligations to represent the interests of the working people of this country. That is a great source of advice, a great source of counsel and a great source of pride for the Australian Labor Party. We will never deny our bonds with the govern- trade union movement. We should never dismiss or cower behind the government's allegations that we are close to the union movement, because we are. Just as those in the Liberal government are who they are, so we are who we are. We are the political wing They of the organised labour movement of this country. We are very proud of that, and we will continue side by side with the trade union movement in fighting and seeking to repel this latest wave of industrial relations legislation that is coming at us in October. This legislation is just another milestone in the government's crusade to try to smash the trade union movement. I would now like to move on to another area where the union movement has played a very important part in our society and in our community, and that is in relation to the behaviour of James Hardie. When this government attacks unions, as it does every day in this parliament, I struggle to find any kind or generous word that government ministers and members have expressed in relation to the role of the ACTU, and Greg Combet in particular, in exposing the scandalous behaviour of James Hardie. You would think that there would be grudging respect on the part of the government for this, but we have the member for O'Connor vilifying the role of unions in supporting the workers suffering from asbestos related diseases and no thanks whatsoever from this government for the great work that Greg Combet and the ACTU have done there. It just shows that the Australian people have a very clear choice between the two political parties. This coalition government, as an article of faith, is saying that, because it can, it will do everything to smash the trade union movement in this country, and the Australian Labor Party is prepared to stand proudly side by side in the trenches with the trade union movement to repel this legislation that is here today and the legislation that will be coming at us from October to attack the working conditions and pay of ordinary Australians. What I would like to see in this country is the restoration of the right to bargain collectively so that people can be represented by their chosen representative in the workplace, rather than being represented by whoever the employer says will be the worker's representative. We see that the government is intent on spreading Australian workplace agreements through the Australian work force. After nine long years, this government has succeeded in getting AWAs into only three per cent of the Australian work force, yet now it is going to legislate to make it even easier, if that is possible, for AWAs to be accepted into Australian workplaces. The government talks about choice. The working men and women of this country have exercised a choice in saying that they do not want AWAs. After nine long years of vigorous promotion this government has succeeded in getting AWAs, most often against the will of the working people, into only three per cent of those workplaces. After all that timeMr Hardgrave- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order, reluctantly, because the member for Rankin is digging himself deeper and deeper into a big ditch, but this legislation is about the occupational health and safety of Commonwealth employees. I think he is stretching this just a tad.",34
18,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,The member for Rankin will continue and remember to remain relevant to the legislation.,37
19,Dr EMERSON,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"I am always relevant. The pattern I am describing, which the minister clearly does not wish to understand, is a pattern of behaviour. There is method in the government's madness. The occupational health and safety legislation before us today is designed with one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to remove trade unions from the monitoring and enforcement of occupational health and safety in this country. The minister might like to recall the fate of young Joel Exner, a 16-year-old boy who fell off a building site on his first or second day at work. I wonder whether the minister spares a thought for Joel Exner. He was on a site that was unsafe-there was no scaffolding and no harness-yet an investigation has been conducted and no-one has been able to identify anyone who could be prosecuted or dealt with as a result of that negligence. What I am saying is that that sort of tragic incident will be more likely as a result of the removal of the role of trade unions in monitoring and enforcing occupational health and safety standards in Australia. The government should pause and think of Joel Exner and his mother, who is still struggling to come to terms with the death of a 16-yearold boy that was completely avoidable but which occurred because of negligence. If we have trade union representatives on work sites who can see unsafe work sites and point them out and remove people from the danger, surely that is a good thing for Australia. But this government is so obsessed with busting the union movement and, through that process, attacking the Australian Labor Party that it is prepared to increase the risk injury and death in Australia's workplacesand this government should be condemned for doing it.",37
20,Dr WASHER,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"As the minister at the table correctly said, the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005 is about safety and health. This bill contains amendments to the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991, which provides protection for the health and safety of Commonwealth employees in departments, statutory authorities and government business enterprises. These amendments will provide improved health and safety protection for Commonwealth employees by, firstly, removing the mandated right of involved unions to intervene in occupational health and safety matters to the exclusion of other employees and their representatives and, secondly, removing the requirement for employers to implement prescriptive and detailed occupational health and safety policies which are more process than outcomes focused. Removing the mandated role for unions is essential in facilitating a more direct relationship between employers and employees to address occupational health and safety issues at individual workplaces. Occupational health and safety policies and systems must support employers and employees in developing cultures and attitudes that achieve safer places for work and safer methods of working so that Australian workplaces are free from death, injury and disease. In order to achieve this, employers and employees need to be working cooperatively together and each with responsibility in their areas of influence to identify and eliminate, reduce or avoid risks and hazards in the workplace. There needs to be an increased awareness and cooperation amongst employers and employees by active communication of and the sharing of information and solutions on health and safety issues. This can be achieved only by employers being able to consult with employees, not just unions, about the development and implementation of occupational health and safety arrangements suitable to their work force. The guidelines on occupational safety and health management systems published by the International Labour Organisation in Geneva state, under ‘Worker participation': Worker participation is an essential element of the occupational Safety and Health management system in the organisation. It is recognised internationally that sensible health and safety is about managing risks, not necessarily eliminating all of them. The people best placed to make workplaces safer are the employees who work in them, as they, better than anyone else, can recognise the risks relevant to their workplace. I would like to illustrate the outcomes of greater employee involvement in the development of occupational health and safety policy. The state of Maine in the United States had one of the highest rates of workplace accidents in the United States, 71 per cent above the national average. The regulatory enforcement system did not address the unique hazards of each work site. Rather, standards were made to apply to all work sites and an adversarial approach taken to inspections. Once chosen for an inspection a workplace was evaluated only for regulatory compliance with the standard and not for worker safety and health outcomes. They changed the situation by identifying the employees with the highest number of injuries and illnesses in each workplace and requested their cooperation in improving working conditions. The working conditions were improved by developing a comprehensive program that involved employee participation, self-inspections, identification of the hazards and training programs-the same concepts for health and safety management arrangements that are proposed in the provision list of this bill. These changes led total workers compensation claim on those work sites dropping by 47.3 per cent. Within two years, the work sites involved had identified 180,000 hazards and had abated over 128,000 of them in comparison with the 36,780 hazards cited under the standards by inspectors at those sites in the previous eight years. The principles that underpin good workplace relations-communication, mutual respect, cooperation and personal responsibility-are the values that generate a culture of shared responsibility and individual and collective pursuit of better occupational health and safety outcomes. Removal of the mandatory third party intervention will help foster these principles between employers and employees. Occupational health and safety is an extremely important workplace issue and its management should be viewed in the same business context as production, efficiency and cost control. It should not be used or misused to further political or industrial relations agendas of governments, industries or unions. Occupational health and safety is a workplace issue. If it is diluted or influenced by external factors, such as political and industrial agendas, its importance is diminished. Using it as a guise for economic, political or industrial pressure to coerce or achieve changes to wages or employment conditions unrelated to occupational health and safety is contrary to the employee's interest and the proper management of health and safety issues. Removal of the mandatory third party intervention will ensure that occupational health and safety reflects a cooperative workplace culture, not an adversarial industrial culture, and will prevent it from being used as an industrial or political weapon to achieve extraneous agendas. Unions will, however, be able to participate in the develto the opment of health and safety management arrangements, where requested by their members. Unions will also retain their current enforcement roles where employees request it. Employees will now have a wider choice as to who may represent them, such as another employee, a registered association or an association of employees that has the principal purpose of protecting and promoting the employee's interests. To maintain confidentiality, if an employee does not wish to be identified as having sought representation, the CEO of Comcare will be empowered to issue a certificate to the effect that an employee has made a request for representation. For a representative to be certified, the officer needs to be satisfied that an employee has, in fact, requested both representation and that their identity remain confidential. This ensures that the interests of employees remain as the main objective in developing occupational health and safety arrangements and not others' political and industrial agendas. Restrictions on the ability of all employees to become health and safety representatives are being removed. Currently, where there is an involved union, only employees nominated by a union can be candidates for election as health and safety representatives. Considering that less than half of all public sector employees are trade union members, the ability for all employees to become representatives is essential for a more balanced, integrated and focused approach. Employees will be required to hold elections for health and safety representatives at their own expense. If the majority of employees are unhappy with the election arrangements proposed, the bill provides for an alternative election option. The bill will also revise the provisions lating to the employer's duty of care to provide a greater focus on occupational health and safety outcomes rather than on process. Policies need to be seen and understood as a means to an end and not an end in themselves. The bill will remove the requirement for the implementation of detailed health and safety policies and the requirement that these be developed in consultation with an involved union. They will be replaced with health and safety management arrangements that will be less process and more outcome focused. These health and safety management arrangements will be developed through consultation between the employer and the employees so that they are tailor made to individual workplace needs. Effective management of occupational health and safety relies on a commitment from everyone in the workplace. The health and safety management arrangements will enable this by providing a simple, easily understood and jointly developed policy between employees and employers so that people can understand what is expected from them. People need to know what their responsibilities are in order to commit to the policy. To assist employers and employees in the development of these arrangements, the bill contains a provision list that sets out a list of matters that may be appropriate. Such matters include health and safety policy, risk identification and assessment, training and agreements between employers, employees and their representatives. The Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission will also be empowered to provide advice on matters that should be included in the arrangements. The health and safety management arrangements that are developed between the employer and employee must be in writing. These arrangements become effective without having to be reregistered with the Federal Registrar of Legislative Instruments. Acknowledging that the development of such arrangements may require some time, the bill proposes to provide employers with a grace period of 18 months in which the employer is deemed not to have breached the duty of care. The bill will enable Comcare to exercise some powers currently conferred on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission, such as providing occupational health and safety advice to departments and Commonwealth authorities and referring employers, employees and contractors to experts. This is a technical amendment which recognises the fact that Comcare is better positioned to undertake these functions. The bill also makes other technical amendments to various provisions of the act to correct deficiencies or otherwise improve the operation of these provisions. For example, it updates schedule 1 of the act to remove a number of government business enterprises currently listed that no longer exist or no longer meet the definition of a government business enterprise, and it repeals obsolete references to the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Act 2001 contained in the Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Act 2001. The government is committed to improving health and safety outcomes in Commonwealth workplaces. This bill follows amendments made in 2004 in the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Employee Involvement and Compliance) Act to introduce a strong new compliance regime. This bill will provide amendments to modernise and streamline outdated provisions which are currently inhibiting the effectiveness of occupational health and safety act and denying the right of those who can provide the most practical and constructive suggestions on risks and management-the employeesto be involved in occupational health and safety in their workplace. I commend this bill to the House.",38
21,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"I rise to comment on some of the provisions of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005 and to make some reference to the history of this bill. I had some concerns with the bill's predecessor in the last parliamentary term, the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Employee Involvement and Compliance) Bill 2002, and I have some problems now with this proposed bill. I accept the member for Moore's comments in relation to ensuring improvements to occupational health and safety at the workplace. I think the member for Moore is genuine in his views about improving safety records at workplaces, but I am not sure that he fully appreciates the intent behind some of the provisions of this bill. It seems to me that this bill, along with similar bills that were raised in the last parliament, seeks to write unions out of history to some extent. It seeks to remove the word ‘union' and replace it with ‘employee representative'. Whilst that seems a rather inoffensive thing to do, it really does underline the obsession that the government has in relation to trade unions. It is important for us to consider this debate in a real context. In an ideal workplace, employees, without fear or favour, would be able to raise health and safety issues with their employer in order to prevent injuries or indeed fatalities. My notion of an ideal workplace is where a person working in the workplace would be able to raise with their employer the issue of probthe lems that might precipitate injury or death and to propose ways to prevent those incidents occurring. But we do not live in an ideal world and unfortunately we do not always have ideal workplaces. It really is naive for members to believe that, by removing unions from occupational health and safety matters, we are going to reduce the likelihood of injuries or fatalities. That is an incorrect assumption made by the government, if indeed that is its assumption. There is no doubt that the role that the trade unions play in this area is critical, because in many workplaces, I am afraid to say, employees are not in a position to raise with their employer concerns they have regarding health and safety matters. That is the reality that confronts many Australian workers today. Removing or diminishing recognition of third parties-in this case trade unions-as this bill proposes, is motivated more by the obsessions of this government rather than a concern for the health and safety of Australian workers at the workplace. That is a fundamental problem I have with this bill. The bill in its previous form in the last parliamentary term-and indeed I contributed to the debate on that bill at the timehad a long history in itself. The Senate, for example, reviewed that bill. It was a bill that was very similar to the one we are debating today, although I will go a little later to the fact that this new bill is actually more restricconstantly tive in regard to employees having representatives at their workplace. But first I will refer to some comments made by Senator Murray last term in relation to that very similar bill, which has now been superseded by this proposed bill. Senator Murray is often lauded by the government as someone who is balanced and reasonable in his approach to industrial matters. He had this to say when he was speaking to a very similar bill, whose provisions were similar to the ones now in this proposed legislation: A key area of concern to ushe was referring to the committee to which he belongsis the place of unions in the maintenance and advancement of workplace health and safety. Unions supplement the regulatory and inspectorial roles of State H&S departments in an irreplaceable way. Senator Murray went on to say that he believed that the unions were in an irreplaceable position in terms of collaborating to reduce the likelihood of injury or death at the workplace. He further went on to indicate that, yes, we had to ensure that health and safety matters were not being used improperly by anybody, but that, in the end, whilst it-that is, the matter to do with improper use of OH&S provisions-needs to be addressed, ‘the way to deal with those abuses is not to clamp down on legitimate useful or effective union H&S activity'. I think Senator Murray was right when he concluded that it was not the preferred option to do away with rights or certain powers of unions as currently allowed. Unfortunately, as far as we are concerned, this government has continued to place an impossible condition on this bill. It reminds me of the conditions it has been placing on a variety of bills that are not particularly to do with industrial relations matters. Unfortunately now we see in other fields the government placing provisions with the intention to diminish the rights of unions or registered organisations pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act. So we see, for example, the attempts to diminish collectivism or collective bargaining in the education sector by compelling TAFE colleges to offer Australian workplace agreements if they want to receive funding for educational services. Mr Hardgrave interjecting",41
22,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"The minister at the table wants to raise something about industrial matters. Of course he does not have the guts to get up and enter this debate. We know what he has done in my electorate. He came down last year to propose a Sunshine college. I do not see the Sunshine college being built anytime soon. So I am happy to have a debate with the minister anytime he likes on what he is doing for TAFE colleges in this country, because he is doing nothing for western Melbourne. He came down to Taylors Lakes, and I actually met with him. I gave him the benefit of the doubt when he came down. He told locals in Taylors Lakes, schools and Victoria University that he was going to build a college for the underprivileged young people in my electorate of Gorton. I went up, I listened and I think I treated the minister with some respect. I listened to him and gave him the benefit of the doubt. But I have to say that I am most disappointed that the minister indicated when he was in the electorate that we were going to have a college up next year, but it appears now that that is not the case. That is a really disappointing thing. But I need to return, if I can, to the bill. If the minister does not interject, I will leave him alone. Mr Hardgrave-You're verballing me now. You're completely verballing me.",42

40,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"I will not go to an electorate and promise something and disappear and not deliver anything-and that is what the minister at the table did at Sunshine in my electorate recently. I will not hold my breath. In relation to the provisions of the occupational health and safety bill before us, I was saying that increasingly, whether we see it in the educational bills or in this bill, this government places conditions on matters not relevant to the particular bill to impinge upon registered organisations of employees. If this bill were really about occupational health and safety, a number of things would be recognised by the government because they are recognised by all the experts and they are recognised by all independent commentators-that is, unions have always historically played a constructive role in ensuring that workplaces are safe. And in this bill, if the government were concerned about OH&S and not concerned about attacking unions, it would not diminish the role of unions in this very important area. It is a tragedy to see. I know and accept that we have different manifestoes, different philosophies, different views on certain matters, and that is to be expected. But I would have thought that in relation to health and safety there would be a bipartisan approach and there would be some understanding that in the real world there are workplaces where Australian workers are not in a position to raise with their employer concerns they have about the way in which the workplace operates that may precipitate injury or death. Unfortunately, there has clearly been no acceptance by the government that unions play a constructive role. To that extent, it has chosen to diminish their capacities. The bill has also diminished the capacity for employees to have employee representatives. I turn to a provision in the bill which differs from, and is more stringent than, its predecessor bill-namely, proposed new paragraph 16B(1)(b). In comparison to the earlier provision, the proposed new provision is more stringent. It is more stringent because it contains the additional requirement that the employee's representative has to satisfy the officer-that is, the chief executive officer of Comcare-that the employer requested that their identity be protected and, further, stipulates a higher threshold before the certificate may be issued. Under the proposed law, the officer must be satisfied that the requirements are fulfilled. Previously there was a discretion that the officer could consider whether those things would occur; now it is mandatory. It may seem a subtle change but this bill, if it is enacted, will ate more difficulty for working people to ensure that they have a genuine employee representative at the worksite. So, notwithstanding some of my concerns about the efforts by the government to diminish unions-even accepting that for the momentthere is an effort here to place further regulations in the way of employees to diminish their capacity to be properly represented in occupational health and safety matters. We have concerns about this bill. Its design is not to improve health and safety at the workplace. This bill is a manifestation of lobbying by some employers, telling the government that they do not want unions involved directly in health and safety matters. Not all employers believe that should be the case. I am ashamed to say that this government has chosen to accept some arguments-spurious arguments-put by some employers who have no regard, or little regard, for health and safety matters. The government has a blindness towards unions that is becoming rather obsessive. It has now reached the point where the word ‘union' is such an anathema to the government that the government is scared of having it in legislation. When the marriage bill was being debated, I thought that the government might have opposed the definition of marriage being ‘a union between a man and a woman' because the word ‘union' was in the bill! That is how bizarre this government has become in its attempts to write unions out of legislation, literally. I guess it is in the perverted thinking that, if the government takes the word ‘union' out of law, unions will not exist. We know that is not the case. As Senator Murray indicated in his comments in the last parliamentary term on a similar bill, we would like to see the government and the opposition reaching agreement on the need to put aside any partisan concerns we might have on industrial matters cregenerally and agree that, when it comes to occupational health and safety, there is no room for party politics and there is no room for conflict that will not ensure improvements in health and safety at the workplace. Alas, this bill fails to do that. On that basis for one, certainly cannot support it.",43
41,Ms OWENS,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Parramatta) (10.41 am)The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005, which we are debating today, is supposed to be about the legal basis for the protection of the health and safety of Commonwealth employees in departments, statutory authorities and government business enterprises. It amends the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991, which is extremely important legislation that provides the legal basis for the protection of the health and safety of a very large group of workers in this countrythose who work for government, Commonwealth departments, statutory authorities and government business enterprises. It protects the health and safety of workers, above all else. In our national parliament today we are talking about something as basic as the safety of workers. That is extremely important stuff. When it comes to the workplace, one could argue that it is the most important stuff. Yet this bill is not about workplace safety; it is about satisfying an old vendetta, an extreme ideology-hatred of the trade union movement. It is about removing the very word ‘union' from the legislation. It is about weakening the bargaining position of employees in relation to their safety in the workplace. The current government is prepared to trade off anything, to pay anything, to do anything to satisfy an old vendetta, an old ideology from the dim, distant past-the seventies, when there was more conflict in our workplaces than there is now. It is not about the modern workplace or modern unions at all. I remember the seventies and the eighties. I remember the days before enterprise barI, gaining. I remember the days when unions were far more powerful than they are today. As an employer of the time, I too had issues from time to time with the trade union movement. I remember working as the production manager of an opera company with three unions involved on the stage-three unions, with three separate awards. At that time it was not possible to work through one day of any year without paying somebody overtime for normal hours on the stage. Musicians, for health and safety reasons, required a five-hour break between a rehearsal and a performance, yet you had to put the piece on the stage in that day. With a fivehour break it was not possible for the stage crew or the actors to work an eight-hour day. They had to work a longer day and, as a result, someone at any time was on overtime. I understood the reasons but it was hell for an employer. There is no doubt about it. Before the days of enterprise bargaining, it was incredibly tough to keep any kind of efficiency on the stages of Australia, and I imagine it was difficult to keep efficiency or work for efficiency in a wide range of other workplaces as well. They were the days before the reforms of the eighties. But, when it came to safety, I was incredibly happy to work with the unions. They were a great partner of mine in working with my staff to keep them safe in the extremely tough environment of the stage, where speed is important and where, if you do not open on time and to budget, your business goes out the back door. Under the pressures and tight deadlines, my focus was not always on what was good for the long-term health of my employees; my focus was sometimes on what I needed to get done at that moment in order to keep the business alive. I remember one instance, and the circumstance is still quite common today. I was managing an ensemble that was recording a film soundtrack for a German film company. The soundtrack was for a silent film called Korkarlen, by Victor Sjostrom, who was a very famous Swedish director in the 1920s. We were doing three-hour calls, as they still do in the music business. Two minutes before the end of the call, we still had a 90second section to record. I knew that when those three hours was up every bow would go down and every instrument would go back in its case. In the classical music business, you did not go 30 seconds over the three hours and still do not. Employers hated it then, and they hate it now. Although I am not an employer anymore, I would still hate it that, come that three hours, the instruments go down. But the reason they do that is quite simple: every employer wants them to work over the three hours. Every employer wants to them to go three hours and 10 minutes or three hours and 15 minutes. With every call there is pressure on them to go over that length. The physical demands are so great that, unless they hold that line, they simply could not come back day after day and do those three-hour calls. They cannot do eight to 10 three-hour calls in a week unless they hold that line. The consequences of not holding that line ultimately are felt by employers too. During my period with that ensemble, two of my regular contract musicians experienced chronic problems. One of them was out of work for a year due to long-term RSI injury. He was unable to move his arm at all. He was one of the best base players in the country. With the loss of that contractor, I lost ensemble, I lost rehearsal time and I lost money, as did he. The other employee left permanently because of long-term hearing damage. I know as an employer that, while it was sometimes difficult for me and it caused some immediate problems, a trade union was actively working every day in my interests and in the interests of the employees by making sure that my skilled work force would still function efficiently and effectively next week and next month. In respect of the recording of the film soundtrack that I referred to earlier, 95 seconds before the end, the leader of the ensemble said: ‘We have 90 seconds. Let's do it in one take,' and they did. So they did not go over time in the end anyway. They were able to do it because their minds were there, their skills were there, they were not tired and they were able to concentrate for the length of time to which they had agreed. I also found that working with the unions kept issues that could sometimes occur daily out of the workplace. When you work under great pressure each day to get things donewhen you are working with casuals, as you did in the industry that I was in-you do not want issues to fester in the workplace because there is too much work to be done. I found that the union were a great ally. They were there often enough, they knew the issues and they raised them with me early. So, rather than my staff being concerned about things, perhaps putting off raising issues or perhaps talking about them among themselves and stirring themselves up over issues that were easily solved, I was informed about them early enough to do something about them. We were able to keep disputes and the emotional side of issues out of my workplace. I found the union to be an extremely effective ally in keeping the efficiency of my workplace intact. I was also grateful for the work that unions did to make sure that other workplaces did not treat my contractors badly. As any industry that works with contractors would know, you need your contractor to turn up fit for work. They quite often work for others. If the conditions get too bad in other workplaces-for example, if they are not paid enough, if they are overworked and they turn up to your place tired or if they take on more work than they can physically do-they fail. They go broke. I looked to unions then, and I still do, as one of the ways that one workplace can be protected from the bad practices of another workplace. The stage was and still is a very dangerous place. Most people do not know that when you look at a big stage, although you might see 10 metres of height, above that there are three floors of fly towers-sometimes three rails, quite often two-that stretch up some three storeys above. In those fly towers, scenery is hung with nuts and bolts and pieces of timber. Sometimes it is kept together with hinges. They are potentially unsafe places, and workplace injuries are quite common. In my crew on the stage of the Lyric Theatre in Queensland was a head mechanist who in a previous workplace had lost an eye when he was using toggles to tie two flats together. The rope came loose and took out one eye. A second mechanist who worked on contract had lost half a foot in an accident on another stage. My head electrician was legendary in the industryunfortunately, I have to say-for yelling out, ‘Heads,' to warn the workers below when he fell from the third-floor tower a few years earlier. Stages are not places where hard-hats are worn-actors clearly do not wear hardhats. So, when one is working in the fly tower, if one drops a tool or a piece of scenery, one yells out, ‘Heads,' so everyone underneath can duck, which is pretty much what you do. We spent a lot of time looking up on the stages in Australia and around the world, but this man saw workers below and yelled out, ‘Heads.' He then spent eight months in hospital. He lost large parts from inside but he came back to the theatre and was one of the best head electricians in the country. I was extremely fortunate in not having any injuries during my time largely because of what I would describe as a feral approach to the safety of the workers that I employed by the union that represented them. I did come close, though, and from that experience I cannot imagine what workplaces go through when there is an injury. In our regulation today, we should consider what is best for the workers. There can be nothing worse than a workplace death. In my world we came very close one day when one of the cables that supported the large sound doors in the back of the Lyric Theatre snapped when we were moving one of the doors-a 14.9-metre-wide door, 10 metres high, made of metal, that cut the sound between the stage and the rear stage area, operated hydraulically. The cable thrashed about violently, cut through a number of five-centimetre hessian ropes on the fly rail on its way through, and then very gently wrapped itself around the neck of my head flyman on the third floor. It left him with a very small red mark, and left us all incredibly traumatised. I lost my crew for two days that day. I have never forgotten it. We joked for days that Mal still had kept his head, but Mal did still have his head. I am well aware that, in the extremely dangerous environments of theatre stages, construction sites, wharves, mines, the forestry industry, and even in workplaces that we do not think of as unsafe, it is extremely easy for an accident to happen unless we have that group of people dedicated to making sure that it does not happen. This government believes that unions have no role to play in protecting our workers and in keeping our workplaces safe-not for any researched reason, not for any real reason, but simply because of the fundamental belief that unions are bad and must be removed from every single aspect of workplace negotiations, and because of the even more foolish notion that individual workers without collective bargaining powers can negotiate one on one with their employers on all matters, including safety, and get a fair deal. Anybody who has paid attention to what has been happening in parliament over the last few months might be forgiven for thinking that the most urgent issue, the most dire situation, the worse possible threat to Austraconditions lia, is the trade union movement. While the government distract with talk of future IR changes, they are already setting about dismantling our IR system through almost daily attacks on unions. But an attack on a union is an attack on the right to collectively bargain, and it is a fundamental right and part of our national character. We see a government fighting a very old battle from the seventies, when workplaces were largely inflexible and when industrial action was rife. But unions have changed a great deal since then. They are great problem solvers, quite often better than the government, and they often lead the government in finding solutions in workplaces, well ahead of legislation. We have seen the unions work incredibly quickly, in some cases ahead of government, to introduce superannuation for their workers through the establishment of industry funds. Of course, we have seen the government attack that-a great achievement of the union movement that has brought many workers into the superannuation foldthrough super choice legislation, which was only about weakening the role of unions in that extremely important area. In the last couple of days we have seen changes to the way that subcontractors and contractors will be able to negotiate collective agreements. Again, this is a response to changing workplaces where the unions have led the way, finding ways for contractors, which in many cases are just the new employees, to collectively bargain-to make sure that owner-drivers, for example, are able to buy their trucks and work in safety; that their contracts are not driven so low that they are forced to work unsafely by driving long hours, being unable to maintain their vehicles, being unable to pay off their vehicles. But then again we have seen the collective agreements that established the minimum under which owner-drivers could work undone by this government in the last couple of days. We have also seen jail sentences introduced for unionists. There is no doubt that in the next six months or so we will see a few unionists in jail simply for standing up for the rights of workers and demanding the right for those workers to collectively bargain. We see, through recent regulation and again through this bill, the skewing of the balance between the family and the workplace. I say ‘the family and the workplace' not ‘the worker and the workplace' because that is what industrial relations has always been about; that is what the union movement has always been about. When we talk about balance between work and family lives, there has been no stronger advocate for that than the trade union movement over the last 100 years. They are the ones that have fought so hard to make sure that workers go home alive, with all their limbs attached, physically well and in a fit emotional and physical condition, to spend time with their families. They are the ones that are aware that, daily, families set about trying to find a way to do all of the things that we as a society need them to do-to educate their children well, to accumulate assets, to save for their retirement, to save for a rainy day. The balance is skewing further and further towards profit and not the family and in all of our electorates, and certainly in mine, there is greater difficulty for the family to do what we all need them to do. This issue of safety is at the very basis of family life. In Australia at the moment our record on workplace safety is not great at all. The death toll of 3,000 people per year through workplace deaths is not something to be proud of. Nearly 2,300 people die each year as a result of work related exposure to chemicals, and that figure will rise considerably as asbestos deaths cut in. We can expect between 40,000 and 60,000 more deaths due to asbestos related illnesses in the next 15 years. Then, of course, there are nearly half a million injuries in the workplace; nearly half a million Australian employees experience a work related injury or illness every year. Nearly three million Australians are now suffering from work related long term health conditions. The unions are not the enemy when it comes to workplace safety-far from it. They are a vital partner in making sure that our workplaces are safe. They are a group of organisations that have extensive corporate knowledge of the issues in a workplace. Safety issues are not necessarily well known in any particular workplace. Inexperienced workers, unscrupulous or ill-informed employers do not necessarily make for safe workplaces. The unions, because of their involvement in this area over decades, are well informed on safety issues. They see issues in one workplace which they can apply to another. It makes us all safer, and in the long run it makes our businesses safer. The legislation as it is, which weakens the role of unions and the capacity of employees to protect their safety in the workplace, is not in the national interest or in the interests of family. And if it is not in the interests ily, it cannot be in the interests I would urge the government to reconsider its attitude to this and to reconsider this legislation. The safety of Australian workers and their families is not a place for old ideology; it is not a place for hatred, vendettas or vindictiveness against the unions of the past. It is one of the most serious issues in the workplace. It concerns your very serious commitment to the health of workers and not your extreme ideology and hatred of unions. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (11.00 am)-Firstly, let me commend the member for Parramatta for her contribution to this debate on the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005. We hear a lot from those on the other side of this House about people in the Labor Party not having sympathy for small business. Here you have had a small business person telling this House of the importance of occupational health and safety in the workplaces that she managed and in which she has been intimately involved over many years. I listened with heightened interest to the member for Parramatta's contribution. My daughter works on the production side in the entertainment industry. When she tells me she is bumping in a show, the immediate concern that I have is for her safety and the safety of the young people who she is involved with in her workplace. The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005 is the latest instalment in the Howard government's attack on unionists in this country. In this bill, blind ideological prejudice has once again prevailed over common sense and good public policy. This bill is all the evidence that the Australian community needs-indeed that public employees needthat this is a government that has been in power too long. It is arrogant and it is out of of famtouch with the needs of ordinary working of the nation. Australians. It has now become obvious to all in this debate that the motivation behind this bill is not good governance but an ugly prejudice that stains everything it touches. For working people, whether they be in public or private employment, the issue of occupational health and safety is central to their working lives. should be the expectation of every worker, male or female, in this country that, when they leave home on a Monday, they will return home that evening to their families. That does not always happen. It ought to be the aim of any government of any political persuasion to enact sensible, considered legislation that takes the politics out of occupational health and safety and addresses in a balanced way the needs of employers, employees, their chosen industrial representatives and the wider community in these matters. This bill simply does not do that. In opposing this legislation, I rise on behalf of all Commonwealth employees in my electorate of Corio, be they in Australia Post, the Australian Taxation Office, the Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong or any other place of public employment in the Geelong region. The legislation constitutes an overt attack on their industrial rights and will not advance occupational health and safety in their workplaces. The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 provides the legal basis for the protection of the health and safety of Commonwealth employees in departments, statutory authorities and government business enterprises. The bill we are debating today seeks to amend that act. When you strip it bare, it is the Howard government's latest attempt to remove the role of unions in occupational health and safety matters. Labor opposes the introduction of the management agreements which are contained in this bill-agreements which effectively remove the need for government agencies to negotiate occupational health and safety agreements with unions and employees. The ugly prejudice of this government is amply demonstrated by the removal in this It bill of any mention of unions, which are to be replaced by employee representatives, now defined as a registered organisation or a workplace staff association, which now must be invited into a workplace by an employee. Employees will now have to invite the employee representative to initiate an occupational health and safety investigation where previously unions could make a direct request to Comcare to investigate a particular workplace. Many people who have worked in public as well as private employment know that many employees, when they raise occupational health and safety issues, do so at some risk of retaliation by their employer in some way. The unions have played a very constructive role in such situations. Under existing legislation, they have the power to take a complaint that is raised with them to Comcare for some degree of investigation and resolution. Under this legislation we have a deliberate attempt by this Howard government to change that. After nine long years in office, completely out of touch with the Australian people, the government has introduced this piece of legislation that seeks to reflect its blind ideological prejudice in removing unions from their role in initiating on behalf of employees matters before Comcare and other agencies. A quite extraordinary provision in this bill is that under which employee representatives who become involved in developing the so called management arrangements must be issued with a certificate to do so by the CEO of Comcare which will be valid for only 12 months. There has been no logical justification advanced by the government for that particular element of this bill. This provision alone is likely to be in breach of ILO convention 87 relating to freedom of association in the workplace, which Australia became party to in 1973. More insidious is the provision in this bill that employers ought to control the election of who will ultimately represent workers in these important matters relating to occupational health and safety in Commonwealth workplaces and statutory authority workplaces. So much for choice in industrial matters! This government is always trumpeting its mantra about choice in a whole range of policy areas. Most recently that has focused on the areas of superannuation and student union fees. But when it comes to choice and occupational health and safety in the workplace, government members sing a different tune. Quite frankly, I think government members are acting like two-faced hypocrites in this matter. They talk about choice in some particular areas of policy but, when it comes to the choice of workers in Commonwealth agencies, the government backslides on that particular issue. I think the House would do well to reflect on the appalling statistics on work related deaths and injuries and illness in this country each year. It is estimated that there are around 3,000 work related deaths in Australia each year, of which 450 are the result traumatic incident at work and 200 are the result of someone else's work activity. We are talking about a very serious matter here. Blind ideological prejudice ought to be withdrawn from the consideration of this matter and replaced by a considered and rational approach to occupational health and safety that will deliver the best outcomes for Commonwealth employees in reduced deaths, reduced accidents and reduced injuries in workplaces. But the government seems to want to play politics with every piece of industrial legislation. It puts up some very rious arguments to support its point of view on this particular matter. Some 480,000 employees experience a work related injury or illness each year, which at the end of the day translates to 2.8 million Australians suffering work related, long-term health conditions. These are appalling statistics overall. I would not be the first member of this House who has had an employee from a Commonwealth agency come into their office with a difficult situation relating to occupational health and safety considerations and injuries that have occurred in the workplace. Occupational health and safety is not an optional extra in workplaces. There is too much at stake for working families. I say to honourable members opposite: it would be a different tune if they were in a workplace that was in some way unsafe or had the potential to be unsafe. I am sure that members opposite would avail themselves of every opportunity to protect their own lives. They would want structures in place to save their skins in their workplace. They would leave no stone unturned to ensure that the work practices and the work environment delivered a safe workplace that enabled them to get home to their families of an evening. I bet there would not be a member of the govof a ernment who would not go to quite extreme lengths on some occasions to ensure that the workplace that they worked in was safe and to save their skins. Yet here we have their blind prejudice manifested throughout this particular bill. The justifications for this legislation are quite spurious. I am reminded of this by the press release of the ACTU issued today entitled ‘Fed Govt Waters Down Health & Safety Rights For 250,000 Workers'. They make some very interesting points. The current system for Commonwealth employees spuhas been most effective in protecting employees and it has been less expensive than similar compensation schemes around the country. So what is the justification for watering down these particular provisions? It cannot be that it is to reduce the expense related to the safety issues in these workplaces. It cannot be to deliver a better outcome, because in comparative terms Commonwealth workplaces are much safer than many others. The only reason that we have this legislation in this parliament today is the blind prejudice of an extreme government that now has control of both houses of parliament and is intent on using that majority to give expression to the worse prejudices of conservative politics in this country. Mr Brough interjecting Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-The honourable parliamentary secretary, the minister or whatever you are in the governmentMr Brough-Oh, you're ignorant as well. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-We are ignorant are we? I bet you would leave no stone unturned to save your skin. The honourable member would leave no stone unturned in any workplace to save his own miserable skin, yet he will not grant the same privileges and rights to workers in other areas. That is fairly typical. The minister will of course be able to get this legislation through both houses of parliament, but I will let every Commonwealth employee in my electorate know exactly what this government is doing to occupational health and safety in their workplaces. This is a government that preaches about lawlessness in industrial relations. What unbridled hypocrisy that is! This is a government that trained mercenaries in another country to work on Australian wharves. This is a government that has unleashed dogs on Australian workers in the past. You talk about lawlessness in industrial workplaces, but what about the lawlessness of a government that is up to its ears in that sort of caper? There is a very good reason why we should retain a union presence in Commonwealth workplaces and give workers access to representatives of their choosing on these matters: those workplaces have been demonstrated to be safer than many other workplaces in this country. There is a very good reason why the current legislation should be maintained, but it is obvious that the government will not listen to reasoned argument on this matter. You cannot listen to reasoned argument if you are an extreme and radical government introducing extreme measures in the industrial relations arena. You do not have the political or intellectual capacity in that state of mind to enact reasonable legislation in the interests of Commonwealth workers. Good governance requires that those decision makers extract all prejudice from their consideration of matters and look at the best outcomes for working people in this area. Why should that be so? It is because the lives of Australians are at stake. Honourable members opposite can talk all they like about unions and their representatives using occupational health and safety matters for other reasons. If that is the case then why don't you try and solve that particular problem in another way and retain the good features of a system that has delivered the best occupational health and safety outcomes relative to other workplaces in this country? You have not got the capacity to do that because you are peddling a very extreme form of industrial and workplace relations. There should be no place for extremism in workplace relations. The radical, extreme proposals that are now emanating from the coalition, courtesy of the Prime Minister's blind prejudice, will see more Australians die in Australian workplaces. That will be on the heads of those who have put this legislation before the parliament today.",45
42,Mr ANDREWS,OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (11.20 am)-in reply-I thank members for their contributions during this debate. The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005 reflects the government's commitment to improving health and safety outcomes in Commonwealth workplaces and follows amendments to the occupational health and safety act in 2004 which introduced a new, strong compliance regime. The Australian government firmly believes that safe and productive workplaces rely on a cooperative approach between employers and employees to identify and eliminate hazards that may cause injury or death. The focus of occupational health and safety regulation must shift from imposing prescriptive processes towards enabling workplaces to make informed decisions about how best to reduce the risks to health and safety in the workplace. Opposition speakers have wrongly suggested that this bill is an attack on unions that it removes unions from involvement in occupational health and safety in the workplace. That is simply not the case. The bill improves not only protection for employees but also workplace democracy-something we know is anathema to the opposition and the trade union movement. We have heard the member for Corio railing against this bill in the parliament for the last 15 or 20 minutes. His speech was high on overblown rhetoric and almost devoid of substance. Under this bill, all employees can participate in occupational health and safety matters at their workplace. Employers would negotiate directly with employees, who may be represented by unions or other representative organisations. In other words, employees will have choice-and the opposition is so vehement in opposing the bill because they do not believe that workers should be free to choose. Unions should not be given a mandated and privileged role with respect to occupational health and safety in those workplaces covered by the act. Those provisions inhibit the effectiveness of the act. Removing the privileged role of unions in workplace health and safety arrangements and giving prominence to the interests of employees will bring Commonwealth laws in line with most state and territory occupational health and safety laws. Is it unreasonable to provide that employees must first request union involvement in occupational health and safety matters at their workplace and that they be given the right to choose who represents their interests? New South Wales Occupational Health and Safety Regulation 2001 provides that: A Federal or State industrial organisation of employees may represent, for the purposes of consultation on OHS consultative arrangements, any of those employees who request the organisation to represent them. The government and the Labor Party both and believe that workers should have the right to be represented by unions, but the fundamental difference between the two parties is that Labor wants union membership to the exclusion of all other options. Labor is contemptuous of a worker's right to choose an alternative to union representation simply because for Labor there is no alternative. Labor would allow union bosses to walk into any business at any time under the guise of a suspected occupational health and safety breach, even when there are no union members present at that business. The member for Perth suggested that, under the amendments proposed by this bill, unions will be unable to directly request Comcare to investigate an occupational health and safety breach. This is not the case. The existing powers of unions to request Comcare to investigate occupational health and safety breaches are not being removed. Under this bill, employee representatives, including unions, can request an investigation by Comcare, provided it is at the request of an employee. Opposition speakers have also lamented the changes to the provisions about electing health and safety representatives. Currently, where there is an involved union, the act gives that union a monopoly role in the conduct of elections for health and safety representatives. This has unsatisfactory results. Firstly, because unions control the nominations, they can prevent a non-union member from becoming a health and safety representative. This can mean that persons with relevant qualifications, expertise or an interest health and safety in their workplace do not have the opportunity to take on that role. Secondly, positions can remain vacant for extended periods where there is no union member nominated. Perhaps the opposition could have explained how such unsatisfactory outcomes are promoting the best possible arrangements to ensure workplace occupational health and safety. There is nothing sinister about the employer arranging the elections for health and safety representatives. New South Wales has a similar provision. Employers are under a duty of care to ensure that workplaces are safe. Having health and safety representatives is an important component of having safe workplaces. It is therefore reasonable to place an obligation on employers to make sure that elections for health and safety representatives are conducted. In the event that employees are not happy with the election arrangements proposed by employers, the bill enables elections to be conducted in accordance with processes prescribed in the regulations. The key amendments relate to the employer's duty of care and the workplace arrangements provisions. They will improve health and safety arrangements for Commonwealth employers and employees by enabling them to work more closely together to develop arrangements that suit the needs of their particular workplace. Current workplace arrangements, such as the requirements to have health and safety representatives and committees, remain. The amendments will not in any way diminish the Commonwealth's duty of care as an employer to ensure the health and safety of its employees at work or that of others who may be at the workplace. The amendments aim to remove prescriptive requirements, introduce flexibility and ensure that employers and employees in are free to develop appropriate health and safety arrangements to apply at their workplaces. Section 16 is being amended to replace the current prescriptive elements which require an employer to develop an occupational health and safety policy in consultation with involved unions. Instead, section 16 will be more outcomes focused, allowing employers, in consultation with their employees, to develop health and safety management arrangements tailor made to the needs of their particular workplace. The bill gives employees a wider choice as to who may represent them, including another employee, a registered association such as a union or an association of employees which has a principal purpose of protecting and promoting the employees' interests in matters concerning their employment, such as a staff association or an unregistered union. Finally, I assure members that the measures proposed in this bill, in particular the proposed new section 16B, do not violate any implied constitutional freedom of association or Australia's ILO obligations. It has been suggested that the mechanisms for ensuring employee anonymity proposed by new section 16B may prove to be a strong deterrent to employees seeking representation in consultations with employers about safety management arrangements. These concerns totally misunderstand and misrepresent the intended operation of section 16B. Section 16B enables the CEO of Comcare to certify that a union or staff association is entitled to represent an employee who wishes to remain anonymous. A certificate issued by the CEO of Comcare guarantees that employee's anonymity. Section 16B provides a mechanism to protect an employee's identity if the employee wishes to keep his or her choice about their representation confidential. It is not a precondition to unions or staff associations representing their members. If section 16B were to be deleted, there would be no mechanism to provide employees with confidentiality. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",52

47,Ms ROXON,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Gellibrand) (11.30 am)The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005 represents an overhaul of the federal legislative regime for drug related offences. The bill migrates some offences from the Customs Act to the Criminal Code, while introducing new antidrug offences in line with chapter 6 of the Model Criminal Code. Offences that have been migrated from the Customs Act include, but are not limited to, the importation and exportation of commercial or marketable quantities of border controlled drugs or plants, the possession of commercial or marketable quantities of Telstra unlawfully imported border controlled drugs or plants, and the possession of commercial or marketable quantities of border controlled drugs or plants that are, or are suspected of having been, unlawfully imported. The Model Criminal Code Officers Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General developed chapter 6 offences in 1998 after nationwide consultation. The chapter takes into account the 1980 report by the Hon. Mr Justice Williams, who called for greater consistency in Australia's drug laws. Since then, the pattern of drug use in Australia has changed and chapter 6 has been appropriately modified to take into account developments that have occurred over the last few years. Probably the most significant change would be the increased trade in manufactured drugs and chemical substances used to make those drugs or precursors. New offences that are proposed for introduction into the Criminal Code include, but are not limited to, the trafficking of controlled drugs, the cultivation of controlled plants, the sellnow ing of controlled plants, manufacturing controlled drugs, pre-trafficking controlled precursors, possessing controlled drugs, supplying controlled drugs to children, and procuring children for pre-trafficking controlled precursors. To increase the enforceability of the precursor offences, the bill includes a presumption of intent to manufacture an illicit drug where a person is illegally selling, manufacturing or possessing the prescribed precursors. Labor recognise that drugs and serious drug offences have a major detrimental impact on society, and we therefore support this bill. The bill will not change existing regulatory offences involving controlled substances, such as the scheme in place for the issuing of licences for the manufacture of controlled substances under the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967. However, for the purposes of replacing other offences, the bill proposes to streamline the terms which refer to illicit drugs, as current federal drug offences employ a number of different terms. For offences relating to import and export, the terms ‘border controlled drugs', ‘border controlled plants' and ‘border controlled precursors' would be used. For other offences with broader domestic application, the terms ‘controlled drugs', ‘controlled plants' and ‘controlled precursors' would be used. Labor recognises the need for the overhaul of the legislative regime regarding drug related offences. The drug problem, especially the trafficking and supply of drugs to minors, is of great concern and not something that can be tackled half-heartedly. Labor referred the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005 to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for adequate and detailed scrutiny. The committee was due to hand down its report on 9 August but has extended that reporting date. Before the report is handed down, though, I will expand on some of the possible areas where we think this bill could have been done better. Of concern to Labor is the extent to which the bill complies with the Model Criminal Code and the suitability of new penalties under the bill. Where the offences deviate from those of the code, we think the onus is on the government to offer a complete rationale for doing so. Of course, where offences which deviate from the code do so because they are modelled on the import-export offences from the Customs Act, that is fair enough. Additional explanation is required for offences that are not sourced from either the Customs Act or the Model Criminal Code. According to the government, the proposed new offences are principally targeted at organised illicit drug traders and commercially motivated crime. The aim of the proposed new offences is to remove the legal loopholes being exploited by drug traders who structure the illegal trafficking of serious drugs in a way which avoids the consequences of their conduct under the existing law. The new offences provide an avenue for accumulating the amount of drugs traded on multiple occasions within a specified period into a single offence to avoid traffickers escaping liability by manipulating the amount of drugs traded on each occasion. The bill will preserve the existing regulatory offences involving controlled substances, such as the scheme in place for the issuing of licences for the manufacture of controlled substances under the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967. Existing state and territory regulatory schemes will continue to operate, and it will be a defence to the offences in the bill if the relevant conduct is justified or excused under a law of the Commonwealth or a state or territory. Another matter that Labor sought to resolve through the scrutiny of the bill by the committee is the extent to which the new federal offences with complementary state offences are defined and punished similarly, and whether the state and territory jurisdictions have been adequately consulted on the bill. Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT have already implemented many of the provisions contained within chapter 6 of the Model Criminal Code. This bill, if enacted, intends to replace the legislative regime of the Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1990, the TINDAPS Act-and I think there is a good reason for that acronym. The government, in its incompetence, has failed to move across the scheduled drugs that that act covers. In yet another demonstration of mismanagement by the Howard government it has left Australia with two overlapping federal drug regimes in play. Of particular concern to me is that a number of substances included under the TINDAPS Act have not been included in this particular bill. When the TINDAPS Act is eventually replaced, parliament will be forced to return here to look at yet another amendment to this brand new section of the Criminal Code. This is not fair to the Federal Police and Customs officers on the ground, and it leaves the community in a general state of uncertainty as to exactly what in fact the law is. The government claims that it could not include the repeal of the act in this bill, but that is not accurate if adequate transitional provisions and arrangements had been made, as is the usual custom and standard practice. The second reason the government has raised is that the Ministerial Council on Drugs Strategy Working Party is yet to complete its list of illicit substances and threshold quantities. That sounds plausible until you consider that the substances listed in the TINDAPS Act already have legal effect and that the list contained in the current bill is at significant variance with the lists prescribed under Customs regulations. In other words, the government has already produced a list outside the working party considerations. It appears as though the rationale for concurrently operating legislation over an extended period is that the government has not yet finished its work in reviewing and transferring the TINDAPS substances across to the new bill. The government has not done so because of ministerial incompetence and a lack of oversight. It is yet another example of the ministerial malaise that affects the Justice and Customs portfolio right across the board, whether in fighting crime, drugs legislation, missing persons or cargo management. This is another example of Howard government mismanagement that will produce additional cost to taxpayers through now requiring a second piece of legislation where one could have done. We will now be here again reviewing and amending in a matter of months-as I have already said-the very provisions we have before us here today. As many people in this House would know, a single parliamentary sitting day costs something in the order of $300,000. Just like anywhere else, time is money in this place so, when the government wastes time, it wastes taxpayers' money. In future the government must ensure that all aspects of a particular bill or amendment are included when it passes through this chamber so that we do not have to come back here in six months time or so as the case may be in this instance. In response to questions on notice, the torney-General's Department stated that no consultation had been undertaken together with the states or territories regarding this bill, as they would have been aware of the model offences since the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee completed its report on serious drug offences in 1998. However, in the same set of responses, ney-General's Department also listed each offence within the bill and the corresponding offence from the Model Criminal Code. There were almost a dozen offences that had no corresponding offence within the code. The question is, then: how were the states and territories consulted on these offences? I will also now briefly outline some of the other non-drug related provisions of the bill. Schedule 2 would ensure that Australia complies with the optional protocol that states that the recruitment or use in hostilities by armed groups not part of the state of persons under the age of 18 should be criminalised. The bill will comply with this obligation by amending the Criminal Code to provide that these activities constitute federal offences and would be punishable by imprisonment for up to 17 years. Schedule 5 seeks to amend the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Act 1992 to facilitate the transfer of responsibilities from the Attorney-General to the Treasurer for consideration of requests received from foreign regulators for information, documents or evidence relating to the foreign enforcement of business law. Similarly, schedule 6 amends the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 to clarify that cash dealers are not required to obtain multiple identification references from a person who is a signatory to different accounts with the cash dealer. Schedule 7 repeals the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act 1950, which no longer has any legal effect, while schedule 9 exempts AUSTRAC from the At- operation of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 in relation to documents concerning information communicated to it under section 16 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988. In summary, Labor support the intent of this bill and, while anticipating the Senate committee report, we commend it to the House and reserve the right to pursue the Attor- amendments in the Senate.",55
48,Mr SOMLYAY,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Fairfax) (11.41 am)Crime and the fear of crime consistently rate among the highest concerns of the Australian public. The Australian Institute of Criminology has estimated that crime costs Australia around $32 billion a year, and drugs are a key factor in that figure. Drugs play a key part in the cost to our families, communities and society as a whole. Drugs do not just harm the health and welfare of the user; the harm also has enormous flow-on effects. Drugs are detrimental to health, welfare and relationships, not just to the user but to the user's family and friends-all those close to them-and to the community around them. The use, supply and manufacture of drugs breed economic and social loss for our society and generate poverty, violence criminality and fear. Because the Howard government shares the community's concerns about drugs and about the violence and criminal activity associated with them, it has been working with the states and territories since 1996 to reduce the incidence of such crime. This government does not seek to usurp the responsibility of the states and territories in the matter but, in a mobile society like Australia, where organised crime transcends state and national boundaries, there is a persuasive case for uniformity in the definition of serious drug offences. Such uniformity will ensure that there are no loopholes between state and federal laws that can be exploited by drug cartels. As it states in the title, the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005 deals with serious drug offences. It aims to bring uniformity and definition to those offences and focuses not on the end user but on organised illicit drug traders and commercially motivated drug crimes-that is, this bill targets those who make a business out of manufacturing and/or trafficking in drugs. It targets those who make a business out of the drug industry, which has such a negative effect on our society and our sense of safety in our communities. To that end, there are four key aspects of the bill: firstly, it provides a clear uniform definition of some drug terms; secondly, it introduces quantitative measures linked to penalties-again, aimed at drug commerce; thirdly, it covers new substances evolving in drug manufacture; and, lastly, it tackles the use of children in the illicit drug industry. The bill amends that part of the Criminal Code which contains offences targeting conduct considered to be a danger to the community-and that is exactly what the commercial production and trafficking of drugs is. The commercial production and trafficking of drugs constitutes a serious danger to our community. We are not talking about the end user; we are talking about the illicit drug industry, including both the trafficking and the manufacture of drugs. Most jurisdictions throughout the world have grouped such serious offences together in this way. It is also a feature of the Model Criminal Code developed over recent years by all Australian governments-federal, state and territory-working together to achieve greater national consistency in criminal law. You cannot fight interstate and international drug gangs and cartels with inconsistent laws. Criminals do not respect state boundaries and will obviously use any perceived inconsistencies to escape the courts. Our aim is to ensure that there are no gaps between federal and state laws that can be exploited by drug cartels. Variations in laws that deal essentially with the same subject not only impede law enforcement efforts but also are a source of potential injustice. That is why it is good to see that this bill provides a consistent terminology for referring to illicit drugs. This defined terminology replaces the current variety of terms used in federal offences. For instance, it introduces the generic terms ‘controlled drugs', ‘controlled plants' and ‘controlled precursors'. The specific substances that are covered by each of these categories together with the appropriate quantities are then listed in a separate division of the bill. This means that, as new synthetic drugs appear-as they do-it is easy to amend that list to include both the new drugs and any precursors used in their manufacture. Our laws can then react in a timely way to the evolving chemical processes of the illicit drug industry. The preface to chapter 6 of the Model Criminal Code, Serious Drug Offences, states that the focus should be on the individuals who make a business out of drug trafficking. The interaction of state, territory and Commonwealth offences is very significant in this area of criminal law. However, while quantitative measures of liability and presumptions of guilt based on possession of trafficable quantities are common in many jurisdictions, they are remarkable in their absence of uniformity. This bill introduces three quantitative levels of offence in the trafficking and manufacture of drugs, each level with a defined threshold and associated penalty. This allows the maximum penalty for an offence to be structured according to quantity-whether the amount of drugs involved is of a large commercial quantity, a marketable commodity or simply a lesser quantity. Once again, we are targeting drug commerce. But the bill goes a step further than linking specific quantitative measures to the level of offence and the associated penalties. It also allows law enforcement agencies to target those who, by fragmenting their commercial drug dealings, try to avoid liability for the most serious offences. Where a person has trafficked in relatively small quantities of drugs on a number of occasions within a seven-day period, the new laws will allow prosecutors to add those quantities together so that the person can be prosecuted for a single offence involving the total quantity. This closes another loophole for the big end of the drug market. The third aspect of the bill that I will tion concerns the manufacture of illicit drugs and allows the law to cover evolving drugs, chemicals and processes without the need to wait for new legislation each time a new drug or process is uncovered. Synthetic drugs, such as amphetamines and designer drugs, are manufactured from chemicals called precursors, which usually have quite legitimate uses in industry. This bill introduces new pre-trafficking offences that target illicit dealings in such chemicals for the purpose of illegal drug manufacture. These reforms enable the law to be more responsive to the illicit drug market by allowing new drugs or precursor chemicals to be added very quickly to the list of illicit substances. The fourth key aspect of this bill is the creation of a regime of offences for adults who exploit children for commercial gain in the illicit drug industry. The offences include supplying illegal drugs to children or using children in any way to facilitate the trafficking or manufacture of drugs. They include using children to sell, transport, guard or conceal either drugs or precursors. The regime also makes it an offence to use children as a means of procuring other children to undertake these tasks. Obviously, these new offences are aimed at those who would corrupt our children and I do not think any member in this House would argue against them. However, the explanatory memorandum to the bill points out an additional reason for ensuring that it is a serious offence to use children in the supply or manufacture of drugs. It points out that children, due to their lower tolerance to chemical toxicity, are particularly vulnerable to serious side effects or death from inhalation, absorption or ingestion of these chemicals. As the minister said in his second reading speech, drug abuse directly touches the lives of thousands of Australians and indirectly affects us all. It is essential that drug trafmenfickers are met with a consistent and sophisticated array of laws that are not made obsolete or ineffective by the speed of either technological change or criminal initiative. I commend the bill to the House.",58
49,Mr HAYES,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Drug use and drug related criminal activities are issues that are never far from the minds of many parents in my electorate. As parents, they are concerned for the safety of their families-their children-and the security of their local environment. They are also concerned about the links between serious drug use, addiction and the level of crime within their suburbs. The war on drugs, as it is commonly referred to, is a battle that has been waged by most societies now over many years-and I have to say that it has had mixed successes. But the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005, which is before us today, targets one aspect of this multifaceted battle, being the issue of law enforcement. In addition to a number of amendments to other acts that are necessary to implement specific changes, the bill before us today seeks to include some 50 additional offences into the Criminal Code, with the aim of bringing to completion the implementation of the Model Criminal Code. The underlying logic is relatively straightforward: to bring together all serious drug offences into one statute rather than having them in the Customs Act-an act which I suppose could largely be described as providing a regulatory regime. While the bill's underlying logic is straightforward, some of its provisions are questionable and at least are deserving of more detailed consideration. There is no doubt that as a society we are concerned about the impact of drugs and drug use. Recent cases of Australians being caught overseas allegedly trafficking drugs have once again heightened Australia's awareness of this issue. The rights and wrongs and details of these particular cases will obviously be played out over a period of time in front of the relevant courts, but the heightened awareness is something that Australian decision makers at all levels of government need to consider immediately. It is far too easy for someone to say that law enforcement is the only answer. My own experience working with the Police Federation of Australia suggests that law enforcement is obviously a very significant contributor. I take this opportunity to commend the men and women of our police services, the state and territory police forces and our federal police authorities and agencies for their diligent work in stemming the amount, of drugs that are entering the country. Their fine work needs to be recognised and applauded as well as supported with the appropriate resources. I noted earlier that it is for some to say that stronger law enforcement is the only answer. I do not shy away from being tough on crime and nor does the Labor Party. Crime was a significant issue raised with me by constituents when I contested the recent Werriwa by-election, and I am sure that crime is an issue that has been taken up with most members in this House. When I delivered my first speech to the House, I made mention of the fact that there needs to be better integration of Commonwealth and state crime prevention activity to advance the protection and security of all Australians. I believe that stronger law enforcement and crime prevention are essential. I am personally aware that, for the last decade at least, the concept of a common code has been supported by the Police Federation of Australia on behalf of the 45,000 police officers throughout this country. Therefore, the development of the Model Criminal Code as it applies to serious drug offences is a step in the right direction and will be welcomed by police and law enforcement officers. I believe the development of the Model Criminal Code is important for police services from the policy perspective as well as the operational perspective. It reflects the fact that crime and criminals do not recognise and are not hindered by geographic boundaries but that law enforcement agencies sometimes are. I look forward to the development and the implementation of a common criminal code between the Commonwealth, states and territories, as this will allow for more effective policing. It will maximise police resources by making it easier for police to move from one state to another without the frustration of competing criminal jurisdictions. In the past, police officers on secondment were required to have detailed knowledge of the criminal code of the jurisdiction which they had been seconded to. Under the Model Criminal easy Code made possible by this bill, the common jurisdiction allows police to more easily understand and apply the code anywhere in the country without jurisdictional complication. The advent of commonality between jurisdictions is better for law enforcement and is reflective of the better tools that are needed for contemporary policing. I was particularly pleased to see the provisions contained in the bill in schedule 4. I am certain that officers of at least the Australian Police will welcome these amendments. As I noted earlier, criminals and criminal activities do not respect geographical boundaries. The ease of global travel, trade and communications not only allows for increased legitimate trade between countries but has also allowed criminals to globalise their operations. Important provisions contained in schedule 4 mean that the interaction between the Federal Police and other agencies is clarified at both a domestic and an international level. Cooperation at an international level is essential for modern law enforcement. So long as criminals fail to respect geographic boundaries, law enforcement must be afforded the operational capacity to chase the perpetrators across these boundaries. The amendments contained in schedule 4 confirm the ability of the Australian Federal Police to assist and cooperate with state and territory jurisdictions and foreign law enforcement organisations. They also clarify the involvement of the AFP in its role of assisting other nations to develop and monitor peace and security. Again, this is further equipping our police services for contemporary policing. This can only enhance the success that our law enforcement agencies are having with regard to the availability of illegal drugs in our community. Recently it was reported that the Australian Federal Police and Customs had seized nearly 2,500 kilograms of heroin since the late 1990s. In the year 2000 alone the Australian Federal Police seized more than 600 kilograms. The large seizures of the late 1990s have continued and are starting to impact on the amount of heroin available on our streets. Commentators on the illegal drug trade suggest that for the first time evidence is starting to emerge that the seizures are starting to impact on the availability of heroin. This is a significant result and I am sure that it is a level of success welcomed by Federal most Australians. While the immediate concern is the reduction in the availability of drugs on our streets, there is also benefit in terms of reduced crime levels more generally throughout our community. Research undertaken by the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research released in 2003 suggests that the most potent influence on the level of robbery in New South Wales was the increase in heroin addiction. The bureau estimated that every 10 per cent increase in the number of heroin dependent people in New South Wales between 1966 and 2000 led to an average increase in the rate of robbery of 6.4 per cent. It is the increase in property crimes associated with drug addiction that is of particular concern to the residents of my area and, I would expect, residents throughout Australia. They understand the linkages and they certainly understand that, for the vast majority of them, property crime is the manifestation of addiction which is most likely to confront them. My constituents want to know that we are not passing the buck and making excuses about police issues and police resources. They want to know that we are doing something and that we are willing to support our law enforcement agencies with appropriate and effective resources. At the forefront of the fight against drugs are our front-line officers. In my electorate in particular I would like to mention the police commands of Campbelltown, Macquarie Fields, Green Valley and Liverpool. These are all committed police officers. Quite frankly, they need to know that their efforts are appreciated and supported throughout the community. Their efforts are valued and certainly cannot be overstated. I am pleased to report that last night-and unfortunately I was not able to attend-we had the 2005 Campbelltown chamber of commerce and Rotary Macarthur police awards. I would like to congratulate Sergeant Kevin Carter, who received the most coveted Police Officer of the Year award for the Macarthur local area commands. He was also awarded and recognised in the Crime Management Award category. I would also like to congratulate the various other winners of the various categories. The importance of saying this is that communities like mine are certainly going out of their way not only to demonstrate their appreciation but to recognise what the police are doing to contribute to making their communities safer and protecting against such matters as illicit drugs influencing and impacting on families. The strengthening of the Criminal Code and penalties is an important contribution to assisting our constituents. We are serious about their concerns when it comes to crime. However, it would be short-sighted of us to think that it is the only arrow in our quiver when it comes to drug trafficking and drug related crimes. Including these crimes in the Crimes Act rather than the Customs Act and finalising the Model Criminal Code are important elements in the effort to consolidate drug offences, but they are not the tion. They are not the only solution to minimise the societal impacts of drug use, but they are important, at least in terms of contemporary policing. The New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research has reported that stronger drug law enforcement can act as a double-edged sword when it comes to reducing harm associated with serious drug use. On one hand, evidence suggests that law enforcement can encourage people into treatment, decreasing the risk of harm and other activities related to drug crime. On the other hand, there is evidence to suggest that tougher laws result in unsafe practices and increased risks to users. Enforcement and treatment, while not linked directly, are nevertheless linked. Law enforcement can encourage entry into treatment, and treatment can reduce drug related crime. Notwithstanding that research, essentially our primary focus must be on protecting the community at large. After all, we are in a war on illicit drugs every bit as much as we are committed to fighting terrorism. So, while the amendments we have before us are important, they are by no means the silver bullet for the problem of illicit drugs. If they were, this bill would have been passed long ago. Treatment and law enforcement should not be considered in isolation. I strongly support providing our police and other law enforcement personnel with the best tools to assist in their duties. As a consequence, I support this bill. In fact, in my opinion, it goes some considerable way towards doing that. But I must say that I do still have some concerns about some aspects of the direction of the bill. Accordingly, I support the bill but feel that it should be subject to greater scrutiny and a detailed review. In particular, I would like to raise some questions over the merit of including schedules 5 to 7 and schedule 9 in this bill, given the only solubill's stated objectives. I am also concerned that some of the amendments contained in this bill act to erode the presumption of innocence, which to my way of thinking has been the cornerstone of our system of justice. Some of the offences created by this bill include the presumption that possession of marketable quantities of a controlled substance meansand can be defined in the same way aspossession for commercial purposes. While this may be the case in the majority of cases, possession of a marketable quantity does not automatically mean that commercial activity was intended. It would be remiss of me not to record my concern about the long-term impact of a gradual erosion of the presumption of innocence. I acknowledge that this issue has been considered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and that it was decided that the creation of a legal rather than an dentiary burden was the preferred approach. I understand that loopholes previously used to avoid punishment must be removed, but I would not like to see this signal a greater change in the approach to law-making when it comes to criminal activity. Strengthened laws should not result in a reduction in the rights of the accused generally. Obviously in some circumstances this is necessary, but I do not believe people necessarily think there should always be this trade-off. While the provisions of schedules 5 to 7 and schedule 9 seem relatively minor on the face of it, I am unsure of all the reasons behind their inclusion in this bill. Supporting the efforts of state and territory governments in tightening and strengthening the Commonwealth's laws surrounding serious drug offences is a necessary condition to improving law enforcement throughout the country. The increasingly sophisticated activities of the criminal class must be combated through equally more sophisticated law enforcement. Contemporary policing needs laws and resources that equip them adequately and appropriately. I am unashamedly a strong supporter of our police community and I want to see them given every chance to succeed. I want them to be able to claim success after success when it comes to shutting down criminal operations. I want my constituents to feel safe in the knowledge that their concerns are being reflected by making sure that our police have the tools they need at their disposal to do just that. While I am encouraged by the direction of this bill, I cannot at this stage give it my unquestioning support. However, I support the opposition's bid to have this bill considered in greater detail.",60
50,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"It is great to have an opportunity to speak about the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences eviand Other Measures) Bill 2005. The bill is an important step forward in the campaign to better integrate our effort across Australia in the campaign against drugs. In framing my address to this bill, I would like to refer to the report of the former House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs called The road to recovery, which was produced in August 2003. Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, you were a great contributor to that report. It is opportune to reflect on some of the findings and recommendations of that report because many of them are reflected in this legislation. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may recall that the committee uncovered some frightening aspects of drug related crime. Those aspects are addressed in the campaign we see drawn together in this legislation. One of the studies considered by the committee in preparing its report was the Collins and Lapsley study, which found that the tangible cost of crime due to alcohol was $1.2 billion and the cost of crime due to illicit drugs $2.5 billion. Crimes committed by those who have taken both types of drugs together cost a further $582.3 million. The cost of criminal activity spurred on by drugs is thus high. That is just one aspect of the current debate. The committee, during the preparation of its report, reviewed the current efforts to fund law enforcement activities. According to the National Illicit Drug Strategy, Tough on Drugs, the percentage of funding allocated for law enforcement, $1 billion, is 39.75 per cent of the overall allocation. So it is a large part of the funding allocation. With those quantities of money being directed at the fight, it is important that we get it right. The committee went on to make all kinds of recommendations that reflect on the direction we are seeking to report on today. The committee were keen on the formulation of a better framework between states and the Commonwealth with regard to this important issue. I would like to read a couple of the points we made. At paragraph 8.27 of the report of the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities by the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, we reported: The committee: - supports the development of a new national framework to deal with multi-jurisdictional crime, believing that it will contribute significantly to limiting the drug trade; - applauds the government's commitment to limiting drug trafficking and associated activities in thethen2003-04 budget; and - applauds all jurisdictions and agencies commitment to limiting drug trafficking and associated activities. Recommendation 73 was as follows: The committee recommends that the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments put in place as soon as possible all components of the new national framework to combat multijurisdictional crime. Recommendation 74 states: The committee recommends that the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments urgently examine the need for Commonwealth initiatives, to support that available in the State and Territo- ries, directed at supporting local community drug control initiatives. Recommendation 75 states: The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government play an active role through the ministerial councils on police, corrective vices and justice in establishing best practice and promoting nationally consistent policies and practices in policing and sentencing as they relate to drugs. Another area where the matter being discussed in the House today coincides with what we reported on at that time concerns the precursors of drugs-particularly those created in the increasingly pervasive drug laboratories, certainly in Queensland. Recommendation 82 states: The committee recommends that legislation be introduced by governments at the Commonwealth, State or Territory level to: - require that the loss or theft of the precursors of amphetamine-type stimulants be reported to the police; - amend Schedule VI of the Customs Act 1901 to include the precursors of amphetaminetype stimulants; - restrict the supply of the precursors of amphetamine-type stimulants by: - placing ceilings on orders by retailers; - limiting replacements by wholesalers; and - requiring the pharmaceutical industry to report high-use customers to the police. Recommendation 83 states: - the National Working Group on Diversion of Precursor Chemicals identify a way to make legislation sufficiently flexible to be able to regulate immediately the changing precursors that are found in amphetamine type stimulants; - the Commonwealth government amend its Standard for uniform scheduling of drugs and poisons to make all substances containing pseudoephedrine a Schedule 4 Prescription Only Medicine; and State and Territory governments adopt the proposed legislative and scheduling proposals developed on pseudoephedrine, as outlined in the two dot points above, as soon as possible after their identification. The overall tone that we adopted in that reserport was for effective cooperation and much better monitoring of issues such as precursors. I am thrilled, therefore, to endorse the legislation we have before us today. When criminals involved in the drug trade can alter their production capabilities and seek to find a way around the law, it is important that we are ever more vigilant and ever more effective at stamping out as quickly as possible those new paths that the criminals might adopt, if at all possible in advance. When I was reading about the background of some of these clandestine laboratories, I found that Queensland has really suffered because of an explosion in the numbers of these chemical laboratories. The manufacture of amphetamines in Queensland, through the use of backyard boxed laboratories, is spinning out of control. It has been high for some time now and it is getting more and more prevalent, so I think the benefits of this operative approach will be felt in my home state more than anywhere else in Australia. However, it is important that we remain vigilant. In 1997-98, 58 per cent of the laboratories detected by police were in Queensland. Since then, we have continued on a downhill path. In 1963, the first amphetamine laboratories were discovered and were operated by outlaw motorcycle gangs in the United States. We have moved down the path a long way. In Australia alone, there are drugs such as ecstasy, methcathanone, cannabis oil, ‘crack' cocaine, pethidine, GBH, DMT, LSD, PCP and Mandrax. These are the types of drugs that can be produced in a clandestine manner in these laboratories. While some of those have not yet been found to have been produced in labs in Queensland, the great concern is that they will be. We must remain effective in our campaign to get ahead of the game, and that is what this legislation is about. The legislation attacks the issue of the use of children that are brought into these operations. This is an important tactic. The use of illicit drugs is quite prevalent in our community. During 2001, a study found that, in the 20to 29-year age group, recent use of any illicit drug in males was recorded at 40.4 per cent. So quite a high percentage of people in that age group regularly use drugs. That outstrips the 28.8 per cent of males in the 14to 19-year age group, which perhaps get a higher profile in reporting. There has been a continuing trend towards amphetamines, which is apparent in the arrest rate. In 2001, in police raids in the United States, 2,028 children were found at illegal drug laboratories, and 700 of those children had toxic levels of chemicals in their system. That is a matter of great concern. There is a coreadiness and wherewithal of the system in that these labs can be so readily relocated. They can be set up in the boot of a car, in a flat or in any nook or cranny in the community. That creates a risk for children in the vicinity, and we need to address it. I am very pleased that the bill focuses on the danger of serious drug offences to the community and particularly to that vulnerable group of children. The legislation will achieve greater national consistency in dealing with serious drug offences, and this was sought by the committee. The update and transfer of these offences is part of an ongoing process to make central in a criminal code all serious offences under Commonwealth legislation. The legislation will substantially complete the government's implementation of the model criminal code, which was devised in 1998 by the state, territory and Australian governments. Some of the measures in the all bill are based on the model criminal code. Others are based on existing offences under the Customs Act, such as import and export offences. Importantly, other measures account for changes in drug manufacture and use in recent years. We are being flexible and effective. Although members opposite remain to be convinced about some of these initiatives, I believe that the consideration in detail stage the bill will help them to get across these matters. Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, in the committee that you and I were part of, we discovered the importance of this issue and I am sure that members opposite will be convinced. I could continue at some length; however, I am aware of the need to expedite this matter and I will leave it there.",64
51,Mr WOOD,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I stand in support of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005, which is designed to build on the existing illicit drug legislation while creating a uniform approach to increasing penalties for new and existing drug offences. This bill is based on the work of the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee which was established by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General to work on a uniform Criminal Code to be adopted across Australia. As it stands, current Australian drug enforcement legislation stems from the Customs Act 1901, which covers importation and exportation as well as possession of prohibited narcotics. Later came the Narcotic Drugs Act 1967, which created a licensing regime for the manufacture of narcotic drugs. Finally, the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act 1990 extends Australia's extraterritorial jurisdiction relating to drug trafficking in cordance with the 1998 UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Australia has jurisdiction over persons outside Australia who engage in activities with a view to conducting a drug offence in Australia. I will look at the overdose rate nationally. The number of overdose fatalities in Australia indicates that, despite the best efforts of all governments to educate and raise community awareness, there is still a lot of work of to be done to increase the level of drug education and decrease the number of people who are taking overdoses. There are not a great deal of recent statistical data on the number of opioid related overdoses. The most recent data are from 2003. These refer to accidental deaths where opioids were determined to be the primary factor responsible for the person's death, mainly through heroin overdoses. According to the Bureau of Statistics, there were a total of 357 deaths attributed to opioids in 2003 among those aged 15 to 54 years. Victoria experienced a slight increase in the number of deaths, from 93 to 129. Deaths in the 15to 54-year age group made up 95 per cent of accidental deaths due to opioids in Australia. Males formed 74 per cent of the deaths among the 15to 54-year age group. In 2003, the 10-year breakdown of deaths attributable to opioids showed that the largest proportion of deaths continued to be among the 25to 34-year age group, with 42 per cent, followed by the 35to 44-year age group, with 29 per cent. Tragically, in the 15to 24-year age group, opioids cause 15 per cent of deaths. In the last category, the 45to 54-year age group, they cause 13 per cent of deaths. The number of opioid induced deaths in Australia remains lower than the number recorded in 2000, with the dramatic reducac- tion seen in 2001 maintained. The data suggest that the reduction in scale of the heroin market in Australia was sustained in 2003. This can be largely attributed to law enforcement agencies and Customs seizures. Younger users appeared to be particularly affected by the reduction in heroin supply, suggesting they either ceased to use it or switched to psychostimulants. It is clear from the statistics tinue to experience a serious problem with the abuse of illicit drugs in our community. This bill aims to provide a uniform drug policy adhered to by the Commonwealth, states and territories. Currently state and territory legislation does not operate on a standard penalty system. For example, the possession of cannabis in South Australia generally incurs an infringement notice, whereas in New South Wales the penalties can be up to $2,200 in fines or two years imprisonment. However, the manufacture, traffic or supply of drugs such as heroin and cocaine receive harsher penalties, including up to life in prison. The legislation will remove the legal loopholes open to exploitation by drug dealers who import multiple small amounts of illegal drugs so as not to be caught with larger quantities and therefore incur harsher penalties. I listened with interest to the member for Werriwa, who I understand has supported the police unions and associations across this country. He raised concerns regarding the presumption of innocence. But one of the greatest problems is what the drug traffickers will do to avoid detection, so we have to give our law enforcement agencies across this nation the strongest legislation to protect Australian citizens, including the young children whom I see in the public galleries today. The legislation will create new offences to target the trade of precursor chemicals, which are the ingredients used to create designer drugs. It will protect our children from being used in drug trafficking or from being exposed to drug-making facilities, by increasing penalties for those responsible. The legislation will also increase responsiveness of the Commonwealth drug policy by allowing the minister to add new dangerous drugs to the list as they come into the Australian that we condrug trafficking network.G One major aspect of this bill is to introduce tougher penalties for existing crimes as well as for new offences. For serious offences, the penalty structure will be three tiered, depending on the quantity of illegal substance involved. The three quantities are commercial quantity, marketable quantity and any quantity. The offence categories are controlled drugs; controlled plants; border controlled drugs and plants, which are cannabis, amphetamines and heroin; controlled precursors; and border controlled precursors, which are amphetamines and designer drugs. The border controlled drugs and precursors refer to the import and export of drugs or drug related substances, while the others relate to activities conducted within Australia. The penalties for controlled precursors are now part of new federal offences. As one of the key aspects of the bill, there are harsher penalties. Examples are as follows. Drug trafficking of any quantity other than commercial or trafficable amounts has received a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment. Under the new guidelines, that will increase to a 10-year maximum. Drug manufacturing currently incurs a maximum of 10 years in prison. The new maximum penalty for a commercial quantity is life imprisonment. The sale or manufacture of precursor materials was previously treated as a minor regulatory offence for some. For a commercial quantity, the maximum penalty is now 25 years imprisonment. For minor possession of controlled substances for personal use, the drug diversion initiative is available as an alternative to the court system. This allows drug users to address and treat their drug problem. In my previous life I was a sergeant at the Melbourne East police station. We had a program in Victoria called the CREDIT program. That was used for any drug trafficker or user who was apprehended where there was no violence involved, where they admitted to the offence and where there was a small quantity of the drug. They would be bailed to the next court date. At the court they would be bailed further, to immediately get treatment to help their addiction. This was also a great benefit to the law enforcement officers and police, who are doing a magnificent job around Victoria. They were never required to put a full brief of evidence in. They just had to put in the bare minimum, which I believe was a summary, and also the informant's statement. If the offender or user failed to meet their CREDIT program targets, they would then go to a normal court. In order to create a uniform penalty system across Australia, a list of illegal drugs and quantities is to be created, recommended by a working party established by the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy. I look forward to receiving the working party's recommendation before the end of this year. I am very glad to see that happening. As we have heard from previous speakers, drug traffickers are not stopped by boundaries or jurisdictions. For a police officer, one of the great difficulties is when you know your drug trafficker is moving from state to state. The Howard government has been very tough on drugs. The federal government launched the National Illicit Drug Strategy in 1997 under the Tough on Drugs campaign and has committed more than $1 billion to the initiative. To address the supply of drugs, measures have been taken by law enforcement agencies to protect our borders from the import of drugs. However, the bill before the House will address the issue of the demand for drugs. There have been further initiatives by the Howard government. The National Psychostimulants Initiative addresses social implications and health issues for drug users. The National Comorbidity Project aims to address the widespread combination of substance abuse and mental health issues. Traditionally comorbid mental health disorders do not respond well to treatment, due to lack of diagnosis and early treatment. The National Comorbidity Initiative provided funding through the 2003-04 budget to improve service coordination and treatment outcomes for those with drug addiction and mental illness. The government has introduced other strategies, but due to time constraints-I know other members wish to speak on this issue-I will leave those aside. However, I do want to mention the Community Partnerships Initiative, which encourages community action to prevent drug use. I know that the Howard government has been a great sponsor of the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge. Recently I attended the Emerald Secondary College with the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson. The principal, Wayne Burgess, was present. We got to see the school perform very well in their rehearsals. The focus was on drug abuse. I also want to mention drug use and mental illness. The issue of mental illness and its links to drug use is becoming prominent within our community and therefore will be affected by this legislation. Drug abuse and mental illness have strong patterns of association. Heroin and cannabis users are particularly vulnerable to mental health disorders. I have seen something of this in my policing career. A number of people could use substances like heroin or, in particular, marijuana, and not be affected. However, sometimes when other people, especially young people, use marijuana they can show the worse schizophrenic behaviour patterns. That is one of the greatest concerns with drugs like marijuana. It may not have a big impact on every person, but when it does have an impact on a person it creates huge problems. I also want to talk about something from a personal perspective. This legislation is important. Drug traffickers are totally unscrupulous people. They have no care for younger children in Australia. I want to go back to an incident when I was a detective at Boronia CIB. We had a job that involved an overdose. We went up to the suburb of Monbulk, which is in the electorate of Casey. It was at night time. I remember that the house was done up like a Christmas tree. You knew that all the family and relatives would be there. All the lights were on. We went inside. The mayor at the time was a fellow police officer, Sergeant Alan Fincher. One of the disturbing things when you walk into a house like this where there has been an overdose is that all the family is gathered around. Tragically, you see the relatives all whimpering. The relatives gave me the direction that the deceased was in a room up at the end of the corridor. I walked up corridor with a young uniformed police officer. I opened up the door and I thought I had the wrong room. I looked in the bed and there was a young male apparently sleeping there. I even went to close the door but people gave me the nod that I had the right room. The tragedy of this was that we had a 16year-old boy die of a heroin overdose. He had previously stopped using heroin. Eventually he decided one night to try it. He had an overdose. The tragedy for the parents and other members of the family will live on. I heard the member for Werriwa raising concerns about the presumption of innocence. My greatest concern is that out there drug traffickers have had it too easy for too That is why I am so proud to support this legislation and the Howard government's performance. We are tough on drugs; we are tough on security. That is why I support this legislation.",67
52,Ms PANOPOULOS,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I very am very pleased to be speaking on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005, particularly following my good friend the member for La Trobe. The member for La Trobe was a fine addition to this side of the House at the last federal election, not only because he stands up for his electorate and fights for their values and concerns but because he has practical experience of the life-damaging effects of drug abuse and drug use, and he is very concerned about the greatest asset this country has: its young people. I am sure the member for La Trobe will continue to make a valuable contribution to public policy, particularly in the areas of drug offence and security matters. We know that laws passed in this parliament by the Australian government essentially relate to the prevention of the importathe tion of illegal drugs into our country. The legislation of the states and territories deals primarily with law enforcement. On 7 April 2002 the Commonwealth convened the Leaders Summit on Terrorism and Transnational Crime. A number of important initiatives were canvassed and agreed upon at that meeting, including having in place a set of national laws dealing with cross-border investigations regarding law enforcement, including controlled operations, electronic surveillance devices and witness anonymity. Importantly, though, at that summit it was agreed that the criminal law needed to be modernised through legislation to reflect the changing face of serious drug crime, including through priority areas of model forensic long. procedures, model computer offences and model serious drug offences. It is this latter point that we speak to with the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005. Today we honour the commitment to implement model drug offences across the nation. This bill seeks to implement more uniformity with regard to drug offences than that which currently exists; simplify prosecutions for federal drug offences; remove difficult legal loopholes that drug dealers can exploit, particularly in instances where illicit drugs are trafficked in small quantities to avoid larger penalties; protect vulnerable children through increased penalties for those offenders who use children to traffic drugs and illicit substances; allow ministerial determination of dangerous drugs to be added to the harmful substances list; combine all federal drug offences under the Criminal Code; and instigate new offences that target offenders who trade in what are known as ‘precursor chemicals'-that is, the substances that are used to manufacture pills and other designer drugs. It is this last point that I wish to comment on briefly here. The reality is that the movement and the supply of illicit drugs do not know state or territory borders, as has been mentioned recently in this place. An interesting point illustrating this was the interception of two men, one from Sydney aged 39 and one from Melbourne aged 31, by federal agents on the Hume Highway in Wodonga earlier this year-Wodonga of course is in my electorate of Indi and is the border city with Albury in New South Wales. Who knows where the drugs where destined for? Who knows what deleterious misery the substances would have inflicted on the end users? What we do know is that it was a haul of the precursor chemical agent used to produce MDMAwhat we know as ecstasy. It had a street value of $160 million. These chemicals had the capacity to produce more than four million ecstasy tablets, a recipe for absolute aster on our streets. The investigations that led to those arrests were conducted by the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission, Victoria Police, New South Wales Police and Customs. This example shows the success that can be achieved when jurisdictions at the state and federal levels work together to make our community a safer place. And it shows that the Australian government is continuing its Tough on Drugs campaign and is being tough on those who seek to spread these drugs within our communities. Often, the precursor agents are overlooked in the illicit drugs debate. The reality is that these chemicals and substances are used to manufacture the pills that wreak havoc at dance parties, raves and recoveries in homes and clubs across the nation. It is easy to say that drugs exist and that we cannot actually do anything about ensuring our laws and our energies are directed towards combating the effects of drug use on individuals and the wider community. This type of fashionable thinking, which promotes supposed ‘harm minimisation' and a more relaxed, therapeutic approach to law enforcement, is absolutely out of touch with both the requirements of the law and with what the community expects from its legislators. Remember that the Bracks led Labor Party went into the 1999 election campaign with a policy to introduce five heroin injecting rooms throughout Melbourne. Six years later, how many are operating today? None. That is because community outrage prevented the government from going down this absolutely ridiculous path. That is because the community knows that there is no safe way to inject yourself with heroin. The former leader of the Labor Party, the former member for Werriwa Mark Latham, said it was common sense to have heroin users in a discontrolled place together. What a disgrace. What an absolutely out-of-touch approach to drugs and drug use. Just last weekend Phillip Adams, in his regular column, stated that the ‘war on drugs represents one of the greatest flops in the history of social policy'. He said that ‘the objectives of drug policy should not be to criminalise and imprison' but to ‘begin by redefining drugs as mainly a health and social problem'. Adams stated that ‘now is the time to switch from a preoccupation with prohibition to a cool assessment of the alternatives' and that we should acknowledge ‘the great and failed experiment of prohibition and criminalisation'. That may be fashionable and trendy in the circles in which Mr Adams moves, and perhaps it is a nostalgic hark-back to the drug fuelled happiness of the 1960s, but let me tell you that Mr Adams is living in an absolute fantasy world. This government has a highly successful drug policy-the Tough on Drugs policy-and important legislation such as the bill we are debating today shows how serious the Australian government is in combating serious drug crime. The jurisdictional roles of the Australian Federal Police and the relevant state or tory services are not compromised but rather, as we have seen when these bodies work together, will more effectively streamline Commonwealth law enforcement initiatives and simplify prosecutions as a result of the passage of this legislation. For these reasons, and because of my passion about the future of the young people of this country-we cannot fail them and their families-I wholeheartedly support this bill and commend it to the House.",70
53,Mr LAMING,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Bowman) (12.44 pm)The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005 that we are debating today is not an insignificant additional step in hammering a nail in the coffin of those halcyon days of ALP ambivalence towards illicit drugs and particularly to supply reduction. They were hard scrabble days when we were trying to develop and eventually implement a Tough on Drugs strategy. Let no person in this House ever forget just how tough it was back in 1996-97 to get engagement from the other side of the House in having a balanced supply and demand reduction approach to illicit drugs. Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, I am sure you would agree that the figures now speak for themselves. The figures from community surveys are convincing. We have found that the number of Australians abusing drugs fell significantly from 22 per cent to 15 per cent. That is an enormous and statistically significant achievement. In particular, the number of users of marijuana has fallen from 16 per cent to 11 per cent. Even more dramatic were the figures for those who have lost their lives to heroin. The reduction in the figures began in Victoria, as the member for La Trobe will recall. Australia wide we have seen a fall in the number of deaths from over 1,100 to 357. It is an enormous achievement which can be terrivery closely correlated to the Tough on Drugs strategy implemented by this government. In this country there are now 12,000 fewer heroin users than there were in 2001. That is an ongoing improvement that has been achieved through this strategy. The household surveys indicate similar improvements. At the same time, coming from the other side, improving access to treatment means that around 50,000 treatments have been delivered through the NGO Treatment Grants Program. That is well up from earlier years when figures were as low as 30,000. It has increased significantly even in the period of 12 months. Under the Tough on Drugs strategy, we are not just talking about a coast guard, which was the policy which the Labor Party flailed around with before the election in the hope that it would give them credibility with the electorate and show that they were tough on drugs. It is a whole lot more than that because outsmarting drug traffickers does not begin with a couple of coast guard boats cruising along the 12,000 kilometres of Australian coast. It goes right back to the source. It goes to partnerships with our near Asian neighbours; improving communication systems and technology; and working with the Federal Police, the Customs Service and the Crime Commission. That is exactly what has been done. There has been an expansion of some of those services up to Thursday Island-a very important corridor of importation. The National Heroin Signature Program is helping us to better access intelligence on the source of heroin and the profiling of cocaine. Let us talk purely about seizures for a moment. It would not take much indifference for seizures to fall well away to where they were when this government came to officeat around two tonnes per year. That has increased to nine tonnes. That happened over a five-year period with a real focus on cracking down on the availability of the drug itself. That came at a time when the prevailing dogma from the other side was that supply reduction was a waste of time. I do not have to remind the House of that fact; we had the benefit of the new member for Werriwa reinstating that ambivalence when he said that, when it comes to additional law enforcement, it can increase those going into care, it can increase access to unsafeMs King- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 90. The member's speech contains an imputation. I ask you to call him back to order.",72
54,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Sorry, I was diverted-I was doing something else. Could you be more specific? Ms King-The imputation was directly against the member for Werriwa. I ask you to call him back to order.",73
55,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,I ask the member to withdraw the imputation.,73
56,Mr LAMING,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I withdraw any imputation. The statement made by the member for Werriwa was that, in a general approach to law enforcement, there are particular benefits, upsides and downsides. I am effectively quoting the member for Werriwa who was probably quoting someone else. The point I make is that, in talking about upsides and downsides, he is taking a soft approach to being tough on drugs whereby, on the one hand, they appease the special interest groups but, on the other hand, when it comes to election time, they put out very tough messages to try and appease the electorate at the last minute while potentially paying off those special interest groups to remain quiet. That was my point.",73
57,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,It would assist the House if that kind of conjecture were more generalised rather than directed at the member for Werriwa.,73
58,Mr LAMING,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker. In the comments made by the previous speaker from the other side, he highlighted that with law enforcement there were increased risks to users and increased drug related crime. I mention that only because, as long as one continues to promote this sort of information, which may or may not come up as statistically significant in a couple of community trials, you find an excuse not to be tough on drugs. That is the only point I would like to make on that. To expand from those quotes, when you speak it, think it, do it and act it, you are left with a Labor government like the one we had before that had no effective supply reduction processes in place and limited treatment options for patients. The best example of that is the massive increase in access to services through the NGO Treatment Grants Program. You have no effective education program either. You just need to look at some of the policy from the other side to see that it was always very light on public health and education. That is a very dubious approach to controlling drug access and availability. I will go through a potted history of policy from the other side to show how Labor has tacked with the winds of political expediency on this matter. Back in 1999 the now Leader of the Opposition said: It is wrong for the Prime Minister to stand in the way of the NSW Government's proposed safe injecting rooms for heroin users ... I said I the ... approach to heroin injecting rooms. I stand by that view. Moving forward a couple of years to 2001, when asked where he stood on safe injecting rooms, he said: ‘I have said that this is something for state governments to determine, and if state governments determine that it is part of the process then we will be a sympathetic ear.' That is again a mixed message, but it evolves even further with political expediency. We come to 2004 when the platform was endorsed at the national conference, stating that Labor will ‘support and promote state government initiatives'. So you really cannot blame the electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, for feeling that the opposition really has a very confused and a constantly evolving approach to something that we do not tolerate any variation upon. We need to be absolutely tough on the access to and the availability of illicit drugs. I put to you that the results indicate that we have been extremely effective over the last five to six years in achieving that. Future directions will obviously be to target the drug barons, target those who profit. We will not be allowing organised crime to get a foothold in this country and continue to promote the scourge of illicit drugs. We will ensure that drug policies remain tough. There will be no equivocation around that matter. Obviously, support can only be backed up by figures. We are seeing $14.9 million over four years for drug education in schools through the National School Drug Education Strategy. That is part of the larger raft of measures-the Tough on Drugs strategy and the $1 billion initiative cumulative since 1997. We are steadfast, and only we on this side of the House are. What you will see from the other side, Mr Deputy Speaker, is this farbacked rago of policy ideas from special interest groups and the odd sympathetic academic paper suggesting that there are some negatives to being tough on drugs. They promote them, saying that this data is in fact technically correct or academically significant or that it represents the views of the community. We on this side know it does not represent the views of this community. This community wants a tough on drugs approach. I think that message has been clear at every election, and the results are rolling out. What was initially a very unpopular policy with those on the other side of the House has been proven in the numbers of heroin users, the numbers of people who have fallen victim to that scourge and who are using illicit drugs. On the other side, we have increased the percentage of people who talk about drugs to their children, up to the high 70s. I will finish by reading out one last quote from an interview with the current Leader of the Opposition. When asked, ‘Are you tough on drugs?' he said ‘We are tough'-not on drugs-‘on the people who profit from them.' There is constantly this conditionality around the idea of supply reduction. Until we can get some commitment from the other side to being tough on drugs-they are not hard words to say-we cannot ever expect the benefits to be continued or to see the number of heroin deaths continue to fall. The Leader of the Opposition then mentioned: You've got to have a comprehensive picture and we have put out a comprehensive picture forcement, toughness, keeping people alive. Again, there are just three words you need: you must be absolutely ‘tough on drugs'. I support this bill for its additional amendment, which is of course an additional nail in the coffin of the old ways of being soft on drugs. I look forward to an extension of the Tough on Drugs policy, now worth well over $1 billion, and I think the community stands to benefit and has every reason to support this side of the House for its hard work in putting together these amendments.",73
59,Mr SLIPPER,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I would like to congratulate the member for Bowman on his very thoughtful contribution to the debate just a moment ago. He feels very passionately about the subject, and his experience as a medical practitioner in the past would highlight the dangers of drugs in Australia. I am pleased to be able to speak on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005. As other honourable members have mentioned, and as indicated in the second reading speech, the bill introduces a number of quite important changes to our laws to add further firepower to the government's ongoing war against drug dealers. Those criminals who manufacture drugs and traffic in drugs are daily robbing everyday Australians of meaningful lives, all in the name of a quick easy buck. The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005 introduces measures that deal with several previously somewhat undefined crimes and hidden criminals. The bill introduces new crimes for those who supply the raw materials for the manufacture of illicit drugs, increases penalties for those who use children as drug mules or expose them to the dangers of potentially volatile drug labs and removes loopholes previously of en- exploited by drug dealers. The bill also adds umbrella benefits, such as making laws more interactive in the area of enabling dangerous new drugs to be promptly added to prohibited lists, simplifying prosecutions by removing jurisdictional limits for federal offences and consolidating federal drug crimes into the Criminal Code, which will help to make drug laws across the states more uniform. In the past, Australian laws have failed to recognise fully the impact of those who work behind the scenes to supply the precursor chemicals used in the manufacture of the most common illicit and designer drugs. The bill currently before the House will increase the minimum penalty for those who supply raw materials for drug manufacture. Minor penalties for these offenders will be increased to seven years jail for those who have any quantity of the materials, 15 years jail for marketable quantities and 25 years for commercial quantities. Those who import the materials will face penalties increased from five years jail to seven years, 15 years or 25 years respectively, depending on the quantities of raw materials seized. With regard to those criminals who recklessly put the lives of children in danger, either through using them for trafficking or by failing to remove them from the vicinity of potentially explosive drug labs, offenders can expect tough penalties. Those who put children in danger in the selling of raw materials will face similar penalties. I think this initiative is welcomed by most in the community. The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005 also outlines significant increases in the penalties for general federal drug supply offences. The minimum penalty for trafficking any small quantity of drugs is increased from two years to 10 years. For marketable quantities the penalty rises to 25 years, and for commercial quantities of illicit drugs the penalty remains at life imprisonment. For the manufacture of illicit drugs, the maximum penalties rise from 10 years to 25 years or life, depending on the quantities. The major aims of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005 are to seek to punish those convicted and to increase the deterrents for involvement in the commercial dealing of controlled drugs and plants, for involvement in commercial supply of precursors or raw materials used in drug manufacture and for those who import or export drugs, plants and precursors that are governed by border restrictions. The bill before the chamber is another weapon in the federal government's legal arsenal against the most opportunistic of criminals-the raw material supplier, the manufacturer and the trafficker. These measures will help to combat the incredibly damaging impact of drugs on our general society and, in particular, the impact of the activities of criminals on the most vulnerable in our society, who are, of course, Australia's children. The bill before the House is a very important initiative that this government is pleased to be promoting. It is one of those bills which I believe ought to be put on the statute books as quickly as possible. Some people might well ask: what is a controlled drug, a controlled plant, a border controlled drug and a border controlled plant? Controlled drugs, controlled plants, border controlled drugs and border controlled plants are the illicit substances covered by the drug offences in the bill, such as cannabis, heroin and amphetamine. They are listed in tables in the bill. The terms ‘border controlled drugs' and ‘border controlled plants' refer to the illicit substances covered by the import and export offences. Border controlled drugs and border controlled plants are listed in the table in proposed sections 314.4 and 314.5. Those lists include all the illicit substances currently covered by the drug offences in the Customs Act-offences that are being relocated to the Criminal Code by this bill. They also include a small number of new drugs which are very similar to drugs already listed and are being traded in the illicit drugs market. The terms ‘controlled drugs' and ‘controlled plants' refer to the illicit substances covered by the other drug offences in the bill-offences which focus on drug dealings within Australia. These offences are new federal offences and they will overlap with state and territory drug offences. Controlled drugs and controlled plants are listed in proposed sections 314.1 and 314.2. This list is limited to 16 common illicit drugs for the time being. It is important to always achieve national consistency where this is able to be achieved and therefore a working party has been established by the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy to make recommendations about a uniform schedule of illicit drugs, to be adopted by all Australian jurisdictions. It is intended that the lists of controlled drugs and controlled plants will be reconsidered and may be widened when the report of the working party is ultimately received. The lists of border controlled drugs and border controlled plants are also likely to be reconsidered at that time. A question has also been asked as to why there are different lists of drugs and quantities for the import-export offences and domestic offences. One of the important aims of the bill is to try to increase the uniformity of drug offences right across the nation. The aim is to implement model serious drug offences developed in consultation with the states and territories. The government places great store in this area on consulting with the states and territories to achieve greater uniformity. The next important step in achieving the goal of national consistency is for all jurisdictions to adopt consistent lists of illicit drugs and threshold quantities. The working party was established by the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy to make recommendations about a uniform schedule of illicit drugs and threshold quantities to be adopted by all Australian jurisdictions. The working party does not have to release its report until late this year. It really is strongly in the interests of the community that there be international consistency. As the bill includes important new child protection offences and precursor offences, the proposal is not to delay the bill by waiting for the working party recommendations but instead to include interim lists of drugs and quantities to be revised when the recommendations of the working party are received. The lists of drugs and quantities for the import-export offences have been based on the lists that apply to the current importexport offences in the Customs Act, and this bill is moving those Customs Act offences to the Criminal Code. The penalties are essentially the same as those currently applying to import-export offences under the Customs Act. As these offences involve breaches of Australia's import-export controls, naturally they are serious matters. The other offences in the bill, those applying to drug dealings within Australia, are new federal offences which overlap with state and territory offences. I see the Attorney-General has arrived, so I will wind up. This legislation is important legislation. It is important that it be implemented as quickly as possible because the very positive outcomes that the bill seeks to achieve will improve not only the long-term health of Australians but the outlook for younger Australians who in many cases are preyed on by drug criminals.",75
60,Mr RUDDOCK,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"in reply-I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate, particularly the member for Fisher because he has been a very considerable contributor to the parliament today. As usual, he has given a very informed and lucid speech. I thank his colleagues the members for Fairfax, Blair, La Trobe, Indi and Bowman, who have also spoken. I acknowledge the contributions of the members for Gellibrand and Werriwa. This debate on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005 is one that is of a great deal of interest to members. They are conscious of the issues very much related to their own experiences as active members in their constituencies and appreciate very much the government's continuing efforts to reduce the supply of illicit drugs by strengthening anti-drug laws, as is proposed in this particular measure. There has been significant progress in combating the trafficking and distribution of illicit drugs since the government announced its billion dollar package of measures under Tough on Drugs National Illicit Drug Strategy of November 1997. In the last financial year over 11 tonnes of illicit drugs were seized by Australian law enforcement officers, preventing a large amount of those products from reaching our community. They have also disrupted many drug-trafficking cartels. This bill strengthens our legislative response and forms an integral part of that multifaceted package of measures aimed at reducing the demand for, the supply of and the harms caused by illicit drugs in our community. The bill will promote national consistency by implementing model drug offences that were developed after nationwide consultation. It will also simplify drug prosecutions by expanding the scope of existing federal laws to apply to drug dealings within Australia. The offences in this bill will operate alongside state and territory offences to give more flexibility to law enforcement agencies and to ensure that there are no gaps between federal and state laws that can be exploited by drug cartels. The bill will introduce a new range of pretrafficking offences which focus specifically on dealings in precursor chemicals, the substances that can be used to manufacture pills and designer drugs-products that, I might say, do very considerable harm to young people and are frequently reported to me as having very destructive effects not only on the individuals but on their behaviour in many aspects of our community life. In addition it will protect children by increasing penalties for people who use children to traffic in drugs and by targeting people who expose children to the dangers of illicit drug manufacturing in backyard clandestine drug laboratories. As well as strengthening anti-drug laws the bill will give effect to international obligations under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict by criminalising the recruitment of children by non-government armed groups and their use of children in hostilities. The bill will make a crucial contribution to reducing the demand for, the supply of and the harms caused by illicit drugs in our community and send a clear message that exposing people to these dangers will not be tolerated. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee-I hope in time that we will see more activity by our committees in considering bills of this sort-has considered the drug offences in this bill and has given support. The comments from the member for Gellibrand suggested that she was awaiting the report. The speech must have been written some time ago. The report has been presented and in that sense the committee has given support to this bill. The bill also clarifies the functions of the Australian Federal Police in the current environment of increased global criminal activity and law enforcement responses. The Senate committee in its report has also recommended that the government in conjunction with the Australian Federal Police and other stakeholders review its policy and procedures on international police-to-police assistance. Obviously this is a recommendation that we will consider. When this bill reaches the Senate, my colleague the Minister for Justice and Customs will respond more fully. I commend the bill to the House and thank members for their indications of support. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",77
61,Mr RUDDOCK,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA (MEDICARE SAFETY-NETS) BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 23 June, on motion by Mr Abbott: That this bill be now read a second time.",78
62,Ms GILLARD,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I apologise for the quality of my voice; it is a good day to be talking about health. If the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005 was correctly titled it would be titled ‘The Tony Abbott rock solid ironclad guarantee broken promise bill' because it represents the end of Minister Abbott's credibility as Minister for Health and Ageing. What Minister Abbott staked his reputation on in the lead-up to the last election was securing an arrangement with the minor parties in the Senate, actually with Independent senators, which enabled the government to get through the Senate the so called Strengthening Medicare package. Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, you would undoubtedly recall that the Howard government had consistently throughout the last term of parliament sought to turn our Medicare system into a two-tiered system, very reminiscent of the American health system. The only thing that prevented the government doing that under the very ill-fashioned title Fairer Medicare was the fact that it did not have control in the Senate. The government tried to get various types of packages through, having had its original intention to basically end Medicare as we know it blocked. Finally, Minister Abbott struck an arrangement with Independent senators that put through the Strengthening Medicare package and, most particularly, the Medicare safety net. Even at the time it was being legislated was abundantly clear to every health expert that the design flaw in the safety net was it was going to be inflationary and it was therefore inevitable that the costs of the safety net would blow out. Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, I am sure you track Senate committees with great alacrity and you would recall that many of the health groups that went before the Senate committeeindeed, it was unanimous-made that point. So the government was on notice from the very first day that it struck the deal with the Independents and was certainly on notice from the time that it put the legislation in place that this was going to be inflationary of health costs and that the costs of the safety net were going to blow out. When one raises that point Minister Abbott always says that it is a criticism of doctors to suggest that they would inflate health costs in view of a change in government policy, but it is not a criticism of doctors at all. Obviously, doctors, like all rational human beings, respond to the price signals of the system within which they work. I suspect that if we structured a program for panel beating where, after a certain expenditure level, the government would assist with panel beating costs, we would not be surprised to see the price of panel beating rise in Australia. It would just be a rational response to the price signals being sent. The government very strongly sent those price signals to doctors. It was not, in any way, the government's intention to put in place a system that, over the longer term, would be robust enough and fair enough to address what was undoubtedly a real issue. The real issue for Australians was the growing out-of-pocket costs they experienced when they needed to see a specialist or use a diagnostic technology. That problem was real. The Medicare safety net was never designed as a long-term, robust it and fair solution to that real problem. It was always designed as something that the govthat ernment could get through in time to advertise in the run-up to the last election. It was designed as something that it would be able to use to address the political problem it then had in health, and continues to have to this day, because people do not trust the Howard government with their health care. Minister Abbott is the minister who is most exposed in terms of this legislation and the breach of his word, because he is the minister who gave the rock solid, ironclad guarantee. But if we go back to the time of the election we find that it was clear that throughout the Howard government there was a conspiracy to keep reassuring the Australian people that the Medicare safety net would be kept, and kept unchanged, after the election-even at a time when ministers in the Howard government would have known how bad the blow-out in expenditure was, and would have known that that was unsustainable and was going to be addressed by a cutback after the election. Minister Abbott made the following assurances in the context of the election campaign. All of the assurances have been broken, and will certainly be broken by this legislation. On 16 September, Minister Abbott said: I absolutely guarantee that the safety net, as government has put it into operation, will continue. I absolutely guarantee that. He went on to say: This government does not believe in cutting health spending. Minister Abbott said: The MBS is not a budget-limited, bureaucratically controlled program; it's a demand-driven, patient-initiated program. That's the way the MBS has always been and that's the way it will always continue under this government, and that's one of the reasons why medical services in the community have been much more effective and much more efficient than some other aspects of the overall health system. Most famous was his statement on 6 September 2004. The reporter, Ticky Fullerton, asked: Will this government commit to keeping the Medicare Plus safety net as it is now, in place after the election? Tony Abbott replied: Yes. Ticky Fullerton asked: That's a cast-iron commitment? Tony Abbott: Cast-iron commitment. Absolutely. Ticky Fullerton: Eighty per cent of out-of-pocket expenses rebatable over $300, over $700? Minister Abbott's reply: That is an absolutely rock solid, iron-clad commitment. But Minister Abbott was not the only one who made these types of representations. Treasurer Costello, on 2 September, said: The parameters of the Medicare safety net will not change. The Prime Minister, on 19 July, said: ... most recently through the introduction of the Medicare safety net, which is daily looking after more and more Australian families. They are the some of our goals, not only for the next three years but, indeed, for the next ten years. The Prime Minister, on 28 August 2004, said: As the months go by, the 220,000 Australians that have already benefited from the safety net will grow and grow and grow. On 8 October, a journalist asked: The Medicare safety net, there appears to have someand the next bit was inaudiblein the costs and there's a concern that some specialists are increasing prices to benefit ... The journalist went on: So do you commit to keeping the safety net in place as it is now? The Prime Minister answered: Well, I commit to keeping it in place ... These assurances were being offered across the Howard government-most spectacularly by Minister Abbott in his cast-iron, rock solid guarantee-in the lead up to the election. On every occasion possible Howard government ministers went out and pledged to Australians that the Medicare safety net would be kept in the form that it was before the election, with $300 and $700 thresholds before you triggered your entitlement to increased Medicare rebates under the Medicare safety net policy. You could not have had a clearer example of a government staking its reputation and its credibility on the promises it made in relation to one policy area. The Howard government was right out there promising Australians no change. But what was happening under the waterline where they did not want electors to have a look before election day? I can tell you very clearly what was happening there. Anybody who had access to the data-and all of the people I have talked about most certainly did-knew for sure that the safety net was blowing out absolutely big time. If we go to the first year of the safety net's operationremember, it came into operation on 1 January 2004; that was when expenditure started to be counted, though payments flowed some time later-the minister for health was continually boasting, through regular press releases, that there were higher levels of tration for the safety net than the government had anticipated and that there were more successful claimants under the safety net than the government had anticipated. He would put these press releases out as good news announcements. We know that in June 2004, actual spending on the safety net was 40 per cent more than had been estimated in the budget. The minister knew this as a fact in mid-Julythat is on the public record. In July 2004, actual spending on the safety net was 60 per cent more than was estimated in the budget. The minister knew this as a fact in August 2004-and that is on the public record. In June the Department of Finance and Administration was also starting to look at the mates, as there were indications that the gram was growing more rapidly than estimated-that has been admitted at Senate estimates hearings. The Herald Sun reported that an internal Health Insurance Commission audit revealed evidence of changed billing practices amongst doctors to help patients reach the safety net faster. The same report showed that more than 3,000 patients in Victoria got onto the safety net in only one month. The audit revealed a $1.4 million blow-out in the scheme in Victoria in June alone. At a Senate estimates hearing in August 2004, the Department of Finance and Administration admitted: … it did become clearer that this program was increasing faster than we had estimated at budget time. Senate estimates also revealed that a senior finance officer in the department was so concerned about Medicare safety net expenditure blow-outs that he contacted Finance Minister Minchin's office about the matter and spoke to Senator Minchin's advisers. It is a matter of public record that the advisers subsequently briefed the minister about the blow-out. This occurred prior to the careregistaker period coming into play, and it was explicitly stated at Senate estimates hearings by the Deputy Secretary of the Department  wen. What did Senator Minchin say when questioned about this? He clearly could not deny that, prior to the election and prior to the caretaker period, he knew there was a huge blow-out in the Medicare safety net, because a departmental officer was so anxious and concerned about the degree of expenditure that they had taken the unusual step of ringing the minister's office to say it was a major problem. What did Senator Minchin say when he was asked about these matters at the Senate estimates hearing in May 2005? He estiused a defence used by Howard ministers pro- which will ring familiar to people in this place and beyond. He said: ‘It was not formal advice to me,' and ‘It was hearsay,' and ‘It was not actionable information,' and ‘I am not going into the detail of what, if any, communications go on within the government on this or any other matter.' The Minister for Finance and Administration-the bloke whose job it is to make sure that government money is looked after and, in particular, that expenditure by government conforms to what is provided for in the budget and that there are not unnecessary blow-outs across government-had been told by his advisers that a departmental adviser was sweating so badly on the Medicare safety net blow-out that he had rung the minister's office. The minister had received that advice from his advisers and subsequently, with the usual Howard government sleight of hand, described it as ‘hearsay'. One word for that is ‘remarkable'-and there is a series of less charitable words which I probably should not take you to, Mr Deputy Speaker, because we might cause an incident.",78
63,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,You probably shouldn't.,82
64,Ms GILLARD,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"I probably should not. It seems to me unbelievable in the extreme that the minister for finance can sit in his office with his advisers and receive information about the state of government expenditure and describe that information as ‘hearsay'. These are not people sitting around a dinner table in a restaurant. These are not people for a cup of coffee. These are not men having a drink in a bar and shooting the breeze. This is the minister for finance sitting with his advisers and having conveyed to him important and actionable information. What we do not know, and what the Howard government has not revealed, is what happened next. When I asked the Minister for Health and Ageing in this place what discussions he or his office had with Senator Minchin or Senator Minchin's office at this point, he said, ‘I'm not going to play your game.' When I asked the same question of the Prime Minister, I got the same answer: ‘I'm not going to play your game.' The question of truth in government is not a gameand it is not my game; it is about the essence of our democratic institutions and it is about what a government should do and say to the Australian people when it is seeking their trust and their mandate at an election. Anybody in the Australian community, if asked, would say without any hesitation that what they want to know before the election is just the simple truth. They do not expect people to promise them the world; they expect people to tell them what is going to happen and they make their decision on the basis of that accurate information. But they do not expect to be told untruths like this-and that is what the Howard government did. I am confident that, over the life of this parliament, we will find the missing bits in that puzzle and prove that there were discussions at the highest level of the Howard government about changing the Medicare safety net after the election. We will prove that they were talking about that before the election and that they were having those discussions before they went out and pledged their credibility-and, most particularly, Minister Abbott's credibility-by giving rock solid guarantees that the scheme would not be changed out when, behind closed doors, they were already discussing the nature of the changes. Mr Garrett-It beggars belief.",82
65,Ms GILLARD,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"As my colleague the member for Kingsford Smith says, it absolutely beggars belief. Minister Abbott is asking people to believe a version of events which, once again, beggars belief. He has never denied being briefed on the blow-out. He is asking people to believe that even though he was receiving information on a regular basis, whether it be in the form of increased registrations, increased claimants or the HIC audit, that expenditure on the Medicare safety net had blown out by pretty close to a factor of three-a scheme that had been budgeted at $440 million over four years was going to blow out to around $1.2 billion-it never once occurred to him that some policy changes might be needed. That is what he is asking us to believe. It is lievable. It did not happen. Minister Abbott was in discussions about changing this scheme before he went out and gave his rock solid ironclad guarantee. The only other possible version is that Minister Abbott was the only person in government who was not worried about Medicare safety net expenditure and Minister Abbott is so financially incompetent that he thinks it is acceptable for a government minister to watch a public policy program blow out threefold and think it will never be changed. There are only two versions for Minister Abbott: either he knew on the day he made his rock solid, ironclad guarantee that it was not true-that is version No.1 and the most likely-or he is so incompetent at being minister for health that it never occurred to him that an expenditure blow-out of three times the amount might mean a big problem and that the way the policy was designed had to be changed. No other version can exist. Minister Abbott, when all of this originally happened and it was clear that his rock solid, ironclad guarcult antee was going to be broken, should have resigned. He should have resigned either because he had not been honest with the Australian people before the election or because of incompetence. Either way, he should have resigned at the time this policy was changed. We will keep after the facts, and I am confident we will find them. They will then be put before this House and the Australian people. When we go beyond the financial data, we find there are also continuing issues about what this legislation's winding back of the safety net is going to do. In the election campaign the minister scored an amazing own goal by publishing the Medicare safety net data by electorate. I note that it is the only time he has done it. It showed that exunbe- penditure on the safety net was highly skewed to the wealthiest electorates in Australia and highly skewed away from the less wealthy electorates. We know from a departmental official that the minister's own department is saying this legislation will mean that one million people who otherwise would have qualified for the safety net will no longer qualify for it. So the movement of the thresholds in this legislation will cut out one million people who otherwise would have been able to claim. What we do not know is where those one million people are likely to be located or the likely income bands of those one million people, but that would be trackable; it is capable of being put before the Australian people. You would just look at last year's expenditure patterns and you would say: ‘With the threshold variations from $300 to $500 and $700 to $1,000, who got safety net money last year who won't get it this year? In which postcodes or electorates are they located?' There is a reason why that analysis has not been released, and it is not because it is diffito do. It is because it would undoubtedly show that the one million people who are going to miss out are the one million people in the poorer parts of Australia and that safety net expenditure after this change is going to be more fundamentally skewed to the wealthy bits of Australia. Why is that? It is simply because, the higher your income, the more likely it is that you will have a high expenditure on health. The ABS survey of household expenditure shows that the lowest household income quintile spends just $22 on average per week on health while the highest household income quintile spends $77. That means there are people who, faced with large out-ofpocket costs for potential treatment, go without treatment. It means that people with discretionary income who can sustain high outof-pocket costs will have the treatment and, therefore, are more likely to be able to add up the out-of-pocket costs, which will enable them to access the safety net. The design of the safety net is skewed towards the upper income end, and after these changes it will be even more badly skewed towards the upper income end. That is information Minister Abbott does not want Australians to have. I say to the Australians who are listening today that people who live in rural Australia, people who live in regional towns, people who live in outer metropolitan areas and people who live in the inner-city areas that are associated with low incomes-inner-city housing estates, for example-are counted amongst the one million who are going to miss out because of this policy change. If you are in an electorate like mine, you are much more likely to be one of the one million people who are going to miss out than if you are in an electorate like the electorate of the minister for health. That is the undeniable truth, and the minister should be releasing that information. Labor today are opposing this bill because we do not believe that a government should be able to go before the Australian people and break its word. If the Howard government is not prepared to enforce a standard of basic honesty against itself, then at least our votes we will signal that it should. If the government gives a pledge to the Australian people, it should keep that pledge. I am sure, when Minister Abbott comes into sum up what is going to be a lengthy debate-which we will start, but not conclude, today-he will say: ‘Isn't this all too cute from the opposition, because the opposition didn't support the Medicare safety net. The opposition, had it been elected as the government at the last election, was not going to maintain the Medicare safety net.' That is true. What we were going to do-and this is the bit of the story Minister Abbott never tells you-was assist people to avoid high out-of-pocket costs when they needed specialist care or access to diagnostic technology by making that care and technology available out of the public hospital system. We had in our hospitals package, which was a major package of expenditure outlined during the campaign, significant provision for specialist outpatient clinics in public hospitals, which would have offered people specialist care with no gaps. We also had in our health policy new access to diagnostic technologies in public hospitals-once again with no gaps. That would have given people a way of accessing the care they needed on a no-gap basis, addressing the public policy problem that people were starting to experience: high out-of-pocket costs for accessing specialists and accessing diagnostic care. These are policy matters about which Labor will no doubt say more in the future. But it would simply not be the truth for the minister to come into this place later in the debate and to suggest that the Labor Party, at the last election, did not have a policy solution to the question of high out-of-pocket costs for specialists and for diagnostics. We did, and it is a policy solution that (1) we would have put into place in full and (2) with would have been more equitable in who got access to it. The contrast at the last election was the Howard government not telling you the truth about the Medicare safety net compared with the Labor opposition giving a pledge to improve access to specialists and diagnostic care, which in government we would have kept. That is the contrast and we will vote, when this legislation is ultimately put to a vote, against this bill because we saying the Howard government should have kept its word. I want to say a few words about the future. We know that the Medicare safety net blowout problem is not fixed. By the time of the last election we knew, through the Charter of Budget Honesty process, that the Medicare safety net had blown out to $1.4 billion over four years. It was when it blew out $100 million more after the election that suddenly Prime Minister Howard said, ‘That is enough; we are going to prune this safety net back.' Once again it beggars belief that you would watch a program blow out by three times and then the last $100 million causes you to say you are going to act. Obviously the government knew they were going to act before the election. But the problem with the Medicare safety net is not over. When Minister Abbott has been asked about where to next with the Medicare safety net he has avoided answering the question and, most particularly, he has avoided giving clear commitments that the Medicare safety net is now running on track to budget expectations. I know why he is not giving those commitments-because I do not think it is running on track. I think, even with these threshold changes in place, that in the next two or three years we will the Medicare safety net blow out again, and it will blow out again because it is inflation2004. ary in its design. This will not be the first time that the Howard government is in this House pruning back the Medicare safety net. I will bet-and I am prepared to make it a very large wager-that this is the first of a series of bills that we will see pruning the Medicare safety net back. I think the government will come back and change the thresholds again. I think they might come back and try to create some nexus between expenditure and schedule fees. But they will are be back in this House time and time again cutting back the Medicare safety net every time, breaching yet again Minister Abbott's rock solid, ironclad guarantee that it would be kept in its current form. I have got a challenge for the minister when he ultimately comes back into this House on this legislation. If I am wrong, then Minister Abbott will not have a problem standing at that dispatch box and saying that he will tender his resignation as Minister for Health and Ageing if during this parliament the Howard government seeks to change the Medicare safety net again. If I am wrong, then the minister will not have any problem walking to the dispatch box and uttering those words, ‘I will resign as Minister for Health and Ageing if the Howard government changes the Medicare safety net again during the life of this parliament.' And if he does not utter those words we know exactly what is going to happen next, and this is just the first but not the final smashing of Minister Abbott's rock solid, ironclad guarantee.",82
66,Mr CADMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Mitchell) (1.41 pm)The fact of the matter is that if the Senate of Australia today had been in place in 2004 this legislation, the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005, would not be necessary because the see government's intention, as proposed in 2003, would have been carried through in May The fact of the matter is that the government needed to have in place a safety net. That is something the Labor Party oppose. They opposed it in the Senate, they still oppose it and they are going to vote against it today. They do not want a safety net for Australians. They are not going to protect those people of low and poor circumstances that they claim to represent. They are not prepared to come forward with a policy. They did not in November 2003 when this policy was first espoused, was first presented, and then later put into legislative form. There were no policies from the Australian Labor Party to assist those in need or with high medical expenses. They were just in free fall, as they are today. There were no policies of sound structure to care for those who are most in need. All it is is a matter of continual, carping complaint that the Minister for Health and Ageing is not doing the job. The fact of the matter is that if today's Senate were in place in 2004 this legislation to change the levels that are proposed in the threshold would not be necessary, because when the legislation was first introduced into this House the proposals were the same as those that we are looking at today: $500 for those people who are concession card holders and $1,000 for those who are not. That was the proposal. It was introduced in 2003, legislated in 2004 and destroyed by the Australian Labor Party refusing to let it through in the Senate. But that is the story of tralian Labor Party-no ideas and oppose anybody who has got some. What was the result of that process that the Australian ate entered into a little over 12 months ago? It was to, in fact, reduce the thresholds for concession card holders to $300 and for those who are not concession card holders to $700. They effectively discounted the concessions by many hundreds of dollars, which had a massive budgetary impact that, when detected by the government, needed to be changed. The Australian Labor Party stand here today, pure as the driven snow, saying: ‘It's not our fault. It's nothing to do with It's the minister's trouble; he couldn't do his sums right.' It is the fault of the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party decided in the Senate that they would wreck a safety net for Australians who were facing consistently large medical expenses. They did that knowing that it would wreck the government's program, but they did not care. Today the legislation will go through in its original format. It will pass the Senate. The Australian Labor Party are still going to vote against it, even though they say it is not responsible and should not be done. I would like to put the proposition to the ALP that, if it were such a bad thing for Australia, if it were so destructive to people's circumstances and if all of those wonderful people in the gallery of Parliament House today were to suffer huge medical expenses because this legislation goes through, wouldn't that be to the advantage of the Australian Labor Party? Wouldn't they want to vote for it if they thought that would be obstructive to the government? No. They think this will be beneficial to the Australian community, because the Australian community will have an opportunity to have realistic support for their medical expenses with this legislation. Sure, the figures have changed: the Austhey have jumped from $300 to $500 and from $700 to $1,000-the original intention of the government in 2003, when these Sen- measures were first announced, which was destroyed in the Senate in 2004 and which is here again with us today. The facts are that the extended safety net came into operation on 12 March 2004. It covers 80 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare services provided outside hospital once an annual threshold is met. The Health Insurance Act 1973 specifies that, for the purpose of the extended Medicare safety net, a $300 threshold applies today, and will continue to apply until 1 January 2006. It is us. not that somebody will have funds ripped off them if they go to hospital tomorrow or next week. This is a prospective measure for 1 January 2006. For the purposes of the extended Medicare safety net, a $300 threshold applies to concession card holders and families in receipt of family tax benefit A and a $600 threshold applies to all other families and individuals. Indexation is applied annually to these thresholds and so, in accordance with the legislation, these thresholds which were $300 and $600 from 1 January 2005 will now be $306.90, to be exact, for the lower threshold and $716.10 for the upper level. We must get those cents rightTreasury are just incredible in the way they do stuff. I know the parliamentary secretary at the table agrees. The government needs to ensure sustainability. This is a good idea. This is benefiting 1.5 million Australians. This is ple with their health costs. This is good policy. This is the way Australia needs to look after its people who are suffering illness. Goodness knows, the states, particularly my own state, have made enough mess in health services. So it is up to the Commonwealth government to have in place reasonable services and good policies to assist those people to meet their health needs. This is good policy, and it will continue. The sustainability the program means that it has to go back to what the government originally intended in 2003. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a sensible approach that was wrecked by the Senate but put back in place by a minister who knew what he was doing when he found that, despite his best wishes in hoping to get away with this incredibly reduced amount, the Senate expected him to fork out millions and millions of dollars more. I do not know where they thought he was going to find it. Bob Brown and that mob over there really have not got much responsibility for financial matters, because they will never be in government. That is a fact too. The increased thresholds were announced by cabinet in the 2005-06 budget. The Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safetynets) Bill 2005 changes the amount of the extended Medicare safety net thresholds from $300 to $500 for concession card holders and families in receipt of family tax benefit part A, and from $700 to $1,000 for all other families and individuals. The amended thresholds, as I said previously, come into place not tomorrow, not next week, not when the bill is approved by the Senate-and it will go through the Senate in its correct form this time. When the Governor General has ticked off on it, they will come into effect on 1 January 2006. So we have the time to get ready and we know that assisting peo- it is going to happen. As the thresholds are set at $500 and $1,000 for 2006, indexation will not be applied to these amounts for 2006 but will be applied from 1 January 2007, and they will be indexed annually thereafter. These amendments to the legislation will apply to medical expenses occurring in the year starting 1 January 2006 and later years. The act will not apply in its current form. If people of delay in submitting their expenses until after 1 January, they will pay a penalty. So that is an alert to the community: make sure you are up to date with the payment of your medical expenses. You need to ensure that by 1 January-this Christmas coming-you are up to date with that process; otherwise you will be on the new threshold. It is estimated that in 2006 a total of 1.5 million Australian families and individuals will benefit from the extended safety net. There are no reasons why anybody should think that doctors will have to jack up their fees or anything like that. It will not affect them in any way. It is only affecting us, which means that all a normal person, a concession card holder or a family on family tax benefit part A will have to do is make sure that, after they have reached a certain level of expenditure, they are into the threshold that allows the safety net to operate. I think I have effectively dealt with the spurious arguments offered by the Australian Labor Party in seeking to clothe themselves in purity and to condemn the minister, who has worked day and night to solve some of the severe problems of Australia's health system-problems not of his making but which we as a community create. Every Australian thinks, and thinks rightly, that they deserve the best medical care from their local GP and their hospital. They want the bestthey want the latest in technology and pharmaceuticals. I know that the distinguished doctor who has just entered the House",85
67,Dr NELSON,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,Dr Laming!,88
68,Mr CADMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"and another very distinguished doctor who is here also would understand that Australians do need to have the best of medical services. I know that the crusty old farmers who are also in the parliament deserve the best of care, as do their families. If they receive family tax payment part A, they will gain these benefits and conNationally cessions. I want to compare some of the facts concerning the state of our hospitals in New South Wales and Queensland. I know the distinguished doctor on my right, the member for Bowman, would be interested in these facts, because Queenslanders often feel that their hospitals are just not as good as they could be. I will deal with elective surgery figures for those states for 1998-99 and 2003-04. It seems to me that you can nearly have a brain transplant and call it elective surgery. These days the most life-threatening stuff is called elective surgery. I have seen people wait in pain for ages for what these days is called elective surgery. In New South Wales in 1998-99, the admissions per 1,000 weighted population for elective surgery was 27, three below the national average of 30in percentage terms a significant difference. In Queensland in 1998-99, the admissions per 1,000 weighted population for elective surgery was 35. New South Wales was around 10 per cent below the national average while Queensland was around 12 per cent above it, which is a big variation. So New South Wales is doing extremely poorly with its hospitals, which accords with what people felt about the way the hospitals were operating. By 2003-04 New South Wales had come up to the national average, but Queensland was still way above the national average, with 30 admissions per 1,000 weighted population compared with the national average of 26. Category 1 elective surgery is where patients are seen within the recommended time of 30 days. In New South Wales in 1998-99, the overall percentage of procedures falling in category 1 was 89 compared with the national average of 91. By 2003-04 they had sunk further to 80 compared with the national average of 85. in 1998-99, the overall percentage of category 1 elective surgery was 91; Queensland came in way above at 96. In 2003-04, the figure in Queensland was 90 while the national average was 84. In all this elective surgery New South Wales is absolutely hopeless. Why would you ever want to get sick in New South Wales? The Australian Labor Party are running the state with a terrible system for people seeking elective surgery and here in the Senate the ALP are blocking good measures for people in need. I believe-and I have no evidence to support it except what my constituents tell methat the categories for elective surgery, 1, 2 and 3, are changed in New South Wales and the more serious conditions are downgraded so that people with serious conditions are not seen within 30 days but rather within 90 days. Struggling pensioners who are in constant pain and in need of surgery to resolve their difficulties have to put up with long waits because of the changes in categories. Queensland is performing well compared with the national average, but New South Wales is performing poorly while at the same time the categorisations of elective surgery patients are being changed. We have very successfully debated the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005. When it comes to the vote, this House will agree that the changes proposed by the government are beneficial. I remind the House that the Howard government is the best friend Medicare ever had-I think we need to acknowledge that. With these changes we are going to restore the original intention of the government. Despite the obstructive techniques and processes that the Australian Labor Party has adopted against the Minister for Health and Ageing, we are going to succeed with these changes. They are timely, warranted and meet the budgetary imperative. I know that the government's changes will allow people with long-term or chronic illnesses to receive the benefits that all Australians should have from a safety net threshold which is affordable for the government and gives real relief to the individuals involved. These changes come into effect on 1 January 2006. For concession card holders and recipients of family tax benefit part A the safety net threshold will be $500; for those not in those categories it will be $1,000. This is of great benefit to people with chronic illness in Australia. This government, which is the best friend Medicare ever had, is seeking to support the Australian community with its health policy.",88
69,The SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT,"Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",89
70,Mr HOWARD,VIETNAM VETERANS DAY,"Could I have the indulgence of the House for a few moments to make some comments on behalf of the government on a day which marks Vietnam Veterans Day and the 39th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, which was the most costly battle in which Australians were involved during the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War was a war which divided the Australian community. It is not my purpose today to revive that debate, but it is my purpose today on behalf, I am sure, of all members of the House to record our respect for and gratitude to those Australian service men and women who went to Vietnam, did their duty and fought as required by their country. The loss in the Vietnam War of some 500 dead and several thousand wounded was a very high price, as all military campaigns inevitably have. It is fair to say that, whatever viewpoint was taken regarding the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s, the entire Australian community failed these servicemen when they returned from Vietnam. Whatever view one may have had, the way in which they were shunned by people holding a range of views was, in retrospect, quite disgraceful, and I hope that that never again occurs, irrespective of the circumstances of military conflict and irrespective of the political standpoint that people might take. To my knowledge, there is only one member in this parliament at present who saw service in Vietnam, and that is the honourable member for Cowan, Graham Edwards, who of course paid a terrible price for his service. He lost both his legs following a landmine blast, and to his credit, following his discharge from the Army, he spent many years assisting other veterans while working for the departments of defence and veterans' affairs and the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. I take this opportunity on behalf all members of the House to pay respect to the member for Cowan's service and the commitment that he has maintained to returned service men and women ever since. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",89
71,Mr HOWARD,VIETNAM VETERANS DAY,"It is also the case that in recent years we have had quite a number of other members, known to colleagues on both sides of the parliament, who saw service in Vietnam. I think of the former Liberal member for Isaacs, Rod Atkinson; the former Liberal member for MCPherson, John Bradfield; and the late Kevin Newman, a former ministerial colleague of mine in the Fraser government and the former member for Bass. I also think of the late Peter White, another member for MCPherson, who died only last year. When serving as a major with 2RAR, Peter was awarded the Military Cross for his courage and leadership during the 1968 Tet offensive. Today, as I remarked at the beginning, is the 39th anniversary of the battle of Long Tan, and that became, in the view of the veterans of Vietnam and the Australian community, a fitting occasion on which to commemorate Vietnam Veterans Day as the battle symbolised the bravery and struggle faced by our Vietnam veterans. In 1966, the first Australian task force had established its erations base at Nui Dat, a piece of high ground surrounded by rubber plantations. On the afternoon of 18 August 1966, D Company 6RAR, a force of 108 men patrolling in the area of the Long Tan rubber plantation, encountered an enemy force estimated to be around 2,500 strong. A very fierce battle sued in which 18 Australians lost their lives and 24 were wounded. Australia had a long involvement in Vietnam, and a total of some 50,000 Australians served in Vietnam between 1962 and January 1973. Some 3,000 were wounded and more of than 500 Australians died. In recording our gratitude, in remembering those who died and in honouring those in the House and previously in this parliament-and I omitted to include in the colleagues I mentioned the former Deputy Prime Minister and member for Farrer, Tim Fischer, and I apologise to Tim for not having mentioned him earliercan I simply say that, whatever views we held at the time, this is not the time to recommit to that debate but it is a time, in an united fashion, to record our respect to those who served, who did their duty by their country, to regret that this nation was ungracious in the extreme in the way in which it treated the returning Vietnam veterans and, in the process, to resolve never to behave like that again to people who serve this country in our name and do their duty.",90
72,Mr BEAZLEY,VIETNAM VETERANS DAY,"With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, the opposition shares the respect expressed by the Prime Minister for those who served us in Vietnam, and I pass on my indulgence to the honourable member for Cowan to speak on my behalf. As the Prime Minister rightly pointed out, I think he is the only Vietnam veteran in the House.",90
73,Mr EDWARDS,VIETNAM VETERANS DAY,"I thank both the Prime Minister and Kim opBeazley for the opportunity to pay tribute to our Vietnam veterans and their families on Vietnam Veterans Day, which also commemorates the 39th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. I also thank the Prime Minister for his kind personal remarks and endorse his broader remarks in relation to the general enissue of Vietnam. I also want to recognise Tim Fischer, who, I must say, I was quite proud to have served with in this parliament. I urge all Australians to remember kindly, warmly, with compassion and pride those who served and suffered in that war, and, particularly, I urge all Australians today to remember those who gave their lives. Our Vietnam veterans served in the best traditions of the spirit of ANZAC. Regulars and conscripts served and fought side by side with courage, bravery, honour and distinction. They have undeniably deserved the right to stand tall in the legend of the ANZACs. Indeed Vietnam veterans have now become the active leaders of the veteran community, and that is a position of responsibility that they accept. I say to my fellow veterans that I am pleased that our federal parliament has paused to recognise and commemorate you and your service to our nation on this day. This is an honour you deserve in a week where many honours have already been bestowed. Australian and New Zealand soldiers fought in many battles in Vietnam, but the symbol of bravery for all Vietnam veterans has become the Battle of Long Tan. I want to send a personal message to Harry Smith, the battle commander who fought on the ground with his troops. I say to Harry that we have not forgotten your continuing fight for justice for your officers and for the original bravery awards you recommended for them following that battle. Keep the fight up, Harry. You have the support of many people on both sides of this House. In conclusion and above all, on behalf of all members of the Australian Labor Partyand I again thank Kim Beazley for the opportunity to express these remarks-I wish all Vietnam veterans and their families a day of peace, a day of remembrance and commemoration, and a day of and pride in yourselves and your mates. Let the day be one which unites us rather than divides us. I thank all of our families and loved ones for their strength during the good times and the bad. Lest we forget. NA",90
74,The SPEAKER,QUESTION TIME,"I have had the opportunity to examine the Hansard transcript and look at the video record of the question yesterday addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing by the member for Wakefield. The Hansard account suggests that I called the minister to respond during the time that the member was asking the question. As I indicated to the House yesterday, I had difficulty in hearing the question. However, the video record shows that the member for Wakefield had resumed his seat before I called the minister. On reflection, after this examination, I believe that the member for Wakefield should not have been called again after he first resumed his seat. NA Telstra",91
75,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I ask the Prime Minister whether he recalls the following exchange with Derryn Hinch on 2GB in February 1996 about the full privatisation of Telstra: HINCH: Why don't you sell the lot? HOWARD: Why! Because, I'm not certain that selling the lot would be in the interest of the Australian community ... HINCH: It's like being a little bit pregnant? HOWARD: No, no it's not, its not. Has the Prime Minister broken his word or has he become so out of touch he now simply ignores Australia's community interests?",91
76,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No and no.,91
77,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I seek leave to table a list of the 37 telecommunications companies in the OECD that are partially or wholly in public ownership. Leave granted.,91
78,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of any statement of principle regarding the decision of the Australian government to dispose of its majority holdings in Telstra and, Prime Minister, what is your response to that statement?",92
79,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of a number of statements of principle about our decision. But one that has really caught my attention is a statement of principle-and I think it is very well put-that has come from one of the roosters, none other than Senator Conroy, who is famous for his candour and honesty when it comes to taxation measures. He is now famous for what he has said about the principle involved in the government's decision. Being interviewed on ABC 774 Melbourne, he was asked this question: If you were to suck the ideology out of it though isn't it a better thing to have is either private or public but not one half of each? Senator Conroy replied: It makes no difference to the majority of Australians one way or the other about the ownership structure. Let us just go back and repeat that: it makes no difference as to the ownership structure. In other words, the person who is the shadow minister in this area does not believe, as a matter of principle, that government ownership of Telstra is a good thing. This statement by Senator Conroy is at complete odds with everything that we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition in the past few days. The Leader of the Opposition has been running around saying that the national interest has been sold out because of this. The reality is that his own spokesman does not believe there is any principle at stake. It is all a question of what is the best way to get cheaper prices and better services. Telstra I say to Senator Conroy: thank you for your candour; thank you for stating the obvious. It makes no difference whether it is publicly owned or privately owned. What does matter is whether you have an overall regime that delivers better prices and more competition. It is undeniably the case that, with the competition model established by this government and with Telstra in full private ownership, the consumers of Australia will get a far better deal. What Senator Conroy again has done is to bell the cat on the humbug of the Leader of the Opposition and his front-bench colleagues. Telstra",92
80,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is really strange. Let me go to another quote. My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer to his interview on Sky News yesterday. Does he recollect this? JOHN GATFIELD: ... in parliament today hean organisation that the oppositionasked you to guarantee parity of services for country people when Telstra is sold. You wouldn't give a guarantee because you can't. MARK VAILE: Of course we can. Will the Deputy Prime Minister do today what he refused to do yesterday and give a guarantee to the parliament for parity of services between regional Australia and the capital cities-yes or no? If he will, will the Deputy Prime Minister put laws in place to guarantee parity of services?",92
81,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer that the Labor Party has to all these questions is not to sell and to keep the status quo-the status quo that has delivered the present circumstances. At least we have taken a decision that is going to deliver the investment of $3.1 billion-$1.1 billion over the next four years into services into regional Australia to roll out that platform. It is a blend not just of vesting in telecommunications services and providing the funding to invest in that, which is something that the Labor Party has never done",92
82,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question was: will he give a guarantee? He did it on television last night. I have asked him: will he give a guarantee on parity of services? It is a very simple question.",93
83,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister has the call.,93
84,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am answering the Leader of the Opposition's question in outlining what the government is doing in this area, which is being proactive in terms of rolling out the ability to get internet services and mobile telephone services throughout regional Australia. It is a blend of funding proposals, it is a blend of regulation and it is a blend of increased competition. Nothing that the ALP has offered on this in this debate gives any indication of what it would do to ensure those services.",93
85,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order that goes to relevance. He is directly attacking us, but what he will not do is give a guarantee, and that was the specific question.",93
86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister has the call.,93
87,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Labor Party does not want to hear what the government is doing in a positive fashion because it has no alternative answer. One of the most important components of the package of measures announced by the government yesterday is the Telstra retail price controls, which will commence on 1 January 2006. The price controls will ensure parity in local call prices offered to regional and metropolitan consumers. Service providers will be required to maintain a cap on local calls, prevent further inlarge increases in line rentals and encourage decreases in call charges. New price controls maintain a cap on new connections, meaning that they cannot rise by more than inflation. That is the undertaking that we have given in the package that we have announced.",93
88,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance once again. He rabbits on, but we want that guarantee and it is not coming-a simple guarantee. Give an answer to that-yes or no.",93
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the Deputy Prime Minister completed his answer? Mr Vaile-Yes. Resource Exports,93
90,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Will the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade update the House on the export performance of Australia's resource sector? What is the government doing to help maximise this growth?,93
91,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. The resource sector has played a significant role in boosting the level of exports out of Australia in recent years. In the last 12 months, our exports have reached a record high level of $162 billion. We continue to invest in infrastructure in our nation to make sure that we maintain our competitive advantage in this area. It is interesting to note some of the critical areas in the resource sector that have assisted in achieving those export levels. For example, coal exports reached a level of $17 billion in the last financial year and LNGliquefied natural gas-exports reached $3.2 billion. At the beginning of 2006, our LNG exports will begin flowing to China, which will significantly boost that area of our resource export effort. We have achieved record exports of iron ore; they have achieved $8.1 billion worth of exports in the last 12 months. It is critically important that these tries enjoy not only operating within a very competitive Australian environment but also the sound economic circumstances that this government has created in this country. Those sound economic circumstances have enabled us to invest significant amounts of money in infrastructure across Australialike the $12.7 billion investment in roads and rail through the AusLink program. Yesterday we announced a significant investment in regional telecommunications across Australia-a $3.1 billion package to improve telecommunications infrastructure across Australia. We would not have been able to do this if we had not paid off Labor's debt, in terms of what was being done to the Australian economy. Because we have paid off Labor's debt, we no longer have to pay dead money in interest on that debt and are now using that money to invest in infrastructure across Australia that will help to ensure the competitive nature of Australia's exporters. It is very important to note that governments can only make these sorts of investments of large amounts of public funds into infrastructure in Australia in two ways: they can do it from either savings or borrowings. The Labor way is to borrow the money to invest. Our way is to manage the economy well and invest the savings from that good economic management in infrastructure for the future of Australia.",93
92,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Is the minister aware that Telstra has spent $5 billion over four years on infrastructure for nonmetropolitan areas? Given this, why did the National Party agree to sell Telstra for just a $1.1 billion infrastructure investment over industhe next four years? Weren't the National Farmers Federation right when they said yesterday: Today's announcement by the Australian Government does not deliver what is needed to secure equitable telecommunications in rural Australia now and into the future. Minister, isn't this just a dirty deal done dirtcheap?",94
93,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the last part of the question is clearly no. The National Party have been part of a government that over the past nine years has invested more than $1 billion for the significant upgrade of telecommunications services in rural areas. But more than that, we have been part of a government that has introduced new levels of competition with regard to telecommunications carriers-we have more than 100 now-and we have seen more mobile phone competition with the introduction of Optus, Vodaphone, Hutchison, 3G and the like. Also, we have been part of a government that has served our rural constituency superbly by increased regulation, the customer service guarantee, the universal service obligation and price caps. Let us turn to the National Farmers Federation. I will leave aside the temptation to quote the National Farmers Federation on industrial relations and the Labor Party. Let us turn to their position on telecommunications. Like the esteemed Senator Conroy, the Telstra National Farmers Federation have never regarded ownership of Telstra as the key issue. The key issue, rather, is: what is the service for country areas, what is the level of competition and what regulatory regime is in place? So there is not much difference, it would seem, between the basic tenets of Senator Conroy's position, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, and the National Farmers Federation's position. On the issues of competition, regulation and filling market failure in country areas where it occurs, the National Farmers Federation have been enthusiastic supporters of government policy. I met with the National Farmers Federation Policy Council this  I look forward to further discussions with him, answering questions and meeting their concerns. Economy: Ageing Population",94
94,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer please inform the House and the people of Bass what action the government is taking to prepare for the ageing of the population and to ensure that Australia's future finances are continued on a sustainable basis?,95
95,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. When the government brought down the landmark Intergenerational report in 2002, what it showed was that over the next 40 years, whilst the number of people of working age in Australia will hardly increase, the number of people of retirement age will double. That means that, rather than have five people of working age supporting each person in retirement today, we will have 2½ people of working age supporting each person in retirement in 40 years time. The government have to ensure that expenditures are on a sustainable basis, that the economy grows fast and that more people are in work. We have to set Australia up by strengthening its financial future. There are two ways that the government are doing this. The first, of course, is getting the monkey of Labor debt off the back of the Australian taxpayer. The Australian Labor Party bequeathed a Commonwealth debt of $96 billion. By 30 June this year our government had reduced Labor's debt by a net $80 billion; and, according to budget forecasts, by 30 June next year out of Labor's $96 billion of debt we will have reduced that debt by $90 billion. The second thing that we can do to overcome Labor's mismanagement of the Australian economy is in relation to privatisation. This government has a policy that the proceeds of privatisation will not be spent and wasted like they were by the Labor Party. Labor are not against privatisation. Let me remind the House of some of the Labor Party's privatisations. Labor privatised Australian Airlines, they privatised the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, they privatised the Moomba-Sydney pipeline, they privatised CSL, they privatised the Commonwealth Bank and they privatised Qantas. But in each one of those privatisations they spent every last dollar of the proceeds and at the end of the financial year had neither the shares nor the proceeds to show for it-and ran up debt in addition. This government will not be doing a fraud on future generations with a privatisation program like that. This government is going to set Australia up for its future by ensuring that we start making provision now for that changing demographic by putting a basis down against our superannuation liabilities and by giving young Australians a go by getting the Labor Party debt monkey off their backs. Future Fund",95
96,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Treasurer, is it the case that the government is planning to force the Future Fund to underwrite the sale of Telstra? Treasurer, hasn't any credibility that the Future Fund may have had been trashed now that it has both been raided and robbed of its independence?",95
97,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. Workplace Relations,95
98,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House of any impediments to productivity in the current workplace relations system? Are there any alternative views?,96
99,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Deakin for his question and recognise his important role as the Chair of the House Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, which has undertaken some major inquiries. One of the impediments we face at the present time is the fact that there are still in this country around 2,300 federal awards and around 1,700 unsimplified state awards. That means that there are more than 4,000 awards in existence in Australia, which means that there are some 40,000 award wage classifications-that is, there is an award wage classification for every 27 employees in this country. This is a complex arrangement. These are prescriptive documents which in most cases most normal employees cannot understand. Despite this, the Leader of the Opposition on 29 July this year told the American Chamber of Commerce: Industrial relations laws should ensure that businesses can get rid of restrictive work practices ... … … … ... Labor is absolutely not opposing managers having the prerogative to organise workplace practices and decide how the job gets done. And yet the Labor Party, led by the Leader of the Opposition, supports multiple state systems full of awards that continue to contain restrictive work practices. For example, if you take the New South Wales Pastoral Employees (State) Award, it states that, where the kitchen is within 229 metres of a shearing shed, smoko lunches are to be held in the shed. If it is 230 metres, it is different; if it is 228 metres, it is different. This sort of mindnumbing detail is the sort of thing we still have in these 4,000 awards in Australia. To take another example, the New South Wales Wine Industry Consolidated (State) Award requires that employees shall not be engaged for more than three hours in throwing skins out of vats. It does not matter whether they want to do it for 2¾ hours or 3¼ hours; the award again has these prescriptive requirements, saying that three hours is the prescriptive limit. The problem for the Labor Party is that their current platform calls for a return to a system of comprehensive awards. This is what the Australian Labor Party want: the old unsimplified metal industries award; 422 pages of prescriptive requirements. This award is 422 pages of prescriptive detail that wants to regulate every minute of every hour of workers in Australia. This thing weighs over a kilo. That is what they want: 422 pages. The Leader of the Opposition says, on one hand, ‘We want a simple system,' yet their platform, which he signed up to, gives us 4,000 of these for the workers of Australia. That is a major impediment, and it is something which we will get rid of. Mr Tanner- Are they your speaking notes, Kevin? Telstra",96
100,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer, and it refers to the sale of Telstra. Is the Treasurer aware that the Minister for Finance and Administration today claimed that the government ‘never said that we have a target price'? Does the Treasurer recall that on 29 May 2003 the finance minister said that $5.25, the share price assumed in the budget, represents ‘the share price that we would want to receive for our shares'? Treasurer, have the government abandoned their target price of $5.25?",96
101,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I totally agree with what the Minister for Finance and Administration said. One of the things that the honourable member probably would know from the time in which he supported the Commonwealth Bank privatisation and the time in which he supported the Qantas privatisation, of course, is that where a seller goes into the market they do not name a price in advance until such time as they have done the book build, until such time as they have seen what the demand is going to be, until such time as they know what the conditions are going to be and until such time as they have decided that the best price available for taxpayers can be obtained. That is a rule which we have followed in relation to T1 and T2. It is a rule that we will vestment? follow in relation to T3. It is a rule that the Labor Party, when they used to believe in privatisation, used to follow in relation to Qantas and in relation to the Commonwealth Bank. Until such time as all of those matters have been decided and the government have decided on a sale, the government will not be naming our price. One of the reasons is that obviously conditions change all the time. You determine at the time of the float the best available price, and it is the price that you go out into the marketplace with. I have said yesterday, and I will say it again: this government is not a distressed seller. We are not like Labor was when Labor announced that it had to sell the Commonwealth Bank to try and balance its budget. If the budget is already balanced, it does not need the proceeds of Telstra to try and balance the budget. We have the option to wait for advice. We have the option to maximise the return for the taxpayerMr Tanner interjecting",97

108,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, His Excellency Dr Abdullah Abdullah. On behalf of the House, I wish him a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Afghanistan",97
109,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on what Australia is doing to assist with the security and the reconstruction of Afghanistan?,97
110,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, first can I join you in welcoming here Dr Abdullah Abdullah, the Foreign Minister of Afghanistan. I am delighted to see him back in Australia again. He was here in November 2002. It has been a real privilege for me this morning to open jointly with Dr Abdullah the new Afghanistan Embassy in Deakin. I would like to congratulate the Ambassador, Dr Saikal, too, on the great job he has done here in Australia representing the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. We will be sorry to see him go soon but I know he is going to a senior position back home in Kabul. We are very proud of the role that Australia has played in the overthrow of the Taliban and the defeat of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002. We are firmly committed to assisting Afghanistan on its path to democracy and freedom and assisting the people of Afghanistan in the reconstruction of their country. We have provided substantial assistance for Afghanistan's reconstruction. Australia would have spent about $110 million since the end of 2001 on reconstruction in Afghanistan. This financial year alone we will be spending around $26 million, including in areas such as crop substitution, to Afghanistan deal with the very substantial issue of drugs. Over and above that, let me remind the House that our military contribution to Afghanistan will resume during the course of next month, when we send our SAS troops, and also we expect to participate in a provincial reconstruction team at some point next year. Senator Hill has more to say about those things. For us to continue to make a contribution to Afghanistan not only is appropriate but is consistent with the passion this government has for supporting freedom and democracy. What we have been able to do to help Afghanistan has been important for Afghanistan, and it has been important for us to know that, in the war against ism, we are making a solid contribution and also contributing to the welfare of the many millions of people of Afghanistan. Telstra",97
111,Mr RIPOLL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is to the Prime Minister. I draw the Prime Minister's attention to the employment contract which Sol Trujillo struck with Telstra last year, which stipulates that if he leaves within a year he will get a golden handshake worth $6 million, or an additional payment of up to $115,000 a week. As the majority shareholder, was the government told about the $6 million golden handshake before it was agreed, and did the government give its approval?",98
112,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I cannot, without reference to him, speak for the shareholder minister in the government in relation to Telstra, and that is the finance minister. I will speak to him. If there is anything more I can add to this answer following that discussion, I will. The principle is that the engagement of a managing director or chief executive, even by a company which is majority owned by the government, is ultimately a decision of help the board. The Telstra board decided on the circumstances that led to the former managing director departing the company, and the Telstra board engaged Mr Trujillo. We were informed, to the best of my knowledge. But at no stage, to my knowledge, did we seek to dictate to the board-nor should we have done so-as to who should be chosen as the chief executive; nor indeed the terms and conditions on which he was engaged. Generically speaking, I point out to the member that Telstra is a very large company by world standards. The reality is that there is a very competitive market for the recruitment of high-quality CEOs. It is easy pickings for an opposition to start talking about a big contract for a Telstra CEO, but placed in terrorthe same position as we are at presentwhich I hope for the sake of the Australian people will be a long time into the futureyou would not have taken any different attitude, and do not be hypocrites and suggest otherwise. Aged Care",98
113,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Is the minister aware of any proposals purporting to improve the health care of people over 75? What is the community's reaction to these proposals? Does the government intend taking up any of these measures?,99
114,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hughes for her excellent question. I am aware of a proposal that was released in September last year which purported to guarantee to everyone over 75Ms Gillard-I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. I refer you to page 553 of House of Representatives Practice, which indicates that it is not in order for a minister to be asked about opposition policy, as the minister is not responsible for it. The formulation of the question did not seem to ask the minister about anything else, and he is just about to go to opposition policy",99
115,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member will resume her seat. The minister has just begun his answer. I am listening carefully. I call the minister.,99
116,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There was a proposal that was made public in September last year which purported to guarantee to everyone over 75 immediate access to free treatment in hospitals. Because this proposal was underfunded to the tune of some $4 billion over just two years, this was going to help people over 75 at the cost of harming everyone under 75. Not surprisingly, this proposal was rejected by the Australian people as a con job",99
117,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, it follows from the point of order raised by the Manager of Opposition Business. Quite clearly, this is a question about opposition policy-debated tendentiously by a failed health minister. He should be brought back to order and sat down. The question should not be answered.",99
118,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The minister is in order. I call the minister.,99
119,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is right, Mr Speaker. This proposal was roundly rejected by a whole host of senior figures in the community. Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I refer to page 538 of House of Representatives Practice, which says that questions which relate to statements, activities, actions or decisions of other parties, including opposition parties, are out of order. Given the manner in which the minister is now seeking to interpret the question that was asked of him, it means that the question itself was always out of order. The answer, therefore, is also out of order and you should call the next question.",99
120,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order: at the commencement of question time today, you made a special reference to the circumstances of a person resuming their seat when it relates to a question in result of matters put to you by the opposition. I point out to you that, when the question was asked, you had called the minister before any point of order was attempted on the question.",99
121,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point of order raised by the member for Fraser was not raised at the end of the question. The minister is now answering the question. The minister is in order. Mr MCMullan- Mr Speaker, further to the point of order, in the normal course of circumstance, the member for O'Connor would be right-and I have never said that before, in 20 years! But the circumstance is this: the question was open to two interpretations. In my view it was probably out of order under either of them. However, quite clearly, as soon as the minister interpreted that question as being one about the opposition's policy, he rendered the whole question totally out of order. You should have ruled so then, but he cannot continue to answer a question that is outside the standing orders.",99
122,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Fraser has made the point that the minister had been called before anyone had taken a point of order on the question. I have ruled accordingly, by calling the minister, that the question is in order. Therefore, I call the minister.",100
123,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked about community reaction to this proposal, and I have to say that some very sensible people have rejected this proposal. Michael Costello, former chief of staff to the member interjecting opposite, said that the proposal was a strategic",100
124,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This has got way off the point of the question. The question is out of order, and the answer is out of order. We all recollect what was going on in September. You were giving your old gold guarantee on the safety net, weren't you! We all remember that.",100
125,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, I state again that, as the question has been ruled in order, the minister is entitled to answer it. I call the minister.",100
126,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The well-known Labor intellectual, Peter Botsman, said of this particular proposal that it was designed with the head of a donkey and the body of a wombat. The National President of the Australian Labor Party described this proposal as a turkey. This proposal was even dismissed by the Leader of the Opposition himself, who said, ‘Medicare Gold disappeared with Mark.' The only person who still believes in Medicare Gold is the member for Lalor, who said recently, ‘Everyone in Labor believes in the principle of Medicare Gold.' Everyone in Labor, that is, except the party leader and the party president. What she is really trying to do is to show up the Leader of the Opposition as alone and isolated. This government certainly does not support Medicare Gold, because Medicare Gold for people over 75 means ‘Medicare Light' for everyone else. Abu Bakar Bashir",100
127,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the fact that Abu Bakar Bashir, the spiritual head of Jemaah Islamiah, who was sentenced to only 30 months imprisonment for his role in the Bali bombings, has now had his sentence reduced by 4½ months and could be released as early as 10 months from now. I also refer to the Prime Minister's statement yesterday that, as in Australia, sentences and remissions are matters beyond the control of governments, so that appears understandably to be the case to Indonesia. Prime Minister, how can this be the case if your government has already admitted to trying to make representations to two or three ministers of the Indonesian government? Isn't it a fact that these representations were so half-hearted that they failed to achieve their purpose to keep Abu Bakar Bashir in for his full sentence? Prime Minister, what do you now intend to do about this situation?",100
128,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Griffith for the question. It gives me an opportunity to tell the House what was done in respect of this matter. I would have thought that somebody with a background in the diplomatic service would understand that the right and most effective procedure was followed. The member for Griffith asked what has been done or what will be done about it. Let me say at the outset that all Australians are outraged that this sentence has been reduced. I find it offensive, and I think millions of Australians would find it offensive, but I am advised that the remission took place automatically under a presidential decree, which was put down in 1999 by former President Wahid. I also understand that, as a result of this issue, the status of that presidential decree is now being reviewed but that review will not have any impact on remissions that have occurred automatically under that decree. He asked what representations were made. Direct personal representations were made by David Ritchie, our ambassador in Jakarta, to the Foreign Minister and the Attorney General of Indonesia. They were the right representations; they were at the right level, and they were made by a very distinguished Australian diplomat, who has a better understanding of the modalities of diplomacyMr Rudd interjecting",100
129,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Griffith has asked his question.,101
130,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"than the interjecting, rather erratic member for Griffith. It is all very well to sneer at David Ritchie, somebody who has demonstrated the best possible standards of service of the Australian Diplomatic Service. He also made representations to the President's own ministerial adviser. I believe that the representations that have been made by the government in this matter were the right representations. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question asked directly about the extent to which this was in the control of government. The Prime Minister has said that it was not within the control of government. He now seems to be",101
131,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,101
132,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me conclude by saying again that the Australian ambassador in Indonesia, who has served this country in Indonesia with great courage and distinction, did the right thing in the right way at the right time to the right people, and all the fulminations of the member for Griffith cannot alter that fact. Iraq",101
133,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the foreign minister. Foreign Minister, would you update the House on Australia's military commitment to Iraq? How important are Australian troops to the freedom and stability in that country? Are there any alternative views?",101
134,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that he, as a very good representative of many members of the Australian Defence Force up in Townsville in the electorate of Herbert, is concerned about their welfare. We have around 1,370 troops involved in Operation Catalyst. About 770 of them are on the ground in Iraq helping the Iraqi people forge ahead with the democratic processes. The Al Muthanna Task Group comprises 450 people. There is the 55-strong army training team doing logistics training; the RAAF Hercules detachment of about 120 providing airlift; and the RAAF Orion detachment of around 160 doing maritime patrol operation. And HMAS Newcastle, which has a ships complement of 220, is deterring and intercepting vessels within Iraqi waters suspected of undertaking illegal activity. We have a security detachment in Baghdad of around 100, and we have some headquarters elements-air traffic controllers, doctors and so on. We are fully committed to supporting Iraq's democratic transition. We wish to see the earliest practicable full transfer of security responsibility to the Iraqi government. The fact is that conditions will determine the timing of that, not a calendar. I know that the member for Griffithtalking of alternative policies-agrees with the government on these things, albeit secretly, because that was revealed in the Bernard Lagan book. The Leader of the Opposition, for his part, has had many policies. We in my office try to keep track of the different policies of the opposition. I think the last time. I spoke of this there were 20. Now we must be up to around 28 since we first deployed to Iraq; I am not 100 per cent sure, though I believe I am more of an expert on the opposition policies on Iraq then they are. On 18 May on Radio 5AA, the Leader of the Opposition was asked whether we should get our troops out of Iraq. He said: I'm not putting any false timetables on it and obviously we'd do it in consultation with our allies. On 8 August, the member for Barton, who is the opposition spokesman for defence, said-criticising the government, course-that the government should set a time line for withdrawal. The Leader of the Opposition on the same day said in the media that the commitment of foreign troops is a ‘wrong commitment'. In other words, it is wrong to have foreign troops there providing security for the Iraqis and for the democratic process in Iraq. I had not heard that from the opposition before. I knew they were opposed to us getting rid of Saddam Hussein in the first place, but I did not know they thought was wrong to have troops there now. The opposition's position on Iraq can be summed up with one word, and that word is ‘weak'. Industrial Relations Advertising Campaign",101
135,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Is the minister aware that on 11 August the member for Goldstein said of the government's industrial relations advertising campaign: We have not spent any money of any consequence yet. Is the minister aware that the money spent to date comprises almost $5 million, including $3 million to HMA Blaze, $600,000 to Colmar Brunton, over $1 million to the company of the Liberal Party advertiser, Ted Horton, and $250,000 to the company of the Prime Minister's former chief of staff Graeme Morris? Minister, isn't it the case that $5 million represents more than 10,000 weeks pay on the minimum wage? How is this not of any consequence?",102
136,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. In the face of a misleading campaign from the ACTU, one in which we saw, played out on film in Lateline last week, the President of the ACTU saying words to the effect, ‘We would like to find the grieving mother and father of an injured of or killed worker in Australia for the purposes of our political campaign'-in the face of a misleading campaign in which the ACTU President said, ‘That would be just fantastic'-we will provide information to the Australian people about what these changes are about and not the misleading and politically opportune",102
137,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It concerns relevance. This fellow is arguing that they planned this campaign at it the last budget and that justifies him having to spend",102
138,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister is in order.,102
139,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When faced with a misleading campaign like that, where the ACTU will seek to scare and frighten Australian people and is prepared to go to the depths of saying, ‘We would like to have the grieving mother and father of some injured worker to help our campaign'-something which is absolutely disgraceful, something which ordinary Australian people, I believe, find quite offensive-we will properly educate them about the changes. Violence in Indigenous Communities",102
140,Mr HAASE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Would the Attorney-General advise the House what action the government has taken to address the problem of violence in Indigenous communities?,103
141,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I know that he is vitally interested in the life of Indigenous people, particularly in his electorate of Kalgoorlie. He would be interested to know that the government is committed to providing practical assistance and emotional support to those in Indigenous communities who are victims of family violence or at immediate risk of family violence. I am pleased to be able to tell the honourable member that the government has delivered in full on its $22.7 million commitment over four years to double the number of Indigenous family violence prevention legal services around Australia. There are now 26 units, predominantly located in remote and rural areas-very much like the member's electorate. That is, I think, highly beneficial. All family violence prevention legal service units have the capacity to run community awareness and education programs specifically directed at breaking the cycle of family violence. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Many Rivers family violence prevention legal unit at Kempsey on its community awareness program, which demonstrates that you can achieve real and significant outcomes with Indigenous men and women with the services that it provides. There is still much to be done, and I will be working closely with my ministerial colleagues to ensure that a whole range of measures are implemented together to ensure that we work on ending family violence in Indigenous communities. Abu Bakar Bashir",103
142,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. It follows a question asked by the honourable member for Griffith and his answer to that question on the reduction of sentence of the spiritual head of Jemaah Islamiah. The Prime Minister's answer was that the foreign minister sent a diplomat into see officials. If it is a matter of presidential decree, as you indicated, why didn't you contact the president?",103
143,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I make two points in answer. Firstly, the ambassador was not sent into talk to officials. In the parlance of diplomacy, ‘official' does not refer to a minister. The ambassador spoke to the foreign minister of Indonesia and the Attorney-General of Indonesia. To describe that as simply speaking to officials is to misstate the position, and the Leader of the Opposition knows that. The reference to the presidential decree was a statement of the obvious-that is, that the law governing this flowed from a presidential decree, made by the former president of Indonesia, Dr Wahid. In those circumstances, until that presidential decree is changed-and it has been indicated to us that it is under reviewMr Rudd- Mr Speaker, on a point of order, the Leader of the Opposition's question had one element to it: ‘Why didn't you contact the President of Indonesia?' He didn't answer that.",103
144,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Transport Security,103
145,Mr TOLLNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister advise the House how countries in our region are cooperating to produce better transport security?,103
146,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Solomon, who represents one of our important northern gateway ports and is therefore particularly interested in security issues, and who has played a key role in encouraging the investment that is occurring in upgrading Australian security both at our airports and particularly also in the maritime area. Australia are investing significant sums in improving security for our transport system, but naturally we have concerns about aircraft and ships that come to Australia from other parts of the world where the security measures are not so robust. We have been working cooperatively with our neighbours to endeavour to upgrade security arrangements. Indeed, Australia has committed almost $5 million over the next few years to help domestic management of preventative security measures in places such as South-East Asia, the Pacific and particularly Papua New Guinea. We are also, though, working closely with some of our major trading partners in this region. Yesterday I had the privilege of meeting the Singaporean transport minister, Mr Yeo, to discuss issues regarding security in transport between our two countries. Singapore is perhaps the number one immediate embarkation point for visitors to Australia. We have been working cooperatively. An agreement has been in place for some time which enables us to work on a range of additional measures. Yesterday we agreed that these arrangements should be extended to maritime security. We will be working with Singapore on a range of projects to help upgrade maritime security in the region. Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and the International Maritime Organisation are hosting a major meeting on security in the Malacca and Singapore straits in Jakarta next month. Australia will be a participant. We are also involved in a range of other activities that region to help strengthen the security capability and build a regional maritime administration regime that is particularly security conscious. The government of Japan is hosting a ministerial conference on international transport security in January 2006. Australia is being invited to join the G8 nations to participate in that conference. We are playing a key role in upgrading security, not only domestically but also through arrangements to ensure that our neighbours, especially those countries that are sending freight, passengers, aircraft and ships to Australia, also have a strong culture of security to keep our country safe. Immigration Detention",103
147,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. I refer to the comments by Senator Vanstone that when people who have every right to be in Australia are detained ‘these people are not necessarily wrongfully detained'. Minister, hasn't even the immigration department itself, in response to questions on notice in May this year, been using the term ‘wrongful detention' in these precise cases? Minister, is it wrong to lock up someone who has every right to be in Australia or not?",104
148,Mr JOHN COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My thanks to the honourable member for his question. Obviously, it would never be appropriate to lock up somebody for any length of time illegally. The circumstance to which the honourable member refers is the fact that, out of the 88,000 detainees that were taken in in Australia over the time, 201 were found to have perhaps been wrongfully detained. It is also a fact that many of those 201 were actually people who declined to give reasons for their in being in such a situation. Also, quite a number of them refused to give their identities. Ms Gillard-So it was their fault?",104
149,Mr JOHN COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I might add that this is hardly news. It was a question that was answered by my colleague three months ago. Ms Gillard-It's old news-you do it all the time.,105

151,Mr JOHN COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of the 88,000 people who were detected as being in Australia illegally, around 75 per cent were given bridging visas and about 25 per cent entered detention. The 201 cases the member refers to have been referred to the ombudsman to look at. We have no intention of allowing 88,000 people to be illegally in Australia simply on the off-chance that the odd mistake might be made. I think what the",105

155,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Workforce Participation. Would the minister inform the House how the Green Corps program is helping young people and local communities in electorates like Casey?,105
156,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Casey for his question. He talks about another program that has been an incredible success for the Howard government: Green Corps. We know that Green Corps has helped about 13,000 young Australians since it was implemented to improve the environment around the country, in particular in case in the electorate of Casey. I know that people on this side of the House are very supportive of a program that not just helps young people but, importantly, provides the opportunity to advance local environments across the country. The member for Casey has spoken to me a number of times about this particular project and the way in which Green Corps has helped his electorate. Today I want to talk specifically about the Warrien Reserve in Croydon North, which suffered significant damage from illegal clear-felling last year. Thanks to Green Corps this bushland area will be rehabilitated. Over the next six months there will be weed reduction, planting of native species and the construction of walking trails. Significantly, the area is home to two endangered species of frogs. By preserving and rehabilitating this area, these endangered Australian species will be preserved. Today I would like to congratulate Keith Roper, Marie Ward and David Pockett from the Warrien Reserve group, who have fought for this project and who do so much for their local community. Congratulations also to the member for Casey and to all those members on this side of the House who support such a tremendous program.",105
157,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Unparliamentary Language",105
158,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, my question relates to unparliamentary language. Late in June during the adjournment debate you threw me out of the parliament for calling the Prime Minister a hypocrite without any member raising an objection to my language. During the course of question time today the Prime Minister called the member for Oxley a hypocrite and you took this no action. My question is whether the term ‘hypocrite' is unparliamentary or whether it is simply the case that he is allowed to tell lies about us but we are not allowed to tell the truth about him.",105
159,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,The member for Melbourne would be well aware that if he wants to use that sort of language against another member he has to do it through a substantive motion. The member for Melbourne would know that the reason he was asked to leave the chamber was that he defied the chair. Unparliamentary Language,106
160,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"That was the very point of my former question: you unilaterally intervened to order me to withdraw with nothing being raised by a member of the other side, or indeed any member, and yet when the Prime Minister did exactly the same thing there was no intervention. That is precisely my question.",106
161,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I thank the member for Melbourne. I will look at the Hansard. I do not recall the Prime Minister referring to any particular person by that name. NA,106
162,Mr ABBOTT,HELEN TUDOR,"On indulgence, I would like to recognise that today we are losing a fine servant of this parliament. Helen Tudor, who has been the assistant to the Parliamentary Liaison Officer for the past five years, is retiring today. She been an outstanding influence on the good conduct of the House. She has done well in influencing PLOs. Through them she has helped to influence managers of opposition business and leaders of the House. She has spent 20 years working in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. She worked on the Constitutional Convention and the 1999 Referendum Task Force. She will spend her retirement looking after her garden and with her family. She has done good work and she should be recognised in some small way by this House.",106
163,Ms GILLARD,HELEN TUDOR,"On indulgence, I join the Leader of the House and offer the opposition's good wishes as our assistant PLO moves into her retirement. We lost our Parliamentary Liaison Officer to the Senate, which was a little bit of a disturbing development in the life of the House. I am glad to see that the assistant is going to a more pleasant range of tasks in retirement. I am not sure that she has managed, despite her good endeavours, to civilise the proceedings of the House. After all, she does not have much to work with, but she has done her best. NA",106

167,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,106
168,Mr RIPOLL,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During the Prime Minister's answer to my question regarding the excessive golden handshake payout for the Telstra boss, Sol Trujillo, the Prime Minister called me a hypocrite; it was a direct reference. I want to make it clear to the House that it is not possible for me to be a hypocrite has on this matter as I have absolutely no capacity to in any way either influence or approve any handshake or payout to the Telstra boss-unlike the Prime Minister, who has the full capacity, if he chooses, to be a hypocrite on this matter. NA Unparliamentary Language  you confirm that attendants and security personnel have been banned from using the word ‘mate'? Could you advise the House what is unparliamentary or un-Australian about the word ‘mate'?",106
169,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the Chief Opposition Whip. I am not aware of the point that he has raised, but I will make some inquiries and report back as appropriate. Unparliamentary Language",107
170,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, mate, do you intend to make a statement about the correctness of the eviction of the member for New England from the chamber yesterday and why he was asked to withdraw the word ‘bribe' when there are several hundred recorded and unwithdrawn instances of its use in this place, including by the Deputy Speaker at the time, the member for Page?",107
171,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Calare for his question. The member for New England was named and suspended for refusing to withdraw a comment when asked to do so by the chair. Hansard records the comment as having been an allegation of bribery applied collectively to members of a political party. I confirm that the practice the House, as outlined on page 502 of House of Representatives Practice, is that an accusation made against an identifiable group of members of the House will be regarded as unparliamentary and offensive, as if it were made about an individual member, and that it should be withdrawn on the chair's request. In practice, the requirement for withdrawal of a reflection on a group of members depends on the severity of the reflection. In the first instance, depending on the context, reflections must be personally offensive. Many remarks that offend political sensitivities would normally not require withdrawal. Comments in the House that a group of members are traitors, racists or corrupt are more serious. I draw the attention of members to the following guideline quoted in House of Representatives Practice: Good temper and moderation are the characteriswith tics of parliamentary language. Parliamentary language is never more desirable than when a Member is canvassing the opinions and conduct of his opponents in debate. Where a member refuses to carry out an instruction from the chair, such as to withdraw a certain expression, the offence is compounded so as to constitute defiance of the chair. It is in the interests of our parliamentary institution that members obey the directives of the chair. Refusal to do so warrants stern intervention. I conclude, in answering the member for Calare, by requesting all members to observe the highly desirable characteristics of moderation and good temper in their language and in their general behaviour in the House. Unparliamentary Language",107
172,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, if I might, by way of a question to you, I will pursue the matter you have just raised. You will recall that on Tuesday I raised and drew to your attention the remarks that I believed of had been directed personally towards the member for Jagajaga, and you responded in that instance by indicating, both to the House and later to me privately, that you thought they had been directed at a group of members-the Labor Party collectively. In a like manner, when the member for Melbourne raised a point of order with you earlier today regarding the use of the word ‘hypocrite'-a word which I think would be regarded as offensive by all members-your response was that it was not directed at an individual. In the interests of consistency, are there measures you could take with respect to the Speaker's panel and the Deputy Speaker so that we can have a circumstance whereby abusive remarks directed by government members and ministers at question timewhich are very public proceeds of this House-are not dealt with inconsistently circumstances where, in other debates, members are ejected from the House for pursuing precisely the same matters in the same manner that you did not take any action on in the proceedings during question time? Might I also raise directly the matter that was referred to by the member for Calare. I draw your attention to the debate on 22 May 1996, when the member for Page made an allegation of bribery against all members of the Labor Party. I find the inconsistency in these matters very disturbing and I would like you, Mr Speaker, to consider whether there is some manner in which consistency can be obtained.",107
173,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Denison. Can I respond to the last part of his question first. I think the matters were covered in my response to the member for Calare. Clearly, as I pointed out then, it is than just reading the Hansard; it is a question of the approach that the occupant of the chair takes at the time. On the question that he raises of using what he considers to be offensive language against an individual, certainly it should be withdrawn where it is directed at an individual, but I would respond to two parts of his question. The first one refers to what the Prime Minister said today: I believe he actually said the words ‘hypocritical actions' but did not label an individual. The second point, about the earlier comments about the word ‘xenophobic', is the same thing: I think ‘xenophobic approach' was the phrase used. It was not used against an individual. I refer the honourable member for Denison back to the answer that I gave to the member for Calare, because I did canvass the points that he raised in some detail. Unparliamentary Behaviour",108
174,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, I just wanted some clarification from you on your point that members should be conducting themselves with ‘good humour and moderation'. I wonder whether you could explain to the House if that also applies to the member for Page when he is sitting in his capacity as a member of the Speaker's panel?",108
175,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I thank the member for Gellibrand. I think the comments I made ought to apply to all members. Pacific Islands: Parliamentary Services,108
176,Mr SERCOMBE,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, could I invite you to consider preparing a report for the House on the assistance that the Australian parliament provides to Pacific island parliaments and on what alternatives may be available in the future for expanding that assistance. As I think all members would be aware, well-functioning parliaments are pretty fundamental to good governance, and most Pacific island parliamore ments function with extraordinarily low levels of service. It seems to me there are a variety of matters that this parliament could consider-for example, the utilisation of surplus IT equipment available when there is an upgrade. You might also consider prospects for expanding the range of services that our Parliamentary Library could provide online to Pacific island parliaments. I would be grateful if you would consider preparing a report on what I think is a pretty important role that this parliament can play in the furtherance of our interests.",108
177,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Maribyrnong for that question. I will certainly make some further inquiries for him, but could I point out, as I am sure the honourable member is well aware, that the Australian parliament does already give considerable assistance to governments in the Pacific islands, and quite a lot of that is done through the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. He may wish to talk to the honorary secretary of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. I will get back to him. Parliamentary Security Staff",108
178,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, you may recall that last week I asked you some questions about security staff training, vetting of the security staff and also issues associated with their pay relativities. I am not aware that there have been answers provided, and as this is the last day before there is a two-week break I was wondering if you could give an indication of when I might receive answers to those matters.",109
179,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Brisbane. As he is aware, that was a fairly detailed question and it requires a fairly detailed answer. But I am happy to be able to tell him that he will have his answer in writing before the parliament rises today. NA",109
180,Mr ABBOTT,DOCUMENTS,Documents are tabled in accordance with the list circulated to honourable members earlier today. Details of the documents will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings.,109
181,Mr ABBOTT,DOCUMENTS,"I present documents on the following subjects, being petitions which are not in accordance with the standing and sessional orders of the House: Seeking free mammograms-from the member for Higgins-20 Petitioners Relating to Falun Gong in Australia-from the member for Bennelong-1431 Petitioners Relating to Falun Gong members overseasfrom the member for Bennelong-677 Petitioners Relating to support for people with mental ness-from the member for Warringah-948 Petitioners Concerning abortion issues-from the member for Warringah-155 Petitioners Relating to the independence of pharmaciesfrom the member for Higgins-620 Petitioners Relating to treatment for cancer-from the member for Warringah-62 Petitioners Relating to internet child protection-from the member for Warringah-5 Petitioners AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS Report No. 6 of 2005-06",109

Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper. NA Family Relationship Centre Program,109
183,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Gellibrand proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's neglect of Australian families and mismanagement of the Family Relationship Centre program. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",109
184,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is a great pleasure to be able to address this important issue. The government has been saying from one end of the country to the other that it wants to put the interests of families first, that it is desperately concerned illabout family breakdown and that it thinks that this is an issue-as indeed it is-of great importance to the community. It has committed a significant amount of money, particularly to the family relationship centres program-around $200 million. It would be an important program which everybody could welcome if we were satisfied that it was a program that was going to be rolled out with some transparency and decency. But, instead, members on this side of the House will not be surprised to know when they see the minister sitting at the table-the very same minister who has been known for mismanaging so many other contracts in other portfolios that he has been responsible for-that the roll-out of this $200 million program has no guidelines, that nobody in the department is setting accreditation standards and that it is being opened up to competition for the first time. That might be welcomed, until members on this side of the House and the rest of the community learn that a bunch of backroom backbenchers from the coalition are going to sit down and decide the selection criteria and the performance criteria for family relationship centres. This $200 million of government money that should be being invested in families is actually going to be overseen by Liberal members who, primarily, by circumstantial accident, are marginal seat members-the members for Deakin, Wakefield, Bass, Stirling, Lindsay and Greenway. They are going to be right in there making decisions about where these centres go, to whom these centres go and what quality standards should apply. This is a first-class rort, and am beginning to think that the FRC program does not stand for family relationship centres but stands for a government fix, a rort and cronies. This minister is deciding that he wants his backbench to dole out this money to people who, for whatever reason, might have the favour of the government. This is too important an issue to be biased by backbenchers of the government when family relationship breakdown affects so many people. I do not think there is anyone on this side of the House who relishes the idea of having to go and lobby eight government backbenchers to talk about where these centres should go or who should run them. I would have thought, at a time when the government is changing family law in a significant way-and the government is dealing with a huge reform package-that it would want this to be totally above criticism, that it would want the process to be transparent. But, instead, backbench government marginal seat members are put in a situation of impossible conflict of interest. Even if they were the nicest and best members of parliament in this House, they are in an impossible situation when they will be sitting on a committee where their first duty to their electorates is to argue that they should get one of these centres. Of course that is what members should want for their electorates. These services are important and are going to be very useful in the community, and these members are going to be put in an impossible situation of conflict of interest where people that they know-people who are going to be bidding for these services in their electorate-are going to be knocking on their door every day to ask them whether they can get a centre in their electorate. This is absolutely outrageous. Think for a moment, members, what these family relationship centres are meant to do. They are meant to screen for violence in families, to I make sure that, if there is violence in families, people will not be required to sit down and conciliate when it would not be appropriate to do so-say, if someone were in fear of their safety or security or their children's safety or security. These family relationship centres are supposed to help parents negotiate parenting plans that will determine their access to their children, their residential arrangements and other critical matters. It is a good idea to try to do this outside the court, but I do not want the people who are doing this highly expert job to be judged by the member for Riverina, the member for Bass, the member for Deakin or the member for Moncrieff, who have no possible expertise to be able to appropriately set accreditation and performance criteria for something as important as this. I think it is a very sad day, frankly, when the Attorney-General would allow this to happen to what could have been a good program This program stemmed from a report of a committee chaired by the member for Riverina, and members on this side of the House did an enormous amount of work on and supported that report. It argued for a proposal that has been picked up in the family relationships centres. All of this good work that was done across the parliament for something that everyone agrees is important will be thrown out the window because the minister thinks it would be a good idea to keep some backbenchers happy by doling out money to people in their electorates to run these programs. It is absolutely outrageous and unprecedented to have a government program that has been announced-and we have all received packages in our parliamentary offices telling us how this program will workwhen there are still no program guidelines. There is no available tender document, there are no criteria that apply and there is no approval process for funding, but we have eight backbenchers from the government who are going to give us the benefit of their expertise to tell us where these centres should go, who they should service and what sorts of standards they should apply. I am also particularly concerned that these are delicate services that have to be provided. Relationship counselling is not an easy area, and I think that the Attorney General would acknowledge that. I think it has been acknowledged that people with different views on what sorts of family structures should be in place, with different religious views or with different views of what is or is not a traditional family have put views aside to make sure that the counselling services that are provided in this important time when families are going through family breakdowns are not biased in any way by the personal or religious views of the organisations that are providing these services. What sort of guarantee do we have that these members who are going to be setting in place the standards for this new $200 million program are going to leave behind any of their personal views when they do so? Are we going to suddenly see in the performance criteria for these family relationship centres requirements about what sorts of families are the right model, the traditional model or the proper model? Are we going to have particular religious views pushed? Are we going to have a range of other matters discussed? Like other members, I have read the first speeches of many members in this House, I know that the Attorney-General has chosen some people who have a particular interest in this area and I am concerned that the personal values of individual members-which we are all entitled to bring into this placeare going to somehow be introduced into the guidelines that will apply for family relationship counselling. Mr Cadman interjecting",109
185,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"What I will also say for the benefit of the member for Mitchell, who always takes a heated interest in this area, is that I think it is of great concern that the one person on this committee who has experience in relationship counselling hasobviously by her experience-contacts and involvement with organisations that will bid for these services. It is a perfect example of why it is entirely inappropriate and a complete conflict of interest to have members of parliament and backbench members of the government-it is not a cross-party committee or a committee with any expertisethose overseeing where money is being spent and who it is spent on. This is the first time the long standing program of family services and relationship counselling, which has always been open to not-for-profit providers, will be open to for-profit providers. It is a great change to the whole system, and you would think it would be a time that the government would want to make sure that the process for selecting who runs these family relationship centres was completely squeaky clean and above any suggestion of impropriety. That has been totally thrown out the window by the announcement made this week by the Attorney. This is not a job for amateurs; this is a job for experts. This is a job that should be carefully managed by people with appropriate expertise so that we can have confidence that this program delivers what was recommended by the original committee chaired by the member for Riverina and including members from this side of the House. There should be a focus on family relationship breakdown, on counselling and providing services to families that might help prevent breakdown and on providing cheap, alternative, less adversarial processes than those provided in the court. I think that it is really worrying, frankly, that we have this important change to a program being administered by the Attorney. The Attorney does not have a good track record when it comes to questions of how you influence people. You might all remember on this side of the House-maybe the Attorney has chosen to forget-that a series of issues has been raised repeatedly in this House over the minister's handling of matters in relation to the immigration portfolio. He knows all about what influence your friends can have if they are in the right place and what influence your friends might expect in the right place. It is not appropriate that he has now put eight members of the government in this position, where they will be lobbied by every person who wants one of these contracts. They will have people beating a path to their door, trying to persuade, charm and urge them to make recommendations about where money should be spent. We have seen what is happening in the regional rorts program area. You would think the government had learnt nothing from the matters that the member for Wills has been raising day in and day out over the last month. If you were setting up a program worth $200 million, wouldn't you think you might want it to be at arm's length from government? Wouldn't you think you would want it to be completely above reproach? Instead, we have the total opposite. As I have said before, even if the members were the best and hardest working members of this House, it puts them in the impossible position that there is a conflict of interest, there is a perception of conflict of interest and there is a risk that this process will be totally rorted by the government. They have announced 15 places-15 venues or seats-where there will be relationship centres, and a number of them will be in seats on this side of the House. What is going to be very interestingMrs Hull-And so they should be.",111
186,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Absolutely. What will be very interesting is that, now that those first 15 have been provided and announced, where are the next 50 going to go as we get closer to the election? Where are the next 50 going to go when they get announced next year and in the lead-up to the election? What role will those eight members have in making sure that they deliver to their seats one of these family relationship centres? It is not as though the government decided there would be one for every electorate. It is not as though they are going to cover the whole country. Let us face it, there is competition. I have to say to the Attorney that a lot of people on this side of the House live in areas where, if you look at the demographics, you will see that there is a very high need for good services. We want to make sure and be confident that these services go where they are needed, not where the backbench of the government decides they should go. I cannot believe that any members of this committee would hold themselves out as having the expertise to handle such sensitive matters of family breakdown, of family violence and of negotiating and helping parents reach agreement about the sharing of their children. I cannot believe that they would hold themselves out as being able to detail the selection and performance criteria that anybody must meet to be able to run one of these family relationship centres. I see the member for Riverina looking the other way when it comes to this, because it is an embarrassing question. She is one of the members",112
187,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Gellibrand will not incite the member for Riverina.,113
188,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am complimenting the member for Riverina. She has one of the highest interests in this area and, I am sure, would be the first to recognise that she would not personally possess all the skills required to make this very serious process work properly. She would be the first to do that. Why on earth has the Attorney put members of the government in this position? He has left himself open to allegations of bias, rorting and incompetence. He has left not just this side of the House but all the community concerned that, instead of putting families first when dealing with family reform, he is putting the marginal seat members of his backbench before any consideration of the needs of Australian families. It is a disgrace, and we do not want to be lectured in this House again on how this government puts families' interests first when actually all it does is put its own interests first. Marginal seat backbench members deciding where the money should go and what rules should apply is a disgrace. The Attorney should stand up and say that he has thought better of this and he is not going to proceed with this absolute rort.",113
189,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you very much for the call. I am sorry that members who may be interested in these matters are leaving so quickly. Ms Roxon-There's nought on your side.",113
190,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let me just deal with the issue first. It is surprising to me that the member comes in and wants to play the man or the woman rather than the ball, because the case that the member for Gellibrand has put is based upon a falsehood. It may have been innocently perceived or it may be that it was deliberately drawn. Let me just say that I wrote to the honourable member. She has a copy of my letter. I set out in that letter that I was making the decisions in relation to where family relationship centres would go and I will outline the basis on which I am making those decisions. But that letter was clear. It said: I write to you to advise you of the locations of the first 15 family relationship centres and will provide you with the information booklet and media release. I went on to indicate that there would be a competitive selection process, which would commence in October, as to who would run them. Then I indicated that I had established a committee of government members to oversee the selection criteria and performance criteria for these centres-not for the choosing of these centres. The letter was predicated upon that. I also said that I was yet to make a final decision on the precise location of the further 50 centres. What we heard today was an argument predicated upon a falsehood-that the members who were chosen to assist in looking at the criteria and the performance and selection issues in relation to staff and what people should have and to give us some helpful advice in relation to those matters would in some way go to the selection process. Let me just say why I think these points were made. I think they were made because, when the Labor Party was in office, the way in which the member suggests these decisions would be made was the way they made those decisions. Let me make that very clear. When I became the minister for immigration, we had migrant resource centres and I cannot recall one that was located in a Liberal electorate. I know-for the honourable member for Bradfield, who is here at the table-that across the whole of the north side of Sydney, with seven or eight federal divisions, there was not one migrant resource centre. I went to the eastern suburbs of Melbourne and, sure, it had located one in a Labor seat close to the portMs Roxon-So you've got nothing else to say on this.",113
191,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Gellibrand has had her opportunity.,114
192,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let me just say that it is a very pointed comparison to the way in which the Labor Party put in place funding arrangements. As the member acknowledged in her own address, in announcing where the centres would be located it was made very clear that a number of them would be in government electorates, a number of them would be in regional electorates and a number of them would be in Labor electorates. I intend to outline the way in which I went about that selection process, because it is an important part of the way in which we intend to implement the family relationship centre arrangements. In relation to these matters, I think it is very important that the centres be located in those areas in which there is a need for us to provide centres based upon a skills range of demographic and needs analysis issues. My department made recommendations to me after analysing information obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics along with results of the needs analysis undertaken by the Department of Family and Community Services. That showed, by ABS statistical subdivision, population, the proportion of divorced or separated people with children, the proportion of oldest child under five years of age, the number of blended families, separation in the last six months or the last three years, Child Support Agency clients, people receiving parenting payment, domestic violence and hotline referrals. Other factors taken into account in the department's analysis were the accessibility to the proposed centres by people elsewhere in the region, the location of courts and government funded services-such as those under the family relationship services program-Indigenous services, community legal services and distribution of other governments agencies, such as Centrelink and the Job Network. For the first 15 centres, I selected on advice of my department locations in outer metropolitan and regional areas rather than city centres so that they would not be overrun while the next 50 centres were being rolled out. I, in fact, looked at whether I should go to areas that are usually held by the Labor Party-like Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide. The department gave me advice that, if I were to put those centres in the established capitals, they would be overrun and that it was better to go to the regional and outer metropolitan areas that I have chosen. That was the basis upon which those decisions were taken. It is premature to make any judgments about the locations of the next 50 centres; they have not been announced. But those decisions will be taken by me on advice, taking into account the factors that I have outlined. I do not apologise whatsoever for establishing a committee to oversee the selection and performance criteria as well as standards. As I have said this publicly, I think some people think there is an industry in relation to these matters-a closed shopas to where you go for advice in relation to these matters. One of the things that I was desirous of looking at was how you might write selection criteria that would still effectively address the sorts of issues that we believe ought to be addressed in having the right people with the right skills involved in that task. I have to say that these were not issues that had been raised with me by the opposition. One of the points I would make in relation to consideration of this issue and who you talk to and on what basis you proceed is that, before the last election, this was an issue upon which the Labor Party had no policy, had made no statements and had no ideas. Now that we are implementing measures that we announced before the election, the Labor Party is saying, ‘Foul, foul, we're not involved in the process.' Part of this process, I have to say, involves the consideration of the law that would apply. It was here that I invited the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, of which the member for Gellibrand is a member, to deliberate. I have to say that, in relation to legislation involving committees of this parliament, it is a fairly rare event for that to happen. It certainly rarely happened when I was in opposition and Labor governments were introducing legislation. I have been involved in a process of ensuring in relation to this that members were involved in looking at the framework of law that we were going to implement - Any priority to be given to existing, estabIn relation to the particular matters that the member for Gellibrand has raised with me today, the people who were taking an interest in the rolling out of the family relationships centres were many of those that, because of their interest, I have asked to give me some adviceMs Roxon interjecting",114
193,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, they had not come to me",115
194,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! We do not need a debate across the table. Ms Roxon interjecting,115
195,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Gellibrand is warned!,115
196,Mr RUDDOCK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"and had not put any formal representations to me. All I am saying is that, in a situation in which there has been an absence of interest and policy by the Labor Party, a number of members on this side of the House expressed a view. Of course I invited the member for Deakin, the member for Moncrieff, the member for Wakefield, the member for Stirling, the member for Riverina, the member for Bass, the member for Lindsay and the member for Greenway to serve on this informal committee to look at the criteria that we are going to use. The honourable shadow minister has been commenting for some time on a range of issues that she thought ought to be taken into account in dealing with this particular policy implementation. In a press release on 1 August she said: Mr Ruddock still won't give answers on basic questions such as: - The requirements or qualifications for staff running centres - Whether centres will be purpose built with appropriate security and multiple entries - How he will ensure staff are appropriately skilled to screen for violence lished services - The absence of proper accreditation for vices The fact is that I have asked for these members to be involved in looking at criteria that are being developed by my department in relation to implementation. We see it as being very important that those factors are taken into account. The documentation is being developed. I have outlined that the time from which people will be asked to express interest in running the centres will be October. It would be premature of me to release in advance of the settlement of that documentation information about how these matters are going to be worked through. There are probity issues to be addressed in relation to those questions. There has been substantial consultation to date. There is a discussion paper on centres, from which we have received numbers of submissions. There are ongoing consultations by me with stakeholders. I had a number of visits recently to Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Darwin and Brisbane where I met with a large number of people. My department is involved in ongoing discussions with stakeholders, including strategic planning days. For these reasons there is a good deal of work and input being undertaken. I thought-and I do not apologise for it-that it was particularly important that members of the parliament who have had very wide experience and background be able to play a part in looking at these details and offering advice about where we can improve the way in which we will undertake the process. I should inform the House as well that the government is currently developing an accreditation system for dispute resolution practitioners. That is a task that is being undertaken through the Commonwealth and state vocational education and training system, known as VET. Under that system, the Community Services and Health Industry Skills Council has been authorised by the serAustralian National Training Authority Ministerial Council to develop national competencies in the health and community area. We have asked that this industry skills council help develop the competency based accreditation standards for family dispute resolution practitioners, family counsellors and workers in children's contact services. Once developed, these competencies will be the basis for training courses and also for the assessment of competencies. This accreditation system will be the minimum standard applying to staff in the relationships centres and other practitioners providing dispute resolution. It is important to recognise that we see the issue of standards for family relationships centres as being particularly important. Under the funding agreements, the centres themselves will be required to meet national performance standards and be subject to national guidelines and requirements. As a minimum they will need to meet current performance standards under the Family Relationships Services Program. These cover a wide range of topics, including leadership and innovation; strategy and planning processes; data, information and knowledge; people, including supervision, training, appraisal and staff safety; client focus processes; product services; organisational performance; and client safety. In addition, national standards beyond minimum standards will apply if the backbench committee believe, through their input, that we can implement these measures more effectively. Let me just say that I have a great deal of confidence in my colleagues. I do not like the inferences that have been drawn. I do not like the way in which the Labor Party seem to think that their modus operandi is something that is pursued by others. I have a great deal of confidence in my colleagues and I will be asking them to continue their engagement. I will be asking them to help oversee the way in which the program itself is implemented over time, and I look forward to the very helpful advice that I will receive from them.  torney-General is too modest! The modus operandi that he claims belongs to the Labor Party he should claim for himself, because it is unique to the coalition. There has never been such a backbench committee on the Labor side to determine such criteria or to select such centres. I think I come here with a degree of disappointment, because I would pay tribute to Kay Hull, the Chair of the former House Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, for the job she did, particularly with regard to the report Every picture tells a story. I pay tribute to other members and in particular my colleagues, Julia Irwin, the member for FowlerMrs Hull-Jennie George.  minded, the member for Throsby, Jennie George. Amidst much suspicion on both sides, we got a unanimous and very worthwhile report out of that committee. It was adopted by the government-not in total, but significantly adopted-and I am pleased to see that. But let me say this: I have been in this place long enough to know that, if you want to politicise family law, if you want to take cheap points on family law, you will see no progress. The Labor Party members signed up on that committee to a bipartisan approach. They have signed up on the latest report by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which sought to go through the legislation in a record short period of time-again, a good report and one that I believe will be adopted by the government. But let us look at what the Attorney has said. He said: ‘I've set up this high-powered, experienced, backbench committee.' As I said, I would not quibble with the member for Riverina being on it. She has earned her place on any forum. But, of the remainder, what do we find? The most experienced members of the House? The people who have spoken up most about family law? No, not at all. We have four members of the class of 2004 on the committee-new members. Ms Roxon-Even chairing the committee.  I am told. There is the member for Greenway-and I will come back to the member for Greenway-the member for Stirling, the member for Bass and of course that very special member, the member for Wakefield. I the apologise to Tony Abbott, the Leader of the House. I verballed him yesterday, and I am apologising, because I suggested that he was forcing the member for Wakefield to add a part to his dorothy dix. We know what dorothy dixes are. They are those questions that are prepared on the government side and that the chief whip hands out. And do you know what? The member for Wakefield, the significant member on family law, got question No. 7-and it ain't hard to read a dorothy dix. But this member who is championing family law, this member who is a whiz kid on all the guidelines that should apply to the location, could not read the dorothy dix. And he is the chair of the committee. Ms Roxon interjecting",115

Of course, there was a second part to it: ‘Are there any alternative policies?' And he forgot. What a mess he made. But of course the Leader of the House learned from his mistake. Today he was not going to trust them with a preamble about government policy. He gave Danna Vale the question that went straight into alternative policies. He was not going to fall for the same mistake.",117

Let us go to some of the criteria that the Attorney General announced for the first time. I said that the member for Greenway is on the committee. In Blacktown we have one of the highest rates of domestic violence. It ranks at No. 21, well ahead of the rate in Lindsaythe member for Lindsay has obviously verballed her on the committee and not allowed her to get that relationship centre in Blacktown. Mrs Markus interjecting tic violence, Louise, have a look at the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research information. Mr Cadman interjecting",118
199,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Mitchell!  tion to Chifley, for example, in terms of child support-the number of payers and the number of payees-we have one of the highest numbers of children in either category. But do we in Chifley get a look in for a relationship centre? When I was serving on this committee with Nicola Roxon-I am sorry; the shadow Attorney-General-and Duncan Kerr, the member for Denison, I said: ‘I bet you they announce a relationship centre in Lindsay.' This was before any announcement. And-bang!-there it was in Lindsay. In south-western Sydney, where we have a lot of need, there are several electorates. You could pick Parramatta, the capital of Western Sydney. You could pick Reid. You could pick Fowler. You could pick Prospect. Or you could pick Macarthur. Have a guess which one is going to get it? Macarthur will get it. Of course it will, because, of the 10 centres, eight of them went to coalition electorates, and all but two were of course marginal electorates. Marginality, the Attorney tells us, is not in there, but they just happened to go there, even though on the statistical basis on which he announced he had made his decision they do not stack up. Mr Gavan O'Connor interjecting process, an above-the-board process, but that is how the dice fall! So I predict that in Western Sydney we will see one in Macarthur. We will not see one in Prospect. We will not see one in Fowler. We will not see one in Reid. We will not see one in Blaxland or Parramatta. You will find that it will be in the seat of Macarthur. The plea I make is this. Every member on either side knows how difficult human relations are. They know how difficult family law is. They know how difficult child support is. We have an opportunity in this parliament to move forward together to make some genuine changes in a bipartisan and honest way, knowing that, no matter what we do, we will never get it perfect-we will never get it right-but we can make a significant difference to over a million children. I say to the Attorney-General: you and your predecessors have form in referring legislation to committees. Labor predecessors have also done this, which he denies. In fact, attorneys-general have traditionally referred legislation to committees. If you want a bipartisan approach, if you want a transparent and open approach, why is it that you have selected this backbench committee? Should anyone believe the Attorney in his claims? I ask: why are four of those members in the class of 2004? Four are from the class of 2004, and the person who is chairing the committee is someone who cannot even ask a dorothy dix question in this House. So why wouldn't we be concerned about the lack of bipartisanship? Why wouldn't we be concerned that these relationship centres will not go where the need is greatest? Tragically, the Attorney killed off the idea of tribunals. The relationship centres face some difficult challenges, not the least of which is making sure that people in rural and regional Australia have reasonable access to them. This is not an issue we should be playing politics with. If I were to talk to Catholic Welfare Australia, the single parents association, Dads in Distress, Parents Without Partners, the Family Law Reform Association or any of those groups, they would be so disappointed that the relationship centres, the nerstone of the report, have been sidetracked into a slimy coalition backbench committee which has in its membership four of the most junior parliamentarians in the parliament and a person chairing it who cannot even ask a dorothy dix question. (Time expired)  tion No. 7. Leave not granted.",118
200,Mrs HULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We can certainly assert in this House that families in Australia have never had a better friend than the Howard-Vaile coalition government. Aside from family tax benefits, tax cuts, child-care rebates and a host of other financial measures, this government has now moved to restore fairness and equity in the family law system. This has long been overdue. The system was put in place by Labor, who have consistently failed the children of Australia and will continue to fail the children if it is up to the member for Gellibrand. Assertions of conflict have been made here today by the shadow Attorney-General, the member for Gellibrand, and they are absolutely scurrilous. She knows the truth. The member for Gellibrand was literally advised of the truth today at an open press conference. She knows the truth, yet she came into this House and made assertions that she knew were false. Through her dissenting report, the shadow Attorney-General has used this opportunity to make a difference in the lives of Australian children after parental separation and breakdown to hit out politically at proposals for industrial relations reform. Is it any wonder that we are concerned as to whether the shadow Attorney-General, the member for Gellibrand, has her own agenda to frustrate any reform that might take place in family law that would benefit the children of Australian people? Even her own party supcor- ported the reforms that would benefit these families and, more particularly, our children, the children of broken relationships. As I said, the shadow Attorney-General, the member for Gellibrand, is absolutely aware of her misreading of the letter from the Attorney-General. I told her, as a part of that advisory committee, that it was not my role to determine where these family relationship centres were going to be placed. But, no; she would not believe that. She then came into this House and made assertions, scurrilous accusations and personal attacks on the members of this advisory committee, who are there purely and objectively to ensure that everything is taken into consideration when we determine how family relationship centres are to function in the future, for and on behalf of the children of Australia and the parents of the children of Australia, and how these centres will assist parents to have meaningful, strong and equitable relationships with their children. What the shadow Attorney-General has done here today is cleverly manipulate words. The shadow Attorney-General, the member for Gellibrand, is putting her own political interests first by making such false allegations and assertions in this House. And then she turns around and says, ‘I hope the Attorney-General will see the error of his ways and decide to retreat from the pathway of getting this advisory committee to do the site selection,' when she knows very well that the Attorney-General had no intention of having this advisory committee make site selections. How will we read this? What might happen? Maybe the shadow Attorney-General, the member for Gellibrand, will go out and say: ‘Well, here it is. I asked the Attorney General to retract from getting this advisory group to determine the sites for these centres and, look, he has actually gone and done it.' Do you know why he is not letting this advisory committee determine where these centres will be? It is because he never had any intention of doing so, and the member for Gellibrand knew that he never, ever had any intention of doing so. Basically, I am really disappointed. I have a lot of time for the member for Chifley, Julia Irwin, Jennie George and Harry Quick.",119
201,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Riverina will refer to members by their seat.,120
202,Mrs HULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I apologise that I have used their names, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I enjoy their company. They have been absolutely wonderful in determining how the best interests of Australian children can be seen to after parental separation. So I am disappointed that members have focused on personal criticisms of an advisory group rather than on the fabulous objectives of family relationship centres and delivering the very good outcomes that our Labor colleagues have worked very hard in cooperation with us to achieve. The outcomes and objectives of family relationship centres are very meaningful and strong, and I think they deserve recognition. From family relationship centres, you can get pre-marriage education to give your marriage a sound start-a very good basis on which to begin a family. If you are having a bit of a ‘scud' here and there, and you want to improve your relationship, you will be able to get education on family relationships and access other services that will help you strengthen your relationship. These are really sound objectives for families. This clearly dispels any notion that this government is letting families down. If you are having a relationship difficulty that is bordering on ‘really difficult', you can get information and access services to help prevent a separation. That is what we want to do. We want to give our mums and dads-the partners of Australia-the opportunity and the tools to solve their issues so that actions that impact on the children of Australia can be minimised. For separated parents, everything is very rocky, emotions run high and you have no idea of your rights and roles. You do not want to go through the legal system because it sometimes gives very skewed outcomes. With common sense, people can generally resolve their own issues. If you are a separated parent you can go to a family relationship centre and get help to resolve your dispute and reach an agreement on your parenting arrangements. You can sit down and cooperatively work out how you will jointly parent your children in separate households. You may not be partners for life, but you are parents for life. These centres will be able to give you quality information and advice on dispute resolution as well as help you to access other services that you might need to assist you in achieving a very admirable goal. If your parenting arrangements break down after you have been through the process, and your court orders are breached, the centre will be your first port of call to help you fix the problem outside the courts. In the courts, it can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. That is what we heard during our inquiry and it is in our report Every picture tells a story. Grandparents and their grandchildren are affected by family separation. Family relationship centres can give you good advice on how you can manage the process so that you and your grandchildren can have a meaningful, warm, tender and loving relationship. It has disturbed me that, rather than highlighting the positive objectives of the family relationship centres, an advisory group which has been willing to collect information and provide it to other bodies to enable these objectives to be reached has been criticised here today.

228,Ms BIRD,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to take the opportunity to mark the fact that this is the closest sitting day to Sunday, which will mark the 62nd anniversary of the election of a woman to this parliament. To quote from the speech at the time: It would be strange indeed were I not tonight deeply conscious of the fact, if not a little awed by the knowledge, that on my shoulders rests a great weight of responsibility; because this is the first occasion upon which a woman has addressed this house. These are the words of the first woman elected to the House of Representatives, on 21 August 1943-as I said, marked by 62 years on Sunday. In 1943, Enid Lyons was elected to this parliament to represent the Tasmanian seat of Darwin, renamed Braddon in 1955. The day of 21 August, 62 years ago this Sunday, was the very first occasion on which a woman had addressed this House. As Dame Enid Lyons herself acknowledged in her maiden speech-as they were then-on 29 September, it was for that reason that it was an occasion which for every woman in the Commonwealth marked a turning point in our history. In 1949, Dame Enid Lyons became the first woman in federal cabinet when she was 2005 appointed vice-president of the executive council under Prime Minister Menzies. Until 1966 she was the only woman to be ap2005 pointed to Commonwealth ministerial rank. Dame Enid was elected four years after the death of her husband ‘Honest Joe' Lyons, who died in 1939 while serving as Prime Minister. Enid stood for the seat of Darwin despite her husband's advice that people ‘wouldn't vote for a woman for ages yet'. Prior to entering our parliament, Dame Enid was a schoolteacher-something that is close to my heart. Her concern with political issues such as women's rights, the elimination of discrimination in employment, improvement in maternity care and the widow pension led her to give her first political speech in 1920. The wife of a Prime Minister and the mother of 12 children, Dame Enid Lyons was firm on her political beliefs. I quote another brief extract from her words: Well, I've spent most of my public life, trying to arouse women to a sense of their own value, not merely as housewives, but as citizens you see. In 1902 Australia became the first country in the world where most women had the right both to vote and to stand for the national parliament. Women had gained the right to vote for parliament in New Zealand in 1893 but were not able to stand as candidates until after the First World War. Although Australian women gained these political rights very early, we did not succeed in entering federal parliament until four decades later. Also in 1943, Dorothy Tangney was the first woman to be elected to the Australian Senate, representing the state of Western Australia. Dorothy Tangney was one of the few women successful in securing election in the Senate under the reform system of election, the system fought for by Catherine Helen Spence. Both Dame Enid Lyons and Dorothy Tangney broke the barriers of custom and prejudice against women, Enid insisting that she stood as a citizen and a woman. Anyone who thinks the fight is over should take a look at our current parliament. The number of women elected to the parliament has settled for the moment at just above one-quarter of all parliamentarians. It has been that way for about a decade now. Since 1996, the ALP has increased its female representation in the House from 8.2 per cent to 33.3 per cent. The government has experienced a slight decrease, from 22.4 per cent to 20 per cent. On issues such as the active involvement of women in civic life in this country, including in this House, it is important to always take the opportunity to remember those that blazed the way before us, as both these women of different political persuasions did, to take the opportunity to remember the efforts that they made on behalf of all of us and to acknowledge their service to this nation. Victory in the Pacific Day: Mr Fred",124
229,Mrs HULL,ADJOURNMENT,"On Monday we remembered 60 years since victory in the Pacific. At a service in Wagga Wagga, I met a man who was a prisoner of war and worked on the Burma railway. His name is Fred Wilson. He is 94 years old. Every year at the service for this event, Fred reads out a poem. I would like to take the opportunity to put the poem into Hansard. Fred Wilson deserves to have his efforts and his thoughts on the things that he feels so strongly about read into the House of Representatives record for him to be proud of. The poem, which was penned by another, is called Mates. It says: I've travelled down some lonely roads Both crooked tracks and straight And I've learned life's noblest creed Summed up in one word, Mate not just I'm thinkin' back across the years (A thing I do of late) And one thing sticks between me ears, You've gotta ‘ave a mate. Someone who'll take you as you are Regardless of yer state And stand as firm as Ayres Rock, Because ‘es yer mate. Me mind goes back to ‘43 To misery and hate When a man's one chance to stay alive Depended on ‘is mate. With bamboo for a billy can And bamboo for a plate, A bamboo paradise for lice and bugs Was a bed for me and me mate. We'd slide and slither thru the mud And curse our rotten fate But then you'd hear a quiet word ‘Don't drop your bundle Mate' And though it's all so long ago Wilson These words I have to state A man don't know what ‘lonely' means Until ‘es ‘lost' ‘is mate. If there's a life to follow this If there's a golden gate, The welcome that I want to hear is Just ‘good onya mate'. To all of you who ask us why We hold these special dates, Like ‘ANZAC Day' I answer ‘Why! We're thinkin' of our mates' And when I've left me drivers seat, And handed in me plates I'll tell ole Peter at the door I've come to join me mates. The reason I have read this poem out is that Fred Wilson is 94 years old. He reads this poem with passion from the bottom of his heart at every memorial service. And he sheds tears every time he reads the poem. In all the 60 years following victory in the Pacific, this man and other fine men and women share the same camaraderie and the same feeling of longing to have a mate. The poem is now in Hansard for Fred's family to remember for the rest of his life and the rest of their lives. Being 94 years Fred's life is not going to last for much longer. But the family takes great pride in attending the services, presenting their floral tributes and being thankful for the survival of a father who has provided for them an opportunity to have a wonderful life in Australia. It is with great thanks that I applaud you for enabling me to put into words this poem, which, as I said, has been read every year by Mr Fred Wilson, 94 years of age, at a memorial service in which he dedicates his thoughts, his memories and his concerns and his gratitude for the people he called ‘mate' when he was in some of the worse conditions that one could ever imagine. I thank the House for enabling me to read this poem today. Church Funding",125
230,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"It is a pleasure to follow the member for Riverina. I hope that the report we heard in the House about parliamentary attendants being directed against using that great Aussie expression ‘mate' turns out to be without foundation. I am concerned that the Howard government is blurring what need to be clear lines between church and state and using taxpayers' funds to reward churches that promote views it approves of and, by neglect, punish churches that express views it does not approve of. At the end of March the Howard government approved a $40,000 Regional Partnerships grant for a church called the Living Word Church at Thangool. I understand Thangool has a small population of 300 or 400, is situated 10 kilometres from Biloela, in the heart of the Banana Shire in Central Queensland, and is reached via Rockhampton or Gladstone. The Regional Partnerships program, widely known as ‘regional rorts' on account of its abuse by the National Party in old, projects such as A2 Milk, Beaudesert Rail and Tumbi Creek, has given $39,925 to the Living Word to develop a recently purchased store into a church. There are many churches all across Australia that over the years have purchased buildings and turned them into church buildings. But I do not believe they have received or expected support from the federal government to do so. They have built up their churches by dint of hard work from the church members themselves. My second concern is that the Living Word Church is seriously of the religious right. The Living Word Church is part of Jim Kaseman Ministries, also known as the Association of Faith Churches and Ministries. It is part of the Word of Life theology, which preaches a doctrine often referred to as prosperity theology. Prosperity theology contains radically right-wing views, both theologically and politically. Prosperity theology places great stress on spiritual warfare, for example the pain-of-birth prayer. It involves totally uninhibited screaming by the praying person. The leader of prosperity theology in Scandinavia, Mr Ulf Ekman from Sweden, says of this kind of prayer: ... when the Holy Spirit encumbers upon man something that is experienced as physical pain; as when a woman gives birth ... we are rolling about on the floor, screaming in anxiety, squealing like a pig being slaughtered. This is an immensely strong intercession, and the devil detests it. He shouts to us that we are crazy and fanatics. Not only is prosperity theology to the far right in a religious sense; it is also far to political right. Mr Ekman says it is his aim to break: ... the socialist spiritual power which governs, dominates, infiltrates, controls, manipulates catches people in Sweden. Mr Ekman is in favour of a strong military defence and wants officers who, led by the Holy Spirit, become ‘more militant than ever'. My third concern is what checks were conducted into the operations of the Living Word Church in Australia before this grant was approved. It has been alleged that many former members of the Word of Life Church overseas are subject to depression, are suicidal and are hospitalised in psychiatric institutions to a greater degree than average. It is claimed that there is substantial evidence of suicide among members of the Word of Life who had no previous psychiatric record. What checks has the government carried out to ensure that it has not handed over money to a religious cult? To point out the obvious: we do not want or need such an outcome in Australia. It is my view that government funding of churches and religious organisations violates one of the basics of our society-the separation of church and state. It is one thing to fund religious organisations to do work on behalf of the government and community, for example funding the Brotherhood of St Laurence or the Salvation Army to do charitable works among the poor, or to fund education services provided by religious organisations, but it is another thing altogether to fund a church to do its own works-and that is what is proposed here. In my view it is no coincidence that there are no Islamic mosques, Buddhist temples or Jewish synagogues funded by Regional Partnerships. For that matter there is no Uniting Church or Catholic funding either. The better the thing would be for governments to enforce a clear distinction between church and state. That is one of the foundations of this country. It arose from the painful lessons of reliand gious wars in Britain, the source of our legal system, when Protestants and Catholics variously sought to use the state to enforce their religious convictions on others. This is no mere historical matter. We live in the age of terrorism, where religious extremists seek to foment religious war. We cannot accept in this country notions of divided loyalty between Australian law and Islamic or sharia law. But we will not have the moral authority necessary to make this essential point unless we observe a clear distinction between church and state, a distinction that this Regional Partnerships grant blurs inappropriately. (Time expired) London Terrorist Attacks National Security",126
231,Mr WOOD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise initially to talk about the London terrorist attacks that occurred on 7 July 2005. Tragically, 52 people perished after four blasts on public transport. Those who died were from mixed religions and races, including Shahara Islam, a 20-year-old English woman who was killed while catching the number 30 bus. She was born to Bangladeshi parents and lived a typical English life, but she was also committed on Fridays to go to prayers at her local mosque. Tragically, an Australian also died: 28-year-old Sam Ly, who was also on the number 30 bus. A number of alleged offenders have been arrested. Two weeks after the first attack on 7 July there was an additional attack on 21 July, where four more bombs that were meant to go off did not go off, luckily for those on public transport. Today I wish to address the gaps that I see in national counter-terrorism. Even though it does not directly relate to what happened in London, the issue is terrorists trying to use apparently legitimate methods to avoid detection. For example, on September 11 they trained as pilots before killing 4,500 people after hijacking the planes. In Saudi Arabia, they were trained as security guards and subsequently kidnapped and executed the international contractors who they were paid to protect. In Jordan in 2004, in probably the luckiest case of a terrorist attack being vented, al-Qaeda purchased 20 tonnes of chemicals and explosives with false identification. They loaded these on three vehicles, again purchased with false identificationmy argument for having an identification card. They used this method of purchasing chemicals to commit an attack. If they had gone ahead, they would have killed over 100,000 people. In the bombings in Bali and the Australian Embassy in Jakarta they again purchased ammonium nitrate fertiliser and potassium chloride. The approach by the Howard government-and I also acknowledge the great work, through COAG, of the state governments-is to focus on intelligence through ASIO. We have introduced aviation security identification cards, maritime identification cards and ammonium nitrate fertiliser identification cards-ammonium nitrate fertiliser is the weapon of choice for terrorists. There is a major problem with this. At the very high level of intelligence, which is so vitally important, the Howard government has invested $500 million, but the state law enforcement databases do not talk to each other. For example, a missing person could be reported as missing in one state and located in the second, but if checked on the police database there would be no direct match. More concerning, though, is that in this nation there is not one police database for records of those who hold licences to possess explosives. As I said before, terrorists are trying to find apparently legitimate ways of getting their hands on products to commit attacks. I immediately call on all the state premiers to ensure that their police and law enforcement agencies have at the tips of their fingers the necessary resources to find out who has these licences to possess explosives. Finally, with the aviation identification cards coming on board-which have been pre- issued to baggage handlers-the maritime identification cards and the ammonium nitrate identification cards, I urgently request that they have fingerprints included so that we can ensure that these people are identified. For a national database, I highly recommend that we use CrimTrac, a national law enforcement database, which already captures DNA and can capture sex offenders. This is the perfect tool to capture people with these licences so that law enforcement agencies know directly who has what licence. In the future, they may be able to prevent a terrorist attack. This is vitally important for this country's security. At the same time, those investigators can identify patterns of behaviour. (Time expired) Telstra",127
232,Mr RIPOLL,ADJOURNMENT,"This afternoon I want to talk about the issue that has dominated national affairs this week: the full sale of Telstra. This week, after nine long years, the Prime Minister's long-held ambition to sell off Telstra has been achieved. The government's decision with the support of the National Party-the Liberals in moleskins-will mean a reduction in basic telecommunications services for many Australians. It is not the sale of a century; it is the sell-out of a century. It is a bad joke and the joke is on ordinary Australians, but the majority of Australians are not laughing. Polls this week show that 70 per cent of Australians are opposed to the sale of Telstra. In Queensland, that figure is closer to 80 per cent. In rural Queensland, I suggest that it is about 95 per cent. Most people are opposed simply because they know that it will mean a reduction in their telecommunications service. The Prime Minister's announcement to set aside only $1.1 billion for the roll-out of broadband services for country Australia and the creation of a $2 billion trust fund is the worse part of this whole joke. There is nothing in this plan for people either living in the suburbs or in the city. As most people living in the cities and suburbs will attest, their vice is no better than their country cousins'. All the government has done is create another slush fund for the National Party-like Australia needs another unaccountable, nontransparent, National Party administered booty bag. This makes the whiteboard affair look like a morning tea with a coin donation. Australians want to see the delivery of decent telecommunications services for everybody, regardless of whether they are in the bush, city or suburbs. The big losers out of the sale of Telstra will be the residents in suburbs in my electorate, places like Forest Lake, Springfield, Collingwood Park, Seventeen Mile Rocks and Sinnamon Park that already struggle to get decent access to broadband services-the simple stuff that everyone should get in this country. Once Telstra is sold, residents living in these areas will have no chance of getting these services because all decisions by Telstra will be made on a commercial basis. The bottom line is that the mighty dollar counts, rather than what is in the best interests of ordinary Australians. That goes for everybody, not just people in my electorate. It is disgraceful that the Liberal and National parties are prepared to sell off Telstra, removing the last possibility of improving services to suburbs in Oxley and the rest of Australia. We are keeping pressure on this 800-pound gorilla called Telstra to be accountable to all Australians who deserve good, basic and simple 21st century telecommunications technology. The central character in the dramatic events which have unfolded this week has been the National Party senator, Barnaby Joyce. ‘Barnstorming Barnaby' has become ‘Backdown Barnaby'. The long-term national interests of this country have been jettisoned for the short-term gain of the National Party. The interests of country people have been betrayed and they know it. They serhave been betrayed on the cheap-dirty deals done dirt cheap for bugger all.",128
233,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member will withdraw that remark.,129
234,Mr RIPOLL,ADJOURNMENT,"I withdraw it. In parliament this week, Labor asked the government to guarantee parity of services for country people when Telstra is sold. They would not give a guarantee, because they cannot and they will not. They are so out of touch that they do not understand that effective communications are the key to successful bush businesses and for many families to stay in contact. That goes for businesses right across Australia, whether in the bush, city or suburbs. Whilst they have been squabbling over the price of the sale-that is all that it came down to: haggling over price-mobile phone lines have been dropping out all over Australia. I say to the government: do not sell Telstra; just fix it. The National Party went to the election saying that they opposed the sale of Telstra. Now they have rolled over. We do not need another slush fund for the National Party to rort. Now that Telstra will be privatised, its focus will be on profits first, service second. This out-of-touch government refuses to put people in the country or the outer suburbs ahead of profits. The only way to ensure proper services for Australia is to keep Telstra in public hands. Backdown Barnaby has not said yes to the full sale of Telstra yet, though. Australians must continue to put pressure on Barnaby to do the right thing, as he promised. I am urging all Australians to give Barnaby Joyce a call and tell him what they really think. His number is 0746 251 500. Give him a call. He claims no-one has been ringing, but I am sure the phones are running hot. Vietnam Veterans Day",129
235,Mr TICEHURST,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to take a moment on Vietnam Veterans Day to remember the 59,000 Australians who served during the Vietnam War and the 520 who died. I encourage all Australians to do the same. Vietnam Veterans Day on 18 August is a time to reflect on the service and sacrifice of the men and women who served in Vietnam and to reaffirm our commitment to the freedom and peace they fought for. Vietnam Veterans Day is a day we remember the 18 Australians who died at Long Tan and restate our gratitude for their sacrifice and the legacy of their courage. Our military involvement in Vietnam lasted more than 10 years, making it the longest in Australia's wartime history. However, for many Vietnam veterans and their families, the aftermath has been longer lasting and often difficult. The Vietnam War was unique in many ways. While all three services were involved and served with distinction, it was predominantly a hard and bitter ground war. From mid-1965 to late 1971, nine battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment served a total of 16 twelve-month tours of duty in Vietnam and an extensive array of support arms accompanied them. The level of Army involvement was reflected in the casualty figures. The Australian Army suffered 96 per cent of all the Australian casualties in Vietnam. The nature of their service in Vietnam meant Australian soldiers endured longer periods in contact or imminent risk of contact with the enemy than at any time since the Gallipoli campaign in 1915. In the battle of Long Tan, 108 Australian infantrymen of D-Company, 6th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment, encountered an enemy force of more than 2,500 in a rubber plantation north of Long Tan. Although clearly outnumbered, the Australians held firm against the enemy force through a remarkable display of courage and determination. The Australian government named its Long Tan bursary scheme in honour of the Australians who served and the 18 men who died in the Battle of Long Tan. The Long Tan bursary scheme recognises the need to assist Australian Vietnam veterans' children to make the sometimes difficult transition to post-secondary education. Applications for the bursary open on Vietnam Veterans Day, with 30 bursaries of $6,000 each available to help eligible students with the cost of their tertiary education. I encourage the children of Vietnam veterans who are planning to enrol in their first full year of tertiary education and who need financial help to apply. To conclude, it is so important that we ensure future generations of Australians will always remember such dedicated service in the face of adversity and respectfully pay tribute to the sacrifices of those who gave their lives in Vietnam. We must also honour those who came home and who still bear the deep scars of their service. I was involved in the call-up in 1965. Fortunately, I did not go to Vietnam, but many of my mates did. I remember visiting some of them in the hospital in Holsworthy after they were injured in the field. Some of these people have since passed on, but we owe a great deal to them. It is up to us and future generations to really remember their service. Vietnam Veterans Day",130
236,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to take this opportunity to speak on Vietnam Veterans Day and to join with honourable members who have also had this opportunity. The Prime Minister earlier today made a speech commemorating the day, and he was eloquently supported by my colleague the member for Cowan, who made what would be considered a very moving contribution about his direct experiences. I want to use this opportunity to speak about two institutions associated with my electorate. The first is the Diamond Valley Vietnam Veterans Association, which held a concert on Friday last. It was a band concert and the artists that played at that concert were the Australian Army Band Melbourne. I wish to congratulate Bob Elworthy, as the chair, and the committee of the Diamond Valley Vietnam vets not only for the concert and the occasion that they had on Friday but for their continuing support and the work they do for their comrades in arms, nam veterans. I think that this is a very important organisation. I know that other members are involved with organisations of a similar ilk. The camaraderie and mateship that people in these organisations display and the comfort that they give to each other and their families have been very important in the periods since the Vietnam conflict. Today, 39 years on from the Long Tan battle, it is important that we do have these reflections. I also wish to place on record my congratulations to the Australian Army Band Melbourne, which is located at Simpson Barracks, Macleod or Watsonia in the seat of Jagajaga, alongside my electorate. They are a very professional and very fine group of musicians and are a great credit to the Australian defence forces. As was indicated on Friday night, those who served in similar Australian Army bands throughout Australia at the time of the Vietnam conflict were on duty in Vietnam. Often they served as non-armed combatants. They did things such as stretcher duties and the like. The support that those people displayed in the conflict and the fact that they were very much part of Australia's efforts throughout the Vietnam years were placed on record on Friday night. Much has been said about the events of the last 40 or so years. The main thing is that we do come to agreement at this time about the way in which we should treat our veterans. No matter what our position is about their deployment, when they come back they should have our support. The Australian Army Band Melbourne has recently returned from its deployment in Iraq. I am sure that while there they served Australia in a fine fashion. I am very thankful to have had the opportunity to place on record to both the Diamond Valley Vietnam Veterans and the AAB Melbourne my complete congratulations and admiration for the way in which the Viet- they carry out their work.
