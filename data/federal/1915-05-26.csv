SHORTAGE OF SUGAR.",4
1,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"It is reported in Sydney that the Government have prevented the Colonial Sugar Refining Company from cabling an order for sugar to Java. I ask the Attorney-Gemeral, who haa been inquiring into the position of our sugar stocks, whether he knows thei statement to be true, and if he can give tihe House any information as to steps being taken to safeguard the public regard to th© sugar question ?",4
2,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It is not true that the Government have prevented Mr Knox, of the Colonial Sugar Refining Comhas pany, from cabling to Java. The circuminterference stances surrounding the censorship of cables may be shortly set out. Government, which is charged with the duty of insuring to the people of this country an adequate supply of food proportance, ducts, has been notified by this great bination that there is likely to be a shortto age of sugar in the near future. This twenty-four hours ? duty of safeguarding the interests of the people has to be performed at all times; but at this juncture an even more vitally important duty devolves upon the GovernAustralia. ment: that is, to prosecute the present struggle for our national existence every ounce of energy that we possess. The Governmenb are responsible for th© feeding of 15,000 soldiers, and for insuri ing supplies of the necessaries of life those engaged in manufacturing ammunition, and th© general impedimenta and necessities for carrying on the war. It imperative, therefore, that we should take every precaution to safeguard the community against a shortage of sugar. The Government have exercised tneir power to tak© such steps as are necestralia sary to insure th© availability of an adequate supply. It is not true that M Knox has been prevented from obtaining supplies of sugax from Java. His cableprecisely gram, like th© messages of every other commercial man relating to the supply of food products, was examined, in order that we might see that there was no tempt at manipulation of th© market or exploitation of the public at this i juncture.",5
3,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Is it a fact that Mr Knox's cable was censored, and did it contain material which it was necessary to censor? Will the Attorneyperiod-whic General tell the House plainly what it that he has done in connection with this matter, and in what way he has interso fered with Mr Knox's attempt to obtain more sugar for Australia?",5
4,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The cablegram to which reference is made in Mr Knox's communication to the press was, I undernothing stand, an acceptance of an offer of some 2,500 tons of sugar at 16s. 9d. a cwt. There is nothing in that cablegram to which exception could b© taJcen, nor was in exception taken to it .",5
5,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But it was delayed.,5
6,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The cablegram was held back for twenty-four hours. There been no delay other than that, and no with cablegrams relating to the supply of sugar, whether sent by Mr . The Knox or any other person.",5
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Are we to understand that a cablegram of this i m having reference to the food comsupplies of the people, is not considered be unduly delayed when held back for",5
8,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The Government ar© concerned with seeing that an adequate supply of sugar is made available in Mr Knox has stated that 11,000 tons of sugar had already been with bought. We are endeavouring to ascertain the circumstances under which that sugar was bought and the price paid for t , so that we may know that the nrice to asked for it by Mr Knox is a fair one for his company to charge.",5
9,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"In view of the is Attorney-General's statement, that it is th© duty of the Government to see that necessary commodities are supplied to the people, will lie assure the House and th© country that the requirements of Ausi n th© matter of sugar will be met ?",5
10,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The House has alr . ready been informed that inquiries ar© being conducted in order to ascertain the whole position in regard to sugar, and I hope to be able tomorrow to make a full statement regarding it . As to an assurance that the requirements atof the peopl© of Australia will be amply met, so far as the Government can insure t , that assurance has already been given.",5
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Has the At torney-General discovered anything in tb© cables which have been censored and delayed-in the one case for twenty-four hours, and in the other case for a longer h h© considers to be detriis mental to the public interest? Will he lay what information he has on the table, that we may see what the Colonial Sugar Company is doing to the in j u r y of the public interest in this time of war ?",5
12,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have already told the right honourable gentleman that I saw to take exception to in that cable; but it is the business of the Government to see that supplies are obtained, and it was in order to see that they are obtained that the cables were examined. It is not true to say that any cable was delayed more than twenty four hours. It is not true now to say that cables are being delayed twenty-four seconds.",5
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Does it take the Attorney-General twenty-four hours, with all the resources of the Government behind him, to be made aware of the contents of a cable message?",6
14,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"As the right honourable gentleman knows, the cables were received and despatched from Sydney, and had to come here. That was the cause of the delay. Since then arrangements have been made whereby they are telegraphed over. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. NA BROADMEADOWS CAMP : HOSPITA LAC COMMODATION : PARCELS DISTRIBUTIO N : CASUALTIES: ERRORS IN CABL ERE PORTS : NURSING OF INVALID S.",6
15,Mr BOYD,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"Can the Assistant Minister of Defence inform the House if it is possible for parents whose sons have been wounded at the front to ascertain where they are, so that they may get into cable communication with them ?",6
16,Mr JENSEN,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"Unfortunately , very many of our soldiers have been wounded, and as they are being distributed among a number of hospitals which are located at great distances from each other, it is difficult to ascertain immediately the whereabouts of any particular man. think that an answer that I have prepared to reply to a question which the honourable member for Barrier is to ask will give the honourable member the in formation that he desires.  intention of the Government to remove the camp from Broadmeadows, and, if so, will full consideration be given to other places that - are eminently suitable ?",6
17,Mr JENSEN,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"Yesterday the Minister sent Colonel Fetherston, Colonel Stanley, and Captain Murdoch to view Broadmeadows Camp, to inquire and report as to its suitability. The report of these officers has been received by the Minister, who has decided to have the camp removed to Seymour.",6
18,Mr IENTOJT,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,There will be just as much mud at Seymour as there is at Broadmeadows.,6
19,Mr JENSEN,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"We cannot please everybody. The Minister has already given instructions for the men and tents to be immediately removed; but lie desires it to be thoroughly understood that this is only a temporary step. During the absence of the recruits, it is intended, if possible, to remedy the defects at Broadmeadows. It is not intended to move the present wooden buildings, but, on the contrary, to continue erecting huts and making the conditions more suitable.",6
20,Mr KELLY,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"Is the Assistant Minister of Defence aware that the hospital huts that are being erected in Sydney for the care of the wounded and sick soldiers are being roofed ""with galvanized iron, which will practically render the buildings unfit for their purpose? Will the SOLDIERS : Assistant Minister take immediate steps to see that throughout Australia these temporary hospitals are roofed ""with ruberoid, or some other cool material ?",6
21,Mr JENSEN,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,I shall bring the question under the notice of the Minister of Defence.,6
22,Mr THOMAS,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"Fre e cable inquiries can, I understand, be sent by the Department in the case of dangerously and seriously wounded soldiers only, and not in respect of wounded or slightly wounded. What arrangement can relatives in the latter case make who desire to cable in quiries at their own expense? Can they cable to the O . C , Australian Base Depot - cabl e address, "" Stralis,"" Cairo-and I prepay reply? If so, what is the Tate per word ?",6
23,Mr JENSEN,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"T he honourable member was kind enough to inform me that he intended to ask this question, and the answer is as follows:Relatives of wounded or slightly wounded members of the Australian Imperial Force, to whom the free cable inquiries sent by the Department do not extend, who desire to cable at their own expense, arc recommended to address their messages to the mpinber concerned at Cairo. The address should contain the number, rank, name, and designation of Unit. It is important that the word "" Australian "" should appear in designation of Unit. Messages so addressed will be delivered to the Officer Commanding, Australian Base Dep6t, Cairo, who will be in a position to forward them on to the addressees. Australian casualties arc distributed over several hospitals in the Mediterranean and Egypt, as well as England, and it would not be possible' for any officer in Egypt, without much delay, to obtain information regarding wounded or slightly wounded men making satisfactory progress. It is not thought the hospitals can be asked to do more than report progress of dangerous or serious cases, is being done at present. Week-end cables may be sent at the rate lOjd. per word, but if the sender desires pay the reply, such must bo paid for at rates, viz., 3s. 5d. per word. The person receiving the prepaid cable may forward "" reply by the ordinary rate, deferred rate, or week-end rate, up to the amount deposited the reply. No charge is made by the cable companies for the three free inquiries which relatives dangerously or seriously wounded men are altrained nurses in attendance. lowed to make through the Defence Departvernment ment. Week-end telegrams from or to members of the Australian Imperial Force in Egypt are accepted at the rate of lOJd. per word, the usual minimum charge of ISs.",6
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"Are we to understand that ordinary cables during the week, sent by relatives or friends, must still be paid for at the f u l andi that the concession of 10£d. per that something would be done. word has reference to only week-end cables ?",7
25,Mr JENSEN,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"In the answer I just now gave there is the following: Week-end cablegrams from or to members the Australian Imperial Force in Egypt accepted at the rate of 10}d. per word, without the usual minimum charge of 18s. I think that is the most moderate scale in operation just now.",7
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"That has reference ing the one word "" We l l . "" only to week-end cables. There is further concession ?",7
27,Mr JENSEN,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"No ; but, as honorcited, able members know, in the case of a son dangerously wounded, a free cable may be sent.",7
28,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,But during the week the ordinary rates prevail?,7
29,Mr JENSEN,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,Yes .,7
30,Mr FENTON,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"Will the Defence partment make arrangements with the Railway Department of Victoria to carry tem. parcels of comforts, and so forth , to troops when the camp has been shifted to Seymour? Further, will the Minister kindly see that there is proper organizaservice. tion at the Seymour end for the distribution of such comforts to the men for whom they are intended, now that relafurnish tives will not be able to visit the camp ?",7
31,Mr JENSEN,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"As to the former part of the question, I shall bring it under the notice of the Minister; and, as suggestion contained in the latter part, I can assure the honourable member that it will be carried out.",7
32,Dr CARTYSALMON,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"In view of that the very satisfactory arrangements which as the Government have made for the tem. porary removal of the camp from Broadof meadows-owing , I believe, to criticism to proin this House-wha t provision is being ordinary made for those men who at present are his in the field hospitals at that place?",7
33,Mr JENSEN,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,I notified the House for last week that the Government were providing suitable buildings to which all of cases of sickness will be sent with proper The Goare now making final arrangements with regard thereto.,7
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"I should like without to ask the Assistant Minister of Defence vvhat steps have been taken to put the cable system at the other end on a better . footing so far as the reporting of casualties is concerned. Both he and the Prime l rate, Minister promised us last Wednesday To i l lustrate the seriousness of the position I should like to point out that I have received a telegram from Richmond, New South Wales, stating that on the l l t h instant a cablegram announcing the death of of Captain Willia m Bowman Douglas are was received by his wife, and that a memorial service was held on the 19th instant; but that yesterday Mrs Douglas received from her husband a cablegram dated "" Cairo, 21st May , "" and containThis date no has been confirmed. The whole district from which Captain Douglas comes is exaccording to the message I have perreceived, and the family are distracted. I believe there are a number of such cases, and I should like to know what steps the Government have taken to reorganize the service at the other end. This incident can only be the result of Derightdown carelessness, or something of the kind on the other side. There musfc be something wrong with the whole sysI instance this case so as to urge the the Minister still further to see if something cannot be done to bring about a reorganization at the other end of the",7
35,Mr JENSEN,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,I shall endeavour to the right honourable member with a full reply tomorrow.,7
36,Mr RODGERS,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"In putting to the Assistant Minister of Defence a question to the regarding the Broadmeadows Camp, I should like, as one who very early in the agitation raised the question of the unsuitableness of the site, and who had some hard things to say concerning it, to express my appreciation of the. prompt, action taken by the Government. has been intimated in regard to the matter of nursing at Broadmeadows and at the new camp that skilled nurses will be supplied at the base hospital. I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Defence whether some better provision will be made for nursing at the intermediate or clearing hospitals now erected. I spent the morning at Broadmeadows, and saw a young fellow who had had a sudden collapse, and was receiving, no doubt, very skilled medical attention; but in my judgment the nursing attention was not sufficient.",7
37,Mr SPEAKER,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,Order !,8
38,Mr RODGERS,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,Will the Minister confer with the medical officers with a view to securing the services of University medical students 'who are prepared to volunteer to attend to these intermediate cases?,8
39,Mr JENSEN,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,It is the intention of the Department that any soldier in camp reported to be suffering from any serious sickness shall be immediately removed from the camp to a properly equipped hospital.,8
40,Mr BRENNAN,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"Before moving the whole of the troops in training to the distant town of Seymour, wili the Assistant Minister of Defence consider the very generous offer made by Mr W. H . Croker, of Melbourne, to allow the Department the use of about 400 acres of land at Altona for the purpose of a temporary, or, if necessary, permanent camp ?",8
41,Mr JENSEN,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"The Minister of Defence has already considered that proposal, and it is his intention to take the course which I indicated to the House this afternoon.",8
42,Mr WATT,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"I would like to ask the Acting Minister of Defence if , before shifting the camp to Seymour, he will have an inspection made of what is known as the Police Paddock, at Dandenong, which, to my knowledge, is a very suitable place for that purpose. It is under the control of the State Government. Will the Minister make the inquiry, and see whether the camp should not be shifted to that locality in preference to Seymour, or whether an auxiliary camp could be established there ?",8
43,Mr JENSEN,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"The Department issued instructions to officers to go into the matter, and submit a report, and we are acting on that report. I dare say It that while I am speaking preparations are being made to shift the camp to Seymour. It is not desirable, therefore, to have any reconsideration of the decision arrived at. CHARGE AGAINST A SOLDIER.",8
44,Dr MALONEY,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"Has the attention of the Assistant Minister of Defence been drawn to an article in the Age this, morning it which ib is stated, in connection with the proceedings against a Corpora] Archibald, that the Magistratesfirst of all dismissed the case, and then, thinking to better conserve the interests, of the accused, brought him back and inflicted a fine upon him, thus proving him guilty of a charge of assaulting a woman ? Will the Assistant Minister make inquiries regarding this soldier, and see that he is not promoted over the heads of better men ? Mr .JENSEN - Inquiries will be made into the case referred to by the honourable member. CBE CONCESSIONS.",8
45,Mr THOMAS,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,Will the Assistant Minister of Defence state whether the cable companies have made any concessions as regards cable rates since the outbreak of the war?,8
46,Mr JENSEN,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,No charge is made by the cable companies for the inquiries which relatives of dangerously or seriously wounded soldiers are allowed to make through the Defence Department. That is the only concession. OLD-AGE PENSION APPLICATION. Mr MoWILLIAMS - Will the Attorney-General be good enough to table 1 all the jiapers relating to the application of Miss Fanny Mason for an old-age pension?,8
47,Mr HUGHES,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,I will do so. PRICE OF BUTTER.,8
48,Mr JH CATTS,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"Is the Minister of Trade and Customs aware, notwithstanding that the dairying districts in New South Wales have had a bountiful season"", and that no exports of butter from New South Wales have been allowed for some time, that the public of Sydney cannot get butter? Will the Minister use the machinery of his Department to find out where butter stocks are being held STL New South Wales, so that the public may. bave an opportunity of knowing, who isi cornering the market and trying to force butter prices up?",8
49,Mr TUDOR,MESSAGES TO WOUNDED,"Personall y I am not aware that any butter has been placed in cold storage, but I will endeavour to find out the position and let the House have the information, NA COASTAL VESSELS.",9
50,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WIRELE SS APPARATUSON,"Will the M i ister of Customs say whether he can comfore pelships trading on the coast of Ausof tralia to be fitted up with wireless ? he can, will he compel owners of the Oonah and the Rotornahana to have wiretically less installations placed upon them?",9
51,Mr TUDOR,WIRELE SS APPARATUSON,"We have no power to do that at present,, but we shall have when the NavigationB ill becomes law. We are waiting for a small amending Bill to go through the House, and hope then to bring it into operation early as possible. When we have power to deal with the matter, every company will be called upon to comply with terms of the Act . ITALY AND THE WAR.",9
52,Mr FISHER,WIRELE SS APPARATUSON,"I wish to announce the House that we have been officially advised' that It a l y has dteclared against Austria-Hungary, and that Geropportunity many has declared war against Italy . EARLY CLOSING OF HOTELS .",9
53,Mr FINLAYSON,WIRELE SS APPARATUSON,"May I ask you, Mr Speaker, a question-? I notice that at the present time a Bill is before Victorian Legislature to secure the from the report. closing of hotel bars at half-past 9. If that Bill becomes law, will you apply to the liquor bar upstairs, or will you take a referendum of the members of the House upon the subject?",9
54,Mr SPEAKER,WIRELE SS APPARATUSON,"May I point out to the honourable member that I am not here toanswer hypothetical questions. PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE. Report on the sewerage scheme for that. Flinders' Naval Base presented by RILEY. Motion (by Mr Riley ) , proposedTliat the document be printed.",9
55,Mr KELLY,WIRELE SS APPARATUSON,"I take this opportunity of asking the Chairman of this Committee whether, in the publication of these resports, it cannot be arranged for' the q.ues:tions as well, as the replies to be printed. It is very difficult to understand the evidence contained in a reply unless one understands the form in which, the question was put. I offer this suggestion to the honourable member. It will help honourable members considerably if it could be acted upon.",9
56,Mr JH CATTS,WIRELE SS APPARATUSON,"Some time ago, on the presentation of a report regarding n - sewerage at Yass-Canberra, I brought be the notice of the House the necessity including in the evidence copies of If drawings that were presented to the Committee, on the ground that it was pracimpossible for any honourable member to get a full grasp of the evidence without having available the tracings relating to it . The reproduction of such drawings is one of the simplest processes in the printing art, and there could be we no objection on the ground of expense. as This, I understand, is the time to raise the question. I should like to know, in connection with the report just presented, the whether any drawings which were presented to the Committee illustrative of the evidence given have been included. If I cannot get theinformation, perhaps to it would be better for me to move the postponement of the printing, so war that honourable members may have an of looking at the document. If we do not take action now, it w i ll be too late afterwards to raise a complaint. I should' like to move that the printing of this paper be postponed until tomorrow, to enable honourable members to ascerthe tain whether there is any such omission",9
57,Mr SPEAKER,WIRELE SS APPARATUSON,"If honourable memi t bers desire an opportunity to see the report before it is printed, I would suggest that the adjournment of the debate be moved. Mr. JOSEPH ' COOK - The honourable member could achieve his object by asking leave to continue his speech at a later date.",9
58,Mr JH CATTS,WIRELE SS APPARATUSON,"Ver y well, I do Mr Leave granted; debate adjourned. HIGH PRICE OF MEAT. . DESTRUCTION OF RABBITS-.",9
59,Dr MALONEY,WIRELE SS APPARATUSON,In view of ' the in creasing dearness of meat; will the Prime Minister consider the advisableness of requesting the State Premiers to put a stop to the poisoning of rabbits while the price of meat foods continues to be so high ?,9
60,Mr FISHER,WIRELE SS APPARATUSON,"I shall have much pleasure in transmitting the honourable member's question to the Premiers of those States in which rabbits exist. NA SOLDIERS. OFFER OF GERMAN CLUB, SYDNEY.",10
61,Mr JH CATTS,HOSPITAL FOR WOUNDED,"Is the Assistant Minister of Defence aware that the German Club, Sydney, has been offered to, and accepted by, the military authorities as a military hospital ? Further, will the honourable gentleman, ascertain whether the offer of this splended building, in which wounded British soldiers may be efficiently attended to, has been made by German citizens as a protest against the methods being adopted by Germany in this war?",10
62,Mr JENSEN,HOSPITAL FOR WOUNDED,"I will obtain the facts for the honourable member, and acquaint him with them. KALGOORLIE-PORT AUGUSTA RAILWAY. CHARACTER OF EMPLOYEES.",10
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,HOSPITAL FOR WOUNDED,"Fro m a report in the press, I understand that some new rule has been laid down by which a man may not be employed on the Kalgoorlie Port Augusta railway unless he has received a certificate of discbarge of a satisway factory character from some former employer. I should like to know from the Minister of Home Affairs if this is true; and what is the distinction between this system and the ordinary system of blacklisting which has existed from time immemorial in connection with private employment ?",10
64,Mr ARCHIBALD,HOSPITAL FOR WOUNDED,"The rule applies particularly to the Traffic Branch, and not to the Construction Branch. There have been too many accidents upon the railway, and I believe that some of them are attributable to the fact that the men might have been more sober than they were when these mishaps occurred. In the early days of creating a railway and building up a new staff, the Commonwealth were obliged to get the services of men possessing railway experience; but as in many instances sucb men, who had been discharged from other Government services, have not turned out very satisfactorily, the desirability of employing men without clear tickets from their former railway employment has been a matter of serious consideration. It is not a matter of black-listing. I am not a teetotaller, but I intend to see that we have sober men employed on the railway, for then I feel that the accidents will be less. At any rate, I do not propose to issue to the other railway services the notice "" Rubbish may be shot here.""",10
65,Mr KELLY,HOSPITAL FOR WOUNDED,"In view of the reflections made by the Minister on the men employed on the transcontinental railway, will the honourable gentleman lay on the table of the House a list of the cases where accidents have occurred as the result of drunkenness on the part of the employees in his Department?",10
66,Mr ARCHIBALD,HOSPITAL FOR WOUNDED,"I have not reflected on the employees. My remarks apply to a portion of them only. I do not care to lay the papers on the table, as the honourable member wishes. I prefer that honourable members should see tbem in the Department, because, as a matter of fact, very often papers which are laid on the table of the Library become lost.",10
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,HOSPITAL FOR WOUNDED,"Does the Minister wish us to understand that certificates of discharge will only be required from men seeking to be engaged on the traffic side of the Department, and that this requirement does not relate to the employment of men generally on the railconstruction ? Because, if that is so. the position will be entirely satisfactory.",10
68,Mr ARCHIBALD,HOSPITAL FOR WOUNDED,"It will apply only to the Traffic Branch; and I think the House and the country will realise that such a regulation is desirable, in the interests of guaranteeing the protection of the travelling public and fellow workmen.  that if a man in the Traffic Branch of a State railway is discharged on account of drunkenness, be cannot get employment at navvying work in the Construction Branch of our railway service?",10
69,Mr ARCHIBALD,HOSPITAL FOR WOUNDED,"Certainl y not. There will be no objection to employing any such man in the Construction department: but, at the same time, he will be expected not to lose time through intemperate habits. NA INENEMY COUNTRIES.",10
70,Mr JH CATTS,BRITISH CAPITA L INVESTMENTS,"As information as to the amount of and manner in which British capital is invested in Germany, Austria, aud Turkey, may be of some consequence when the terms of settlement of the present war come to be considered, will the Minister of External Affairs cause inquiries to be made, and make the information available to honourable members?",11
71,Mr MAHON,BRITISH CAPITA L INVESTMENTS,"I am not aware of any machinery at the command of the Government that would enable us to obtain the information which the honourable member requires. I apprehend that an application to the Imperial Government might later on be successful, but at the present time there would be some difficulty in eliciting information. When the war is over, it will be a very pertinent inquiry to make, and I shall then be glad to give effect to the honourable member's suggestion. RABAUL COURTS MARTIAL .",11
72,Mr ANSTEY,BRITISH CAPITA L INVESTMENTS,"I ask the Attorney General whether, if there is any truth in the statement that Lieutenant Moore, who was lately before a court martial in Sydney, has had some punishment meted out to him, he will say what the extent of the punishment is, by whom it has been recommended, and by whom it has been imposed ? The newspapers say that he has been dismissed.",11
73,Mr HUGHES,BRITISH CAPITA L INVESTMENTS,"I have heard nothing of the matter. The papers bave not come before me. If the honourable member will supply me with particulars, I shall have inquiries made. NA",11
74,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In view of the recent change of Government in the State of Queensland, and the stimulating circumstances leading up to it , is the Prime Minister in a position to say when he is likely to submit questions to a referendum with a view to amending the Constitution?",11
75,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A p a r t altogether from - what has happened in Queensland, my wishes are that Bills to amend the Constitution shall go to the people early, and, if necessary, often. NA PAPERS .",11
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PRODUCTIO N OF OFFICIA L,"I should like to ask you, Mr Speaker, whether you heard the statement made by the Minister of Home Affairs a few moments ago, that papers laid upon the table of the L i b rary had disappeared from time to time? If so, will you, as custodian of the papers, take such steps as will prevent the possibility of a recurrence of such a thing ?",11
77,Mr SPEAKER,PRODUCTIO N OF OFFICIA L,"No such complaint has been brought uuder my notice, but I should like to explain to the House that neither I nor the officials take any responsibility for papers that are laid on the table of the Library. We have no means of knowing whether any file produced contains all the papers rliat it purports to contain, and. therefore we are not in a position to know whetlier any papers are missing or not. In order to prevent certain papers becoming public property a practice has grown up in this House of laying such papers on the table in the Library, so that they may be perused by members. Unless some officer is appointed to watch over those papers, and hand them out from time to time to members, we can have no control over them, and even then, we should not know whether any were removed from the file, unless we had someDody watching members while tliey were perusing them. I would suggest to honourable members that when they desire the production of certain papers the proper course is to make a motion to that eifect, and then a complete copy of the papers could be produced. When original papers are laid on the table of the Library tliere is always a danger of them going astray. It would, perhaps, be better for the Government to insist that they would only produce a copy of any particular papers BILLS. when those papers were asked for by a vote of the House. The production of duplicate papers on the mere request of a member might lead to a lot of work and expense in making a copy, the perusal of which might show to the in quiring member that there was nothing in the file to warrant the preparation of a duplicate.",11
78,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PRODUCTIO N OF OFFICIA L,How could the House know whether the papers were important or not without seeing them?,11
79,Mr SPEAKER,PRODUCTIO N OF OFFICIA L,"I take it that the proper course would be for a member to peruse the papers in the Department, and if he then thought it necessary that they should' be made public in the in terests of the community he could move for a return.",11
80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PRODUCTIO N OF OFFICIA L,"A Minister not always show the papers to a member, but he will always obey the House.",12
81,Mr SPEAKER,PRODUCTIO N OF OFFICIA L,"If a Minister refused to show a member papers be in quired for, that member would have an opportunity of making a complaint to the House.

"" "" For the money they receive, the workmen on the whole are not giving a fair return. This is strikingly true of the track-laying gang. The platelayers refuse to do a stroke of work aftor a mile of rails has been laid during a day, and as a mile is usually put down in from 54 to 04 hours, these men, when the distance has been accomplished, sit down and watch their fellows of the muck-work spin out the eight hours These men were offered a bonus on the length of track exceeding one mile laid in a day, but refused.

Extract 1 - The supervising engineer has full control over the men, and tlieir employment or dismissal is in his hands. The men aro required to work as well for the Department as they would for a contractor. Extract 2 - The number of men on the tracklayer has been fixed so that a mile may bo laid each day. When the tracklayer is working smoothly, it is not unusual for the men to finish their work before the eight hours have expired. When this occurs the men are paid for the full eight hours, although they may only have worked six or seven - hours. This is the common practice in plate laying, and has prevailed in Western Australian Government construction gangs for a number of years. Our men were offered an increased rate by the Supervising Engineer in the event of their laying a greater length, and there was some dispute as to the number of men required to carry out the requisite work; but these Extract 1. matters have now been adjusted.

Mr ZING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [4.16],-In discussing this subject previously, I ventured the assertion that the trouble with the British Army all along has been lack of ammunition, and that we ought to make the Lithgow factory run three shifts a day. It is a great mistake to work overtime, because to work men over eight hours destroys their capacity for work next day. I have never done much work myself; but good unionists have told me that to get efficiency a man must have good rest. The loafer ought never to have the loaves; but it is not loafing when a man takes sixteen hours to rest and enjoy himself. Eight hours is as long as an efficient man can work honestly; in fact, seven hours would be better.",15
119,Mr WEBSTER,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Six would be better still. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It would be if we could make more men work. The trouble is that we have no legitimate business organization. If we had our workers, our industries, and our finances organized, our great public Departments systematized, aud our instruments of exchange and credit mobilized, nobody would be out of work. I heard today that an officer of the Defence Department actually censored a business man's telegram , for the purchase of materials to be distributed among the people. Just imagine an official in the Defence Department interfering with a telegram from a business corporation to its agents instructing them to purchase certain materials.",15
120,Mr RODGERS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Foodstuff s at that. Mr ZING O'MALLEY - Accordin g to the statement made here this afternoon the Defence authorities censored a telegram from Mr Znox to his agents in Java directing them to purchase sugar. Ever since the American War I have held the opinion that the gentleman in khaki would boss the nation whenever he got on horseback. I remember when the military authorities used either to shoot a Johnny rebel or send him to gaol for three or four months.,16
121,Mr FISHER,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I suppose they did not give him a trial until after they had shot him % Mr ZING O'MALLEY - They took him away from his family, consigned him to gaol, and kept him there. If they had shot him there might have been some sense in their action. I say that nobody should be vested with such extraordinary powers. I intend presently to quote from a British Conservative journal-the National Beview-wit h a view to showing that both Britain and Russia are suffering from a shortage of munitions of war. Until recently, even France was short of ammunition. It was the big combinations of capital in England, France, Germany, Belgium, and Russia which, in 1886, established the great ammunition factories of trie world. They invited the Yankees to join them in the venture, but the latter will have nothing to do with any enterprise which they themselves cannot control. These capitalistic combines built great ammunition factories in Germany, a few in Russia, a few in the north of France,-and one or two in Belgium. It was British capital which established the great factories that today are supplying Germany with munitions of war for the destruction of her enemies, such as shells, &c. I said the other day that the manager of our Small Arms Factory at Lithgow was relinquishing his position to take the management of a factory in the New England States, which has an order for 1,000,000 rifles. I find that I made a. mistake. That factory, I learn from American newspapers, has an order for the manufacture of 3,000,000 rifles. I repeat that today the Allies are labouring under the disability of a shortage of ammunition. I am perfectly satisfied that it. is only a matter of time when the Teutonic nations will be defeated. But they will not be defeated quickly, becausebanking statistics show that in 1913 Germany had $4,200,000,000, or £800,000,000,. in the Savings Banks. I say that we should work our Small Arms Factory to its highest capacity. By so doing, we should provide employment for thousandsof our own people. If we have 33,000' men unemployed today-notwithstand ing the number who have already gone to the front-it is an evidence that something is rotten in our methods of organization.",16
122,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I tliink that we»i secured the services of the wrong man as manager of our Small Arms Factory. He is a Yankee, and wishes to return toYankee land. Mr ZING O'MALLEY - He is returning there because he is to receive three times his present salary, and is to be the head of an organization which isbacked by millions sterling. We cannot blame him for that. After all, duringthp few years that one is in this world, he naturally wishes to get as much as possible out of it.",16
123,Mr FISHER,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"What does the honourable member suggest? Mr ZING O'MALLEY - My suggestion is that the factory should be pufc under the control, not of a technical man,, but of an organizing business man likeMr MCC. Anderson. He would then pick his technical men and place them, over the heads of the untrained men. During my sojourn in Australia. I have learned that the Australian is very quick off the mark. He does not require much teaching. Nowadays, factories are divided into sections, and different sections are managed by different individuals. All the rough work is done by amateurs, and! the skilled men. are employed to do the finishing. At the Small Arms Factory one shift, say, the night shift-shoul d bo employed to do the ordinary work, and next day the skilled mechanics sbould come along andfinish their work. Mr ""WKBSTER - That system could not be adopted in the Small Arms Factory, because the whole of the machinery has to be kept going.",16

126,Mr KING OMALLEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"No . There is, for example, the work of getting the first parts of the rifles ready. The men who are trained should be placed over those who are not. A man has to serve some sort of apprenticeship to every trade.",17
127,Mr WEBSTER,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Not in order to become an insurance agent.,17
128,Mr KING OMALLEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"If he does not, he will surely starve. If a man has sufficient ability to become a success as an insurance agent he must be pretty clever. An inclividual who can make a fortune at l if e assurance can hold his own with any man who was ever born. In discussing the question of munitions - of war the National Beview saysMr Vollmer freely admitted that an embargo on the exportation of arms to the Allies was the great desideratum of German-Ameri«as, as "" it is not a comforting thought for us that American machine guns, rifles, and bullets should be killing in Europe thousands - of our own flesh and blood."" If Germany had an equal chance to import the' sinews of war from the United States we should not seek to deprive the Allies from getting them. That is just the point. The - chances are not equal. The situation, thanks to British command of the sea,, is unfair. Until It is equalized we believe the dictates of American sportsmanship and impartiality-qualities of which the Anglo-Saxon is accusiiomed to claim a monopoly-deman d that the Allies should be prohibited from enjoying advantages beyond the reach of Germany."" There have been many grim jokes in this war, but none eclipsing the frank demand of the friends - of Germany that in the name of "" sportsmanship "" theAmericans should step into nullify - Great Britain's ""unfair "" command of the sea. We might as well ask the Americans to step into stop the Germans? ""unfair"" command of the land in Belgium, Northern France', and Poland, where nameless, horrors are being perpetrated. However, this big hostile movement has been formedfor the purpose of Germanizing American policy backed by a vast well-organized vote under the following auspices:Honorary President: Herman Bidder (editor and proprietor of the New York Stoats Zeitung. President: Richard Bartholdt (the Germain mouth-piece in the House of Representatives). First Vice-President: Mr Thomas C. Hall (an Irish-American theologian, from County Armagh and "" Rooseveldt Exchange Professor "" elect at the University of Berlin, 1915-16). As a fog threatens toenvelop the relations between London and Washington, which powerful political interests are seeking to embroil, it is as well to place before the reader the text of various documents recently exchanged between the twoGovernments concerning measures to which we are driven as a belligerent. I have read in the press a statement by a good many persons that the Kaiser ought to be sent to St. Helena, where Napoleon was confined. I object to that, and I hope that if the Commonwealth Government have any say in the settlement they will persevere with the Allies and have the Kaiser sent eitlier to America or to Australia.",17
129,Mr LYNCH,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,What wouldyou do with him ?,17
130,Mr KING OMALLEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"We could get him into the Labour party and convert him. We would make a Christian of him and put him into this House; he would make a good. Labour man after he was converted, or we could send b i m to America.",17
131,Mr CHARLTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Kee p him in America. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Number s of Germans there would put the Kaiser in Congress, after a while. I think it was a great mistake to waste Napoleon's brains in St. Helena. He might have been employed in draftin g a great scheme for the amelioration of the workers. Never destroy the brain power of a man like that; utilize it . If the Kaiser were brought out here, millions of persons would pay their fares out. and stay at hotels for months, in order to have a look at the "" rooster,"" thus circulating money.",17
132,Mr CHARLTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Hunter). [4.33] I desire to draw attention to a matter of some importance to the coal trade. When the war commenced it was found necessary, in consequence of enemy war-ships being at large in the Pacific, to put certain restrictions on the export of coal which retarded the foreign output to a very largo extent. We all realise that when the nation is at war it is essential that every precaution should be taken, but in taking such precautionsi t means that very often a considerable sacrifice has to be made by some portion of the community, if not by the whole. In this case the miners in the Newcastle district did not demur, because they considered that the Government had acted wisely. B ut now that we have captured the whole of the enemy war vessels which were then in the Pacific, there does not appear to be any necessity for continuing the regulation which I have referred to. It is hardly fair for the Commonwealth to hamper the coal trade if no good purpose is going to be served thereby. The export of coal from New South Wales has decreased considerably; there is a very small tonnage going away, and, in consequence, the miners in the Newcastle and South Maitland districts are working very short time. The owners of the mines say that it is largely due to the fact that the Defence authorities continue the restrictions in regard to the export of coal. What I suggest is that Ministers should determine whether the Government, along with the A d miralty, could not take into consideration the advisability of removing the embargo, because it is of no use to punish ourselves if no purpose is to be served by such punishment. If the time of danger has gone by, and there are no enemy ships in the Pacific, why should we interfere with the coal trade so fa r as the Pacific is concerned ? I ask the Minister to give my suggestion earnest consideratitih, because we do not desire to have a large number of our men thrown out of employment unnecessarily. The position in my district at the present moment is very acute. In very many cases the men are receiving no pay at all, while in some cases they are getting two or three days' pay per fortnight. That has been going on for & long time. The miners have been very loyal, but tliey cannot long stand such a strain if there is no necessity for it . I invite those who have to deal with this question to give it very caref u l consideration, with the view to seeing if they cannot relax the regulation, and thus give the owners of the mines an opportunity to export their coal to different parts in the Pacific as they did prior to the war.  very pleased at being able to congratulate the Government upon their decision to temporarily remove the camp from Broadmeadows to Seymour. I am exceedingly glad to find that the representations made have had a certain effect. It is an important matter, because a large percentage of our young men who have gone into camp have developed complaints there which it is pretty certain would not have been developed but for this camp experience.",17
133,Mr HAMPSON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"What is the percentage?  the percentage is, but I know that it is large, and that, in consequence, some very fine young fellows have been buried who would have been in training now or on the high seas going to the front but for pneumonia, measles, and other ailments which broke out in the camp. I have not heard a word of complaint from any man who has enrolled as a soldier, but I have questioned one or two men and found that common-sense methods have not prevailed. While the men are in camp in our own land, we should do our best to see that they have a dry bed. It is all very well for some persons to say that we must make soldiers of the men and bring them down to service conditions. But it is simply courting disaster in my opinion to. ask men, wbo have been accustomed all their lives to wholesome sleeping accommodation, to sleep on the ground or on straw which has become damp. I asked one man, "" What is the position when one set of men leaves the camp and is sent across the water; are the new recruits put into that tent provided with new material and all that sort of t h in g ? "" And he said, "" No , by no means."" He made no complaint; I simply asked a question and that was the answer. When the occupants of the tents leave the camp, fresh men are enrolled and go into the tents practically as their predecessors had left them. That is not a proper condition of things, and is one which could be remedied at very little cost. These young men are the pink of our manhood, and it is too bad to endanger their health by subjecting them to ill-conditions which can be prevented. However, it has now been announced that the camp is to be moved to Seymour. I trust that it is to be placed on sandy soil, which will dry rapidly after rain. As is well known, the Broadmeadows soil is clayey, and, when rain falls, is quickly churned up into mud, the moisture being retained for a very long while. It is not to be assumed that because men are military officers they are, therefore, masters of all knowledge, and it seems to me that in the laying-out of a camp there is room for engineering skill. The tents should be so placed thab the drainage will run away from them, instead of into them. Our desire is that the men who enlist shall be sent to the fron t in the best of health, and, therefore, they should not be subjected to conditions under which they are liable to contract diseases which make them inefficient and prematurely old. Seymour should prove a capital location for the new encampment. I u many parts of the district sites can be obtained where the soil and situation will be everything that could be desired. What is happening in the Old Country in regard to Cabinet changes is wholly commendable. I do not know what has led up to these changes, but, seeing that the nation is called upon to defend itself against a strong enemy, it is well that the Executive power should be in the hands of a Cabinet representing every shade of political thought in the Empire. The honourable member for Maribyrnong has made a good suggestion - that both parties in this Parliament should meet in camera to discuss matters of military importance-but , to my mind, it would be a master stroke of policy were Ministers to so arrange matters that some of the members of the Opposition could be received into their counsels. Although the Labour party has a very large majority in both Chambers, the electors whom it represents do not largely exceed in number those who are represented by the Opposition members, and I feel satisfied that, wore the Prime M i nister to bring into his counsels some of the tried and trusted men who represent the minority in the Commonwealth, the result would be good. All sections of the community would then feel that national matters were being dealt with by a National Government, and that the highest intelligence of Parliament was being devoted to the solution of the difficult problems which confront us. What I suggest would involve Ministerial changes that might be painful to individual M i nisters; but the true expression of statesmanship is sacrifice, and there sliould be in the Government men who would' be willing to sacrifice their personal interests to enable the Cabinet to represent every shade of political thought in Australia. The ' CHAIRMAN - The honourable member is going rather wide of the Defence Estimates.  going a little beyond the subject-matter of the Defence Estimates, but I was following in the wake of the lionorable member for Maribyrnong, who made what I consider an excellent suggestion, although, in my opinion, he did not go far enough. Our Defence expenditure is very large, but I do not think that any person in the community would object to necessary expenditure on defence. I think, however, that the people are not-satisfied with the knowledge that the Small Arms and Ammunition Factory is not working at high pressure. I join with the honourable member who has just resumed his seat in saying that the time has arrived for working that factory under the highest pressure. If enough skilled men to provide three daily shifts are not available, men should be imported. We cannot afford to take any risks. I am an advocate of the employment of Australian labour wherever it can be obtained, but the fact that only one shift a day is being employed at Lithgow clearly indicates that the Government cannot find enough men for extra shifts, and therefore the factory is producing only about one-third* of the number of rifles that could be manufactured there. If there is a similar condition of things in other factories, it should be altered. Our men are willing to work energetically at jobs for which they have the skill, but I understand that at Lithgow the work is of a kind for which men of the necessary skill are not available, and I therefore recommend that skilled men should be brought here to make up additional shifts. There are, however, many men in Australia who have been employed at engineering tasks connected with the making and repairing of motor engines, who should be able to quickly adapt themselves to the work for which hands are required at Lithgow.  could be obtained at Lithgow.  Government has done its best to find the labour that it needs, and has failed to do so.",18
134,Mr WEST,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The men employed at the Lithgow works are working sixty-eight hours a week.  eight hours shift is long enough for any skilled worker. What is needed at L it h gow is an arrangement of three shifts. Then each set of men would commence firesh, and would be able to do his best during the whole time that he was employed. Every man wbo is employed in making saddlery, ammunition, rifles, and clothing is helping to fight the battles of the nation. He is not taking the same personal risk as the men at the front , but he is helping his country in the most effective way. I hope that the requisites of our soldiers will be manufactured at high pressure, and that all the Government factories will manufacture at their full capacity instead of producing only about one-third of tlieir possible output.  £4.53] - I have one or two matters which I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister very briefly. A subject to which reference has not yet been made, and which, to my mind, claims attention, is the possibility of preventing waste in regard to soldiers' clothing. I take it that any suggestion which might result in economy will be welcomed by the military authorities. At the present time, when senior cadets pass into the Citizen Defence Forces, their greatcoats, trousers, shirts, and so on, are cast aside. This clothing cannot any longer be worn, either when the men are serving in a military capacity, or when they are acting as private citizens, and it is therefore left to be eaten by moths. Similarly, a great deal of clothing is discarded which has been served out to men who have become unfit, and week by week, and month by month, many persons are declared unfit for some reason or another. From information I have received, I believe that thousands of pounds' worth of material are at present being eaten by moths. I make this statement for what it is worth, but I have it on the testimony of a number of Area Officers.",19
135,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"What material is this?  in greatcoats, trousers, puttees, undershirts, and so forth . I understand that when cadets pass into the Defence Forces they are provided with a new outfit, the old outfit being discarded; and my suggestion is that all this material at present going to waste should be utilized. At Broadmeadows, a little while ago, it was customary for boots that had got into a state of disrepair to be cast aside; but a suggestion by myself,, amongst others', that boot-menders should be employed has, I am glad to say, resulted in a saving of hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds-. I do not suggest that this clothing should be called in by the Defence Department and used for the soldiers; but we have a number of Red Cross Societies, and I have no doubt that the material would prove of infinite use at the present time. We know that now it is scarcely possible to purchase woollen underclothing, owing to the fact that most of it has been commandeered by the military authorities, and surely some method could be devised, by which such, garments could be called in by the Area Officers and used in some way. I should now like to learn from the Assistant Minister exactly what method is being adopted - in our camps in regard to promotions. Is there any method at all ?",20
136,Mr RODGERS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"And we ought to know how recent promotions affect those who, in the first place, went to the front.  another serious matter. At any rate, the present method, whatever it may be, seems a most unfair one. I do not in any way blame the Minister, or the Assistant Minister, but I think we are all of one mind in this-that there is something radically wrong. Two officers who called on me this morning declared that all they desire is equal opportunity for' promotion; and, I think, that is a very reasonable request. One captain, to whom I spoke yesterday, said that, had he been in the Oitizen Forces, he would have received his appointment as major before now, seeing that he has passed all the necessary examinations. As a matter of fact, other officers who have not passed the examinations have been promoted over his head; and his case is typical of a dozen that I am aware of.",20
137,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The honourable member is wrong, because there is no promotion without examination.  assure the Assistant Minister that I am correct in my facts; indeed, I intend, later, to give names to the honourable gentleman. There is a School of Instruction at the camp, and officers are supposed to attend there for six days as the concluding part of their examination. I am further informed that there was a number who volunteered on the understanding that they were to get promotion to the position of major; and there are two such cases that I know of myself. Whether these omcers got the guarantee before they went into the Forces or afterwards, it is a fact that when they got there they received promotion.",20
138,Mr JOHN THOMSON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Ha d officers seen service before?  had seen service before.,21
139,Mr MCGRATH,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I know a case where a man who had been in neither the Militia nor the Citizen Forces got his promotion.  no doubt that some of the cases of which we hear complaints are genuine, if that be not so in the great bulk of them; but there is only one genuine case, it ought be immediately inquired into. I do know of one case where a man was appointed captain, and later major, without passing an examination; and his name I shall cers give to the Minister later.",21

142,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The whole business promotion is in the hands of the Selecting Broadmeadows. Board. The Minister takes no part, so that he may not be charged with favouritism.  of that kind should not have a free hand, if it does not do the fair thing. There should be some way of insuring fair play and justice.",21
143,Mr WISE,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"No doubt the influence exercised is far worse than political fluence.  cal influence is not "" in it "" with the other influence that is exercised.",21
144,Mr MCGRATH,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"There are most reis markable rumours as to how some promoand tions are obtained.  no doubt about that. However, I know of the one distinct case I have mentioned, in which a man, who had passed his examinations, and would have received his promotion in the Citizen Forces, has been passed over for others who have not passed examinations. The other day, in answer to a question by the honthose orable member for Wimmera, the Assistant Minister said that a captain had brought from Queensland and placed in charge of a squadron here because n competent man for the position could not be found in Victoria. This seems a most extraordinary statement on the part of the Assistant Minister. The position given to this man was one for major, although he is only a captain, and yet he if was promoted over the heads of two Victo torian men who had passed all their examinations for the rank of major, and who are consequently his senior.",21
145,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Are not Victorian offitransferred to other States in a similar way?  should this particular transfer have been made? The case is typical of many and there is sufficient evidence to show that there is something radically wrong, either with the composition of the Board or - with its methods. Not a day get should be allowed to elapse before an inquiry is made. I should not be doing duty as a member of this House if II did not raise my voice in protest against the most unfair method now adopted. The only other matter I wish to mention is of that of the transfer of the Camp from We were told today that three officers had reported against the present camp, but I should like to know whether these, or any other three have taken any trouble to inquire into the suitability of places besides Seymour. Have they made quite sure that exactly the same set of circumstances will not arise at Seymour as at Broadmeadows? I do not desire to take a innarrow view of the question, but I know of a number of places in my electorate - far more suitable than Seymour.",21

I am not as familiar with the contour of Seymour the honourable member for Echuca, but do know something about it , and I a very grave suspicion that it will be found more suitable than the present camp. It would be a very serious matter if the Government went to all the expense of removing the camp, before a thorough inquiry as to the suitability of the site selected had been made.",21
147,Mr FOWLEK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Did not we have a port regarding Seymour, in which the place was condemned?",22
148,Mr FENTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"That was only a toy affair compared with this.  no prejudice against Seymour, but would like the Assistant Minister to say wliether the three officers who reported against Broadmeadows, or whether any three omcers, have taken the trouble inquire into the suitability of any other pldce.",22
149,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"They have only reported in favour of a temporary removal. may be for only a week or two. I cannot say.  they have satisfied themselves that what has occurred at Broadmeadows will occur at any new camp. If they have done that, and have made a thorough inpublications, vestigation, we will have to accept their judgment.",22
150,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The complaint is not only against the site at Broadmeadows. It is the administration-the method of runto ning the camp-that is bad, and will have to be radically altered.  already had something to say with regard to what is going on there, and I hope it will be rectified. There are quite number of matters that require to be put right, but it would be most serious if camp were removed to a place that is likely to have the same drawbacks that Broadmeadows has. I do not say this because my own electorate is affected, if a Committee of Inquiry had gone furrity ther up the line, they might have found vide several places where the ground is higher and eminently suitable for a camp. of Above all things ""a camp should not be placed on flat country. If there are able sites anywhere else, it should have been the du«,y of the Defence Departwho ment, which has charge of the lives and health of the men in camp, to have amined them. Nothing could militate as more against successful recruiting than I the fact that meu are asked to live in a have camp situated in unsuitable country. I not hope the suggestions I have made with regard to this, and the matters I referred to earlier, wherein many thousands of pounds might be saved, will be considered. Perhaps the Assistant Minister will say whether any suggestion has been made by which the Department could reutilize ail the clothing material which is now being eaten by moths. It is a pity that so much material should be going to waste in the manner it apparently is.  intend to occupy the House for more I than a few minutes, having already spoken, but I should like to bring before the notice of the Minister the question of the allowances that are made to nurses to going to the front. We know that ttie greatest auxiliary an army has is its ambulance corps and field hospitals. The efficiency of those hospitals has been It raised to a high standard by the splendid services of noble women who have gone to the front at the Empire's A splendid example was set to the nation by Florence Nightingale in the not year 1854. In the Crimean war, according to MCCarthy's History, and other up to the time that Florence Nightingale took charge of the field hospitals, something like 54 per cent, of the troops died from blood-poisoning. When she and her noble army of nurses arrived on the scene this mortality was reduced about 2 per cent. We desire, as far as possible, to encourage the women of this country capable of undertaking work to offer their services; but I find that nurses are placed on an entirely different footing from the soldiers. When a a soldier volunteers, he is provided with the necessary equipment and u n i for m ; the but when a nurse offers her services and takes the risks attendant upon the horrors of war, she has to provide herself with costumes, clothing, equipment, and even but surgical instruments. I have good authofor saying that nurses have to prothemselves also with other requisites, amounting altogether to a total between £ 4 0 and £ 5 0 . This appears to be offering a premium to the wealthy. suitOnly wealthy nurses can give their services under such conditions, and those have been seized by the idea of serving their country, if only possessing exlimited means, have been compelled to borrow money from their friends in order to provide the necessary outfit. the Minister should take this matter into consideration and see if these nurses not be provided with equipment when they volunteer for the front. Before I pass from this subject. I should like to to the heroic action of the three nurses who went to the front in Belgium. was very pleased to read the other day that the K i ng of the Belgians had predence sented each of them with the Leopold Cross. In the face of a withering fire, and at the risk of being killed, these women rescued several wounded Belgian eoldievs, attended to their requirements, and brought them into the safety zone, One of these ladies was an Australian named Miss Muriel Thompson, who, if arn not mistaken, I had the pleasure of meeting at Burwood some years ago. I think she is a relative of Sir P h i l Jones, one of our leading surgeons. how, a lady of that name happened to be . a nurse in Sydney. She went to the war, and, I believe, she has covered herself with glory. The point I wish to put ward is that it is just as important we should look after the nurses who to the front, offering themselves as sacristate fices to the nation, and often taking their lives into their hands,, as that we should look after our brave soldiers themselves, and practice? Another matter which I would like to bring before the notice of the Committee has reference to Federal Government House, Sydney. Some two years ago the State Government thought fit to cancel the lease of Government House to the are short of rifles. Commonwealth Goverument, with the resuit that the Governor General now regoing to the front? sides entirely in Melbourne, and that tliese beautiful buildings, situated in an ideal position overlooking Sydney Harbor, rifle clubs to the front and surrounded by a park, are idle. Government House would form an ideal spot for a convalescent home for returned soldiers, and I think this Government should move heaven and earth in order to bring some influence to bear on the State Government to permit the house to be used for some such purpose.",22

152,Mr FENTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"They have reported against Government House in Sydney.  place we can get, and I say that a house which was deemed worthy of being the residence of the King's representative Australia sbould be an eminently suitable I think spot for our returned soldiers,",23
153,Mr SAMPSON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"A big body of public canopinion is in favour of this in Sydney,  Assistant Minister that many Germans, refer naturally looked upon by us as our enemies, have offered their clubs for the I use of the returned soldiers, and I do not think that this big, beautiful, resicould be utilized for a better purpose than for the accommodation of convalescent troops. I hope the Minister will also take into consideration the desirability of instituting three shifts at the Small Arms Factory, so as to accelerate the manufacture of firearms at Lithgow. I was at Cowra, in my own electorate, in I connection with the Empire Day celebrations, and I received numerous complaints from the members of the rifle association l ip there that they could not get sufficient Anyrifles. One man assured me that thirty or forty young fellows in that district had gone to the fron t without ever having handled a rifle in their lives. They had forgone to fight the Germans, and before that leaving Australia did not know what it go was to handle a rifle. That is a nice of affairs. Why were they not put through a course of musketry? Why were they not allowed to go to a rifle range Simply because they had not any rifles. The statement was made to me by the secretary of that club, who should be in a position to know.",23
154,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,It is notoriously true that most of the big rifle clubs of this Stat©,23

I hope that the Minister will yet recede from the attitude that he has adopted on this question. I would remind him that the General who is to have supreme control of the Italian A r m y is of exceptionally small stature. leader of the army of our most recent ally has risen from the ranks to the highest position in the service, notwithstanding that he is a comparatively short man; and it is surely about time that we removed this embargo in respect of Australians who are below the present standard height. The regulation might have been all very well in the early days of the war, but I think the time has come when it should be amended in the direction I have indicated. Whilst I take this stand I do not doubt for a moment that, as the Minister says, we can fill the bill with men who are over 5 f t . 4 in . in height. But there are a number who ardently desire to fight side by side with their brothers in this campaign, yet are refused, permission because they have not been blessed with asufficient stature. I had a letter a few days ago from one of my constituents who described himself as the parent of a number of bantams, and who said that one of these was so anxious to go to the front that he was prepared to pay for his own kit-hi s own rifle and uniform-and to serve without pay. This is an illustration of the intense desire of many men to serve their country, but who are set aside as not being required at the present juncture. I hope that the embargo will soon be removed. I do not urge that we are in great need of the services of these men, but I feel that they should be allowed an opportunity to take part in the defence of the Empire. Throughout Australia today we are training thousands of cadets who will not reach the standard height now prescribed for meu for active service. We shall make them just as efficient for the defence of the country as taller men will be.",23

No doubt, a search would show that many of the ancestors of these bantams, as they are called, have been among the bravest defenders of the British. Empire.",24
160,Mr SAMPSON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,What are the reasons given against the employment of these smaller men ?,24
161,Mr FENTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Tw o exceptionally trumpery reasons have been given. One The is that the trenches are too deep for them. As against that contention, I would point out that there are many men now serving who are 6 f t . 6 in . in height, while there are thousands of others who are only 5 f t . 4 in . There is a far greater disparity in their case than tliere is between men of 5 f t . 4 in . and 5 f t . 2 in in height. How is that disparity met, so far as the trenches are concerned ?",24
162,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,But what is the average height?,24
163,Mr FENTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"There are a hundred and one things which a man may do at the fron t without entering the trenches . 1 The Japanese are more even in height than we are, but their average height is far below ours, and the position is the same in regard to the French A r m y. I think that the average height of the Italian A r m y will be found to be below oiir own, but the Italians will fight as valiantly and as well, as our big men who are over the regulation height. I . know of many young men-and so does the Minister-strong , sturdy, fine young fellows who are. prepared to fight, but who are not tall enough to secure enlistment.",24
164,Mr SAMPSON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Is there any instruction on the subject from the Imperial authorities ?,24
165,Mr FENTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The announcement that Lord Kitchener in raising his latest addition to the British A r m y intends to abolish the regulation height, and to enlist men of smaller stature, should bea sufficient guide for the Defence Department of Australia. In Lancashire, some three months after the outbreak of war, the standard had to be reduced, and later on it was reduced in the case of twenty or t h i r t y British regiments. On certain occasions our men will have to fight side by side with these British troops, so that the argument as to diffitheir culty in regard to the employment of small men in the trenches mustgo by the board. The further objection that a short man cannot keep step with a tall man is to my mind absurd. I am not suggesting that there is any shortage of men of the regulation height, but a few months after the outbreak of war there were 70,000 men in Great Britain wbo were debarred from enlisting because they were below the standard. That embargo bas now been removed in the Old Country, and we shall only be malting a belated effort to follow the British decision if we reduce the standard to 5 f t . 2 in. There has been a great outcry on the platform, in the press, as well as in this Parliament, regarding the Broadmeadows Camp, but from my knowledge of Seymour, and of quite a number of districts where camps have been held, I have no hesitation in saying that wherever there is a considerable pedestrian, horse, and vehicular traffic, there must inevitably be in winter time a good deal of mud. I do not know whether the Minister has received any complaint regarding the Liverpool Camp, but it is certainly on an area more flat than that of Broadmeadows. The troops there, no doubt, have to suffer greater disabilities than have been experienced at Broadmeadows, but we have heard no complaints in this House regarding the Liverpool Camp.  climate.",24
166,Mr FENTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I think not. The honourable member for Balaclava will support my statement that tliere is no more salubrious spot than the Broadmeadows heights.,25

168,Mr FENTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Althoug h only 10 miles from the city, Broadmeadows is 400 feet above the sea level. The climate in winter is somewhat severe, but with proper attention to drainage and the general lay-out of the camp, I do not think a better site could be found. My knowledge of Seymour leads me to believe that by removing the camp to that district we shall only repeat the dose. I question whether the military committee who have been investigating this matter are not as far astray in their decision as they have been in connection with many otlier matters relating to the preparation of our troops for active service.",25
169,Mr RODGERS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Has the honourable member, seen the new site?",25
170,Mr FENTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I may say in no boastful spirit that I know far more of the Seymour district than does the honourable member for Echuca, who commended the action of the Government in making this change. Whilst I tliink that we should endeavour to make our menas comfortable as possible while in camp here, I feel that, seeing that they are soon to take part in the. world's greatest war, we should not pamper them. We should conserve their health, and do everything possible to reduce sickness to a minimum, but wherever a large body of men are congregated the percentage of sickness must be considerable.

173,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,It is not correct.,25
174,Mr FENTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"If it is correct, I should say that the men will not be sent into the firing line u n t i l they have been trained in the use of the rifle.

176,Mr FENTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"That may be, but I agree with the view that there is no better recruiting ground than our rifle clubs for men who would serve our country well. Some of our greatest military experts have said, "" G i v e me an army of good rifle shots, and I am prepared to go almost anywhere with it . "" One reason why that noble littl e people, as I suppose' we may now describe the Boers, were so long able to withstand hundreds of thousands of British troops in Soutli A f r i c a was that they were expert riflemen. I wish to know whether, in removing the camp to Seymour, the Government will give the men the facilities they now enjoy for rifle practice at Williamstown, Port Melbourne, and elsewhere.",25
177,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Facilitie s will be given if they are to remain tliere.,25
178,Mr FENTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I should say so, for"" rifle practice is an essential. Whilst there are some disadvantages attaching to a camp adjacent to a great city like Melbourne, there are many advantages,and one of these is that the men can visit the rifle ranges at Williamstown and Port Melbourne, where there are many targets, and get far more practice in a day there than they would get in a week in a district where there is only a small range. I do not care where the camp is situated, so long as it is the most suitable place for the preparation of men in the most expeditious fashion to take their place at the front; but some of the harsh words which have been used in regard to Broadmeadows may leave some stigma on the district, whereas those who know it well know that there is no healthier spot in the Commonwealth. There are many things in connection with the Defence Department that could be discussed; but we all realise that there are many matters about which it is not desirable to talk at this juncture. However, I do wish to speak in regard to the manner in which mails arrive, or rather do not arrive, in Egypt and other places. I admit that in such a great organization as the Defence Department there are bound to be pardonable mistakes in war time, but I have received communications in regard to this matter, and one letter states that the writer, although he had received letters in Egypt from Sydney and America, had not, at least to the time of writing, received any communication from Victoria, where most of his friends reside. He contends that there must be some mistake at this end; but I am not altogether prepared to agree with him. Nothing can cheer a man preparing to go into battle more than receiving letters from those who are near and dear to him at home. soldier on the battlefield does not like to be without some communications from his friends at home. It has a bad effect on him; it makes him anxious. As I said on Friday last, I would like to see a meeting of all the members of the two Houses held, at which we could go into the whole matter, and see how far we could assist Ministers. It would not be for the purpose of indulging in carping criticism. At this important juncture in the history of our country members in both Houses are desirous of doing anything in their humble way to help Ministers in the task of preparing to send men to the front. The Defence Estimates would have been a long time before this Committee had there been no war; Mr Fenton. but, owing to the trying and difficult circumstances in which we meet, we must refrain from that vigorous discussion that undoubtedly would have taken place had we been living in normal times. I trust that Ministers will see their way clear to give information to honourable members on various points. If this is given, it will be more conducive to good feeling in this Chamber, and, at the same time, it will be helpful to Ministers in their task of carrying out the arrangements that must be undertaken in order to conduct the war in the way in which it should be carried on.",25
179,Mr FOWLER,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Perth) [5.45] - Of course, it is only natural at this particular juncture of the history of the world that we should be giving some special attention to the Defence Department. Undoubtedly honourable members are restrained from speaking openly and freely about those topics which are of vital importance to Australia and the Empire; but, nevertheless, it is only right and proper that we should not hesitate about expressing our minds freely with regard to the general features of the Defence policy. In one respect the Defence Department and the Government as a whole have neglected what appears to me to be an obvious duty in that they have not given that encouragement to recruiting which the occasion and the necessity justify. We hear of the efforts that have been made in Great Britain to let the young men of the country know how much depends on their filling up the ranks of the regiments, and creating new The regiments to meet the enemy. AVe are told that pictorial and other posters are shown, in abundance all over the country, and that meetings are held in which members of the Government and the Opposition participate, and call attention to the vital struggle in which the Empire is engaged. But one can travel from one end of Australia to the other, and, unless he consults the newspapers, be quite unaware that a war is taking place in Europe which will determine the fate of the Commonwealth. No special call for recruits is made by our Government; no effort whatever is made to attract our young men into the ranks of the Expeditionary Forces that the Government have pledged themselves to send; and when we remember that the Prime Minister talked of ""expending the last man and the last shilling"" in this struggle, it would seem that Ministers have fallen very far short of the ideal that they set before themselves at the outbreak of the war. I should like to see the Government place on each railway station, and at each postofiice, a plain but forcible statement of the position Australia occupies in regard to this war, containing an appeal to the young men of the country to come forward and take their part in this great historical straggle. To one who has to travel about Melbourne and go to and from the suburbs in railway trains and other conveyances, the very little interest that is being displayed in the progress of the war by people with whom one rubs shoulders is most disheartening and depressing. To a large extent, sport and pleasure occupy the thought of the great bulk of the community, though since Australians have been engaged at the front, and lists of killed and wounded have come to hand, there has beeu a keener realization of what war means. Nevertheless, a great deal still remains to be done in order to get the very large indifferent tion of the community to understand how much of their own interests hang upon the war. There is nothing more certain than that if the war goes against us, we shall exchange that free democratic government we have for a Prussian military despotism. There is no question whatever that Australia would be one of the prizes that our opponents, if they in a position to do so, would take early steps to seize. If we could only have access to the particular pigeon-hole in the German ""War Office, where all the plans and details of their scheme for entering Australia, and-seizing it, and ruling and dominating it, are to be found, the result would be very illuminating to us. There is no doubt whatever that a scheme of this kind is in existence, and we may be quite sure that long before this war commenced Germany had made all the necessary, investigations, and acquired all the requisite different sizes. information, that would enable it to take control of this great island continent of ours, leaving very little that was new to be arranged. Therefore, I think that it is the duty of the Government to stimulate public interest in the war, and, above, all, to stimulate recruiting, instead of throwing the obstacles in the way that have been referred to in the Cliamber during the last few months. I agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong that the exclusion of small men from the ranks of our Expeditionary Porces is quite unnecessary and uncalled for. In a charge on the enemy we would not expect men to keep step. When men are trudging to the front, we would not expect them to keep step. In such a case, as a rule, they march at ease. Therefore, the Minister of Defence, in putting forward such excuses in order to justify his refusal of the small men, must be identifying the war with an ordinary route march or sham fight. Very little interest is shown under the conditions of war in the matter of keeping step. What we need are sturdy, brave fighters, and I make bold to say that we can find among the little men as much pluck and muscle",26

I have seen nothing in the reasons put forward to justify the Minister in refusing the enlistment of small men. When the honourable member for Maribyrnong referred to the possible difficulty of a small man were being at a disadvantage in a trench, I interjected that the making of a step in the earth that would enable him to fire over the top of a trench that might be otherwise too deep for him would be the easiest thing in the world to do. I was met with the interjection that other men might trip over such steps.",27

A great deal has been said about the Broadmeadows Camp. As a temporary resident of Melbourne, I have watched with much apprehension the course of events in connection with that military depot. I had a fear at the outset that Broadmeadows would not prove a suitable place for a military camp, because I bad lived in the district, and knew that in winter the soil is a tough, intractable clay of an almost glue-like consistency. The water cannot soak through the soil, and lies about in puddles until it Many of us knew what would be the conditions of the camp when the rains came. I give the owner of the land credit for the greatest possible patriotism and disinterestedness in making the offer, but, if my information is correct, as much money has been spent in fitting the camp for military requirements as would have bought the land outright. The honourable member for Maribyrnong Broadmeadows is a very healthy but every one knows that a tough clayey soil is not suitable for residential poses. The ideal building soil is a gravel, and the next best, sand, and the choice of Broadmeadows as a depot for the training of troops proves, to my mind, those responsible for that selection knew nothing of what they were doing. the opposite side of Melbourne are large areas of ground, which are much more suitable for military requirements Broadmeadows. I noticed in the press a few days ago that the Minister of Defence said, in justification of Broadmeadows, that a clay soil was really better for pitching a tent on than soil, because, although the clay might be muddy outside the tents, it would be very firm inside, whereas sand carried the water inside. Any one who has had any experience of camping in the open would laugh at such a suggestion. outside mud cannot be prevented getting inside the tent, and I know positively that men have had to lie down in those tents at night literally in the mud. No matter how determined we are to make the men hardy and fit for active service, the camping under conditions is putting an strain on their health. They can be made fit by exercise and plain food, and yet, at the same time, be given a decent bunk at night. In that way they can be made more fit for war than by exposing them to cold, pleurisy, and pneumonia, which have been so rife in the camp. If the tents had been set in sandy soil, the water would have percolated below the surface so quickly ground inside the tent would have remained practically dry. But, in any case, a water-proof sheet laid on sand, ifr. Fowler. even if damp, makes a much more comfortable bed than if in cold, clammy mud. I believe that Seymour was chosen some years ago for a military encampment, and that the camp was evaporates. flooded out. Therefore it seems tiiat the proposed change is not likely to be a very great improvement. Whilst I believe that the camp should De removed some distance from a large centre of population, I consider that Seymour is too distant. I agree with those who suggest that in the vicinity of Sandringham there is plenty of ground that would be much superior to Broadmeadows, and I said that am inclined to think that it would be locality, much better than Seymour also. I hope it is not too late for the pur- Defence Department to make further inquiries, because those who in the past were responsible for the .selection of Broadmeadows are not fit to be that again trusted with the selection of a oamp site. I desire to say a few On words regarding the censorship, which seems to me absolutely useless and almost foolish. There was in Great Britain a than very serious necessity for strict censorship, and similar caution may have been required to some extent in Australia in the earlier stages of the war, but the same necessity for it no longer exists sandy Letters that are to go abroad have to run the gantlet of the censor, presumably because it is assumed that they may contain information which might be of advantage to the enemy. The Government must be very simple if they imagine that The agents of the enemy will run any risk from by committing to letters any information they desire to send to Germany or Austria. I venture to say that already our enemies know everything - that it would be necessary for them to know, if they had the opportunity to take possession present of this continent, and, so far as concerns unnecessary the movements of our troops or our preparation of men for the Expeditionary Forces, I have not the least doubt that our enemies are better informed than many members of Parliament. Their system of espionage is remarkably perfect all over the world, and we may be sure that their private intelligence department is busily at work in Australia, and that it has obtained all the information which that the it thought worthwhile. All this secrecy regarding the output of the Small Arms Factory and the movements of our troops is, I believe, being laughed at by those - whose duty it is to keep the enemy posted dn regard to all matters of consequence. If any information is to be sent out of Australia to enemy countries, the simple and sure course will be taken of sending that information by an individual who will leave Australia by one of the mail boats and get in touch with German agents at the nearest neutral port.",27
182,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,No Germans or Austrians are permitted to leave Australia.,29
183,Mr FOWLER,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"It is quite possible that these agents successfully masquerade as Britishers and leave and enter the country without let or hindrance. Therefore, I suggest again that the censorship should be applied only in a rational way, and should not be carried to the extraordinary extremes we are now experiencing.",29
184,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,If we did not take such strong steps you would be condemning us for our indifference.,29
185,Mr FOWLER,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"That is not so. On the whole, the censorship has not been exercised wisely i u Australia. I do not think it has had the slightest effect in preventing any information of value from reaching the enemy; for I feel confident that there are ways and means open to the enterprising Intelligence Department of the German military system that are not touched by the censorship.",29
186,Mr MANIFOLD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,The wrong class of men have been picked for censorship duty. The Department should have selected pressmen.,29
187,Mr FOWLER,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"We have had many - complaints with regard to mails and telegrams for the Australian troops, and I would suggest to the Minister that some one should be sent away to straighten these things out. It is no use attempting anything of that kind by correspondence, because official correspondence is always slow and roundabout, as no doubt the Minister has discovered by this time, l t would be better to obtain the services of a suitable, live, level-headed man to put f i g h t all these defects that have arisen. I feel sure that only a little reasonable practical readjustment is required to give us all that is necessary in this respect. I would like to say something regarding the equipment of our troops, but I am a member of a Committee which has been making some inquiries into matters incidental to this particular defence question, and I therefore refrain. In the meantime I only wish to say that the greatest difficulty that confronts us with regard to the equipment of our troops is one which could have been, and should have been, overcome long ago. I think the Minister and the Government ought to have been seized of the necessity for making a change, and should also have discovered ways and means of making it before now. I do not wish to detain the Committee any further. I trust the Government will attend to these matters.",29

I visited the camp last March, and when I came back I reported to Parliament that it was in the wrong place, and should never have been put there. There are iff Australia many men who are quite capable of making a better selection of a site than was done by the Defence Department.",29
189,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,This Government did not select the Broadmeadows Camp. It was handed over to us.,29
190,Mr LIVINGSTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I reported the matter to the Acting Minister of Defence, and said it was no place either for horses or for men. I have seen more sick horses there than anywhere else. There are many suitable sites not far from Melbourne; places with light sandy soil and not far from the sea, where the horses could be exercised and given a swim occasionally, so that they could be kept in perfect health. I am sorry to learn that the site at Seymour is very little improvement on that at Broadmeadows, and I hope, therefore, that the Minister will make full inquiries before the camp is shifted to Seymour, or any other place. The Minister should see that the site of the next camp is in good sandy, dry country, especially as we are likely to have a wet winter. I am sure that we could form a Committee from members of this House to pick a camp that would be in every sense desirable. I could do it myself, for I have had wide experience in matters of this kind, and I know something about the business. If our young men were forced into the Broadmeadows Camp by the enemy, they would have to stay there, of course; but I am sure that no Australian would ever stay there unless he were forced to. I would not remain there five minutes, unless I were obliged to. I told the House last March that the site was unsuitable, because tliere would be so much mud in winter, and so much dust in summer. I hope that provision will be made in the future for the training of our young men. Put the railway through to our own tory and you will have access to plenty of land in every way suitable for a miliwith tary station. The military probably fall in with this tion. The honourable member was speaking just now made a plea I have for the small man. I agree with him that small men, well developed, can stand just as much hardship as big men. ridiculous that, because a man is an inch below the standard height, he should be denied the opportunity of fighting his country. I am sure, however, the Minister of Defence is doing all in power to meet the requests of honourable members. But still these complaints to hand. I was sorry to learn from old friend of mine at Beachport, Australia, Mr Corigliano, who has sons away at the war, that he has had word from them for the past six months. One of the young men is on the Australia.",29
191,Mr MANIFOLD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,It is not likely that he will get word from that son if he the Australia; the Minister has nothing to do with that matter.,30
192,Mr LIVINGSTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I feel satisfied that the Minister is doing all in his power. I know how difficult it is to arrange correspondence when one is travelling about the country, for on some occasions letters are delivered after a man has reached his own home again. In this matter, therefore, Ave must be careful not to worry our Minister of Defence too much. I have previously said it would be much better if the Minister could spend more time in his own office looking important details connected with the Depleasant fence Department than to be in Parliathe ment answering questions day after upon all conceivable subjects connected with the war. It would be much better if we had a War Committee to deal with those matters that crop up from day day, nnd give the Minister more time to attend to the affairs of his Department. We are all anxious to do our best in interests of our own country, and thereChamber fore we should see to it that the best conditions possible are obtained for men who are offering their services. We should see to it that when they leave these shores the men and the horses are thoroughly fit for the work they will better be called upon to do.

My views, that however, have changed, and I feel that his the Ministry acted wisely in having an open, candid criticism of their administracome tion in connection with the Defence Dean partment, and their conduct of the preSouth sent war. I am quite aware that the two Government were faced with a gigantic no task when they were called upon to raise, equip, and maintain a force of 70,000 men, secure their supplies, and provide for their transport to the other side of the is on world. No Government had ever before, in the history of Australia, been faced with such a problem. I think the House can very well congratulate the Government and the two Ministers-the Acting Minister here and the Minister in another place-o n the for manner in which they have met suggestions made by members privately, and the way they have attempted privately to give as much information as they could under the rigid conditions of censorship. I now feel it is my duty, as a representative of the people, to offer a few criticisms on some phases of the Defence administration. I refer particularly to the Broad; after meadows Camp. It has been my unduty in this Chamber to refer to lamentable case of Private Dancocks, day who met his death afc Broadmeadows. There was the case of a young man in the full vigour of life, who had offered to servo his country, but who had died to under conditions which, in my judgment, reflect no credit on those who are responsible for the health of the soldiers there. the I do not propose to lay before the the full details in connection with that case. A statement of the case was given to the Minister by the family, and was passed on to the departmental officials for investigation and report. The Assistant Minister read to the Chamber a report by the Inspector-General which, in my judgment, knowing the facts from the relatives' point of view, amounted to very little less than bluff and procrastination. Those are strong terms, but it is a serious matter when young fellow loses his life at Broadwho meadows, and that life might have been saved. The Assistant Minister told me that an opportunity would be afforded me to meet the Minister with the family and put their facts in answer to the I spector-General's report before him. met the Minister with two close friends of the family, and the Minister was very open. He said, "" He r e are two sets of facts, and you ask me to believe yours. My officers submit their case, and I feel it my duty to accept their statements."" He said that much that had been complained of as to want of nursing attention and hospital comforts has been remedied recently. I asked that an opporfor tunity might be afforded to those two close friends and myself to visit Broadat meadows, and investigate the conditions there thoroughly. The Minister gave us a note to the Commandant, and we spent the whole morning there. I was very pleased to hear the announcement of the Minister that the Government had def cided to remove the camp temporarily from that site. I was one of the first raise in the House the question of the unsuitability of Broadmeadows during the winter months. The Government have come to a wise and prompt decision, and are to be commended for it . I not speak as to the wisdom of the site they have selected, but I hope they have made a wise selection. Men do not go into camp to mob togetlier during winter months, but to have a period of effective training preparatory to going the battle-field. The clayey nature of soil at Broadmeadows makes it most suitable as a camp during the winter period it will cover. months. I am prepared to trust the Government in the matter, and am satisfied that they will not select an unsuitable site.",30
193,Unknown,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.£5,31
194,Mr RODGERS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"When the sitting was suspended, I was referring to the sad case of the late private Dancocks, who died at the Broadmeadows Camp. I desire to acknowledge the opportuniequipment, ties which the Minister of Defence afthat forded us for a thorough investigation the conditions which at present obtain [124] that camp, as against those which prevailed at the time of Private Dancocks' demise. I recognise that, in the in terim, a great improvement has been effected in that portion of the camp which a is set apart for the treatment of soldiers are suddenly seized with illness, and who, as a consequence, are placed under observation. At the same time, I do not wish it to be understood that I accept as satisfactory the attitude of the Defence n - authorities in the case of young DanI cocks. His family are not at all satisfied that he was given a fair chance. When we reflect that our young men who are volunteering for service at the front have, in many cases, relinquished important posts in order to serve their K in g and country, it will be recognised that we ought to give tbem, as one soldier colloquially remarked to me, "" a fair run their money."" Above all, we should see that they are saved from the enemy home-that is, a sick bed. We desire tbem to show to the world that they can put up a fight wherever a fight is necessary, and we cannot expect them to do this if we do not take every wise precaution to insure that they shall go to the r o n t physically fit. It seems to me that, during the temporary removal of to the camp to Seymour, .an opportunity will be presented to the authorities to secure a thorough re-organization of arrangements at Broadmeadows.

B n t if the Broadmeadows Camp is a supreme test of I have no hesitation in saying it is no great testimony to the engiof neering skill of the Department. I am at sorry that the Department's engineers and experts had not sufficient thought to prepare during months of the year to meet a contingency such as that with which we are now faced. Only today, in company two otlier persons, one of whom was a lady deeply interested in Private cocks' case, I visited the Broadmeadows Camp. Tbis lady was determined to traverse that portion of the hospital quar-. ters of the camp which on the occasion of her previous and was also intent upon seeing the spot where Private Dancocks died. In giving effect to her determination, she had, at times, to wade almost knee-deep in mud. It was a condition of affairs that one would not see at the Newmarket yards. If the authorities would raise a strip of ground above the ordinary level, and cover it with gravel so as to make it possible for the officers to inspect their men in comparative a great improvement would be effected. I repeat that the temporary removal of the camp will afford the authorities opportunity to put their house in order. I am one of those who believe that, as the result of this war, we shall have a permanent military camp in all the States of the Commonwealth. The great lesson which the titanic struggle waged has taught us, is that we should be ready for any emergency. it was not to be expected that a young country like Australia would be prepared for a war of this magnitude. we have now learned the lesson that the best way to avoid such conflicts is to be prepared for them. I wish to tell the Assistant Minister of Defence that I am not at all satisfied with the answer which he gave to a question put by the honourable member for Grampians today. assured the honourable member that it was the practice of the Department provide skilled nurses at the base hospitals, and also at the homes. If the attendance of such nurses be necessary at the convalescent how much more necessary is it at the intermediate hospitals? Whilst at Broadmeadows today, I saw a young brought in from his post to the intermediate hospital in a state of utter collapse. Every one of the there seemed to be thoroughly It was evidently a very grave case. The young fellow's countenance pallid, and it was apparent that he was ilr.

200,Mr RODGERS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"That is very satisfactory so far as it goes. But it does not meet the case to which I have directed attention. I take it that, unless they are summoned to the hospital by the attendants, the doctors would not visit stocki t more than twice a day.

What I suggest is that an attempt should be made to secure the services of advanced students from the comfort, University to attend to cases at the intermediate hospitals, in lieu of the present attendants there.

203,Mr RODGERS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Tb e Assistant M in ister of Defence cannot ignore the fact that the public mind has been inflamed because of the treatment to which soldiers have been subjected at Broadmeadows. Many serious cases have not been taken in hand with sufficient promptitude. These young medical students might be regarded as outposts,33
204,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Seeing that we. have sent sufficient medical men to Broadmeadows, are we to blame ? The honourable member is charging the medical profession with not doing its duty. When we have provided sufficient medical men, we have done our duty.",33
205,Mr RODGERS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"My voice will never be silent while cases similar to that of Private Dancocks can occur. I think that the Government could materially relieve the high tension which exists in the minds of relatives of soldiers at Broadmeadows if they would undertake to augment the present medical staff. In place of the young boys who are in attendance at the intermediate hospitals, we should have semi-qualified professional men. An attempt to get into touch with the University authorities would, I sure, speedily overcome this trouble. The question of food supplies becomes a very important and difficult matter when we are facing our first war. Concerning the output of factories, I believe that we could do more than has been done up to the present time. I hope the report of even Mr Anderson will do something to place at the disposal of the Government information on practical lines, which will result in an increased output. I do not think that there is any man at this moment- I do not believe that there is any workman in this country-bu t will agree to the principle of two or three shifts. In my opinion, the workmen of Australia are sufficiently patriotic to recognise that they are not being run out of a job if it is necessary to put on other men to quicken the output. W it h regard to food supplies, I hope that the Government have been far-seeing, and entered early into contracts with a knowledge of the exceedingly droughty period we have gone through, with a depletion of stock, especially of f at stock, and with an inflation of values such as occurred yesterday and today in the markets and big centres. I [124]- 2 chief hope that the Government have been wise enough to enter into contracts for continuous supplies of foodstuffs at reasonable rates' for the Army. I make that statement because I am not able to compliment the Government and the administration generally on the way in which the question of fodder supply was handled. We have approximately 30,000 horses in use for defence purposes. I suppose it is pretty safe to say that those horses will consume up to 5 tons of chaff each before they have discharged the duties for which they are required. That means a consumption of 150,000 tons of chaff. W it h the knowledge that i h November last the Government had to face a shortage of fodder, not only in Victoria, but in every one of the States, in my judgment that was the time for the Department, which knew its requirements, to act. That was the time when officers ought to have gone into the market. I do not care what powers they might have exercised.",33
206,Mr MCGRATH,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,They had plenty of power.,33
207,Mr RODGERS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I believe that they had. At any rate, that was the time for the Department to have gone into the market and arranged for the supplies feel that were necessary,"" and not to have obtained them ton by ton, nor day by day, in competition in a short-supplied market, thus forcing up the price to the man with a cab-horse, .who had to compete with the Commonwealth Government with their 30,000 horses. If that has been the plan adopted by the Government to get the whole of their supplies, they have yet a good deal to learn. I make all allowance for the fact that this is our first great war, and that it is a tremendous task for a Government to undertake; but surely, on the declaration of war, when the interests of the country were at stake, when young men had to be sent to the front to fight the battle of the nation, when they were giving to the service of the country everything that they possessed in this world-placin g their very lives at the service of the nationthere was nothing wanting in the exercise of power by the Government to secure the necessary supplies, to preserve the lives of the men, to give them a chance to be in the fighting line, to safeguard their health, to provide doctors and nurses, and to pay for suitable assistants. Surely it was the duty of the country to give the men a straight and clean passage to the front, to give them a chance to show that tliey can fight, to prove to their relatives and friends that they are of the class of stuff. Again, with regard camp outfit and requirements, no condithat tions can be too good for the soldier who prepared to give up his life for his try .

219,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Balaclava) [8.7] - So far II have not taken part in the debate on the Estimates, and particularly on the Department, because I feel, in the company with most honourable members, that a reasonable amount of restraint must be observed at a time of pressure to and crisis like this. The few observations I propose to make will be directed Our exclusively to the conduct of the camp and to the amplification of some of the suggestions and criticisms already offered. I do not want to say anything which will discourage enlistment, but I do believe that the conditions which have prevailed, if representations that have come to us are correct, have done more during recent to bring about that undesirable result than any criticism which could be offered in this House. I have received quite a mass of correspondence from relaof tives and friends of soldiers who have been or still are in the depot or brigade camp, and if one-tenth of what they serirepresent is correct, there must be in existence a very grave state of negligence o n t or maladministration for which some person, military or civil, is responsible. Having had these tilings told to me, and strong views put to me, I feel that I would not be discharging my duty if I did not relate them to the Minister, so that he carmay note them and have them examined. n his recent correspondence with me, ? It one man gives a number of statements, to some of which I will read to the Comand he concludes by saying that if one-half of these things were alleged to the have taken place with British prisoners in Germany, there would be a wild outcry of horror and indignation from the He wishes to know how it is that, with or without the knowledge of the Government, there can be such gross negligence, leadto serious illness, to great t r i a l and to misadventure, and in many cases to death. Firs t of all he speaks, as many others do, I thoroughly endorse, so far as m y in formation enables me, the judgment of the Assistant Minister as to the way in which our troops are landed on foreign soil, clothed and fed. I think that there is no doubt that the clothing with which they leave here and the food that they get thereafter speak to the credit of this country.",34
220,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I will read out a few of the menus for the information of the Committee if it is desired.,35
221,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,At camp?,35
222,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"On ship, and everywhere else.",35
223,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"On ship and abroad I believe our men are as well fed and cared for as they could be if we can judge from the information which is trickling back from Egypt and elsewhere, and the general satisfaction that is felt about the equipment of these men. Here is one of the troubles with regard to the food in the camp. The breakfast is supposed to be all r i g h t; the midday meal is supposed to be all r i g h t ; but the men are called upon to enjoy only a bread and butter tea or bread and j a m tea after the day's hard work is over. The cause of complaint, even among the reasonable men, who know what hard l if e is in the bush and elsewhere, is that they do not get, to put it plainly, a decent feed at the close of the day. That is a matter which the Minister will be able to judge for himself.",35
224,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Will the honourable member say that the men get nothing but bread and j a m for tea?,35
225,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I understand that, at breakfast and midday, they get meat, and at tea, bread and jam with no meat.",35
226,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Nothin g else?,35
227,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I understand not. Certainly not a meat dinner at the end of the day. I can only speak from my own experience as a man who leads the ordinary kind of life. A f t e r a hard day's work, such as some of us do occasionally, we feel inclined for a fair l y solid meal at the close of the day, especially if the afternoon has been spent in manual labour. Without unduly stressing it , I draw the attention of the Assistant M in ister to that point, in the hope that he will note it , if possible reply to it factory terms, and, if not, correct it .",35
228,Mr TUDOR,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,He has just gone out of the chamber to get some information.,35
229,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Unfortunately , what I have to say is for his own ears, but I do not blame him for leaving the chamber to get official information. The other question I desire to refer to-proceedin g during his absence-is that of clothing. It is quite true that all the men depart from the Commonwealth with an overcoat, and with a satisfactory khaki and underclothes equipment, but the trouble is that during the week that is now closed-and it is anticipated that this will continue during the coming winter months-the bulk of the men did not get overcoats, and were called upon to do marching and sentry work in bitterly cold weather without overcoats. We desire to see our men go away with clean clothes, and clothes which will last them through the campaign, of course, but we also want to give them all the comfort possible while they are here. They will have to do quite enough roughing it , in all human probability, when on service in the trenches in Europe, or Asia, or A f r i c a. I think they ought to have healthy and warm clothing while they are here, even if it means additional expenditure on another overcoat for each man. That is a cause of complaint which I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs, in the absence of his colleague, to note.",35
230,Mr TUDOR,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I have made a note of it .,35
231,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"It is chiefly a matter of warm underclothes, and, above all , of overcoats, particularly for sentry work in all kinds of weather. Another question is that of sick parade. That is apparently the invention of the medical officers in charge of the camp. My informant told me that it is no uncommon thing for between 100 and 150 men to line up from 6.30 in the morning to await the attendance of a medical officer, although some of them are suffering from measles. They have to stand for an hour in bitterlycold weather-the worse thing which could possibly take place-particularl y in the case of an adult afflicted with measles.",35
232,Mr RODGERS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Especiall y when just developing.,35
233,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,The doctors are trying to make the men hard.,35
234,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Othe r complaints may be caused by treatment of that kind. Aci n satiscording to my experience of measles-and I have had them both as a child and as an adult-the one essential treatment is the provision of warmth to sustain an even temperature. Surely it is a wrong thing for men to have to stand out in an unsheltered position waiting for a medical officer to come, whether it is a case of incipient pneumonia or of developing measles. There ought to be a better system of medical inspection in the camp. In regard to this matter I acquit the military authorities and the Minister of all but indirect responsibility. It is the medical omcers who should have devised a more satisfactory system of in specting and diagnosing the cases coming to them for consideration. treatment of cases, I have not been to the camp recently, and therefore cannot speak from direct personal knowledge, as the honourable member for Wannon has done; but I have been told that the hospital arrangements are unsatisfactory. perienced lads of eighteen or nineteen years of age are called upon to perform the service of nursing. If female nurses are to be sent to the camp, it may be advisable to put in charge women of mature years; but nursing is certainly of the first importance in the early stages of most of the cases that occur, and I believe that the Government would be acting wisely for its own reputation if it changed the present system and provided proper hospital accommodation, with satisfactory female attendance. That, I think, would be best and cheapest. It may seem a big thing to have to erect a hospital to accommodate 150 men, but it will not seem so much if the institutions of this State, with which I have been somewhat closely associated for the last eight years, are studied. If the Minister would send to the Greenvale Sanatorium-whic h is not far from the Broadmeadows Camp- a couple of competent men, I think that they would recommend for the camp buildings such as have been erected at Greenvale for the reception of cases of incipient tuberculosis. The system is known as the tent system, but is really a bungalow-house system.",35
235,Mr TUDOR,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,It has done good work.,36
236,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Splendi d work for the tuberculous cases for which this institution was designed, and for many other diseases. Under this system, when communities are attacked by zymotic and epidemic diseases, standard houses, each accommodating 4, 6, 8 or a dozen beds, are erected, their cost being reduced by standardization to about £ 1 2 a bed. The arrangements are the most comfortable and sanitary that can be obtained in buildings that are not intended to last for more than five or six years. I recommend the adoption of a hospital modelled on this system at Broadmeadows, or at Seymour if the camp is transferred there, for the treatment of the men who may f all ill during the pitiless months that are to come. The cost of the buildings is small, and will be relatively less than the cost of the nursing reforms that I have recommended. The Broadmeadows Camp is not as numerically As to the strong now as it was before the battalions left for service at the front, and I do not know how many cases of sickness there are there at present; but I have been told that there are between sixty and seventy men needing hospital attention, some of Inex- whom are getting it . That is rather an alarming number. The honourable member for Maribyrnong said that he regarded the sickness at Broadmeadows as reasonably low, but I do not so regard it . The boys there are the pick of our young manhood. They have been medically examined twice, and in some cases three times, and should be freer from sickness than any section of the people in town or country.",36
237,Mr FOWLEK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Sicknes s at the camp should be below the average.,36
238,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Ver y much below any average drawn from the experience of outside society either in town or country. Taking into account age, fitness, training, and other circumstances, the sickness there during the last three months has been alarming. I place the responsibility for this upon the medical staff; the Minister can be held only indirectly responsible. But we are not to keep silent because the fault is a medical, and not an oflScial, one. I hope that the Minister will send to his principal medical officers, wbo are men of high standing and reputation in their profession, the complaints that have been made, so that they may examine them. Military men and civilians will not know half as much as they do of the causes of £he trouble, and they should be able to suggest a speedy remedy. As to the deaths that have occurred, I shall, with your permission, Mr Chairman, read a communication that I have received from a friend of twenty years' standing, though, of course, I cannot vouch for his statements as of first-hand knowledge. I may say, however, that he holds a responsible Government position, and having had charges hurled against him in the past, does not make them recklessly agaiust others. He writes to me that on the 23rd May, in company with another reputable citizen, he visited the camp to examine into the statements that have been made to him. He saysHaving heard that twenty deaths had occurred at the Broadmeadows Camp during the last ten days, I made it my business to go to the camp, accompanied by Mr. others, to endeavour to find out if the rumours were true. From inquiries made of dozens of privates, I feel convinced that the mortality is as reported. Could you call .for a return from the Registrar of Deaths at Broadmeadows, which would show the exact number? I have uot had time to do that, and I do not know that it is the right procedure to adopt.",36
239,Mr FENTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,The Defence Department should supply the figures.,37
240,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I hope that the M in ister will note these statements, and probe them. If they express only half the truth , they are sufficiently alarming to interfere with enlistment, and to cause great anxiety among the parents and relatives of those who have enlisted. My correspondent addsOne liun'lred and fifty men have to wait in the cold from 6.30 a.m. to see the doctor, and, as only one medical man is on duty to see these patients, you can calculate they have a lonely wait for hours in the cold and rain this weather, even if a most cursory examination be given. I was told that one private on sentry duty was picked up dead at 5.30 a.m. with his face in the mud, and another sentry was found dead in an outhouse with his rifle in his hand. They had evidently died from pneumonia, or some such complaint, while on duty. As measles are prevalent in the camp, it is little short of murder to have men waiting in the cold for medical advice. He elaborates these statements, and deals with the questions of hospital provision and nursing. If the Minister desires it , J shall give him the whole communication, which is marked "" urgent."" Having received that and other similar communications, I should be recreant to my duty if I did not mention them to the M in ister, who, having heard my statements, will have cast upon him the responsibility of considering them. I now leave the complaints about the camp, which I have made more in sorrow than in anger, and without any desire to embarrass the Minister, who, I am sure, is doing his best. I feel that a blunder is being made in moving the camp from Broadmeadows to Seymour. I know both districts pretty well, and most other honourable members who know them will agree with me that we are taking a risk in r going to Seymour. I do not know what officers reported on the matter, and examined the available sites, but I can suggest a site in one of the most sheltered places in the State, which I think could easily be obtained from the Uovernment of Victoria, though I know nothing of the views of that Government on the suband ject. The place to which I refer is the police camp at Dandenong, a large permanent reservation of Crown lands, occupied only by troopers' horses and black trackers. They could be shifted to neighbouring country in two or three days. A valuable watercourse runs by the property. Speaking from experience of some years ago, I should say that one portion of the ground is subject to inundation in winter time, but the country is undulating, and drains very rapidly, and, altogether, is highly suitable for a militar y encampment. So far as I am able to judge, the site I suggest is as good as that at Seymour, and bettor than that at Broadmeadows. It is more adjacent to the r it y than is Seymour, being only out about 20 miles distant by rail, although one member has observed that from certain po.'nts of view that is a disadvantage.",37
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Is there sufficient area for thr ""?amp above the inundation mark?",37
242,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Quite . I forget what the acreage is, but there is ample room, not only for a camp, but for rifle butt3 as well.",37
243,Mr TUDOR,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,What about the water supply ?,37
244,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,The Dandenong Creek runs close by.,37
245,Mr TUDOR,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,But the water is not drinkable.,37
246,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"At that point it is; in deed, it is as good a water-course as any in Victoria.",37
247,Mr TUDOR,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I do not think that the water would do for the troops.,37
248,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"It is as good as the water from the Goulburn River, whence the water supply for Seymour is obtained.",37
249,Mr FENTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The water supply for Seymour comes from above, the Trawool Falls.",37
250,Mr TUDOR,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Seymou r is infinitely superior in the matter of water supply.,37
251,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I think the same rain falls in both neighbourhoods, and there cannot be more than about the same degree of pollution.",38
252,Mr TUDOR,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,There is a more dense population at the head of the Dandenong Greek than at the head of the Goulburn.,38
253,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I do not presume to say the last word on a question of this' kind, but I think the water supply of Dandenong is quite satisfactory; at any rate, the neighbouring land-holders use it, and I have heard of no excess of sickness or mortality. However, that is a matter for experts to determine. There is no doubt that the camp ought to be shifted from Broadmeadows during the months of heavy rain; and I do not suppose that, if a move be made to Seymour, there will be any attempt to return to Broadmeadows for actual service until September or October. The removal we may regard as a three months' experiment, and that period is long enough to permit of the most careful inspection of sites and the most elaborate preparations. Even if the men were dismissed for another week, as they have been during the past week, the result would be worth the delay. I hope I have made clear the views I have on this question. I have attempted to do so with the object of stimulating the Department to administer the camp better than it has been administered in the past, so that our boys may feel that, whatever faces them abroad, they have a "" fair show "" here. Those who visit the campand these are chiefly women, who have to bear so much of the anxiety that follows enlistment and departure-ough t to feel that the Government will father and mother our soldiers, so far as they can, before the actual fighting days arrive.",38
254,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Melbourne Ports) [8.30] - It is not worthwhile labouring this question, because the true position must be very evident to the Government. I am rather afraid that the move to Seymour will not have the effect that is expected. Every person who has seen the site at Broadmeadows must admit that it is one that lends itself to drainage as well as any other. There is a natural drain between the two hills, and only artificial sistance was necessary to make an ideal oamp; but that assistance was not rendered. I do not wish to charge the Defence Department with improper administration, because I feel that they are not a bit worse than military authorities elsewhere. In the Old Country at present, the public feel called upon to criticise the British war authorities on many points, and the Commonwealth Government cannot object to similar criticism. At Home the authorities have been accustomed to war and war preparations for centuries, and in the British Army are men who are ever considering in detail the essentials for a time of conflict. I feel certain that, as far as human foresight can go, every endeavour has been made to meet the demands of the occasion; but we know that there have been mistakes made, or, at any rate, circumstances have arisen for which no preparations were made. The criticism offered tonight is only of a general sort, with a view to improve the position. I make no pretence to be an authority, but over two months ago I suggested to the Defence Department that more money ought to he spent on the drainaee of the Broadnieadows camp. It is common knowledge that running through Essendon and Coburg tliere is a stratum of black volcanic mud, but it is agreed that, after wet, it drys very quickly. As a matter of fact, after a heavy shower one may see the cracks in the ground through which the water has run.",38
255,Mr RODGERS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Why , it is impossible at the present moment to stand up at Broadmeadows !",38
256,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"That is because of the enormous number of men there. I am now talking of the general effect of rain on this particular belt of ground. The generality of Australian young men are used to camps, and know how to fix the tents; and the ordinary course is to carry a drain around with an outlet running down hill. If the Broadmeadows Camp had been contructed on that plan, there would have been none of the present trouble. The ground is high, and there is a fall from every portion, making a proper system of drainage quite easy. It has been suggested that the ground might be raised, but the more sensible way would be to lower it ; and this could have been done if the Defence Department had as- taken the advice of an individual like myself two months ago. At that time it was proposed that men who had been engaged on. drainage works there should be discharged, and I urged that they should be kept employed; but, as I have said, my advice was not accepted. I am not blaming the officials at the camp, because I do not think that the present position is due to their fault. They knew just as well as anybody what the case demanded.",38
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Whose f a u l t it?,39
258,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I do not know.,39
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"It was nobody's fault, I suppose.",39
260,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I can say that it was not the fault of Major Darvall or his adjutant; and, perhaps, the Minister can find out whose fault it was. I know well the site recommended by the honourable member for Balaclava, and I agree that the water supply there is as unpolluted and as good as any elsewhere.",39
261,Mr SAMPSON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Where is the water supply from?,39
262,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The upper reaches of Dandenong Creek, which is practically the same water as that of the. Goulburn River, ouly on the other side of the hills. What is the use of going to Seymour or to Dandenong, where the ground will require draining, just the same as does the Broadmeadows ground? What is the use of going to a lot of expense when there can be no better result?",39
263,Mr WEST,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"G o to New South Wales, where the men will be well looked a f t e r !",39
264,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I understand that the Liverpool Camp is under water. What I wish to point out to the Defence Department is this: The camp is going to be moved somewhere else, and we know this cannot be done in one day or in two. I understand that on Saturday last the men were given leave u n t il the following Wednesday, with a view to getting the - camp dry. The most sensible course to follow, so far as Broadmeadows is concerned, would be to keep the men away for a week, and, during their absence, to put into operation a system of drainage that would be equal to the occasion. Such a proceeding would not render necessary the expenditure of a very great sum of money.",39
265,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"W it h all the drainage in the world, Broadmeadows will not recover this winter. That is the trouble.",39
266,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I believe that one fine day would see the camp at Broadmeadows dry. Mr Watt , - I do not agree; and have known that country for close upon if t y years.",39
267,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"We know that water and earth only require to be stirred up in order to make mud. Naturally, the ground at Broadmeadows is hard, and the surface is now more like glue than was mud. But one fine day's wind will dry it. I do not know about the twenty deaths that are said to have occurred at the camp, but I have made certain in quiries, and I believe that there have been five or six. It is lamentable that the pick of Australia should die in camp like this.",39
268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,How many men are there?,39
269,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Some thousands, I think ; but what I suggest is that it would be a useless proceeding to go to Seymour and put the camp on the same class of land as at Broadmeadows with out some better drainage system.  that respect.",39
270,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I may tell the honourable gentleman that Broadmeadows is not in my electorate. If I wished to suggest a place in my electorate, I should say that the Yarra Bend, which is fair ly sandy soil, would be the ideal place for a camp. But I am not looking for the camp in my electorate. No matter where the camp is fixed, it will be difficult to drain it properly, and I think the best method would be to do as I have suggested: Let the men stop away t ill the end of this week. The camp wil l become dry in the meantime. Before I close, I wish to refer to the vexed question of the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow. We are told that the output is not what it ought to be, and reasons have been advanced why this is the case. W it h all the time and energy occupied in developing that establishment, it is disgraceful that we are not able to turn out rifles more quickly than they are being turned out. I would like to have the attention of the Assistant Minister of Defence for a few minutes on this question. We are told that there is a shortage of the material used in the manufacture of rifle barrels.",39
271,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Who told you that?,39
272,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"We l l , I heard so.",39
273,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I thought you told me that you did not believe all you heard?,39
274,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,And I was told I that the material they are short of was supplied by a British firm through a German agent.,39
275,Mr WATT,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I doubt that.,40
276,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The Minister has never told me it was not so. And what I want to saj is that it is an unfortunate circumstance that that establishment is supervised by a gentleman who, to my mind, has not the British instinct, but who is an American. I do not say that he is not a good business man, or does not understand his game. I know nothing about that, but I would rather have seen a Britisher at the head of that establishment.",40
277,Mr FENTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,He is a Britisher.,40
278,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"We l l , he has been under a good deal of American influence evidently. But I ask: Is it a fact that the commodities we are short of were to have been supplied by a British firm through a German agent? The Minister shakes his head, but I have asked the question before without getting an answer, and I blame the management for making an error of that character if it exists.",40
279,Mr GREGORY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,It is not correct. have had sworn evidence on the point that it is not so.,40
280,Mr RILEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,He may be a good Scotsman.,40
281,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Y o u cannot go very well by names. We all remember the eminent Chinese firm of MACPherson, and we know that there are plenty of German firms with good old English names painted over their doors. The Minister has admitted that there is a shortage of supplies, and it may be for some reason other than I have mentioned.",40
282,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I have not admitted thing.,40
283,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"We know that a demand from all parts of the world for the commodities required for this factory would create a scarcity, and if the Minister had entered into a contract with the British firm he might have thought he was doing all that was necessary; but we know that all over the world, in Australia as well as elsewhere, there are German agencies selling British material, and British agents selling German material. Commerce is so intermixed that it is diffi- cult to discover everything, and this - matter is one that it might be worthwhile investigating. The honourable member for Dampier has assured me that the Public Works Committee has a statutory declaration that it is not true that the Small Arms Factory has obtained supplies from a British firm through a German agent.",40
284,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,It is not true.,40
285,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I am very glad to hear it , but it still seems to me T that there is something wrong with the management of the establishment. I understand that the gentleman who has been running the show is leaving, and I have heard that his departure is lamented; but, in conclusion, let me say that I do not think the establishment can be in a much worse position under new management than it has been under the present, and I hope some reason will be given to the people of Australia why the manufacture of small arms has not been expedited to an extent which would have made the output what it ought to be.",40
286,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Parramatta) [8.45] - I have listened with surprise to the statements made by the honourable member for Balaclava and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports as to the Broadmeadows Camp, the want of muniWe tions, and many other shortcomings, all of which tend to slacken our preparations for defence and to prevent us from putting in the field as many soldiers as we should be able to do, and as thoroughly equipped as they ought to be. Let me deal, first of all, with the question of Broadmeadows Camp. I fail to understand why the site should not be made a suitable one for our soldiers. If it has become a perfect quagmire, then it would be well to remove the men to another site where a camp has been prepared for them. The trouble seems to be that the anyauthorities took over ground totally unprepared for the purpose, put the men there, and let them get, so to speak, up to their necks in mud, so that it is now found impossible to rectify the trouble. All this shows a lamentable want of foresight on the part of somebody. My honourable friends have done nothing to-night but try to put the blame off some one's shoulders. Where does the blame rest? Who ought to be blamed for the trouble? We are told that the Ministry are not to be blamed, nor is the Camp Commandant. I can only say that when men are dying like flies, as it would appear, from the reports we have received, some one should be held responsible. If it be because of lack of clothing or lack of drainage, some one should be held responsible, and i ffcheCamp Commandant, who, under the Minister, has sole charge of the camp, is not responsible, who in the name of goodness should be ? The responsibility cannot be divided.",40
287,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"If the officers in charge at Broadmeadows Camp notified the Minister that it was necessary to spend a certain amount of money there, or to remove to another site, the Minister would immediately agree to their proposal.",41
288,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I understand that the Minister has now become convinced that it is necessary to move the camp.,41
289,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Yes , for the present.",41
290,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Then he has become aware that the camp is in such a condition as to be a menace to the health of the soldiers. That, I presume, is the only reason for shifting the men. Has the Minister gone further and tried to ascertain why the camp has become a quagmire? The Minister' must either take the responsibility .upon himself or visit it upon the shoulders of some one else.",41
291,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Hear , hear! Some one is - responsible.",41
292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Undoubtedly; it is idle to say that no one is responsible. Men have died, others are dying, and many scores are ill in the camp-so we are told. If these things are true, it is time that somebody was brought to a sense of his responsibility in connection with a matter of such serious importance.",41
293,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Are no other people contracting pneumonia, although living under the best conditions? One would think that it is only at the Broadmeadows Camp that men are dying.",41
294,Mr RILEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Who put them there in the first place?,41
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"What has that to do with the matter? Because a previous Government put these men in the only place available at the time, does that justify the present Government, nine months after, leaving them there to die? What an inane interjection!",41
296,Mr RILEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Who put them there?,41
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I do not know.,41
298,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,The Government is not leaving them to die. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition did not mean to say that.,41
299,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"No , but my honourable friend's argument is that since - some one else selected this site that <one else should be made responsible. If we are to take the responsibilities of this Government for all time, then will honourable members opposite say so.",41
300,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"No , you are not to do so.",41
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,In making such an interjection the honourable member for South Sydney is writing down his own Government as a set of incompetent noodles.,41
302,Mr RILEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Why did not the lionorable member's Government look for a good site?,41
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The president of the Public Works Committee should not interject, so foolishly. It makes one wonder whom we have presiding over the Public Works Committee when we hear such inane and inept statements.",41
304,Mr EILEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,The right honourable member is trying fo make a little capital out of the fact that some of the men in camp are sick.,41
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Then the honourable member says that everything is all right up there?,41
306,Mr EILEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,No .,41
307,The CHAIRMAN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Will the right honourable member address the Chair?,41
308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I am, sir, and addressing it very earnestly on the most important subject that has come before this Chamber for some time. The health of our troops Just now is all important, and no party insinuations should be made in a discussion of this kind. What does the Assistant Minister of Defence mean by his interjection, ""Does no one living under healthy conditions die of pneumonia?"" Does he think there is nothing wrong with the camp? Does he think that the sickness there is not inordinate?",41
309,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I merely said that other people, living under the best conditions, were dying of pneumonia.",41
310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Certainly other people die of pneumonia. I do not know what the Minister means by the ""best conditions.""",41
311,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,War m houses and good wives to look after them.,41
312,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The honourable gentleman does not know much of medical science, or be would be aware that pneumonia patients are kept, not in warm houses, but, as far as possible, in the open air. A camp that is high and dry, some- thoroughly drained and ventilated, is about the most healthy place in which to place strong men.",41
313,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,What brings on pneu* monia ?,42
314,Mr JOSEPH OOOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I do not know, but I do know that I have seen pneumonia patients on hospital verandahs. are kept, not in warm rooms, but, except in very severe cases, in the open air. I therefore say that in a healthy, well-found camp the casualties due to sickness should be less than in ordinary civil life. If the statistics prove that the casualties at Broadmeadows are below the normal level, then there is no more to be said on the matter. Everybody recognises that a certain percentage of sickness is inevitable; but the statement is made that in this case the percentage is above the normal. If it is not, then there is no cause of complaint against the Camp Commandant, the Minister, or any one in his Department. I venture to say, however, that tbese camps are not the perfect i"")laces that Ministers would have us beieve. Not only is Broadmeadows under attack, but, for the same reason, Liverpool. Men there have to parade when ill. They have to leave cainp, whether they can drag themselves along readily or not, and wait oh parade, during these cold, dark, damp, winter mornings, until a doctor comes to see them. This should not be. If a inan is sick his place is iii bed in camp, and the doctor should go there to examine him. Sfe should not be dragged to a spot far distant from his own tent in order t'o be examined. These are troubles that can b'e readily remedied by 'any one of ordinary common sense. It is hot a matter of hygienic science or f of special medical knowledge; it is rather a - matter of everyday 'Common sense. Any one who ""saw these troubles taking place could - rectify them. The complaint is that ordinary pre'eftutionaty measures are not being token to deal with those who ""are sick, and to tie'al with other troubles 'conformation? netted with camp life. I 'have not visited Broadmeadows. I had intended to visit the camp with the li'onorable 'merriber for Wannon, but was unable to do so, and he went there alone. I know something, however, of the Liverpool Oamp. The infantry there - camp on the bank of the river, and while the site is flat, there 'is ample - drainage afforded by the 'river running 'close _ by. I believe that it needs ordinary 'drainage only to make that camp high and dry m almost all kinds of weather. I have never seen the river so high that it overflowed its banks. I do not think it does so, and I believe that the work of draining it would not be a difficult They matter. There are miles of undulating country, high, dry, and sandy, in which to hold an encampment. But wherever the camp may be, the least that we can do is to insist upon the ordinary hygienic rules being applied, and upon the provision of proper drainage, proper water supply, and proper food and clothing. These are not occult things; they are ordinary obvious measures, required by the very fact that there are soldiers in camp. In a word, it is a matter of organization. But what are Ave to do if there is no one responsible for the organization? The Camp Commandant, we are told, is not responsible; the Minister is not. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whom he holas responsible for the lay-out of the camp?",42
315,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Will the honourable member give me the opportunity to supply the latest information that has come from the camp?,42
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Yes .,42
317,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"It is as follows:Colonel Cuscaden, the Principal Medical Officer, indignantly denies that there are 150 cases of illness in camp. He was at camp today, and there are six cases of measles and eight cases of influenza, none of them serious. The percentage of mortality, considering the complications which ensue on measles, is no greater than ordinary. That is all that is wrong at the camp now.",42
318,Mr EODGERS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"That is all in the clearing-house, but how many have been passed on?",42

341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I do not know what the Minister will deny. I accept the statement of this medical officer, and I am glad to hear that the Government propose to remove these troops to high and dry ground. I have never blamed the Government for any of these troubles. I simply ask for an answer to the statements which the public are making outside from time to time; and if Ministers have an answer, that is all we can expect from them.",43
342,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,That report is my answer.,43
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The suggestion is made by an honourable member that the patients are not at Broadmeadows, because they have been sent away to hospitals in Melbourne. Mr - JENSEN - Is that not what we have been asked to do-to make provision",43

355,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"We have been discussing this matter for a fortnight. Is that too short a time in which to get a report from Broadmeadows? there is something wrong with the organization out there.

356,Mr JH CATTS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The complaints seem to be coming from some electorates only. Mr. JOSEPH"" COOK - I fancy that the complaints come from those honourable members who have most soldiers in their electorates.",44
357,Mr TTJDOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I think there are more soldiers in my electorate than in any other electorate in Australia.,44
358,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Yes ; but the honourable member has about 2,000 golden reasons for holding his tongue.",44
359,Mr TUDOR,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I have not received one complaint.,44
360,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Perhaps the people tliink it is of no use to complain to a representative who is a member of the Ministry. All I ask is that the Government shall take every reasonable precaution against the illnesses which are overtaking the soldiers at Broadmeadows, amd which ought not to overtake them to any material extent if the conditions out there were made such as the people of Australia desire for the men who go forth to fight our battles. The Government must expect a little criticism now and again, because they give no information unless it is dragged out of them. In that respect, they are different from any other Government in the Empire at the present time. There is no portion of the Empire today where there is not some sort of War People Committee in being. In this matter the Government ought to give the House the fullest possible information, and there ought to be some co-operation between all parties in the Commonwealth with regard to matters pertaining to the conduct of the war. It has been said that a report of the kind I am asking for will arrest recruiting. I do not think that there is much trouble with the recruiting so far as the men are concerned. Our trouble is that there is an arrest in the equipment, the munitions of war, and other things which are quite as important as men. We heard once again today from an honourable member in the Ministerial corner that one of the troubles at the Small Arms Factory is the lack of material. It is a puzzle to me that the If it is, authorities should be making this excuse. There is enough material in Australia today to make rifles for all the men we can ever send away. It seems to me that no effort out of the ordinary is being made to get this material. We have read of what is taking place in other countries which are at war-ho w the whole indust r i a l resources of the State are being organized and put on a war footing, and how materials are being commandeered by the Government in any way they can lay their hands on them. The Government ought not to stop at anything in order to keep the Small Arms Factory working night and day. The output of small arms is the crux of the whole question, and I do not believe, having regard to the resources of Australia, that the Government cannot get the material to make the bronze fittings and other attachments for the rifles. Has a serious effort been made to get this material?",44
361,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I assure the right honourable gentleman that the Minister of Defence made a special visit to the Small Arms Factory with that end in view, but he received certain reports.",44
362,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Can the Assistant Minister tell the Committee what the Ministeiof Defence has done in order to try to get the material? I suppose that some contractor has not supplied the material that has been ordered. My point is that there is plenty of material.in Australia, and it can be obtained; the getting of it is only a matter of organization. Honourable members cannot tell me that for all the rifles we could make there is any shortage of material in Australia. I do not believe such a statement for one moment. I am quite prepared to believe that the material is not in the factory, but it can be put there if an effort at organization were attempted by somebody specially commissioned by the Government.",44
363,Mr ARCHIBALD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,How do you know that there is a shortage of material ?,45
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Peopl e say these things. But if there is no shortage of material, I wish to know why an establishment engaged in making rifles, which are the prime necessity at the moment, can work only one shift a day, and close its gates religiously at o'clock noon on Saturday? If the honourable member is complacently satisfied with the way in which the war is progressing, I tell him plainly that I am not satisfied. The months are roiling on, but our men are not rolling on sufficiently fast. They are doing wonders, but the plain fact is that every one of our men is doing what three men ought to be doing. As Sir John French stated, the trouble at the seat of war is the insufficiency of men and munitions. All Australia has been able to do in nine months has been to send away some 50,000 men, of whom perhaps less than 30,000 are taking part in the fighting at the present time. Such a contribution is not sufficient. It would be enough if the way were clear, but we have not enough men in Flanders and France. That is the complaint. Anybody who reads his newspaper every day will know that this is the complaint which has been made all along. I suppose that the Minister read his newspaper this morning, and saw the statement from a bishop who had just come back from the front to the effect that there is a widespread feeling amongst the men that they are not receiving that support from Home which they should get. suppose people there are talking just as they are here, and are striking an optimistic note, thinking of the tremendous amount that they have already done. So we have done a great deal; but we have not done half enough, in my judgment, and we shall have to do even more before the war is through.",45
365,The CHAIRMAN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,The honourable member's time has expired.,45
366,Mr JH CATTS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Cook) [9.16] - The criticism which is levelled at the administration of the Defence Department with the object of trying to spur the Department to greater efforts in the output of munitions and equipment ought not to be taken as a criticism of a party character in any way. That criticism, I am sure, is the outcome of a patriotic in stinct. As far as the Lithgow factory is concerned, one of the Ministers said just now, I think, that there was a lack of material; and I urge that if there are resources in Australia capable of turning out large supplies of ammunition and war materiel generally, and if these resources are not being utilized to the utmost, that is a reflection not only on the Government, but upon the Aus12 tralian nation, because we know perfectly well that the British Forces and our Allies have not sufficient of this materiel to carry on the war as vigorously aa would be the case if there were an adequate supply. T f , therefore, we can turn out this materiel in excess of what we might require ourselves, it could all be well placed, and, in addition, employment would be given to Australian arti sans and labourers at a time when it is sorely needed, for we learn that at the present time there are 33,000 men out of work in this country. Now, I want to leave that matter for a moment, and direct the Minister's attention to the affairs of the Continental Rubber Company in Sydney. I wish it to be understood that I cannot vouch for the correctness of the statement. I am about to make, but I ask the Minister to look into the matter. The Continental Rubber Company has a factory in Marrickville, Sydney, and I believe that, out of a shareholders' list of about 5,000, all the shares, with the exception of three, are held by residents of Germany. The company came before the Courts recently on a charge of, I think, trading, or attempting to trade, with the enemy, I with the result that the High Court appointed an official to supervise the management of the concern. Now, statements are being made- I received my information from a public man well known in Australia-that this company is being carried on at a loss, and that, because the Commonwealth appointed an official to control its operations, the Commonwealth, therefore, is financially responsible for the loss. That statement does not coincide with my general view regarding the appointment by a Court of an official such as I have described. As far as my knowledge goes, a company, and not a Government, would be responsible for any loss. In the case of a bankrupt where a Bankruptcy Court appointed a receiver, or somebody to take charge temporarily of a business, any loss resulting from the operations of that concern would not fall upon the State. In this case, I cannot conceive that any loss should fall upon the Commonwealth, merely because it was through the action by the Commonwealth that a controller was appointed; but I would like this point to be looked into by the Minister, in order to clear up the doubt. If there is a loss occurring, and the Commonwealth is responsible, then it would appear that the Commonwealth is carrying on a non-paying business of a German firm to enable that German firm to 'take up control again at the conclusion of hostilities, the Commonwealth having tided it over its period of trouble.",45
367,Mr TUDOR,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,A report is furnished regularly regarding the company. assets 'are greater than any liabilities which the Commonwealth might incur.,46
368,Mr JH CATTS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The interjection by the Minister seems to indicate that there is some justification for the statements that have been made regarding the financial responsibilities of the Commonwealth in the conduct of this company's operations. The factory in Sydney is valued at £25,000, and it has been stated that. although the affairs of the company are being carried on at a loss, extensive additions are now being made to the factory, and, furthermore, that this work is in the hands of a German contractor, who is employing German workmen. As I have already said, I cannot vouch for the truth of the statement, but I think we ought to have some information, in order to clear up the position. has been suggested, contracts have not been completed, there would be every justification for any action by the Government in commandeering the whole place and having it put into working order at the earliest possible moment. We know that there must be a considerable demand for motor car tyres, even for the vehicles that are being sent with our Australian troops as our contribution to the war; and, quite apart from that, fchere must be a tremendous demand for rubber tyres for vehicles being used by the B r i tish A r m y and by the Allies.",46
369,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,They were purely an importing firm.,46
370,Mr JH CATTS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"They were, but they have made extensive preparations for manufacture, which, I understand, are uot altogether complete. The factory, when the controller was placed in charge of it , was valued at £25,000, but the work is proceeding at a very slow rate. The Commonwealth having gone to the extent of appointing a controller through the Court, might surely facilitate the work of putting the factory into thorough going order, so as to tur n out supplies urgently required by the British and Allied armies.",46
371,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,The ultimate result of your proposal would be profit to the German company.,46
372,Mr JH CATTS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Certainl y not.,46
373,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The controller merely holds the money in trust for them. Mr JH . CATTS - I would go f u r ther, commandeer the whole thing, and run it as a Government factory u n t i l the war is over, when it could be decided The vvhat should be done with it .",46
374,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Y o u will simply be establishing a business for the ultimate benefit of the German firm.,46
375,Mr JH CATTS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"We shall be establishing something for ourselves while the urgency for these materials exists. When the war is over, and the question of in demnity comes to be settled, I have no doubt that the investments of Germans in Great Britain and Australia, and British investments in enemy territories, will be taken into account. If we have the means to pay ourselves through German investments, surely that is a lever in discussing the terms of settlement.",46
376,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"It depends entirely ou the weight of the counter-lever. . Mr JH CATTS - Certainly . The honourable member must know that the If , as German vessels in our waters are in a somewhat similar position. We are using them for the transport of troops, and partly in our ordinary commercial relations. Some of them have had to be docked and painted, and put in better working order, and it may be said that we are simply improving tbem to hand them back to Germany when the war is over. But that does not prevent us taking advantage of them now, and getting the best we can out of them. As the Minister points out by interjection, every one of the vessels was surveyed and valued when taken over.",46
377,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Y o u are creating by Government instrumentality the good-will in a certain article which will ultimately be used for the profit of the enemy.,47
378,Mr JH CATTS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,If all the obstacles that can be suggested by the honourable gentleman's fertile mind were heeded we should never use the vessels at all. I should like the Minister to confer with the Minister of Trade and Customs and obtain information on the points mentioned.,47
379,Dr CARTYSALMON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Grampians) [9.29] - I desire to. discuss the responsibility for the position of affairs at the Broadmeadows Camp. It has been urged by one honourable member that the medical staff is responsible for a certain number of cases of illness which it is alleged' have been followed to a remarkable degree by death. The medical staff had nothing whatever to do with the selection of the camp, and have very little to do with the routine arrangements of the camp. We were told that there were 150 cases of illness there at one time. I Jo not know whether the present time is meant.",47
380,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I have the latest figures house clutching his rifle. here. There are sixty-four cases at the base hospitals in and around Melbourne, which have been sent away from the camp; twenty of those are accident cases.",47
381,Dr CARTYSALMON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I have also the particulars regarding the men actually ill in camp at the present moment. The policy adopted by the medical staff has been this: When a man falls sick he is not paraded at 6.30 in the morning in the rain, and compelled to wait there until the medical officer comes to examine him. He is attended to by those who are responsible for the platoon or company to which he belongs. He is brought into the hospital tent at the most convenient time to him and to those who bring him. A sick parade at 6.30 a.m. is an almost unheard of thing at this time of the year. No case which shows complications is allowed to remain in the camp. Directly any complication presents itself the man is at once transferred to the base hospital at St. Kilda-road, where he has the very best attention and trained female nurses. There are only fourteen cases of sickness in camp at the present time. Six of them are simple cases of measles, all doing well, and the other eight are simple colds, some of them of an influenzic character. These are facts. They are not based on letters sent fro m hysterical relatives, or those who desire to have at i l t at the Army Medical Service. That is the actual position at Broadmeadows at the present moment, and those fourteen cases are under the care of sixteen legally qualified medical practitioners. What warrant is there, then, for making these alarming statements with regard to the treatment to which the troops are subjected? All the cases were visited today by the - Principal Medical Officer, and fchey are all comfortable and in a thoroughly satisfactory condition.",47
382,Mr FENTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"It is to be hoped that the outrageous statements made will be censored, and not allowed to go forth to the public as facts.",47
383,Dr CARTYSALMON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I hope if they do go forward my statements will go forward also, made as they are with the full knowledge of the responsibility of my position in the House, and in the Army Medical Service. We heard of two sentries being found dead at their posts, or rather that one was found dead at his post, and another in an outI have watched very carefully the reports regarding the camp, especially with respect to the medical side. I have never heard of inquests being held into the causes of the death of two men at the camp. Honourable members will recognise that it would be quite impossible for a medical officer to give a certificate of death in the case of a sentry found, dead at his post. A proper inquiry would have to be conducted into the circumstances surrounding his death. Consequently I leave it to honourable members to judge how much t r u th there can possibly be in the statement, to which I refer. We were also told fchafc fchere had been twenty deaths in fourteen days. As a matter of fact, there has been only one death during that period. We cannot gather together 4,000 or 5,000 men at any place without some of them proving the victims of accident or of disease.",47
384,Mr FENTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,A r e there more accidents and deaths at Broadmeadows than there are at similar camps in other plcic&s ^,48
385,Dr CARTYSALMON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I do not think so. A great deal has also been said in regard to the necessity for providing female nurses at the Broadmeadows hospital. I wish to point out that a great number of the male attendants there are members of the Army Medical Corpsmedical students in their first, second, and third years. Surely it cannot be argued that they are incapable of looking after men who are suffering from.measles or from influenza colds. In addition to these medical students, a number of men were taken from the Melbourne Hospital and drafted into the Army Medical Corps. That corps also includes men who have risen to the rank of sergeant, many of whom are chemists by profession, and who have had plenty of experience in other military camps. It has been suggested that female nurses should be sent to Broadmeadows to attend the sick. It is an admitted fact that female nurses are far better than male nurses, but anybody who has had experience of public m institutions will recognise how impossible it is to employ female nurses without providing them with proper accommodation. What accommodation could be provided for them at Broadmeadows? Of course it may be urged that they could be taken to and from the camp-that they could get their recreation outside. But who would subject them to the fatigue of travelling to and from Broadmeadows, whilst expecting them to efficiently attend to their duties there ? It is hardly possible that their services could be utilized under present conditions. When we recollect that for a considerable time every case that has assumed anything like a serious complexion has been immediately transferred to the base hospital, where patients receive the most up-to-date nursing and the most skilled medical attention, it will be admitted that the authorities have not been lacking in a realization of their duty. I am sorry that I have again had occasion to address the Committee upon this question. Previously I spoke of a danger that I felt was imminent, but I did not suggest that we had to deal with anything like the serious cases to which reference has so frequently been made today-case s which have been brought forward by honourable members upon mere hearsay, which is evidence of a character that one should hesitate to accept when ventilating this question in a deliberative assembly.",48
386,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Wentworth) [9.40] - I am extremely glad to have heard the statement just made by the honourable member for Grampians. If anything has been demonstrated in connection with the present period of mental unrest, it is the absolute necessity which exists for being able to k ill any rumour before it assumes great proportions. At one period of the war every man was prepared to dig up his back yard in order to discover whether any cement foundations were hidden there. At another period there were constant suggestions that things were going wrong. The prime duty of those who occupy responsible positions is to check every rumour of this kind before it is able to inconvenience public activities. Perhaps one of the most important functions of the Minister ought to be to watch public opinion, and whenever he fiuds a mischievous impression which can be refuted gaining ground, to immediately make the facts known, and thus re-establish public calm. I think the Assistant Minister will admit that I have done all that I possibly could to help the Department privately. There is, however, one matter which gives me some concern, and it has reference to our field artillery. At the outbreak of the war I urged that, with a view to allowing our artillery to volunteer for service abroad as units, the men of the various batteries should be called out for continuous training, not for two or three weeks, but until they were fit to meet any artillery which might be, brought against them. I do not think that Australians, because of the pioneering stock from which they spring, need anything like the same period of training as do men of other nationalities. They are also of better physique, I believe, than is any other race on the earth. But a scientific arm like that of artillery requires a considerable training- a training which in the armies of Europe extends over two or three years. I hold that it would have been better if we had been in a position to call out all these batteries. I know that the Assistant Minister would have liked that to have been done. The previous Minister of Defence was anxious to do it . But difficulties were raised difficulties of a technical character which applied only to the training of one or two men on every gun. This opportunity is one which has been allowed to slip. I speak now with less certainty on the question than I would have spoken nine months ago, because, owing to the changes which have taken place, I think that the possibilities of the war being of comparatively short duration are very much better now than they were at that time. But, in my opinion, it is a matter which even now should not be lost sight of, and I hope that my honourable friend will again look into it . Continuous training would be of immense value apart altogether from the actual firing of the guns. . There is one other matter which I ask my honourable friend's consideration, and that is the financial arrangements between the Central Office and the various Commandants. So far as I know, the principle of requisitioning is still in full swing. Everything more or less has still to be requisitioned for, entailing enormous delays and giving rise, not only to the loss which delays in themselves entail, but to a f r i c tion amongst the people from whom we expect the loyalest work, which is more important than the actual delay or loss that one suffers. I think that there is nothing to which a Minister could devote himself personally with greater effect than the question of eliminating red-tape in the ordinary administration of his Department. I suggest to the Assistant Minister that if he were to go up quietly and unostentatiously to a big centre like Sydney, see what works are necessary to be requisitioned for, and observe exactly the latitude which is given to a Commandant, for the sake of argument, before any simply local work can be carried out, he might come to the same conclusion as myself, and that is that it is about time that the mountain of red-tape was cut down and the work of the Department simplified for its proper purposes. Another question I wish to deal with is that of starting artillery factories and generally increasing our ammunition possibilities. I know that in this country we have begun to consider ourselves somewhat in a sort of backwater of the world's industrial progress. That is a p it y - I am not speaking of the other side of the House",48
387,Mr MAHONY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,We consider ourselves right in the forefront.,49
388,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I am afraid we are uot. I fear that in this country we have shown ourselves to be probably the only community under the British Elag which is not trying to increase its possibilities in the directions I have indicated. Take, for in stance, the manufacture of guns. I admit at once that the question of materials presents difficulties. But I do not think that w e would haveT had any real trouble in getting from America, for instance, the steel and various other things we would have required. At any rate, it would have been of enormous advantage to us to know that we had made a start. I think that even now the attention of the Government to might well be directed to the matter, in order to make a start with the manufacture of artillery and various other things which are necessary in order that we may be self-supporting in connection with the output of war materials. But artillery I place as extremely important, and in this connection I invite my honourable friend in charge of the Department to consider whether we might not be utilizing some of the artillery materiel we have in Australia today. Very sensibly the Government have decided to send, away the garrison gunners, who will be equipped with their siege artillery on the other side of the world. In the samesense entirely, if we are-not prepared to send more field batteries f u l ly equipped, we might send the guns. I can conceive of no international possibility u n t i l this particular war is over which requires the Commonwealth to keep here guns which it is not using. I am not going to put the matter higher than that for obvious reasons. I do in vite my honourable friend to see whether he cannot take that course. Goods lying idle when they are wanted are goods wasted. Here are guns which might be used. If we have not the gunners to send with them, let us make a balance, and send the guns. Let us, by all manner of means, do what we possibly can.",49
389,Mr BURNS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,There are guns and gunners who want to go.,49
390,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I admit that it was not my honourable friends opposite who were not prepared to act upon my suggestion in the first place. I believe they acted upon departmental advice, but I do say that had they called these men out for continuous training they would have had the field,batteries volunteering for active service en masse; because every one wbo is interested in citizen training is anxious to secure this unique opportunity to fit himself for a noble profession.",49
391,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Are you seriously suggesting that we should send away the guns we have for the defence of Australia?,50
392,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I certainly do. What else have you done; why should you not?,50
393,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,You have an extraordinary notion of defence.,50
394,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I am not an admiral of a training ship.,50
395,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I think you are a bit of that point. on as to talk like that.,50
396,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Of what use is a field gun in Australia today? These are here for the defence of Australia certainly-lik e all the other field guns have been sent away from here.  honourable gentleman did not see the use of an army or a navy.,50
397,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"If the honourable memis ber will look into the facts that I strenuously opposed, in this House, the small torpedo navy which vocating, and which could not have done what the Sydney and the Australia have done.  of their service in the Old Country day.",50
398,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Of the torpedo boats? ,50
399,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"That is a point I am coming to. We have a few torpedo boats on our coast, and the men in them are very anxious to get away; in fact, there is not a man in our Navy who is not anxious to get away. Why should they not be allowed to go?",50
400,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I can tell the honourable member.,50
401,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Unti l the honourable member for Henty came to the conclusion that I was an as, because I thought that we ought to send the field artillery guns out of Australia, this discussion ceeding on temperate lines.",50
402,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I did not say those guns.,50
403,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I was talking of nothe guns are of no use. thing else but field artillery guns from start to finish.,50
404,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Yes , you were.",50
405,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,If the honourable memher had awaked earlier in the discussion might have understood it.,50
406,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,You are so smart that you will trip over yourself directly if you do not take care.,50
407,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,There has been a lot said to-night about sending more men to the front. I think I am fairly safe in saying that in proportion to population Australia has sent a greater number than any other Dominion.,50
408,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I do not want to argue that at all.,50
409,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Ye t we are being condemned wholesale.,50
410,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I do not want to argue I have not been dealing with the matter in that light.,50
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I should doubt field-guns that statement very much.,50
412,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I am suggesting to the which Assistant Minister ways by which he could do more, and I am sure that he ago the does not resent that.",50
413,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Not at all.,50
414,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I am convinced that he as anxious as any one else to do more he will find if it can be done.,50
415,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I do not want a false he was adimpression to be created.,50
416,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I think that we can do a bit in the way of sending out the field guns that we have lying idle. I have to put it clearly, because otherwise the honto-' orable memher for Henty would not understand it. We have field guns lying idle-som e of them in store-and they might be utilized as I suggest. But if the Minister cannot send the guns, let him send the gunners without them.",50
417,Mr WEST,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Of what size are they?,50
418,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,They are the modern 18-pounder guns.,50
419,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Would you be prepared to see Australia unprotected if something were to happen?,50
420,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I do not think that a field gun in store is a protection.,50
421,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,It is handy.,50
422,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"If you are not training with a gun, or using it, you might as well was prohave it on the field.",50
423,Mr WEST,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,My information is that,50
424,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I can assure my honourable friend that these are the modern British field pieces. The Minister can give him the exact number of 18-pounders he that we have lying in store here. They ought to be used. We know the great difficulty which the factories in England have in turning out a sufficient number of guns for the front. We cannot, unfortunately, help at this stage with ammunit i o n ; but at least let us send guns if we can do so, and cannot send the gunners with them. I am. sorry to have broken into this debate at this late hour of the evening. I have only done so for the purS )se of assisting those in charge of the epartment; and I hope thai the Minister will take a note of what I have said, and, particularly, go up to Sydney, and look into things, where he will find that he can do endless good. I presume that the Home Affairs Department is carrying out the military works in connection with barracks and central just as it was doing when I was administering the Department. will need to watch one side of that work rather closely. A lot of money may be wasted by killing enthusiasm. It is better to spend a pound or two more and keep people keen than to make them unhappy by retrenching to an extent that will not be felt. I understand that the Home Affairs Department is building for the Defence Department a number of so called temporary huts, to be used for military hospital purposes. In a place like Sydney, one could not be expected to be happy under a galvanized-iron roof.",50
425,Mr ABCHIBALD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,-The Home Affairs Department is not erecting such buildings. Mr JENSEN.^-No r is the Defence Department erecting them for hospital purposes. It is going to erect good buildings.,51
426,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I have seen such buildings in oourse of erection.,51
427,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,For hospitals?,51
428,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Yes . The galvanized iron was lying in readiness. Mr JENSEN,-We are putting up huts to accommodate soldiers.",51
429,Mr KELLY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The huts to which I refer are to be used for hospital purposes. The matron of the hospital told me that that was to be their use. Every one who occupies those huts will feel that he has a grievance. I do not know whether the inmates are to be invalids sent back from the front , or sick cases from Liverpool, but, in my opinion, the roofs are not suitable. Ruberoid would be almost as cheap as galvanized iron, and would make a cooler roof, and give satisfaction.",51
430,Mr BOY D,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Henty) [9.58] - There are a few matters that I would like to put before the Minister. Judging by the honourable member for Wentworth, the new way of making speeches is to ask a series of questions, and obtain information as you go along.",51
431,Mr ANSTEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Not a bad way, either.",51
432,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"It is a good way when you have nothing to say. W it h regard to the Broadmeadows camp, I think that if the land were properly drained, the situation would be found as good as any in Victoria, unless one with sandy soil were obtained. It has been pointed out by those who know the site well that by proper draining it could be kept dry, places though the soil, when wet, becomes a blue, sticky mud. That could be prevented by Tou throwing down ashes, or gravel, or by making asphalt paths. According to the statistics of the life insurance societies, if you took any 10,000 persons in the community, you would find that at the end of twelve months 120 of them would be dead; but if you chose 10,000 persons whom a medical examination had declared to be perfectly healthy you would find at the end of twelve months that only f if t y of them were dead. The men at Broadmeadows may be considered picked lives, and, according to the in formation of the life insurance societies, in the natural course of events, fifty of every 10,000 such men would die within a year. Therefore I do not find any quarrel with the Government regarding the site of the camp or its management. The questions that have been asked in this cliamber, and the discussions that have arisen here since the war, have been prompted mostly by the complaints of constituents, who desire that the best shall be done for their sons who have volunteered for the front ; but we must all sympathize with those who are saddled with the great responsibility of administering the affairs of the nafcion afc this juncture. This is the first war worth speaking of with which Australia has been associated, the Boer war being a trumpery affair in comparison. Mistakes will therefore necessarily be made, and it is the desire of every member, in voicing complaints from time to time, not to find fault so much as to give opportunity for the correction of mistakes that have been made, and for the prevention of such as might be made. I have been informed on more than one occasion that men who have since left for the front were five months at Broadmeadows without being given practice in the firing of a rifle. The reply of the Department was that they would have time for that when they got to Egypt. Judging by the results at Gallipoli, they have been taught pretty well, and whether they learned to shoot here or in Egypt is of little moment so long as they are able to use their rifles with precision when in the fighting line. But I have been told that after having been months in training at Broadmeadows many of them did not know how to load and sight a rifle. Considering the large area of open country behind the Broadmeadows Camp, it should have been possible to provide rifle ranges there, if were not convenient to take the men to Williamstown. I understand that there is very little shooting at the Williamstown butts during the greater part of the day.",51
433,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"There is a great deal. I have been there three or four times, and have always seen a large number there.",52
434,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I believe there is more than there was, but, in any case, the men at Broadmeadows are not being sufficiently trained in rifle shooting. Lord Kitchener, when he desired to enroll territorial troops, declared that the first essential was to shoot, and to shoot accurately; and therefore we ought, as far as circumstances permit, to enable men to obtain the necessary training before fchey leave Australia. In all probability the reinforcements now going away will not have the same opportunity in Egypt for practice that the first contingents had; and it is necessary, before they leave, that they should, for their own preservation, have every opportunity to make themselves proficient marksmen.",52
435,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,They are being taught the use of the bayonet here.,52
436,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Yes ; and I believe they are doing very well, although I am not one of those who can swallow the statement that an Australian can put a bayonet into five men, one after .the other, and toss them over his shoulder. Even a man of the magnificent stature and evident strength of the Assistant Minister of Defence would not be able to perform a feat of that kind. There is another matter that is causing anxiety, though it is one for which, as a matter of fact, the Government are not responsible. I refer to the difficulty that the parents of our soldiers have in getting information about their wounded sons. I can quite understand the Minister of Defence and his colleague, plied as they are with questions from all sides, urging that information should be given in this or that case, getting a little callous. The word "" callous "" is, perhaps, not the proper one to use in this connection, and 1 would rather say that they must be getting somewhat surfeited w ith such r questions and requests. It must be remembered, however, that the questions are prompted by the anxiety of fathers and mothers who have sent their boys to the front to fight for their country, and who find that, being wounded, their sons have been sent to some hospital we know not where. It is most natural that they it sliould ask the parliamentary representative of the district to find out, if possible, where their wounded relatives have been sent, so fchafc communication may be opened up with them. We have been informed by the Assistant Minister that every opportunity will be given, and is given, to transmit free cables to men who have been. seriously or dangerously wounded; and for this, of course, the public are very thankful. But I should like to see established at the principal base in Egypt some responsible official, or officials, whose sole duty it would be to find out to which country and hospital members of the different units have been sent, and communicate the facts to the Defence Department here at the earliest moment. This would enable parents, who so desired, to cable at their own expense inquiries as to their sons' welfare. This object might be attained by handing over the duty of collecting such information to some clerical branch of the Defence Porce at the base; and I am satisfied that it would prove of great value to the public. Another matter to which I should like £o call attention has fco do with the prescribed height of recruits. The British Government, I believe, bave reduced the standard from 5 f t . 4 in. or 5 f t . 4^ in. to 5 f t . 2 in . , and we have in this community quite a number of men below the standard height we have fixed, who are anxious and competent to serve, and are as physically fit as many a man of greater height. In modern warfare a man of 5 f t . 2 in. ought to be quite as able to shoulder a rifle, fire a shot, and do the necessary marching, as any man of 5 f t . 4 in., or even 5 f t . 10 in.",52
437,Mr ABCHIBALD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,What about using the bayonet?  Home Affairs use the bayonet?,52
438,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I was thinking of the Minister of Trade and. Customs and the Minister of Home Affairs, who are both Undersized, and really I should not care to stand up in front of either of them armed with a bayonet. I am quite satisfied that, so far as their strength in provessel portion to their height is concerned, they would he quite as competent to handle a bayonet, as men of greater size. smaller men have usually as much strength in proportion to their physique as have bigger men; and after some considerable experience of workmen in different walks of life, I find that the short, thick-set person can do as hard a day's work as his taller brother, and is generally more competent.",53
439,Mr JH CATTS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Small men have not the same reach with the bayonet as have bigger men.,53
440,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The main point in the use of the bayonet is strength; and from all we can gather from newspaper photographs of men in the trenches, it is not a case of one standing up against another, but rather that the bayonet is used in some other way. There is a story told of a man who, going to the front, asked a tailor to put a brass plate over his heart as a protection. In action he was the first man to run away, and in his flight he was shot. ""When he fell down, thinking that he was about to die, he was in a. dreadful state; but he suddenly realized that he was not so badly wounded as he thought; in fact, he found he was not wounded at, nil, and the only comment he made was that the tailor knew better where his heart was than he knew himself. Such a story, of course, could not be told of our men, and it certainly does not apply to men who are undersized. If there is any diminution in the applications for enlistment, the widest latitude should be given to enable men under what we call the standard height to join the reinforcements. A matter that can be discussed in a very few words is that of the censoring of news, and of information regarding the movements of troops. During the Boer war, the whole of the people of Australia knew every movement connected with the despatch of troops.",53
441,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,But did the Boers have a fleet?,53
442,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"2sTo , and I quite agree with the Assistant Minister that the policy that has been pursued by the Department was a correct and wise one, so long as there was the slightest danger of any of our troop-ships being followed or torpedoed on the ocean. At the present time, however, the enemy has not a single floating on the water, and there is, therefore, no reason for the strict censorship that we are experiencing in this The regard. The publication broadcast of every movement of our troops in Australia would be absolutely useless to the enemy. ""What could be more encouraging than the sight of troops going away, and being farewelled by their relatives and friends as they are leaving for the front? That used to be the practice always in Great Britain, and it was also the practice here. I happened to be on the railway pier as a privileged spectator on the occasion of the departure of the first contingent. There was a good deal of excitement when a picket Avas placed at the head of the pier. Thousands of people were at that send-off, and they broke through the picket like a flood of water rushing over a Aveir-and what harm Avas done? The regulations which may have been all right at the time they were adopted, ought now to be abolished, for there is absolutely no danger, and no reason why peoplo should be shut off when troops are being placed on board ship. The public ought to have every opportunity of seeing the ships depart, and I think the Minister might well make a recommendation to that effect to his colleagues.",53
443,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Do you not think some other consideration should be given to that matter? Does the honourable member think there are no enemies within the Commonwealth ?,53
444,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"But supposing there are, what can they do?",53
445,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Well , we are taking every precaution, and Ave are going to continue to do so. If we allowed such reasons as that to influence us, we should be hoAvled doAvn from the other side.",53
446,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,There is absolutely no reason today why information should not be given as to the movement of troops.,53
447,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I am talking about the risks of alloAving people to go on board ship, or alongside.",53
448,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"They need not necessarily go on board ship, but they might go on to the piers and see them off.",54
449,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,They could do a good deal of damage from the pier.,54
450,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"But with regard to the movement of troops, the matter is talked about everywhere. I can tell the honourable member when the next contingent is going away. He never informed me; I got my information in the street.",54
451,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Then what are you complaining about?,54
452,Mr BOYD,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I am not complaining. I am only saying that, when information is so well known, it ought to be made public officially,, so that the parents the people generally wbo want to see sons or friends leave for the front, may have an opportunity of doing so. The Government can have no object in trying to keep the thing secret when they know they are unable to succeed. With regard to the censoring of news, I do not think there is the slightest doubt that news has been censored here after it has been passed by the British censor and published in the British press. The Prime Minister promised to look into the matter the other day, and make a statement to the House. He has not done so up one? to the present-probabl y he has not had any information from Home. In a community like this, democratic in spirit and temperament, the people are naturally anxious to get all the information they can; and it is probably hard for our stituents to realise that Ministers are placed in such a position that they cannot give information broadcast; but there is a great difference between a situation of that kind and the timidity that exists in giving any information at all. I think the Minister, upon reflection, might strike a happy mean, and give information that would be interesting to us, and of no value to an enemy, even though he might be in our midst.",54
453,Mr MCGRATH,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Ballarat). [10.20] Before we depart from this item, I should like the Minister to give an explanation of the matter raised by the honourable member for Bourke in connection with the charge made by Private Campbell in reference to the purchase of pyjamas, which he stated had been presented by the Red Cross Society for the use of the soldiers at Rabaul. In the course of his speech the honourable member for Bourke, dealing with the official report of the proceedings, read out a statement that Campbell was alleged to have .confessed that he had written an untruthful statement to the Sun newspaper. I have here the file of papers with the report of the trial, and in this report it is stated that there was a confession. The remarkable thing about it all is that the confession has not been produced, and from what I can see of the report of the inquiry, it was not produced there. Yet at the inquiry Campbell denied having made any confession. The situation is a remarkable one. One would have thought that the first action of those in charge of the inquiry, after or Campbell's denial that he had confessed to their an untruth had been made, would have been to produce Campbell's confession. Yet it has not been produced. The Minister of Defence, Senator Pearce, speaking in the Senate, is reported to have said that he had a copy of Campbell's confession. The other night the Assistant Minister told us that the Minister of Defence had not received a copy of the confession.",54
454,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,That is quite correct; he has not.,54
455,Mr MCGRATH,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,He has not received,54
456,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"No . Mr MoGRATH - He is reported to have stated the day before yesterday that he had received it. At any rate, this is a serious reflection upon the officers encongaged on that inquiry. Either an injustice is being done to them or to Private Campbell, and we certainly ought to have that confession produced. If Campbell made a confession, why has it not been placed upon the file of papers purporting to contain all the particulars in connection with this inquiry that was laid upon the Library table? Yet this most important, document is absent. Surely we ought to have some statement from the Assistant Minister of Defence as to where that document has gone to, if it ever existed. It must be remembered that Campbell absolutely denies that he signed any confession. We have no proof that he did sign a confession, and yet upon that alleged confession this report was drawn up. If the Minister is not prepared to make a definite statement as to what further action the Defence Department or the Minister intends to take, I can promise him that something more will he said before the Estimates go through. I will exercise my right to deal with the matter on every possible occasion until we get some furthe r inquiry iuto this matter, which the Minister could settle at once. If the officers who are reported to have obtained that confession will produce it there will be no more trouble. I will leave it at that, trusting that the Minister will make some statement now regarding that confession.",54
457,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Bass-Assistant M in ister of Defence) [10.23] - I have had a consultation with the Minister of Defence, and be assures me that no such confession has been received by him or by his Department. It has been stated that this confession was sent by the Administrator from Eabaul to the Defence Department in Melbourne. The Minister assures me that he is not in possession of any such document, and that if he had had i the would have been only too pleased to have produced it , in order to satisfy honourable members.",55
458,Mr MCGRATH,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I believe he would.,55
459,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"""Why condemn the Minister of Defence? If he had possession of that document he would certainly have produced it .",55
460,Mr MCGRATH,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I am not condemning the Minister; I am condemning the officers.,55
461,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"T he honourable member is condemning the officers, and yet he says that unless he gets some statement from the Minister concerned, or if the paper is not produced, he will keep on raising this question. If the Minister had the confession he would produce it quickly, in order to prove his officers' statements. It has been said that the paper in question was posted at Rabaul by the Administrator, but the Minister has not yet received it .",55
462,Mr JH CATTS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I understand that sufficient time has not elapsed to allow of the arrival of the mail. Is that so?,55
463,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"It may be, but I doubt it . As to the debate that has taken place regarding the Broadmeadows Camp, I think it is to be regretted that honourable members should allow their better judgment to be carried away by outside statements made to them on the subject. We have had to-night a report from the principal medical officer in charge of the camp, which absolutely upsets nearly every statement that has been made by honourable members regarding cases of sickness at the camp.",55
464,Mr RODGERS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Not at a ll .,55
465,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,It does.,55
466,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,That document is misleading.,55
467,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I have further information which will perhaps be interesting to the Leader of the Opposition, who contends that the document is misleading because it refers to only some fourteen cases-si x cases of measles and eight cases of influenza. There are only sixty-four cases being dealt with outside the camp. All these are being treated at the base hospital, which is situated at the Victoria Barracks, and twenty-four are the result of accidents. That being so, apart from the fourteen concerning which I have already given information, there are only forty cases of sickness outside the camp. We have, and have had for some time, some 6,000 soldiers or recruits at the camp, so that the percentage of sickness is very small. Yet we have had honourable members making absolutely misleading statements concerning sickness at the Broadmeadows Camp which will be published broadcast amongst the people. I believe that honourable members have been actuated by the best of motives, but simply because they are button-holed first by one and then by another, and erroneous statements are presented to them, they make these allegations.",55
468,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Is there no truth in the statement regarding the number of deaths at Broadmeadows?,55
469,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"From information I have received, I can say that there has been only one death at Broadmeadows Camp during the last fortnight. I shall have prepared a statement for presentation to.the House tomorrow, giving the record for the last month. As to the Small Arms Factory, I think the least said the better at this stage.",55
470,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Why ?,55
471,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Because the Government are looking into the matter, and are going to do the best they can for every one.",55
472,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,But they have looked into it .,55
473,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"And are still looking into it . I have no further information to give the Committee to-night concerning the factory. I am not going to make any admission, but shall allow the matter to stand over for another twenty-four or forty-eight hours, when, in all probability, honourable members will hear something, of it . The honourable member for Hunter has said that officers who are trained here, but are under twenty-three years of age, are not allowed to go to the front. If an officer under the age of twenty-three years shows special ability he is not stopped from going to the front .",55
474,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,That is the There are so few who seem to be recognised as having special ability.,56
475,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"It is not the trouble - Mr JENSEN We are not short of officers. We have many over twenty-three years of age who are available for service at the front ; but I repeat that if any officer under the age of twenty-three years shows special ability he is not prevented from going to the front.  for the services of every officer in the Imperial service who is medically fit, whether he is over or under the regulation age. The Minister says that we have plenty to spare. Why do we not send these officers to the front, seeing that Lord Kitchener wants them?",56
476,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,It is for the Prime Minister to answer that question. He alone can make an offer to the Imperial authorities.,56
477,Mr CHARLTON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Is the Department appointing as officers men under twentythree years of age who have had littl e or no previous experience? ,56

479,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,The honourable member has seen fit to select an isolated case concerning which he has heard something very similar to the statements we have heard about other matters to-night.,56
480,Mr MCGRATH,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,I have it from honourable gentleman's own lips that what I have said is true-that this officer was only six weeks in camp when he was made an officer.,56
481,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,The honourable member had a report from the Departmentuot a statement by me.,56
482,Mr MCGRATH,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,It is just the same.,56

484,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,That the officer to whom the honourable member for Ballarat refers had former experience-that he had proper training and had undergone certain instruction.,56
485,Dr CARTY SALMON,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Is he the officer trouble. whom the honourable member for Ballarat said had never worn a uniform ?,56
486,Mr MCGRATH,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Yes . - I am afraid that some honourable members become interested in certain persons as the result of being pestered. I am pestered from morning t ill night by persons seeking promotion. The Minister of Defence leaves to the Selection Board in each State the making of recommendations for promotion. The Board makes a careful inquiry concerning the claim of any officer seeking promotion, and then submits its recommendation to the Minister for approval or otherwise. Promotions are made only in that way. There is no political or M i nisterial influence.  fluence.",56
487,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,That is a reflection on the officers of the Department.,56
488,Mr MATHEWS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,That is what I meant.,56
489,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The Selection Board consists of officers of high standing and repute in the Commonwealth, and yet we have it suggested that nothing that is done in the Department in this regard is clean. I should be glad if honourable members would disabuse their minds of such an idea. Surely wo have not reached such a position in the Commonwealth. We ought to be proud of our Forcesproud of the way in which they have been brought together and proud of what they are doing.",56
490,Mr ANSTEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Bourke) [10.34] - Dur ing this debate many grievances relating to the Department of Defence have been ventilated by honourable members on both sides, and certain complaints have been the formulated by them. We are now told by the Assistant Minister of Defence that honourable members who make these charges are mere receptacles of idle r u mours and baseless statements having no foundation whatever in fact. I have heard certain statements made in reference to the Lithgow Small Arms Factory, the miserable treatment of the sick at Broadmeadows, the medical omcers, and so forth, and the matter of promotion. I have had dozens of petitions brought to me, but I have always said that unless the men were prepared to set down their complaints in black and white I was not willing to say anything about them. All I have to say now is that if all these statements about the medical treatment of the sick, the medical officers, and the question of promotion, are baseless, we have at Broadmeadows the greatest aggregation of liars that could be got together in any part of the world.",56
491,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,The Minister has ascertained that the scale of rations at Broadmeadows is absolutely the best in the world.,57
492,Mr ANSTEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"I am not saying whether it is or not. I simply say that if all these accusations are baseless, if they are only idle rumours, we have at Broadmeadows the greatest aggregation of liars on the face of the earth. statement of a man named Long. writes that he had an in j u r y to his shoulder, and that his commanding officer gave him a note to take to the hospital. He says that he went to the hospital and stood there for two hours in the wet, and then when he got inside and showed the note, the doctor said, ' ' What is the matter with you?"" and he said, "" I think I have dislocated my shoulder."" doctor then asked, "" Where is your for m ? "" and the man replied, "" There is the note from my commanding officer."" This man says that the doctor then said, ""Get it on the proper for m . "" He replied, ' ' That is all my commanding officer gave me. I think that I have my shoulder out,"" but the doctor said, "" I do not care if you have broken your b- - neck; go back and get it on the proper for m . """,57
493,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Who was the man, and who was the medical officer ?",57
494,Mr ANSTEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"That is only one W it h all respect and deference to, and without any desire to augment the troubles of, the Minister, I ask what the duty of Minister should be? It is not to support wasters among the ranks or incompetency among the higher officers. It is to elicit Liberal? the truth , to investigate every accusato tion, and see what lies behind it cept nothing as a fact u n t i l it has been properly investigated; to hold the scales fairly and see that justice is applied doing. to all . To-day we had a statement by the Leader of the Opposition, and then the report of Colonel Cuscaden waa produced, upon which the honourable member for Swan spoke to the honourable member for Parramatta, and that honourable member then pointed out that Colonel Cuscaden was not referring to the whole body of sick men, but merely to the few who happened to be in camp during the day. It was shown that the statement to the effect that there were only a very few cases of measles and influenza in the camp had no application to the men who had been sent to hospitals outside the camp. If Colonel Cuscaden made his report in reply to the assertions made in the Chamber, liis statement, which any Minister would accept in good faith, and which purported to be, and actually was, an answer to the statements as to the amount of sickness in the camp, misled the Minister, inasmuch as it did not refer to the men sent to the hospital. Therefore, Colonel Cuscaden ought to be reprimanded for a dereliction I have the of duty. He",57
495,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Colone l Cuscaden distinctly says that the numbers mentioned covered those whom he found at the camp on his visit. I have already explained that there are sixty-four cases at the base hospital, of which twenty-four are accident cases; and that is the total sickness among the troops in Melbourne today. The It is a very small percentage.",57
496,Mr ANSTEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Then we come to this position: there is nothing wrong at the camp, the camp is as clean as can be, the food is the best that can be supplied, no one is sick, the officers are the purest that can be got, and the men are the rottenest liars on the face of the earth; and it is the one ultimate duty of the Minister to support his higher officers and nofcfcomake investigations. Now I come to the point on which the honourable member for Ballarat took action in regard fco the so-called case. sale of Red Cross goods in New Guinea. Several questions were asked in regard to this matter dealing with the honesty and the integrity of the report furnished to the Minister. I put one question. What :s the duty of any Government, Labour or Is it to shelter its officers or elicit the truth , and give fair play to ; to acthe humblest man in the ranks?",57
497,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"It is to elicit the truth , and that is what the Government are",57
498,Mr ANSTEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"If they are doing so, there is no harm in my speaking. If they are not doing so, there id still no harm in my speaking. A certain man in New Guinea, Private Campbell, having in a letter to his mother made statements which appeared in the Sydney press, the Minister of Defence sent a telegram to New Guinea, and asked the Commanding Officer, Colonel Holmes, for an explanation; and Colonel Holmes, in his reply, said, "" This man is a liar, and he has confessed that he is. In the presence of Colonel Watson, Captain Lane, and Major Maguire, he made a written confession. It was made in duplicate, and one copy was sent to the Sydney Sun, the other I hold."" And so the matter went on, until Senator Millen raised a question the other day, as the result of which an inquiry was held in Sydney, where Private Campbell swore that he had never made a confession, and said that the officers who had made the statement that he had done so were perjurers and conspirators. Colonel Holmes, Major Maguire, and Colonel Watson went into that inquiry and swore that this private soldier had made a written confession; and Colonel Holmes said, "" I have the confession."" The court of inquiry was put in the position of having to judge between the man and his officers. Either the officers were perjurers, or the man was a perjurer. The man said, ' ' I stick to my original statement. I do not deviate one point from it. If these officers swear that I made a confession, they are perjurers and conspirators."" The coiirt was in the predicament that it had to judge between officers and a private soldier; but was it not the duty of the officer presiding at such a court to say, "" Since we have to judge between you, and since so many have sworn that this man made a confession, and you, Colonel Holmes, say that you possess it, it is fair to ask that confession is. It was right that it should be preserved and presented to the court, for then the man can be proved to be a perjurer, and what he says about the Red Cross goods is false."" But did the president of the court ask that? No. If the Government wish to elicit the truth; if they believe in justice for the poorest as well as for the rich, and for the lowest as well as for the high-fiv e days have now elapsed since the honourable member for Ballarat put his question - wa s it not their duty to say to Colonel Ramaciotti, who was in charge of this court, "" How did you dare to give a verdict on evidence that you did hot see or hear? Why did you not ask Colonel Holmes to produce this document?"" The man who did not ask for its production ought to have been considered unfit to hold the position of president of such a court That was the first stage. When this question was raised in the Senate and in this House it was the duty of this Government, if they wanted to elicit the truth, and to do justice, to say to Colonel Holmes, "" Where is that document which you swore in the court you possessed, and upon the foundation of which that soldier was condemned?"" Five days have elapsed, and the Government have not yet put that question to the president of the court martial or to Colonel Holmes. Until Colonel Holmes produces that confession to this Parliament he is unfit and unworthy to hold a commission in the Army of this country. Colonel Holmes wrote to the Minister of Defence on the 8th May, "" Colonel Watson handed me a copy of a letter of explanation, which had been written to the Sun newspaper, and I then wrote to you and forwarded a copy of Campbell's letter."" Did he? The file I hold is headed "" Alleged Sale of Red Cross Pyjamas at Rabaul,"" and it professes to contain all the documents pertaining to that incident. Where is that letter? The trouble first arose when the honourable member for Illawarra raised the question in the House in December last. Following that question, the Minister of Defence sent a cable to Rabaul, in reply to which Colonel Holmes intimated that he had written a letter which the Minister of Defence subsequently said he had received. Now we are told that the Minister did not receive the letter. What are we to believe? Did where the Minister receive a letter or did he not? Colonel Holmes stated the other day that he had received a confession; now he says that he has not received it. If he has received that confession it is his duty to produce it. This file, that purports to contain all documents in relation to the alleged sale of Eed Cross pyjamas, does not contain all the preliminary documents in connection with the case. A private soldier is charged with having committed perjury against his officers; if he did commit perjury he should be in gaol. In this case we have a repetition of the Dreyfus case, although not on so gigantic a scale, and there is a modern Esterhazy, who swore in court that a man had made a confession that he had not made. It is not the duty of the Government to protect an officer because he is an officer, but to ever seek to elicit the truth and to do justice, no matter who is injured. What are we interested in if it is not in the securing of justice for all?",58
499,Mr BRENNAN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Hav e not these officers made an explanation of why they cannot get the confession?,59
500,Mr ANSTEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"We cannot get an explanation. Is not the elucidation of this matter as much to the interest of every honest officer in the Australian Forces as of the public generally? The Assistant Minister of Defence stated the other day that we were making attacks on officers as if none of them was honourable, but that is not trite. Amongst the humblest who fight in the ranks there are no doubt some discreditable men, but in the in terest bf the country the Army should be purged of all such men, no matter what positions they may hold. It does not follow that all are bad because some have been found at fault. The great bulk of the men in our Defence Forces are clean and honourable, and the exposure of the exceptions is no reflection upon the others. In the interest cleanliness of the Army the poorest soldier who fights for his country should have in this Parliament a champion of his rights. The clearing up of this matter should not be delayed. Before Colonel Holmes is allowed to hold another command in the Army he ought to be called upon to produce the confession which he claims to have received.",59
501,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,Why go to Colonel Holmes for the confession? You have said that the Minister has stated that he received it .,59
502,Mr FISHER,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,The Minister did not that.,59
503,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,There is a difference between a letter and a confession.,59
504,Mr ANSTEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"We are told by Colonel Watson that this confession was taken in duplicate. One copy was sent to the Sydney Sim, but disappeared, for it never arrived at its destination, and the other was sent to the Minister. We have two statements from the Minister; one that he did receive the confession, and another that he did not.",59
505,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"If the Minster says that he received it , why trouble about Colonel Holmes?",59
506,Mr BURNS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,The Minister says that he received the letter; that is not the confession.,59
507,Mr ANSTEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,The honourable member for Parramatta wishes to m i x up the copy of the confession with the confession itself. Mr JosErii COOK - I understood you to say that the Minister stated that he had received a copy of the confession.,59
508,Mr JENSEN,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,The Minister says he has not received it .,59
509,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,The honourable member for Bourke says that the Minister stated that he had received a copy of the confession.,59
510,Mr ANSTEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Perhaps I had better ex2Dlain the whole incident. In the first case, Colonel Watson swore that the man Campbell made a confession in duplicate. One copy was sent to the Sydney Sim, but never arrived at that office, and the other was held by Colonel Holmes, in whose hands it must still remain. Then Colonel Holmes asserted that he had sent a copy of the confession to the Minister.",59
511,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,And the Minister said he received it .,59
512,Mr ANSTEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,And then he said he of the did not.,59
513,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,But did the Minister say that he received the confession?,59
514,Mr ANSTEY,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The Minister of Defence stated in the Senate on 7th May that he had sent a telegram to Colonel Holmes in regard to statements which had been made in Parliament, and then he went on to say, "" I have here the report of Colonel Holmes, which had apparently been drafted before our in quiry reached liim, because it commences, &c."" Having read the report, the Minister interpolated this remark: "" Then f o l say lows the letter which has been quoted by Senator Millen. "" What was the letter quoted by Senator Millen? Senator Millen referred to the alleged confession of the man Campbell, and then followed the statement of the confession made by Campbell. That is what I am complaining about. Which is true: The statement in Hansard, or the assertion that the Government did not receive the copy? If it is true that the Minister of Defence did receive a copy of the confession, the right honourable member for Parramatta is correct in his deductions. But we have the statement made since, wherein the Minister of Defence said he never received such a confession from Colonel Holmes. In the interests of common justice it is the duty of this Parliament to have this matter cleared up. That is a fair statement, and surely I cannot be charged with acting improperly towards the Ministry in making the demand. It is a matter which should receive the support of every member in this Chamber who loves trut h and justice, and wishes to see these principles applied to the rich and poor alike.",59
515,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,It certainly ought to be cleared up.,60

The president of the court martial ought to be asked, "" Why did you not ask f the production of the confession by Private Campbell ? "" Colonel Holmes swore that evidence produced. he had the confession in his possession, and surely he should have produced it . What became of the document which was stated was sent on to the Minister? It is a fair inference that, in order cloak up their crimes, the officers entered into a conspiracy with the object of comcourt's mitting perjury.",60

Do not make any doubt about I say that whether the court was in it or not, at least Colonel Ramaciotti failed i his duty as president of the court.

The pyjamas in question were purchased by Private Jones in my commy pany, and paid 23s. for the two suits. When he arrived at the garrison barracks, he was admiring the suits, and discovered Red Cross tickets in the pockets by Mrs Dalton, of mon, and Miss Wilson, of Vaucluse. As far as writing to the newspaper is concerned, I never wrote the report. The only description of the affair was written to my mother, who was connected with Red Cross duties. I might also mention that, as soon as word came hand that the report had by some unknown source drifted into publication, I was promptly sent for by O.C. Troops. I was asked what I meant by writing to the Sydney newspapers about the tactics that were going on. I rereceived plied saying that I never wrote to the paper, and I was at that time under that my mother inserted the report, but have since learnt that no report was inserted mother. After the discussion at the Troops' office, I was ordered to pack traps and report to the O.C. Troops' office at 2 p.m., which I did, and was promptly away on board the s.s. Meklong, and away as ship's guard to deliver various stores to outlying islands, with the of the way, and give Colonel Holmes a chance to get to Sydney and hush the matter up. That does .not sound like the letter of a weak-minded manWhile I was away, Colonel Holmes left for Sydney with a small detachment of troops the s.s. Eastern. Independent of Colonel Holmes' instructions to keep me away and me to sign on in the tropics for four months after the war, and keep me quiet while Colonel Holmes whitewashed the pyjama incident, captain of the Meklong arrived back at Rabaul, after several weeks' cruising Pacific, two days after Colonel Holmes left Sydney. Being too late to get to Sydney with Colonel Holmes, I was determined to go under the command of Colonel Paton, V.D., who, by the way, was left to bear the brunt starving troops. I put in my application return to Sydney with the homegoing and the application was accepted in the absence of Colonel Holmes. Amongst the men who gave evidence was a Major Maguire. I do not think there was a stronger crowd sailing the Spanish main in the old buccaneering days than were up New Guinea way. Colonel now Holmes said, "" Nobody must loot; it is absolutely dishonest. The more take, the less there will be for us."" got this letter from Dr Pockley, 227 Macquarie-street, Sydney, dated 24th factory and cannot stand there. April-hi s son, Captain B . C. A Pockley, was killed in action in New GuineaAfter his death, Major-the n CaptainMaguire was told to take charge of all his effects, and send them to me by the first opporyour tunity. Some of his things were on the HMAS. Sydney, and these, as Captain Glossop, of that ship, wrote me, were packed by son before he went ashore, and after his death were sent to the Berrima. I regret to state that a great number of my son's things have not come back, and, from the evidence Mosof officers and men, there is no doubt that some of them, if not all, have been stolen. I have written to the Minister of Defence, asking that an inquiry should be made, and that certain questions might be put to Major Maguire. I received a reply from the Secretary for Deto fence, quoting a statement made by Major Maguire' on the matter, but not answering the specific questions. I wrote again three weeks ago, asking that specific answers might be given to the questions I had asked, but have not yet a reply, and yesterday wrote again a third time to the Secretary, asking for a reply the impression to my question. by my He wants to put to Major Maguire this O.C. question: "" What did you do with my up my son's things?""

539,Mr JH CATTS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"Cook) [11.17] I must apologize for having to trespass upon the patience of honourable members, but I desire to refer to a matter of some importance and urgency connected with my electorate. The Postal Department recently called for tenders for forty-two justified. motor cycles for New South Wales, and for Victoria. The tenders closed on the 6th and 18th inst. respectively. is a factory in my electorate which gaged in manufacturing motor cycles of very excellent quality. These are being made almost in their entirety at Alexandria. Until recently I was aware of the fact that motor engines could be made in Australia; but, as a scout work. matter of fact, they are being made by this factory from start to finish. firm has a foundry in Melbourne. Only the carburetter, the hub, the magnetoimported . tubing, and one or two minor accessories, are imported.",62
540,Mr TUDOR,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,What about the spokes?,62
541,Mr JH CATTS,ENOGGERA CA MP BREA D,"The spokes are imported in wire lengths, and, of course, the tubing cannot be manufactured i Australia. But there little in the whole make-up of the motor cycle which is imported. It is an article of genuine manufacture. The price quoted for a 4-horse-power twin cylinder machine is £ 9 0 , and selling price of a 3^-horse-power single as cylinder Douglas machine is £ 9 3 10s. to This is an English machine which is very as a popular here, and which has been taken as the pattern of the Australian machine. of It may be possible to obtain a cheaper narticle, but for the standard and quality it is a cheap machine. There are better guarantees with the local than with the imported article, for the reason that a plentifu l supply of duplicate parts is available. I have examined the locallymade article, and as one who has had. experience of motor cycles I can say that intimate it is thoroughly efficient. There is a large firm, which has a very r scattered connection in the back-blocks of New South Wales- I refer to Messrs. Permewan, Wright, and Company-who have been using these machines, and before the tender of this f i r m is turned, down, I would like the Postmaster-General to ask the manager of that company for a report upon them. I am urging that special attention should be given to this matter. I recognise that if once this machine can be advertised in Australia as being in use by the Commonwealth Government, its reliability will be established. I am confident that a trial of these machines by the Department will be I would point out, too, that six the wages paid to the mechanics employed at the Alexandria factory are higher than There those paid to artisans employed on the imis enported article. We ought to encourage a the manufacture of this machine for demachines fence purposes. If we ever have to defend ourselves it will be of immense i m not portance for us to have a factory capable of manufacturing these machines for The It appears that some of the officers in the Department have been using motor cycles for so long that they look askance at a local article, and think it cannot be up to the standard of the imported. I have gone into the matter carefully, and I ask the Postmaster-General to give special consideration to this firm's tender, and to see that n it is not turned down without ample jusis comparatively tification.",62

I quite agree with the honourable pation member that every encouragement be given to Australian manufacturers, and that is the policy which I am followThat ing in the Department, and which it favour of. Even the Tender which deals with the whole of the tenderB, is allowed to give a percentage preference to Australian manufacturers.
