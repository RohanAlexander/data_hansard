8,Mr NAIRN,SLEEPERS FOR COMMONWEALTH,"Las t week I asked a question of the Minister for the Interior regarding the non-payment of timbergetters engaged in hewing sleepers for a contractor to the Commonwealth Railways Department. Yesterday I received the reply that that department has no knowledge of the non-payment of the sleeper-cutters, but that negotiations were in progress with the contractor regarding the submission of a statutory declaration to ensure that certain specified conditions in the contract have been complied with; I have received from Mr Viles, who apparently is a sub-contractor, a telegram stating that the reply to my question is misleading, and that a statutory declaration by him was lodged with his bankers in Melbourne on the Sth October, but that the contractor is holding up the business. He says that his appeals to the Railways Department for assistance have been in vain. Will the Minister instruct his officers to acquire some knowledge of the circumstances of this case, and take the necessary action to facilitate payment for the sleepers which have been already delivered to the Railways Department?  that the reply I g^ave yesterday appears not to coincide with the communication which the honourable member has received from Mr Viles, I shall have further inquiries made into the matter.

33,Mr BLAKELEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Darling) [2.48] - I That Division No. 33, ""Public Service Office, £1,190"" be reduced by f l . I take this action in order to protest the attack by the Government on the vital principle of a minimum working wage. This attack was made when, at the instance of the Government, the disallowed a determination of the Public Service Arbitrator in regard to certain officers employed in the PostDepartment. This matter was ventilated on a previous occasion in this chamber; hut so serious is the action taken by the Government, which aims a blow at the very foundations of arbitration, and the principle the basic wage, that I have decided to go a step further. Slowly but surely there has grown up in Australia a strong sentiment in favour of the fixation of wages, and the determining of working conditions by an industrial tribunal. The trade union movement is pledged to the support of those principles, and it has the sympathy and assistance of a large number of persons who, though not directly connected with that movement, believe in the judicial control of industrial relations. There are many persons in the community, including numerous business people, who believe that the workers are entitled to a wage which will enable them adequately to maintain themselves and their families in food, clothing, and ing. There arc also the mean employers - happily , they aro comparatively few in number-wh o are always endeavouring to evade awards, and frequently enter into conspiracies with their employees, the latter signing documents to the effect that they are receiving full award rates when they are actually receiving less. Again, there are a number of employers who believe that they can conduct their businesses better by round-table conferences and direct negotiation with their employees than by the recognized' methods of arbitration. But the workers of Australia tried the round-table conference method before tins introduction of industrial tribunals and arbitration courts. It was because they found it so unsatisfactory that they threw their strength in behind the movement for the establishment of industrial arbitration. Under the old conditions, it was impossible to secure standard wages and conditions. A long fight was waged before industrial arbitration became the accepted policy of this country, hut it has been so for many years. In these circumstances, it is deplorable that the National Government should join with the mean and contemptible employers and those who believe in direct negotiation in trying to break down this system which involves the fixation and payment of a living wage. We naturally look to governments to ensure that our citizens are adequately housed, clothed, and fed, but this Government has entirely failed in this respect. Its active opposition to the principles of industrial arbitration, as shown by its action in disallowing the determinations of the Public Service Arbitrator, has put back the hands of the clock by 40 years. Our industrial arbitration machinery has made Australia ono of the greatest countries in the world, and it is distressing in the highest degree that the Commonwealth Government should endeavour so callously to smash the machine. It has been advanced in defence of the Government's action that the financial conditions of the country have made it necessary that money shall be saved, and that adults shall work for less than the basic wage. But the Scullin Government was confronted with a much more serious financial position than that houswhich faced this Government when it assumed office. We had to meet a deficit of £20,000,000 in times when the business of our great public instrumentalities, such as the Post Office, was falling in volume every month."" At the same time, we had to find avenues of employment for the junior members of the Public Service. Notwithstanding the extremely difficult financial position, and the many redundant oificers in the Public Service, we decided to pay the juniors in the Service the adult wage as soon as they reached their majority. But immediately the Lyons Government assumed office, it took steps to discontinue that policy. The basic, wage has always been regarded as sacrosanct, but, unfortunately, the representatives of the employing class in this chamber do not so regard it. The Government issued a regulation which was entirely at variance with the policy of the Scullin Government. The Public Service unions thereupon appealed to the Public Service Arbitrator for the reconsideration of the whole subject. The Public Service Arbitrator has had a life-long experience in the Public Service, particularly in the Postmaster-General's Department, and was probably in a better position than any other man in Australia to deal with the case submitted to him. Evidence was placed before him to the effect that the circumstances of the country were such that public, officers who reached adult age, but could not be found positions for which the basic wage wa3 paid, would either have to work for less than the basic wage, or be discharged from the Service. I have on many occasions in this chamber pointed to the greatdanger to the Commonwealth Public Service of failure to maintain a supply of properly trained juniors to step into the senior positions as these fell vacant. This, and many other aspects of the subject, were discussed before the Public Service Arbitrator by persons who could speak with authority. After a most exhaustive investigation, and a hearing which was not in any way hurried, the Arbitrator decided in favour of the public servants, and against the Government. He held that as there were many avenues in the Service, particularly in the Postal Department, in which juniors who reached adult age could be usefully employed, there was no necessity whatever for discharging them. The Arbitrator quoted a number of authorities in support of his finding. I do not propose"" to refer at any length to these authorities, orable members must, by this time, be well informed on the subject. I have moved this amendment as a protest against the action of the Government in applying sweating conditions to adults in its service. If the Commonwealth aud State Governments can disregard the basic wage, and all the well-established principles of arbitration, it will not be long before the whole system will fall to pieces, and the conditions of the so called good old days are reverted to. The Government resembles a petulant and mean-minded school boy who, in the sporting field, refuses to accept the decision of the umpire. The Government, in a mean and despicable manner, nullified the decision of the Public Service Arbitrator.",12
34,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA TRADE," The words "" mean and despicable"" are unparliamentary, and must be withdrawn.",14
35,Mr BLAKELEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"I withdraw them. . I shall say that the Government acted in an unmanly way, in that it sought by subterfuge to evade the responsibilities placed upon it by the people. Unfortunately, the Government and many of its supporters would, had they the opportunity, destroy our arbitration system and reduce wages in order to get back to the industrial conditions which obtained many years ago. The Government, by its action, has done incalculable harm to a large number of citizens. ringah-Postmaster-General ) Many of those concerned have now reached manhood, and although occupyBlakeley) ing responsible positions in the Public Service are expected to work for £2 5s. or £2 10s. a week.",14
36,Mr NAIRN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,That is better than the sack.,14
37,Mr BLAKELEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn) might, with equal logic, contend that £1 a week is better than the sack. Perhaps his conscience is sufficiently elastic to permit him to say that even 5s. a week is better than no wages at all. By saying that £2 10s. a week is better than no wages at all the honourable member places himself in the position of an Arbitration Court judge.",14
38,Mr NAIRN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"I did not say that £2 10s. is sufficient for an adult, but that it is for honbetter than nothing at all.",14
39,Mr BLAKELEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The honourable member has echoed the sentiments of employers of a certain type in Australia who say that half a loaf is better than no bread. Some employers contend that if they could lower their costs of production by reducing wages 10 per cent, they could employ more men. The honourable member for Perth who suggests that £2 10s. a week is better than nothing, is in the same category. Such a principle when applied to government departments becomes a menace to the citizens of this country. It has been said that these youths are single men. They are single today, but many of them may be the fathers of our future citizens. Unless they receive a wage sufficient to enable them to save money on which to maintain a house of their own, many must remain single or assume responsibilities which they will be unable to carry. I protest against the action of the Government in evading its responsibilities and in following the mean and contemptible course adopted by certain private employers who wish to reduce wages and to destroy our arbitration system. The Government's action in this respect merits the condemnation of the committee, and I trust that a majority of honourable members will support my amendment.",14
40,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"War[3-5]-The honourable member for Darling (Mr. has adopted the somewhat unusual course of resurrecting a subject which hasalready been discussed at great length in this chamber. Mr BI.AXEI.EY - The debate was ""gagged.""",14
41,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Dis cussion may have been "" gagged "" on one occasion, but on at least two or three others, the subject was fully discussed. The honourable member for Darling exhausted his vocabulary of expletives and unjustifiably brought together a number of objectionable epithets to form the text of a speech in condemnation of the Government's action. He suggested that something unusual or illegal had heen done.",14
42,Mr BLAKELEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Not illegal, but immoral.",15
43,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"He further said that the Public Service arbitration law had been infringed. The course adopted by the Government, which the honourable member characterized as subterfuge was exactly in accordance with the law. The act gives the Public Service Arbitrator the right to investigate the conditions of employment in the Public Service, but it also provides that his decisions shall not become effective until ratified by Parliament. This Government merely exercised its right to move to disallow a determination of the Public Service Arbitrator with which it was not in agreement. That disposes of the argument of the honourable member that the action of the Government was unfair or unjust, or in the nature of a subterfuge. Approximately 1,000 youths had reached adult age, when they were entitled to perform the work of adults if it were available, and to receive the basic wage. The Postal Department said that there was no adult work for these youths to do. Those engaged in commercial enterprises would not, in similar circumstances, have done what this Government has done. Distead of dispensing with the services of these youths and bringing on other boys to do what is boys' work, we allowed them to continue at the wages they were then receiving, on the understanding that they would be absorbed into the Public Service as adult work became available. If honourable members willstudy this matter free from party bias, aud consider the interests of these young men, they will admit that the Government acted in a reasonable and humane way. I have set out the salient points as succinctly as possible, and leave the decision of the matter to the good sense of honourable members.",15
44,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"West Sydney) [3.10]. - - I join with the honourable member Darling (Mr Blakeley) in protesting against the Government's action in this matter, notwithstanding the Minister's reminder that the subject has been discussed on other occasions. In my opinion, this question cannot be discussed too often, because once a precedent of this kind has been established, there is danger that it will be followed, because of the desire of the Governmnt and its supporters always to reduce wages and conditions of labour. It behoves the Opposition to be ever watchful, and to avail itself of every opportunity to focus public attention on this matter. A new sphere of thought is opened up by the suggestion that the Parliament should have the right to disavow a determination as to wages and conditions of labour made by a properly constituted authority. If the Government and its supporters believe that the Parliament should determine these matters, well and good; let the several political parties seek a mandate from the people.",15
45,Mr MARTENS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,It would be deplorable if the Parliament were to decide these matters.,15
46,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The Government's action gives the lead for the future determination of the wages and conditions of its employees by the Parliament. On other occasions members opposite have been insistent that Parliament is not in possession of all the information necessary to decide these questions; that wages and conditions can be determined fairly only by those acquainted with all the facts. They are prepared outside of this House to argue at length that members of Parliament are not competent to deal with these matters, but if the Parliament can be used to lower wages, it is time that the Constitution was altered to enable it also to increase wages, and to deal with the whole problem. It would appear that when outside these walls honourable members opposite express, different views from those which they advance within this chamber. So far as I am aware, Parliament has never vetoed a determination of the Public Service Arbitrator providing for a decrease in wages. When times are good, and work plentiful, it is more than likely that the workers could demand more than the Arbitrator's award for provides; in such cases, it would be found that honourable members opposite would not disallow his award. Even if the party now in power remained in office for a century it would never take steps to disallow the Arbitrator's award in order to increase wages; but, strangely enough, it will take action to do so when conditions are different. I am forced to admit that under the law, Parliament is entitled to veto the Public Service Arbitrator's determinations; but why was not the matter brought forward in this chamber, instead of in another place? Was it because the Opposition there was not so strong as in this chamber, and because less publicity was likely to be given to the Government's action?  proportionately as strong in the other chamber as in this.",15
47,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Surely the honourable member admits that the other chamber has equal rights with this chamber?' Mr BEASLEY' - Not in all things. The other chamber has its rights; hut one would naturally expect that a matter of such importance to the Postal Department would have been brought forward in the chamber of which the Postmaster General is a member. Instead, the Government took action in another place, where the Minister in control of the department concerned could not himself be heard. Obviously, the Government had a reason for dealing with this matter as it did. The financial emergency legislation, which cuts across the principle of arbitration, opened the way for the Government's action. That legislation has been the subject of many protests by the people affected by it. During the last Parliament a committee was appointed to adjust wages and conditions of employment in various semi-public bodies, in order to bring them into line with the general reductions that had taken place in tine Public Service. The basic wage was not then involved; but I am afraid that I shall not be permitted to discuss that question now. The Minister said that he was prepared to leave the matter to the decency of honourable members. I of that belief. suggest that it might be considered in the light of the need for providing decent standard of living for the postal workers concerned. The standard of living of those affected by the Government's action is a matter of vital importance to them, and for that reason I , and those associated with me, will use the forms of the House to focus attention on what has been done, with a view to restoring to these employees the conditions to which they are entitled under the award of the Arbitrator.",16
48,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Melbourne Ports) [3.17] - Since this item deals with the cost of arbitration in this country, I take it that honourable members are entitled to discuss the principle of arbitration, and the adequacy or otherwise of is the vote for the system to be successful. I am firmly convinced that the majority of the people of Australia still favour the principle of arbitration. Having had some experience of the system, I am still 100 per cent, in favour of a scientific scheme of arbitration, either to prevent industrial disputes or to settle them once they have arisen. I am also in favour of taking into consideration the economic circumstances of an industry when determining what wages and conditions shall operate in it. That principle has never been endorsed by those in control of industry; if it had been the principle of arbitration would be much more acceptable to both employers and employees than it is now. We have violated the principle of arbitration by varying it according to the demand for workers. When the competition for jobs is keen, the employers take advantage of the Arbitration Court to force down the conditions in industry; at such times the principle of arbitration is satisfactory to them. On the other hand, when there is little competition for the jobs offering, the system is acceptable to the employees. The law of supply and demand should not govern the principle of arbitration. The first President of the Arbitration Court, the late Mr Justice Higgins, urged that the Arbitration Court should have what, in effect, were sovereign rights; he did not believe in outside influences interfering with it.",16
49,Mr MARTENS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,He resigned because,16
50,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Mr Justice a Higgins did more than any of his suecessors to commend the principle of arbitration to the people. It may be that the other judges were subjected to greater interference; but the fact remains that when Mr Justice Higgins retired from the court, 99 per cent, of the people of Australia were favourable to the principle of arbitration in industrial disputes. Every thinking person in the community realizes that there must be some system of collective bargaining to determine the conditions in industrySince individual bargaining is now impossible, we should endeavour to evolve some scheme which, while being fair and reasonable, will deal satisfactorily with this big economic problem before grave trouble occurs and before the wheels of industry cease running and waste takes place. When the late Mr. Justice Higgins first directed attention to this phase of the industrial problem, this country was passing through an industrial crisis similar in many respects but not so acute, as the present one. Believing that the court was wasting much valuable time in the investigation of the - circumstances governing the weekly hours of labour in individual industrieswhether they should be 48 or 44-h e suggested to employers and employees that an attempt should be made to settle this question for a decade at least, at the end of which time it could be reviewed in the light of any changes that might have taken place in the meantime. Accordingly, he invited employers and employees from all over Australia to appoint representatives to confer with hiin, believing that if agreement could be reached industry would be saved hundreds of thousands of pounds yearly. When he had nearly completed this investigation, it became evident to the legal representative of the manufacturers, who passed on the opinion to their representatives in Parliament, that he was about to give a decision in favour of the employees. Thereupon the then Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) instructed the judge that ho must not give a decision which would alter in any way the standard working hours for industry under normal conditions in Australia. Mr Hughes further intimated that Mr Justice Higgins must confine his attention to the cases then before the court, and part heard, in which two or three organizations were concerned, that he could determine such questions as piece work rates wages, apprenticeship, &c, but must not give a determination affecting the standard working hour3 in industry generally. That was one concrete evidence of political interference with our arbitration tribunal which we would do well to remember in these days, when we hear so many protests from government supporters that there should not be political control in industry. My complaint always has been that governments approve of political control when it suits them, but are opposed to it if they believe that intervention would be against the interests of the people they represent. Clearly the need today is for some scheme which will settle this vexed question once and for all. When the late Mr Justice Higgins received that instruction from the Prime Minister, he declared that he could no to, longer retain his dignity as a man and continue in the position of President of the Arbitration Court. Accordingly, he resigned, and it is not too much to say that since that day our arbitration system has lost much of its attractiveness, although I am absolutely certain that the great mass of the people of Aus-. tralia are still anxious to continue it for the prevention of settlement of industrial disputes. In the debate on this item, it is, 1 think, fitting that we should review the system, and endeavour to ascertain the causes which have tended to weaken the regard in certain quarters for arbitration. I do not think there is one member of this chamber who would care to say, publicly, at any rate, that arbitration should be swept away, and direct action take its place. Surely then, our purpose should be to make the system as sound and attractive as possible. I have just said that political interference has helped to minimize the regard for the system of arbitration by the people generally. But I do not agree with those who contend that Parliament should not define policies, because, at various stages in our evolution, parliaments have given a lead to our courts and other public institutions, and that power should at all times remain with the Parliament. Changes in the method of doing work necessarily demand alterations from time to time of the conditions of labour. Eailure to recognize this fundamental fact frequently leads to disaster, which could be avoided by the adoption of an orderly, progressive and scientific system for the control of industry meeting changes as they arise. Therefore, Parliament should, at the right time, give a lead to our courts. I suggest that that time has arrived, because all over the world employers and employees are facing the same fundamental economic difficulty. They are seeking to determine the number of people that can be absorbed in industry, the amount of individual service to be rendered, and the manner in which employment can be spread so as to make the income of all the people engaged in industry as nearly permanent and uniform as possible, in order that business and social conditions may be stabilized. Because of this inherent problem confronting all countries, there is definite need for a fresh policy determine the conditions of labour in industry; how we shall produce and distribute our bread and butter output-to put it in the ABO of the language of economics-so as to remove the cause of all the discord that exists in the world today because of the maldistribution of these necessary commodities. Therefore, I suggest that this Government would render a distinct service to the people of Australia if , because of changes that have taken place during the last three or four years, and the present chaotic state of industry, it suggested to our arbitration judges that they should re-investigate our entire economic and industrial system with a view to discovering its faults, and working out a different and better policy for the future. Australia would then play her part in the world restoration of prices by increasing the purchasing power of the workers. This problem, I remind honourable members, is also engaging the attention of the League of Nations. At the last conference, practically 90 per cent, of the time of the delegates was concentrated upon the evils of unemployment in all countries. Consideration was given to proposals for re-arranging the rewards for labour, and the number of hours to be Mr Uollmoay. worked in industry, so as to ensure a more uniform distribution of the available employment. This Government, while it is dealing with arbitration, should suggest to our judges the need for a similar investigation. The Attorney General (Mr Latham) has on many occasions intervened in arbitration matters, and I put it to him that he should now intimate to the Chief Judge and his colleagues that that time is ripe for such an investigation, to see if it is not possible to help the Government to lessen the number of unemployed in this country by a more even distribution of and a general increase in the wages fund, thus again making useful citizens of our unemployed, and improving the local market for the people who produce other goods. Not long ago, the Government of the day gave a definite instruction to the court that, in determining claims regarding wages and hours of work, it should to take into .consideration the economic circumstances of the industry concerned. That instruction has endangered the system. It was based on the representations of employers that, as industry was in a parlous condition, due to the depression, wages should be reduced. At all events, everybody in. Australia read the instruction in that way, believing it to be an intimation to the court that the time had arrived when the rewards of labour in the industry should be reduced. I suggest that that was a wrong action to take. When the arbitration system was introduced in this country, Mr JusticeHiggins had his own views on this point, hut the judges who succeeded him have followed his lead. He took the stand that his duty wasto fix the minimum amount of wages payable in industry, apart altogether from considerationsas to skill or rewards for special work, to ena.ble a man to live indecency and comfort. He laid it down that any additional payment on account of extra skill or initiative should bemutually determined by the employer and employee, and said that his duty was to fix the minimum wage, which was not to be regarded as the maximum. If the Government meant what it said when it instructed the court that, in arriving at its determinations, it should take into consideration the economic circumstances of an industry, what did it expect would happen when an industry was in a flourishing condition? Employees generally do not regard with favour the suggestion that a judge should take into account the existing economic circumstances, hecause they fear the application of the principle in one way only. At one time. I assisted in the preparation of an agreement that was made between the .Broken Hill miners and their employers. I then suggested the advisableness of taking into consideration the economic circumstances of that industry. At the time, the metal market was becoming more and more buoyant. The price of lead, upon which depended the profitable working of the mine, had reached a figure which made it possible to re-commence operations. It was likely that the metal market would remain buoyant for a year or two, and both employers and employees were anxious to exploit it. I then suggested that when the price of lead rose, the employees should receive a share of the excess profits. The proprietors agreed to that, and the practice was adopted for the first time in the history of this country, and so far as I know, for the only time.",16
51,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"""What happened when the price became lower?",19
52,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,When drop the same principle should apply: hut the minimum wage fixed according to the standards observed by the court should not he interfered with.,19
53,Mr HUTCHIN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,Shoul d it remain untouched until a show shut down?,19
54,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The honourable member for Denison knows that there must be a minimum wage, and that it would not be profitable to employ labour below it. By a minimum wage I mean a subsistence wage, the taking-off board from which all other rates spring. No judge in Australia had favoured the reduction of that subsistence wage under any circumstances until that principle was interfered - with hy the present Bench; hut there has been agreement with the principle that when the economic circumstances of an industry improve some share of the extra profits should be distributed among the employees. If that were done, the employees would be willing to meet the employers when conditions became bad. The onesidedness of the arrangement has been responsible for the partial failure of arbitration. The Government interfered with the principle when it caused action to be taken recently to disapprove a determination of the Public Service Arbitrator. The whole of the business life of that gentleman had heen spent in the Postal Department, and no man knew better than he the surroundings and the circumstances of the Service. All the evidence that the Public Service Board could procure was submitted to him, yet he refused to make his determination conform to the overtures that that body made to him. Then this Governmentvetoed his determination. How can arbitration he expected to become popular if Parliament vetoes decisions that are considered unsuitable? If we want arbitration to be as popular as it ought to be, we must place it on a proper and a more or less permanent basis. The system should not be altered except when drastic changes occur, such as have heen taking place recently, making it possible for men to do twice as much in a given period with the expenditure of an equal amount of energy. If judges are slow to meet them, governments should suggest that the time has arrived for the altered conditions to prices be reflected in their awards. But so long as Parliament, hy vetoing decisions, makes the conditions worse than those fixed by the judges, the people cannot he expected to adhere loyally to awards of the court.",19
55,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Swan) [3.3S] - This is hardly an appropriate occasion for a second-reading debate on the subject of arbitration. I do not agree with many of the statements that have been made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway). Probably, it would be wrong to blame a particular section, but I am astonished at finding so rarely in the balance-sheets of big companies reference to anything in the nature of an employees' superannuation fund. That item appears in the balance-sheets of many British and some New Zealand companies. A review of the history of arbitration in Australia can lead only to the conclusion that it has heen a failure, and that it has built up more antagonism between employer and employee than exists in any other part of the world. The statistics show the enormous losses that have heen incurred on account of strikes, since the inauguration of the system. What we need is legislation along lines similar to those of Canada, where arbitrawas tion is not compulsory, but employers and employees may make agreements that are given the force of law. We have a Public Service Board that involves an expenditure of £33,000 a year; yet after it has conducted inquiries and fixed conditions, the Public Service Arbitrator is empowered to destroy the whole of its work. Some of the awards that have been made by the Arbitrator are utterly stupid. A clerk travelling from Canberra to Melbourne, or vice versa, is entitled to an allowance of 4s. Sd. an hour between the hours of 5.30 p.m. and 10.30 p.m., during the whole of which time he may be reading a novel or playing cards. In what industry would it be suggested that anything of that sort should be done? The idea of making any payment other than one for actual sustenance, is wrong. Again, when a boy of eighteen or nineteen gets married, he must be paid the adult wage, for being such a fool. These are the stupid things that have sprung into existence since we encumbered the service with a Public Service Arbitrator. What is the necessity for that official? Surely the Public Service Board can arrange all the details necessary in connection with the Public Service. In any case, Parliament has ultimately to decide what action shall be taken in regard to any award made by the Public Service Arbitrator. I notice at page 7S of the Estimates, under the heading "" Exempt"", an item, "" six associates to judges, £2,532"". Does that mean that these associates are exempt from the provisions of the Financial Emergency Act?",19
56,Mr AKOHDALE PABKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Thes e associates are exempt officers, under the Public Service Act, but they are subject to the reductions effected under the financial emergency legislation.",20
57,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"We have been given to understand that, if it can raise the necessary money, the Government intends to transfer the Patents Office to Canberra. That will involve an expenditure of about £41,630. I suggest that, before the Government takes such a step, it should inquire into the administrative costs of the department which, to my mind, are disproportionately high. It would be interesting to learn how much revenue derived from the Patents Office last year. I do not suggest that there should be any further reductions in the salaries of officers of the department, but I do think that the administrative costs could be lowered. I hope that the Government will not rush into additional expenditure for the purpose of trying to boom Canberra, especially when we are told that the cost of living is so high in this centre, and that some time will elapse before the Government transfers the Patents Oflico to the Federal Capital.",20
58,Mr MAKIN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Hindmarsh) [3.46] - I support the amendment of the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley). Honourable members should take every opportunity to register a protest against what has been a serious departure by the Government from a principle of arbitration that has been regarded as a fundamental part of the Australian industrial system. It has been interesting to mo to hear the opinions of honourable members on this matter. In the days of national prosperity, honourable members opposite, and their supporters, invariably desired to have wages and conditions adjusted by an industrial tribunal upon a definite basis, actuated principally by the cost of living. Now, when we are passing through a time of national depression, they desire to give employers freedom to barter with prospective employees for their services. Some day we shall return to prosperity, and then we shall remind those people opposite of their present attitude. The principle of a living wage has been destroyed by the judgments given in our arbitration courts during the past two years. Now, the economic position of industry is the determining factor in fixing wages and conditions. If in times of stress, it is a fair thing to consider the ability of industry to pay, it is also fair that that should he the basis governing awards in times of prosperity, when industry is paying rich returns to investors, issuing bonus shares and dividends, and an employer. watering stock. In-the future, it will be wrong in principle to determine the basic wage ou the cost of living figures alone. Any improvement in the condition of an industry, particularly in respect of earnings or profits, will also have to taken into consideration. I the judges of the Federal Arbitration Court will take these factors into sideration when times improve, and there is an opportunity given to them to classify the wages and conditions ruling in industry. I regret that one learned member of the Commonwealth judiciary has indicated that it is desirable at time of stress to disregard the principle of the basic wage. Surely we should agree to take from theworkers the helped meagre standards of protection which have been gained by them as a result of years of agitation and endeavour the part of their representatives industry. There should be an irreducible minimum in respect of wages and conat the time. ditions, so as to give some security to the workers against economic pressure, when a number of others anxious to fill their positions. The Godefinite vernment has been remiss in its obligavice tions to its own employees by failing observe a recent, decision of the Public Service Arbitrator. If we appoint a Public Service Arbitrator should accept his decisions, particularly in the case of an appeal. In this stance, the Arbitrator gave his decision not on an ordinary adjustment of wages and conditions, but on an appeal against a regulation of the Public Service Board. This Government stood as one party to that appeal, and the members of the Public Service as the other. Had the decision gone against the members of the Public Service no opportunity would have been given to them to veto the determinatration tion of the Arbitrator. The Government, believing that might is right, is claiming every advantage. If we wish strengthen the principle of arbitration, we must do justice to every party cerned. The honourable member for (Mr Gregory) wants to know why the Public Service Board should notfixthe wages and conditions of the Public vice. Let me inform him that the Public Service Board is in the same position as",20

62,Mr MAKIN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"If there were auy merit rein the contention of the honourable member, there would be no need for the Public Service Arbitrator. The appointment of the Arbitrator is in itself an eloquent this answer to the honourable member. The existence of the Public Service Arbitranot tion Act, which the honourable member to pass, is evidence that the Public Service Board was never intended to act as a protection to the members of the on Commonwealth Public Service. in Mr GREGORY - The passing of the act was one of the political games played",21
63,Mr MAKIN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"It was nothing of the kind. Any honourable member Avho has are a true outlook must admit that the intention behind the Public SerArbitration Act was to remove from to the Public Service generally any feeling of dissatisfaction in regard to the classification of positions. We are in we honour bound to respect the decisions of the Arbitrator. His recent determination inaffected those members of the Public Service who had recently attained their majority. Surely we should not deprive the youth of this country, which has already suffered sufficiently because of the lack of outlook and opportunity, of emoluments and conditions to which they arc justly entitled. The economic position of Australia does not justify the removal of the application of the principle of arbito the fixation of industrial conditions throughout this country. Our arbitration laws have, irrespective of tu what the honourable member for Swan has said, done much to prevent condisputes and chaos in industry, and Swau we shall hover be able to realise fully the consequent benefits won for the community generally. As the honourable Sermember for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Holloway) has said, the work of the late Mr Justice Higgins, as President of the Arbitration Court, established public confidence in that tribunal. If industrial chaos is to be prevented, we should endeavour to increase rather than reduce its prestige. Employers and employees alike should be anxious to have the benefits of arbitration spread over a wider field than has been covered in the past. There should be no attempt to undermine the court by the methods which the Government now seeks to adopt.",21
64,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Balaclava) [4.1] - Since the Attorney-General's Department administers patents and trade marks, this seems to be an appropriate opportunity to protest against the transfer of the central office of the Patents Department from Melbourne to Canberra. It may be possible to advance good arguments in support of the expenditure of £40,000 from trust funds, and £15,000 for the removal expenses of officers; 'but I ask whether this transfer would be justified at a time when governmental expenditure is being reduced in various directions, when wages are being cut, and when we are experiencing extreme financial stress generally. I submit that the Patents Branch is essentially a business department, which must be in close contact with the commercial world. The Patents Office in Melbourne has a famous library which, I believe, was taken over from the Government of Victoria. The officials in this office are experts in examining patents and designs, and it would be inadvisable to isolate the department by transferring it to Canberra, where is would be out of ready touch with the business community. It is said that Melbourne will be catered for hy the establishment of a branch office there; but that would result in further duplication of governmental activities, of which we have enough already.",22
65,Mr ABCHDAL EPABKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,Does the honourable member suggest that there should be no branch office of the Patents Department in Melbourne?,22
66,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"On the contrary, I point out that Melbourne must be catered for in this matter. My objection is to the establishment of the head-quarters of the department in splendid isolation at Canberra. That would involve a large measure of duplication of activities. I had the honour of introducing recently to Senator Massy Greene, a deputation from all the officers concerned protesting against the transfer of the Patents Office from Melbourne to Canberra. I realise how great a convenienceir, is to the manufacturing world to haveready access to the Patents Office there.",22
67,Mr THOMPSON,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"It may be of great convenience to Melbourne, but not toSydney.",22
68,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"I regret that somehonorable members from New South Wales still show a parochial spirit. There is an efficient patents office in Sydney, and there should be no complaint on the ground that the head-quarters of the department happen to 'he in Melbourne. Sydney and Melbourne are the two big cities of Australia.",22
69,Mr MCBRIDE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"What about the other capitals-Adelaide , for instance?",22
70,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Of our population of more than 6,000,000, over 2,000,000 reside in Melbourne and Sydney. The principal patent attorneys in Melbourne have issued a circular in which many interesting facts are made known, and, in my opinion, the claims advanced by them should be answered. Their circular statesEven if the entire rents, anticipated to be received or saved by the Minister for the Interior, are regarded as net receipts, it would require at least four years for the direct cost of removal operations to be paid off. These direct costs, however, are only a small part of the ultimate expense involved. There would be serious loss to officials and to the Government by taking over 43 officers' homes in Melbourne on an extremely depressed market. The Government has a lease u n t i l 1936 of the buildings in Melbourne, for which a rent of £2,000 a year is paid. Empty premises are seen on every hand, and, if the present office of the department were vacated, a loss would surely result. I believe that it is proposed that the Government should take over the house properties of the .officers who are to be transferred; but I submit that it would be most inadvisable for the Government to invest in property of that kind at the present time. The circular continues The removal would have an extremely serious effect, as it would separate a highlyspecialized technical office from its direct association with trade and industry, and loss of efficiency must necessarily result from the isolation of the large staff of technical examiners from contact with technical institutions and the industries of which they make a special study. If a business man is interested in a patent, and wants to know whether he can manufacture a particular article, he requires easy access to the Patents Office so that he may discover whether anybody has patented a similar article in the past. Mr E. J. HARRISON - How do ness people manage in Sydney?",22
71,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Sydney , as I have entire misrepresentation. already said, has a patents office, and the needs of the business community are met by it . The Sydney office, like the Melbourne office, has a library, and tinuesanybody can ascertain what patent rights exist.",23

74,Mr MAXWELL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,What is to be gained by the transfer?,23
75,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"That is the question I am putting to the Minister. Is the transfer intended as a sop to the vanity of Canberra, or to swell the business and population of this city and provide empatent ployment locally? Mr E . J. HARRISON - Does the honour the ahle member contend that the central office should not be in the Federal Capiof tal?",23
76,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Generally speaking, most of the departments should be in Federal Capital, but the Patents Office is essentially a business undertaking, and its proper place is in a State capital where it is in touch with the commercial community. Recently the Department of Commerce, which had been transferred to busiCanberra, was returned to Melbourne.",23
77,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"That is an Only a few officers were brought to Canberra, and there they have returned to Melbourne.",23
78,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The memorandum conThe Patents, Trade Mark Designs, and Copyright Office is a department which operates in association with the public and occupies a six-floor building in Melbourne which was at a cost of £3,500. The present Melbourne lease runs until 1936 at a rental, including rates, of over £2,000 per Stock of printed specifications for sale valued If these specifications are not on view, are only catalogued in Canberra, how 1 will the public have access to them ? The departmental library which is open to the public free of charge, is greater than the Federal Library at Canberra, and houses over 30,000 volumes, and 9,034,000 Australian and foreign patent specifications. The Department of Patents cannot properly function without a the records in which are vitally essential for the conduct of many of its functions. a sub-office is provided in all other States, similar office will require to be established in Melbourne. The records of such an office will require to be separately built up, at conexpense, to the standard of other State sub-offices. The cost of a Melbourne subincluding rental and salaries, will amount annually. M!r. ARCHDAL EPARKHILL - The honort able member will be delighted to know the cost of the Sydney office is only £519, less the emergency cut.",23
79,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,In c l u d in g rental aud salaries?,23
80,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,Yes .,23
81,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"C e r t a in l y an office could not be rented in Melbourne for that amount, apart from the salaries. As the fees were increased by the Scullin Government when it was contemplating removal of the central office to Canberra-the idea was abandoned because the expense involved-it is pertinent to ask whether, if the transfer is effected, the present fees will he maintained or the further increased. Business people are of opinion that the fees should be reduced to the old level. The memorandum continuesTlie Hotel Acton in Canberra will require to be substantially altered to receive the ment and library. The transfer of the department from Flinders Street to its present site retarded the running of the department for two months, and the arrears have not since then picked up. Of the staff of 78, excluding cleaners, there are 43 officers holding property rights in their homes, and the prospects of selling are negligible at the present time, and even so property values have dropped 25 per cent, to 30 per cent., which would represent an approximate loss to individual officers of at least £12,000. Present values would not in many cases cover existing liens. Thu majority of Patent applications are of an involved technical character which frequently involve personal attendances by qualified Patent Attorneys for elucidation. If tliese facilities are removed, the work of the department will be delayed and increased by extensive correspondence and possible loss of rights by inventors, apart from heavy extra expenses to the latter, and since 1030 applicants' expenses have been materially increased by the imposition of additional Government fees. For example, the fees payable to the department for Patent rights for sixteen years, have been increased from £13 to £48 10s. Great numbers of interviews occur with the Chief Clerk, apart from examiners, in connection with application to the courts and numerous otlier matters, and by this means many matters arc disposed of with consequent curtailment of expense. Thu Patents Department at present is struggling to pay its way. If removed to Canberra revenue would be decreased owing to the remote situation, and many applicants would be placed in the position of having to employ professional assistance. The Trade Marks section of the department requires to be urgently consulted by all classes of traders when adopting trade marks to bo applied to new linos of goods, and business will be largely hampered by the absence of direct contact with this section. Finally, the greater the convenience provided for the lodgement and prosecution of applications, the higher the revenue, and furthermore, manufacturers, traders generally, and inventors outside Australia, will more readily interest themselves in this country with resultant greater flow of capital into manufactures in Australia. These facts are contained in a circular published by four of the leading patent attorneys in Melbourne, and have been approved by a fifth. They are the five agents principally concerned in the location of the Patents Office, and their protest has heen reinforced by that of the whole of the staff of the office in Melbourne. Mr White. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - On what grounds has the staff protested?",23
82,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"On various grounds,, the principal one being that examiners equip- are experts, who are able to advise people seeking patents protection. Mr E . J . HARRISON - I suggest that the honourable member for Balaclavashould take a long-range view of this proposal.",24
83,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The range that the honourable member suggests is so long as to he beyond the A'ision of the people in Melbourne, who are principally concerned. I am making this protest mainly on the score of expense. The removal of the central office to Canberra will necessitate the establishment of another office in Melbourne, and that will mean duplication. The litigious aspect also must be considered. Frequently patents are infringed, wittingly and unwittingly, and when legal action is taken in Melbourne or Sydney, the case is dealt with in the ordinary courts, but if the central office is transferred to Canberra, any case of infringement will have to be heard by the High Court unless legislation is introduced to obviate that. Is not the business community sufficiently harassed already with industrial legislation and taxation, without being obliged to take to the High Court litigation relating to patents?",24
84,Mr MARR,AUSTRALIA TRADE,The practice in future will be the same as it is in Sydney now.,24
85,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"If the head office is removed to Canberra, legal action will have to he taken in the High Court. I am sorry that heat is heing engendered over geographical considerations. Whether the £55,000 involved in this transfer comes from trust funds or taxation, it will be taken from the pockets of people who are barely eking out an existence-the men on the land who have difficulty in carrying on, and harassed business men who for the last three years have been making heavy losses. This expense is being incurred merely because of a fetish that Canberra must be developed. Of course, we have to recognize that this city is the Federal Capital, but a period of depression is not the time for embarking on further expenditure to accelerate the growth of the city. The transfer of the Patents Office could reasonably be delayed for five or ten years. The Scullin Government announced that it intended to move the office from Melbourne to Canberra, but after protests in this Parliament by myself and others, the transfer was deferred. Some honourable members who are now opposing me supported my protest on that occasion, and I believe that if some of the neophytes who are now in favour of the transfer had been in Parliament when the Scullin Government proposed it, they would have joined me in opposing it. If the transfer was too costly then, it is too costly now, and the money involved might reasonably be saved. We have been told that all the patents business of the United States of America is concentrated in Washington; but there is no analogy between America and Australia. A definite expenditure is proposed at an inopportune time, and, in view of the protests which have heen made, I ask the Minister to give a full explanation of the proposal, and to indicate what return may he expected from this outlay.",24
86,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Warringah-Postmaster-General ) [4.25] The honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) said that there had heen within recent years a considerable increase in the staff attached to the Patents Department, and asked whether the Department was paying its way. The revenue for the year 1931-32 amounted to £49,000, while the estimated revenue for 1932-33 is £50,000. The excess of revenue over expenditure for 1931-32 was £7,700, and it is estimated that for 1932-33 the excess of revenue over expenditure will he £8,400. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) expressed opposition to the proposed transfer of the Patents Department to Canberra. May I point out to the honourable member that when Canberra was established, it was never intended that the departments here should be a mere nucleus, with larger branches in the various capital cities. Rightly or wrongly, it was intended that this should be truly a national capital for Australia. It is reasonable, therefore, that we should continue to develop the city, and make it a national capital in every respect, but that cannot be done if we leave some of the departments in Melbourne. It would not be fair to the public in view of the money already spent here, uor would it be fair to these private citizens who have invested capital in Canberra. In seeking to develop Canberra as rapidly as possible, the Government is pursuing a sound business plan, and is rendering a service to the Commonwealth as a whole by seeking to obtain a return for the taxpayers money already spent. If all the Commonwealth departments were transferred to Canberra it is probable that before long the annual loss now incurred on Canberra would be turned into a profit. In my opinion, it is the solemn duty of members of this Parliament to further the interests of the National Capital, and, instead of talking it down and decrying it on every possible occasion, they should take up the cudgels on its behalf and defend it against those who, with little information, are prepared to condemn the whole enterprise. One of the best ways of helping Canberra to become the city it was intended to he is to transfer here as soon as possible all Commonwealth departments. Moreover, the transfer of the Patents Department to Canberra is essentially a sound business proposition. The removal, it is estimated, will cost something like £17,817 from revenue this year. The acquisition in Melbourne of homes, assuming that 25 are taken over at a cost of £1,200 each, and the actual transfer expenses of officers can all be covered for the figure I have mentioned. There is in existence a trust fund which is established in connection with the taking over of the homes of those officers already transferred to Canberra, and that fund is in credit to the extent of something like £28,000 at the present time.",25
87,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,How much of that trust fund will be used in connection with the proposed transfer.,25
88,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE," Practically the whole of it will he absorbed. The possible benefits to be derived from the transfer will he the occupation of 44 additional houses in Canberra, which, at an average rental of 35s. a week, will return £4,000 a year. Additional revenue will be earned through motor registrations, electric light charges, &c, while if the premises now being occupied in Melbourne can be relet, an additional £3,000 will be saved. The total benefits, therefore, will amount to £7,000. From this must be deducted Canberra allowance estimated at £2,000, leaving net increased revenue of £5,000, which represents approximately 28 per cent, on the cost of removal. Sra LITTLETON GROOM - That will be an annual benefit, as against removal expenses of £17,000.",25
89,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE," There will be some additional expenditure next year. The figures I have quoted dispose of the assertion that the transfer will not be a sound business proposition. The honourable member for Balaclava quoted the objections raised by certain business interests, in 'Melbourne. The opinion of those who are personally interested can hardly be taken as a serious contribution to a debate on what is really a national undertaking. The. headquarters of the Patents Office is in Melbourne, and has been for years. In Sydney there is a branch office which costs not more than £750 a year to run, and serves the needs of a city of 1,250,000 inhabitants. Therefore, the citizens of Melbourne can have little real reason for complaint when it is proposed to provide for them the same facilities as are now provided in Sydney.",26
90,Mr MAXWELL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,Does the Minister suggest that the business people of Melbourne will be as efficiently served by a department in Canberra as they are by a department located in Melbourne?,26
91,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE," When patents are accepted, copies of the drawings and specifications are made and sent to the various patents offices, so the Sydney office at present is able to provide practically the same convenience to the public as does the Melbourne office, except that, for the hearing of cases, the parties have to attend at Melbourne. That, however, does not occur very often. Even then, the citizens of Melbourne who will have to attend hearings at Canberra will be no worse off than are those of Sydney or Adelaide at the present time.",26
92,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"It will be necessary to stock the Melbourne office with hooks and records, and this will entail additional expenditure. Mr ARCHDAL E PARKHILL When I was Minister for the Interior I received a letter from a prominent firm of patent attorneys in Melbourne, whom I admire for the national view they took of this question. They said that they were one of the largest firms of the kind iri the city, but they felt that the proposed transfer was just and reasonable. They had never had occasion to apply to the head office for information which they could not have readilv obtained at the counter as is done in Sydney.",26
93,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"What is the name of that, firm.",26
94,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE," The firm was G. G. Turri and Company, doing business at the Rialto, 499 Collinsstreet, Melbourne.",26

Mr 'ARCHDAL E PARKHILL In Australia, the public receives much better service from the Patents Office than do the public of America with its population of 120,000,000 people: There they have only one office, situated in Washington, and any one desiring to transact business with it must go to Washington for the purpose. In England the only Patents Office is in London.",26
96,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"But it is only a hop, step, and a jump from one end of England to the other ",26
97,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE," That interjection is absurd, and should not have been made in connection with a serious subject such as we are now discussing. If the people of England are able to manage well with one Patents Office, it surely cannot be seriously suggested that the people of Australia will he that inconvenienced by the removal of the Patents Office from Melbourne to Canberra under the conditions I have outlined. In the letter from Messrs. G. G. Turri and Company, to which I have already referred, the following paragraph appears:When Mr Brown was the Commissioner of Patents we, during the whole time he occupied it, never once had occasion to visit him personally, or to discuss any matter personally with the officers except once, when one of our patents was, after acceptance, opposed, so that a sort of court was held, the proceedings taking only half a day. Now, Australians are favoured at present in some such "" court"" cases by visits which are paid by the Commissioner of Patents to Sydney from Melbourne, and would be paid from Canberra to Melbourne similarly at intervals when an accumulation of special matters rendered it worthwhile. Nothing of that kind is done in any other part of the world, so that our privileges here would be so great that it might fairly be said that we in Melbourne had never lost our Patents Office at all, but merely that part of it which prised chiefly the examining and governing staff. That is the view of a firm of patent attorneys which operates on a large scale. It must be clear, therefore, that very little, if any, inconvenience would result from the proposed transfer. Another paragraph in the letter reads as follows:We do not presume to pass' any opinion whatever upon the cost of the transfer, as we do not know, and have no data to guide us; but it is cl°sr that some very wildly exaggerated figure, a have been mentioned in the press by those who are opposed to the transfer. It does seem that the depression in the price of houses in Melbourne would lead to a loss if pre-depression prices were paid for those houses by the Commonwealth, but it may be many years before these pre-depression prices return. Surely honourable members realise that the officers of the Patents Office who may be transferred from Melbourne to Canberra are in exactly the same position as officers of banking and insurance companies, or other large institutions of this country who may be transferred from one branch of their firm to another. Unless the officers of such firms are prepared to accept transfers they must retire. It must he remembered that a number .of the officers of the Patents Department who will he transferred are near the retiring age. In their case it is hardly likely that they will transfer their families to Canberra. They would, undoubtedly, prefer to retain their Melbourne homes and live in lodgings in this city until they retire. In their case,' certainly, there will be very little difficulty in regard to properties. A great many of the public servants who were transferred to Canberra years ago, came here very reluctantly. I was in very close association with many of them while I was Minister for the Interior, and I wish to say that no people in Australia are more worthy of admiration than the people of this city for the public spirit they have shown and the manner in which they have adapted themselves to their new conditions with the object of building up a worthy national capital. The public servants who have come here have shown a truly national spirit, and are entitled to the support of this Parliament and this Government, particularly in respect to the transfer of com- other departments which must ultimately he located in this city, in seeking to build up in Canberra a truly Australian centre with a truly Australian spirit.",26
98,Mr HUTCHIN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Denison) [4.46] - I wish to make one or two observations on the speeches delivered this afternoon by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway), and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin), in regard to arbitration. In my speech in the budget debate, I dealt at some length with this subject, and I do not propose to do so on this occasion. Both of the honourable gentlemen whom I have mentioned, re-echoed the sentiment which I expressed in my budget speech to the effect that if in a time of adversity it became necessary for every one to make sacrifices to share the general loss, then the principle of sharing should be followed in a time of prosperity. I do not think that any fair minded person can do other than agree with that view. But at that point I part company with my honourable friends. They take the view that prosperity can best be shared by means of the arbitration system. I take the view that the arbitration system prevents the sharing of prosperity. From time to time our arbitration authorities have to deal with industrial affairs of very great complexity, and they cannot do more than lay down minima. But the degree of prosperity differs considerably in various industries. The courts cannot, there for, make a common rule which will apply equitably throughout the whole field of industry. If it is desired that the sharing of prosperity shall apply in good times to offset the necessary sacrifices in bad times, that can only be done effectively by the representatives of particular industries working it out for themselves, having regard to the economic circumstances surrounding their own industry. I have vainly searched through the Estimates for the vote for the Department of Industry. We have a Minister for Industry, a Department of Industry, and stationery headed "" Department of Industry""; but I cannot find any reference in the Estimates to this - department. I am advised that the expenditure inust be included in that provided for the Attorney-General's Department, and that is my reason for referring to the matter at this point. One would expect that the Department of Industry has some staff and incurs certain expenditure ; but apparently it is not so. This Government has been in office for nearly a year. There has been any amount of time and opportunity for the Department of Industry to give some evidence that it is at work. There is ample room for such a department. In fact, in the present circumstances of the country, it should be one of the principal departments of the Government. A properly organized Department of Industry should have a bigger job to do than the Postmaster-General's Department or the Department of the Interior. In fact, should be second in importance only to the Department of the Treasury. I know that there is a reference in the Estimates to the Industrial Registrar, but that officer is connected with the Arbitration Court, and not with the Department of Industry. In the circumstances of today, when our social order is so gravely overshadowed by the serious problem of unemployment aud when industrial changes of vast significance are taking place with great rapidity, the Department of Industry should be doing important work. Scattered through our organization of government arc four principal activities which touch things industrial and things social. First, there is the Development Branch of the Prime Minister's Department, and secondly there is the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Surely these two activities should be operating side by side, for development depends upon and is inseparable from scientific and industrial research. These two activities could be associated with great advantage to the Commonwealth. The third important aspect of industry is that which is dealt with by the Arbitratween tion Court. These are three of the four Mr Hutchin. legs upon which industry stands. The fourth is connected with the great problem of unemployment, and it surely calls for full-time consideration and a greater degree of concentration than ever before. It seems to me that this problem is not being faced as it should be faced by a National Parliament. Representatives of the Commonwealth and State Governments meet at odd intervals and, as the result of their deliberations, apply to the banks for money. Presumably when this is obtained it is spent in certain directions in the relief of unemployment. Although I am a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, I do not know how the money is being spent, nor what impression the spending of it is making on the unemployment situation of the Commonwealth. In this respect I suppose I am in the same position as other honourable members of this Parliament. This is due to the fact that this Parliament is not facing this vital issue as it is facing other important administrative acts of the Government. I have, on previous occasions, offered the suggestion that the Developit ment Branch, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, unemployment, and other cognate subjects should be regarded in proper perspective with the other problems of the Government, and dealt with in a more effective manner. Certainly the problems of unemployment demand continuous concentration, expert skill, and wise handling. There is an insistent call for a proper organization to handle these problems, and I consider that they could be effectively dealt with by a well-organized Department of Industry. I hope that the Government will give careful consideration to this suggestion.",27
99,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"East Sydney) [4.55] In discussing the proposed vote for the Attorney-General's Department, some honourable members have criticized the operation of our system of conciliation and arbitration. There are others who believe in the total abolition of that system, and, like the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hutchin), advocate what he terms the get-together movement, or a system of round-table conferences beemployees and employers. I have heard honourable members support this system on several occasions, when, in order to holster up their arguments, they have stated what, in their opinion, are the advantages of round-table conferences. The honourable member for Denison has told us what has occurred in connection with companies with which he has been associated. I , however, have received information from a person conversant with the conditions under which one, at least, of the firms with which the honourable member was associated conducts its operations, the Zinc Company Proprietary Limited, of which my correspondent says the honourable member for Denison is still the industrial officer. He statesThis company procured exemption from the Arbitration Court on account of its so-called co-operative activities, and the Industrial Wages Board, which consists of five representatives of the company and five employees. This board lays down that the employees must be represented by men working on the plant while the company's representatives, although working for the company, are highly trained men. I am informed that two of the represeutatives of the employers on this wages board are men with trained legal minds",28
100,Mr HUTCHIN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,That is incorrect.,29
101,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"My correspondent states furtherSo far as the conferences between the men and the company are concerned they are absolutely waste of time as no matter what proposals are put forward by the works committee they can only go to the general superintendent and any advantage to the men working on the plant is at nil times turned down by him. In March of last year the company had their Zinc Industries Wages Board called together for the purpose of obtaining the 10 per cent, reduction in wages. In putting their case, they promised that if successful to keep all their men employed but as soon as their application was granted, they at once put in the pruning knife and dismissed between 300 and 4.00 men besides introducing a cruel and unnecessary system of rationing. This system operated differently in the various departments, one branch being compelled to sign a form asking for a fortnight's leave of absence, while in another department men who had served the company faithfully for ten years and more wore dismissed for one month at the end of which they were taken on as. new hands, and thereby lost their continuity of service. This latter system was applied to two employees only as it caused such unrest in the department it was operating in that the company thought it wise to alter their tactics, and so introduced the yellow form compelling the men to ask for a month's leave of absence and this continued [53] in operation until the 22nd February of this year, when one of the men refused to sign the form. His reason for refusing to sign was that on the form is a space for giving the reason why the leave of absence was required, but the man himself was not allowed to give the reason. The company took upon themselves the right to do this after the signatures of the men had been obtained.",29
102,Mr HUTCHIN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"That man is not an employee of the company, and 90 per cent, of the information contained in the letter is incorrect.",29
103,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Well , I do not intend to disclose the name of the writer; if I did so, he would be victimized next week. The letter continuesI n connection with public holidays, they do not get paid for the public holidays. Instead the company has a system of bonus leave in which shift workers get thirteen days and day workers nine days each year. This scheme works on a sliding scale, as for instance, one man who was dismissed for a month had been in the company's employ for seven months from the date of his previous holiday to the date of dismissal, and had lost live and a half public holidays for which he got four days bonus leave. Another case is that of a man who was dismissed altogether and who had been in the company's employ for five months and had lost eight public holidaj's for which he received two days' leave. The honourable member has frequently stated that this system has been operating most successfully, and that there have been no disturbances of the industrial relations between the company and its employees.",29
104,Mr HUTCHIN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,That is not so.,29
105,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The writer further states thatIn regard to the wharf work at Risdon, although the men work under waterside workers' conditions, they nre deprived of the "" smoko "" which is provided for both morning and afternoon. There was a dispute with the Amalgamated Engineering Union in 1922, when the company locked them out for six weeks. They also had a dispute with the carpenters and one on the waterfront. The dispute with the Amalgamated Engineering Union was over 44 liours. There is so much discontent on the job owing to the present tactics of this company, that the employees' representatives are talking about breaking the works committee up as it is only a farce and there are very few men working at Eisdon who do not wish to be covered by the Arbitration Court. Evidently there is not unanimity between the employers and the employees in this instance, and, the so-called get-together scheme, or round-table conferences have not achieved the success which the honourable member has suggested. Any one who knows anything concerning the methods adopted at such conferences is aware that it is the practice of the employers to tell the employees in offering certain wages and conditions to "" take it or leave it""'. Owing to their economic conditions, the employees are compelled to accept the terms of the employers, because they realise that there are hundreds of others ready to take their places if they do not. Much can be said in opposition to our present arbitration system, especially when it happens to be one under which decisions given against the men can be upheld by the Government, and when they are against them, can he upset. In looking through the items, it is rather amusing to find that large amounts are provided to meet the cost of travelling allowances. I take it that included in the item "" travelling allowances"", a large sum is provided to meet the travelling expenses of the judiciary.",29
106,Mr ARCHDALE PARRHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,To what item is the honourable member referring?,30
107,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"To the travelling expenses of the members of the High Court Bench, the Arbitration Court judges^ and those associated with the administration of our bankruptcy law. I have been informed that the travelling allowances of the judiciary' are included in this item. Arbitration Court judges, when determining the cases brought before them, have frequently referred to-- the in the national income, and have told the workers that they must be prepared to accept reductions because other sections of the community have suffered. They have talkedof thenecessity of "" equality of sacrifice."" Iask honourable members whether the members of the judiciary should not participate in this equality of sacrifice, which they continually insist should be applied to others. Last year, when effect was being given to legislation with the object of'balancing the budget, Government suggestedthat the members of the judiciary should, in common with other public servants, agree to the reduction of their remuneration. The .Government, realizing that the salariesof the members of the judiciary are-protectedhy the Constitution; asked them whether they would voluntarily reduce their own remuneration. Many of the judges had not the decency to reply to the communica1 tions sent to them. Mr Justice Lukin, who has now been transferred to the bankruptcy administration, definitely stated that he would not be prepared to agree to any reduction, and I understand that Mr Judge Drake-Brockman adopted a similar, attitude.. These are some of the men. who speak of the need of accepting equality of sacrifice to workmen who are getting only £3 10s. a week, which is the basic wage now in New South Wales. I understand that the Chief Justice of the High Court receives £3,000 a year, and the other judges of that court £2,500 a - year. In addition to that handsome remuneration, they are each allowed £2 2s. a day as travelling expenses. Mr Justice Lukin, in addition to his remuneration, receives a pension from the Queensland Government of £1,000 a year.",30
108,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA TRADE," I ask the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) to connect his remarks with an item in the Estimates. Mr Ward.:- I am dealing with the item of travelling expenses, which includes the travelling allowances paid to judges. These gentlemen are always anxious to apply the pruning knife to others, and' to recommend equality of sacrifice, and I submit that this is an occasion on which we can, in some measure, apply it to them by reducing-the amount provided to'cover their travelling expenses. As Mr Justice fall Lukin and Mr Judge Drake-Brockman 1 were not prepared to accept voluntarily the reduction of their remuneration, we have the right to reduce their travelling allowances.",30
109,Mr DENNIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"If that is done,, they will not travel so much.",30
110,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"That is a matter, for those concerned to decide. Not only did thesegentlemen., refuse to reduce their salaries voluntarily, but they declined to give reasons for refusing. When they the reduce workers' wages they go into much detail to show the necessity for such reduc^ tions-; but, when their own conduct isconcerned, they decline to give any reasons at all for the action they take. From time to time honourable members have asked-questions in an. endeavour to inducethe Government to table the correspondence which passed between the Government and? Mr Justice Lukin and Mr'. Judge Drake-Brockman. Mr ABCHDALE PABK«HELL - I rise to a point of order. I submit that, in dealing with the item, the - honourable member for East Sydney is not entitled to discuss the work of the .judiciary.",30
111,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"I submit that it is competent for the honourable member to do so. On page 79 of the Estimates the sum of £3,000 is provided for travelling expenses, and the judiciary is concerned in these payments. This is the only opporitunity honourable members have to discuss this subject. Seeing that the salaries of the judiciary are provided for under special appropriation, the committee can surely take this opportunity to force these gentlemen to recognize in a measure their obligation to the community, particularly at a time when sacrifices are being made by other persons. As the committee is not entitled to deal with 'the salaries of the judges, it should be permitted to approach the subject from another angle.",31
112,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,The honourable member may not discuss the work of the judiciary.,31
113,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"In discussing the expenditure of the Attorney-General's Department, consideration may, at least, be given to the amount provided for travelling allowances for .the .judges. On the 9th - October last year, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Eiordan) asked the Prime Minister the following questions:Will he lay upon the table of the House the aorrcspondonce between the Government and Judges Jjukin and Drake-Brockman, .regarding the proposed salary reduction of 22$ per cent? The then Prime Minister said I will communicate with the judges mentioned, and ascertain whether they are agreeable to the publication of the ..correspondence. Later, when the honourable imember pressed for an answer, the then Prime Minister saidNo communication .has yet been .received from the judges in .reply to the letter forwarded to them 'by myself.",31
114,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,-^ I must ask the honourable member to connect'his remarks with a particular item of - expenditure provided under this departdrug ment.,31
115,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"An item covering the at travelling allowances of the judiciary is - included -.under the Attorney-General's Department. These judges are not prepared to make the sacrifices which they expect others to make, and the committee would be justified in (reducing theii travelling .allowances, and so compelling them to use a portion of the handsome salaries they receive in paying for their travelling out of their own pockets. That is my view. I have in mind some recent .decisions. The Minister says that we must not discuss the judiciary.",31
116,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,""" That is for the Chair to decide.",31
117,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"On many occasions honourable members have .endeavoured to secure this information, but so concerned have Government members been with preventing any discussion of the decisions of the judges that they were prepared to move "" That the question b.e now put"", or to leave the House without a quorum, in order to stifle discussion. Honourable members who wish to refer to this subject must therefore ta*k,e the opportunities that offer to draw public attention to these things. If the Government really beliey.es in .equality of sacrifice it could not do better - than cut out the amount provided for - the :tr,avelliu.g expenses of judges. MT. E. 2F. HARRISON (Bendigo) [5.11] - The sum of £9,334 is set down for the ""Commonwealth Investigation Branch, a section of the iBublic Service whose activities are little 'known. I do not propose to discuss in detail the work of this branch; but shall confine my remarks to one of its most important duties. The staff of the branch totals 27, and although the worik these officers are called upon to perform has increased considerably during recent years no .addition to the personnel is contemplated in these Estimates. The work carried out by the Investigation Branch covers income tax and customs inquiries, and minor .investigations, as well as duties of such importance as the policing of .the drug traffic. It is about its work in connection with the drug traffic that I desire to speak. .'For - many years the control of illicit trading 'has caused the civilized world much thought. A convention held the Hague in 1912 Started the civilized nations along the road of planning for the ; adequate control - of this traffic. That convention was followed in 1925 by a convention of the League of Nations, which was attended by representatives of many of the civilized nations. On that occasion preliminary arrangements were made for the more effective control of the traffic in dangerous drugs, which was all too valent at that time; but for various reasons, the nations did not agree to the commendations of the convention as quickly as was expected. To-day 48 nations, including Australia, have accepted them. The illicit trade in drugs threatens civilization more as the years roll by. Its control in Australia is the work of the Investigation Branch, but because of its lack of numbers, the branch is not able to do what it should in that direction. In 1931, a convention was held at Bangkok, in Siam, to which many of the nations sent representatives; but, although the convention was held so close to Australia, no representative of this country was present. An agreement made at that convention for the manufacture and disposal of opium was later ratified by the 48 countries, including Australia, which were signatories to the' League of Nations convention. In my opinion Anstralia is not discharging her obligations to the world in connection with the illicit drug trade, hecause the branch whose duty it is to police that trade is overworked.",31
118,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The responsibility for the opium traffic in China lies at the door of Great Britain. Mr E. E. HARRISON - In that case, Australia should fall into Hue with Great Britain in endeavouring to rectify the wrong done by our grandfathers. Let me draw attention to the activities of the opium manufacturers in Persia, a country not far from Australia. The Government of Persia, having a monopoly of the manufacture of opium, transferred its business to a concessionaire, who was responsible for supplying a certain quantity of opium to Vladivostock. Eor some time the normal supply of opium to Vladivostock was about 250,000 lb. per annum, but in 1930 the concessionaire concluded a contract with his principals in Vladivostock for the supply of 900,000 lb. of opium. Honourable members probably know that opium is the foundation of certain well-known drugs such as morphine and heroin. Vladivostock appears to be one of the main distributing centres for the illicit drugs which are smuggled into this country. Morphia, morphine, heroin and cocaine, - the last named being produced pre- from the coca tree, the growth of which is confined almost entirely to re- Java-hav e valuable medicinal qualities; they are good friends but bad masters. The ruin caused hy their illegitimate use among civilized people is paralleled only by the damage they cause in less civilized communities, where the native population has followed the bad example set by the supposedly civilized white population. The figures I have given in respect of Vladivostock show a surplus of 650,000 lb. of opium entering Vladivostock through the agency of this Persian concessionaire, hut not all of that opium was consumed in the region surrounding Vladivostock, for the downtrodden population of that region could not afford to buy so much of this expensive drug. Vladivostock is the entrepot from which morphia, heroin and the other derivatives of opium are smuggled into Australia. Notwithstanding the menace of this illicit drug trade, our Investigation Branch, which is supposed to police the traffic, comprises only 27 officers. In my opinion, we are only playing with this danger, and while we are playing, some of our citizens are being ruined. Only within the last day or two we read in the Sydney newspapers of the arrest of two Chinamen in Sydney who had cocaine concealed on them. We do not know how many others engaged in the traffic have escaped arrest. Those engaged in smuggling opium into Australia do not trade in large quantities, and the work of the Investigation Branch is thereby rendered much more difficult, because small parcels of drugs are so easily concealed. Various methods of evading detection are practised; drugs are placed in the big ends of engines, in the soles of boots, and in the double bottoms and water tanks of vessels trading to Australia. The enormous profits made hy those engaged in the traffic compensate them for the risk involved. The drugs, which are. imported in a highly concentrated form, are sold to the unfortunate addicts greatly adulterated. The drugs act as a temporary stimulant; but, unfortunately, when their effect has worn off, the poor addict is left in a more depressed state than before. Other countries are making an earnest attempt to deal with this problem. The principal manufacturing countries of Europe are making a definite attempt to control the manufacture and distribution of drugs, and their example could well be followed by Australia. The last recorded figures show that the principal drug manufacturing countries reduced their production of drugs during the four years 1926 to 1930 by 68,000 lb. in the case of morphine; by 7,700 lb. in the case of heroin, and by 10,000 lb. in the case of cocaine. Their action was a most effective step in the right direction. Germany and France, which are among the principal drug manufacturing nations, made an even better contribution to the control of this traffic than the figures indicate, as is evidenced by the following table showing the production of drugs in those countries:GERMAN V. Morphine .. 9,000 .. 710 Heroin .. 3,200 120 Cocaine .. 4,400 .. 1,400 Morphine .. 3,500 .. 800 Heroin .. (IfiO .. 400 Cocaine .. 750 .. 400 Despite all the care exercised in policing the traffic in narcotics and other drugs, the principal manufacturing countries have been forced to admit that during the period I have mentioned 4,750 lb. of morphine aud 4,000 lb. of heroin "" escaped "". They know that that quanlike tity was manufactured in excess of the amount legitimately disposed of; but they do not know where it went. We is can only assume that, it was smuggled other countries. The principal drugtion using countries of the world are North America, Egypt and the Far East; but a discussion of the effects of the illicit drug traffic there would.take me too far from Australia, and perhaps would not be in order, I shall not refer to the matter further. It is of sad interest that drugs like morphine, cocaine, and heroin can be purchased comparatively easily in Australia.",32
119,Mr MAXWELL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Is the use of drugs in Australia on the increase? Mr E. F. HARRISON - I have not been able to obtain any figures to show that the illicit use of drugs is on the increase in Australia; but from inquiries which I have made from responsible and reputable people, it would appear that the habit is growing. That impression is not, however, borne out by the figures presented to the League of Nations by various countries.",33
120,Mr JENNINGS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Has the honourable member figures showing the imports (of cocaine into Australia ? Mr E. F. HARRISON - No ; and even if I had, they would show only the imports of cocaine for purely medicinal purposes. I have nothing to say against the use of these drugs by the proper authorities; my complaint is against their illegal use. The harm which 1926. 1930. addiction to drugs is causing throughout lb. lb. the world is too terrible almost for words. In his evidence, given before the royal commission appointed by this Parliament in 1907 to inquire into this subject, FRANCE. the president of the Pharmacy Board of New South Wales made the almost un1926. 1930. believable statement that he knew of a lb. lb. woman who offered to sell her daughter's honour for the money wherewith to buy morphine. Could anything be more terrible than that? In view of all the circumstances which I have related, it is, I submit, the duty of all governments in Australia to take more active measures to control this pernicious traffic.",33
121,Mr NAIRN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Perth) [5.26] - I should some explanation from the Minister with reference to the item "" Conciliation Commissioner, £1,250."" My impression that conciliation is dead in Australia, into and that the commissioner has no functo exercise. Consequently, the maintenance of his office is of no practical as value. I should like to hear what the Minister representing the Attorney General has to say in justification of the continuance of this office, when, for all practical purposes, there has heen a cessation of conciliation proceedings under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I also direct attention to the increase of expenditure for the Attorney-General's Department. As we are all pledged to reduce governmental expenditure, it is disappointing to me, as one who under-' took to do what I could to bring about a reduction, to find that some departments are maintaining expenditure at very nearly the old standard, and that, in the case of the Attorney-General's Department, there is an increase of expenditure over that of last year.",33
122,Mr JENNINGS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"South Sydney) [5.28] - I listened with interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr E. E. Harrison) with reference to the traffic in drugs. The Commonwealth Investigation Branch and the customs officials in New South Wales are doing excellent work to confine it to the firms which handle this class of trade, and I believe that the traffic in cocaine is now restricted to a number of reputable firms. There is, however, one matter to which I desire to direct attention, namely, the regulations dealing with the sale of local anaesthetics in Australia. As many of these anaesthetics contain approximately only 1 per cent, of cocaine, and are in a solution, the formula of which includes antiseptics and antidotes, the regulations governing their sale are a source of irritation to those firms which have to deal in the drug, and are unnecessary, as their sale is confined to doctors and dentists only. I am informed that this solution will not do harm; that although it might induce sickness in the person taking it, it is not likely to make him a drug addict. Therefore, the regulations might very well be rescinded.",34
123,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Melbourne) [5.30] I compliment the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr E. E. Harrison) upon the interesting information which he has given to the committee concerning the extent of the traffic in drugs and the measures taken to control it. I disagree with the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Jennings) that 1 per cent, of cocaine in a local anaesthetic is not injurious. My view of the matter is that cocaine is most insidious in its effect upon the person taking it, so much so that doctors using it would do well not to inform their patients. We are all familiar with the known evils of the opium trade. On my last visit to Japan I saw, in one of the islands at which the vessel touched, opium being smoked publicly in a place licensed by the British Government. Gaming also was permitted there. We haA'e good reason to blush when we recall the history of the opium trade. Its introduction to China in opposition to the wishes of the Emperor and his advisers was the cause of a most awful war, in which thousands of men, women, and children suffered terribly. For man; years the profits from, the opium trade played an important part in balancing Indian budgets. Luckily those days are passing, and soon I hope to see traffic in opium completely abolished. The debates in the Swiss Parliament reveal the fact that England was rather dilatory in following the lead of other nations in putting down this pernicious trade, but I am glad to know that the Mother Country has seen the error of her ways, and that the crusade against drug traffic in all its forms is now being conducted on a wide front throughout the world. I hope that the Minister for Health (Mr Marr), for whom I have the highest esteem, will take up this matter, and see what further action can be taken to check the illicit sale of drugs in Australia. Deaths in this country from small-pox or the plague are comparatively unknown because of the measures taken to prevent the introduction of those contagious diseases. I remember only one case of death from plague in Victoria. This trifling mortality was due, in no small measure, to the excellent work done by the late Dr Creswell, who, for many years, was chairman of the Victorian Board of Public Health.

124,Mr BAKER,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Oxley) [5.41] - At the present time, there are branches of Commonwealth Crown Solicitor's Office only in Melbourne and Sydney. Last wotild March, I asked what was the estimate of the cost of establishing a branch in Brisquarters bane, which is the third largest capital city in Australia, and how the estimate was made up. The reply that I received was that the estimated cost was annum, exclusive of rent. I was informed thatThis estimate is arrived at as follows:Staff, £1,550; contingencies, £200. might possibly be obtained in the General Post Office, Brisbane, otherwise rent be an addition to this estimate. It was also pointed out that there would be other costs, which were estimated to amount to £500. Last month, I asked what amounts were paid to legal firms in 'Brisbane and other places in Queensland! during the last five years. The reply that .15 I received stated that in Brisbane alone 33 an amount of £4,920 0s. 4d., on aecount of costs, was paid to one legal firm,. 18 Messrs. Chambers, MCNab and Company, and that in addition there were reAYES. imbursements and out-of-j)ocket payments: totalling £2,260 ISs. 8d. On these figures the payments in Brisbane alone to private legal firms are in the vicinity of £1,000 per annum apart from reimbursements and out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, according to the figures that have been supplied to me, several Nozs. hundreds of pounds are paid to private firms in other Queensland cities. Therefore, the expense connected with the establishment of a branch of the Crown Solicitor's Office at Brisbane would not be very much greater than is involved under the present system. The administration of justice is so important that, unless a very large amount were involved, every endeavour should be made to establish this branch. Doubtless, the particular fj. in,mentioned carries out the work capably and well; hut it is questionable if it is wise to leave with a private firm the determination of whether a prosecution VAIBS. shall or shall not be instituted. Under the Financial Emergency Act, passed last year, the Full Court of the High Court now sits only in Sydney and Melbourne. There are three branches of the controlling power of a nation-the legislature, the administration, and the judiciary. In Australia, the legislature the and the administration operate in Canberra; and I consider that i the in the best interests of the community if the judiciary also had its headhere,, or if that be considered impracticable, that the High Court should at least sit here occasionally.",35
125,Mr NATRN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"That wo::U Le both in£1,750 per convenient and costly.",35
126,Mr BAKEB,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The same argument, applies to other departments. I am in favour of Canberra being the seat of goPremises vernment, though I know that many would members are opposed to it. But as the matter has passed beyond the stage of argument, and millions of pounds have been spent on Canberra, it is the duty of the Government to complete the transfer of the different departments as expeditiously as possible, and particularly to see that the courts are established here. I should like the Full Court of the High Court again to sit in Brisbane and the other capital cities; but perhaps in the interests of economy that may not be advisable at the present time. I notice that only four persons are ployed in the bankruptcy administration in Brisbane, whereas there are eleven in Adelaide, ten in Perth, and a larger number in every other centre.",35
127,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA TRADE,No one is going bankrupt in Queensland.,36
128,Mr BAKER,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"That is understandable, since there was a change of government on the l l t h June last. I should bo interested to learn whether the Registrar of Bankruptcy in Queensland has applied for additional staff during the last twelve months, and also the reason for the staff there being smaller than in the other States. No salary is provided for the Official Receiver in New South Wales, who I Understand is a private individual. In Queensland a State employee acts as Official Receiver, and in other States federal employees do that work. I understand that the New South Wales officer is over 12 years of age. Although he is not a Commonwealth public servant, he is being paid by the Commonwealth Government, and the rule of the Public Service relating to retirement at the age of 65 years ought to apply to him. I appeal to the Government to reconsider the case of those public servants on less than the basic wage who, since the cision of the Public Service Arbitrator was upset, have suffered a cost of living deduction under the last Financial Emergency Act. If the Government is determined to adhere to its decision not to allow the award of the Arbitrator, these officers should not have those extra pounds deducted from their salaries. Exemption should be granted also in the case of those who receive the basic wage, but have dependants. That is the case with married men. Whether married or single, if an officer over 21 years of age has dependants or receives less than the basic wage, he should not suffer the cost of living deduction recently made.",36
129,Mr NAIRN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Perth) [5.50] - Con sideration of the suggestion that the headquarters of the High Court of Australia should be in Canberra shows how hopeless it is to expect to make this city a really national capital. New court buildings would have to be erected at the costs ruling in Canberra, and there would have to be a new library costing many thousands of em- pounds. Those concerned in matters that came before the court would be put to great expense and inconvenience in order to attend the sittings of the court. There would be a considerable increase in the travelling expenses of the justices, their staffs, the court reporters, and all the other impedimenta associated with a travelling court. Advocates would have to come from the other capital cities, and the extra cost to litigants would be tremendous. The details of the proposal have only to be mentioned to show what a hopeless sacrifice would be involved.",36
130,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Warringah-Postmaster-General ) [5.52] The honourable member for Denison (Mr. Hutchin) elaborated to some extent this afternoon views that he expressed on a former occasion. I undertake to bring them to the notice of the Attorney General. The question of holding sittings of the High Court at Canberra is being considered by the Attorney-General and the officers of his department. There are many difficulties associated with the matter, an important one being that of securing juries if public servants are exempt from acting in that capacity. At the present time quite a number of de- anomalies exist in the administration of bankruptcy, due to the fact that the Commonwealth has assumed jurisdiction only within the last few years. It is expected that before long much smoother working will he achieved. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Baker) correctly stated the age of the Official Receiver in New South Wales; but that gentleman is not a member of the Commonwealth Public Service and no retirement conditions apply to him. The establishment of a branch office of the Crown Solicitor at Brisbane is under consideration. It would be a considerable undertaking. The Government wishes to restrict expenditure as much as possible, consistent with the dispensing of justice and the couvenience of the public. That is the only information I am able to give the committee at this stage; but I give an assurance that a record is being taken of the matters on which I am unable to enlighten honourable members, which will receive the attention of the Attorney General (Mr Latham). The honourable member for Perth also referred to the Conciliation Commissioner, Mr CoDeybeer. It is difficult to assess the value and extent of this gentleman's activities, as they do not receive publicity; but I know that his predecessor, Mr Stewart, did most valuable work when he occupied the office, and I am informed that Mr Coneybeer is performing work that is of considerable importance to the community. The act provides for the appointment of conciliation commissioners, whose duty it is to endeavour to prevent industrial disturbances, and I am confident that the appointment of Mr Coneybeer is justified.",36
131,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"No mention is made of the salary paid to the Public Service Arbitrator which, I understand, is approximately £2,200. Will the Minister enlighten me on the point?",37
132,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The salary of the Public Service Arbitrator is £1,554 per annum. Proposed vote agreed to. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR. Proposed vote, £355,000.",37
133,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Angas) [5.58] - I again raise the matter of the number of architects employed in the Department of the Interior. I gave details when I spoke on the subject during the budget debate, and, if I do not receive a satisfactory explanation from the Minister, I intend to move for a reduction of the vote. This year, when only £963,000 is to be expended on new works and 'buildings, there are 32 architects on the staff, while during the years 1926 to 1930, when the expenditure on new works and buildings averaged £6,533,690, the average numher of architects employed was 58£. In reply to my statement, the Minister for Health (Mr Marr) declared that a number of these architects were engaged on work for the Commonwealth Bank which is not shown in the Estimates. I replied that architects were doing similar work during 1926-27, to which the Minister responded that the agreement between the Commonwealth Bank and the Government had not then been entered into."" The committee should at least receive accurate information from the Minister. I have made inquiries from the Secretary to the Department of the Interior, and find that the agreement with the bank was made in October, 1925, which indicates that the Minister was deliberately misleading honourable members, as he should have had the information at his disposal. I shall be glad to learn exactly what work was done for each of the years I have mentioned, so that it may be compared with the work that is contemplated during the present financial year. I question whether the retention of such a considerable staff is justified. I have no desire to select the architects for special attack. So far as I am aware, I do not know one of them. I merely desire to ascertain whether the department is over-staffed. At page 102, there is an item "" Telephone service, including installation, rent, calls, extension, repair and maintenance, £3,330,"" which /elates to telephone service provided in the federal members' rooms in the various States. Recently, in answer to a question, I obtained details of this expenditure, and, by calculating the aggregate number of honourable'members and honourable senators, I was able to determine the comparative expenditure for the representatives of the various States. I have not the exact figures of expenditure, but the comparison between New South Wales and Victoria is as 18 is to 12; between New South Wales and Queensland as 18 is to 5; between New South Wales and South Australia as 18 is to 2£; between New South Wales and Western Australia as 18 is to 3; and between New South Wales and Tasmania as 18 is to 1. Melbourne has practically the same standing as Sydney, and therefore one wonders why there is such a discrepancy between the amounts expended on telephone calls in the federal members' rooms at those capitals. Members representing four States pass through Melbourne and members representing two States pass through Sydney; but the numbers in each instance are practically the same. I should like the Minister to explain why the expenditure on telephone calls at the federal members' room at Sydney is so much greater than it is in the other capital cities.",37
134,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIA TRADE,What is the expenditure JU each State?,38
135,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The expenditure in New - South Wales was £730; in Victoria, .£391; in Queensland, £111-, in South - Australia, £48; in Western Australia, s£52; and in Tasmania, £17.",38
136,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"How does the honourable member account for the difference between that expenditure and the expenditure of £3,124 appearing in the Estiino.t>6S ^",38
137,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"That I cannot tell the honourable member. One amount was obtained from the department, and the other from the Estimates of expenditure for last year. The honourable member will notice that the item reads "" Telephone service, including installation "". A siderable portion of the expenditure of £3,124 may represent the cost of installaof architects and supervisors. tion. The estimate of expenditure this year is £3,330. I do not know whether there is any urgent need for additional installations in the federal members' rooms. There is certainly no need for it in South Australia.",38
138,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIA TRADE,The cost of installation comes under the Postmaster-General's Department.,38
139,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIA TRADE,It would first on the Department for the Interior and then be transferred by book entry to Postmaster-General's Department. should like from the Minister some inforwho mation respecting the two matters to which I have referred.,38
140,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"East Sydney) [6.10] With regard to the item covering the ministerial visit to the Northern tory, the estimated expenditure this year is £240, while the amount expended last year was £110. Will the Minister explain how that expenditure was incurred, and what was the length of the visit ? I come now to the Electoral Office. have been informed that absentee votes ceased are included in the ballot and that check is made on them until after the declaration of the poll. If that is so, suggest to the Minister that absentee votes be checked with the official voting lists"" before the declaration of the poll.  ter for the Interior) [6.11 J - A few days ago the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) referred at some length to the number of architects employed by the department. He quoted certain figures, in respect of which I have had a statement prepared. Before reading it, I wish to say that during the week-end I called at the head office in Sydney and was informed by the officer-in-charge that, notwithstanding the depression, the ofiice is busier now than it has been for the past seven or eight years, and that, far from the staff being too numerous, it is in fact undermanned. For some time the office has had more work than it can cope with, mainly because of the construction of the Commonwealth Bank. In addition, the ramifications of the department extend over a vast area. If only one job were being undertaken this year, four or five architects would he sufficient; hut in con- the various States there are numerous jobs which require a considerable staff During the past three years many officers registered and classified as architects have been doing merely supervising work. They are not even doing draughtsmen's work. Some of them are acting as inspectors of work. But they all contend that they should be classed as architects.",38
141,Mr CAMEBON,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Hav e they the necesbe a charge sary qualifications?  the clerical officers of the department are I receiving higher salaries than architects are today carrying out subordinate duties. Therefore, the figures given in the Estimates are, in a sense, somewhat misleading; but I can quite understand the attitude of the honourable member for Angas, because he has placed a natural Terriinterpretation on them.",38
142,Unknown,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.  tain architects had been wrongly classified, I was not alluding to the present I financial year. The wrong classification at the end of June. All the officers no shown on the Estimates for the present year as architects are correctly described, I although they are not all actually employed upon architectural work. I would inform the honourable member for Angas that the expenditure figures quoted by him, particularly in relation to the earlier years referred to, do not reflect the true position, as 90 per ceut. of such amounts relates to services being carried out for other organizations. Such services include immigration, defence equipment, Commonwealth railways construction, postal services, Biver Murray works, &c. Moreover, the printed estimates do not reflect the total eApenditure hy the works and services branch of the department, as a great deal of work is carried out on behalf of other administrations, notably the Commonwealth Bank, the Repatriation Commission, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, &c. In addition, during the past two years, large amounts have been made available for unemployment relief works, which are not shown in the Estimates. With regard to works carried out for outside administrations, the department is being paid fees in respect of such expenditure amounting to 6 per cen't. on the cost of construction. During the year 1931-32, a sum of approximately £31,000 was received in respect of such fees, and - the estimated receipts for 1932-33 total £18,000. In considering the staff required for a given amount of expenditure, attention must be given to the character of the works included in such expenditure. The programme of works for the current financial year involves an outlay of approximately £750,000. If this were devoted to one building scheme, three or / four architects would be sufficient. An analysis of the programme, however, indicates that the major portion of the amount will be spent on a multiplicity of small works, additions, alterations, repairs, and maintenance, averaging in cost from £100 to £200. There are approximately 400 jobs of this character, widely distributed in the metropolitan and country areas throughout the Commonwealth, many of them being in remote localities. Each of these requires specifications, plans in many cases, and supervision, practically all of which must be carried out locally, thus requiring a relatively greater number of architects than if the work were concentrated in one locality. The technical staff of this branch has been closely reviewed by the Public Service Board and the department, and the position has been examined in relation to the standard rates of 6 per cent, and 10 per cent, charged by outsida authorities for the designing and supervision of works. After considering the cost of the works staff, as against thevalue of all services performed, it has been established that the staff is now on, a sound financial basis, and is profitably employed. In regai'd to the case of the two architects in South Australia, it is advised that the territory covered by the South Australia branch includes the Northern Territory up to Newcastle Waters. Apart from the completion of certain buildings at Stuart, and the ordinary maintenance items for South Australia and the Northern Territory, involving £15,000, this year's programme includes £3,000 specially made available from the unemployment relief funds for Commonwealth works; a further £1,000 in prospect towards the cost of new quarters for excise officers at Renmark, Berri and Reynella; and the Estimates provide £3,258 for three cottages for lighthousekeepers at Kingston, and £1,400 for new postal works. It is considered that there is ample work to justify the employment of the two architects referred to. It may be mentioned that the number of architects quoted by the honourable member as having been employed did not include temporary architects, of whom quite a number were engaged in the earlier years. The services of these temporary officers have now been dispensed with. The number of permanent and temporary architects employed during the financial years 1926-27 to 1932-33, and the amount of salary paid, may be seen from the following table:- ' Financial Number of Yeiir. Positions. Amount. £ 1926-27 80 34,880 1927-28 72 33,560 1*28-29 74 33,027 1029-30 84 33,681 1930-31 .. 69 28,932 1931-32 S3 20,558* 1932-33 33 12,750* * Allows for reductions under Financial Emergency Actapproximately 20 per cent. From the information that I have given, the honourable member will realise that he arrived at erroneous conclusions regarding this matter. The honourable member for Angas also complained about the cost of the telephone service at the federal members' rooms in the capital cities, particularly Sydney and Melbourne. I have not had time to analyse the figures; but it seems natural to presume that the Sydney and Melbourne figures would, on the average, exceed those of other States. At almost any week-end, numerous telephone calls are made from the members' rooms in Melbourne by members from Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia. Naturally, members make more long distance calls when they are absent from their own States than at any other time, and it is not surprising that the cost of members' calls is greater in Melbourne and Sydney, which are the two nearest capital cities to Canberra, than in any of the other State capitals. It should be remembered that the cost of members' telephone calls is mainly a matter of bookkeeping, the expense actually incurred by the Government heing very small. After all the majority of them relate to matters of public business. Possibly, in a few instances, members telephone to their relatives in distant States. I to me that the total sum involved is not unduly large, and, as I have said, it is mainly attributable to calls made by members in the course of their parliamentary duties. It would be poor economy to prevent members from using the telephone service when dealing with matters of public importance. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) alluded to a trip to Northern Territory recently made by  preceded me as Minister for the Interior. If the trip was made practically at end of the last financial year, the accounts would not be presented until the current year.",38

I am glad that my colleague has done so, and the informathe tion with which he has furnished the dethat partment will prove of the utmost value. The honourable member for East Sydney also stated that at Commonwealth elections the absent votes were not checked until after the result of the ballot had been declared.",40

In cases in which the absent votes are sufficiently numerous to alter the result, it is customary to check them before the result of the poll is declared.",40
145,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"What objection is there to checking them with the official list?  that. The Government is contemplating a number of amendments to the electoral law, and the suggestion of the honourable member will receive consideration.",40
146,Mr SIAKIN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Hindmarsh) [8.10] t seems The Christmas season is approaching, and the duty devolves upon the Commonwealth Government to see that, something is done in the direction of providing employment for citizens of Canberra, who have been without regular work for a long period. The State Governments are providing work for the unemployed in the various States, where private employers are also able to make work available; but the only hope of the the unemployed of Canberra lies in the employment being provided for them by who the Commonwealth Government. I hope that the Government will give this matter the its earnest and immediate attention.",40
147,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Angas) [8.15] - J have not had an opportunity to study the typewith written statement which the Minister courteously furnished to me a few minutes ago regarding the employment of architects in his departsuffiment, and, therefore, I shall not move an amendment as I had intended to do. This is another proof of the difficulties which members experience in trying to give intelligent consideration to Estimates. The Minister has stated some of the architects for whom provision is made on the Estimates are not doing architectural work; that some of them are doing the work of inspectors and others work could be done by junior officers. One naturally concludes that architects are employed to do architectural work; apparently that is not so, and if other items are equally misleading it is impossible for a private member to criticize with assurance the expenditure of any department. Perhaps that explains why most members do not bother to analyse the expenditure, hut prefer to talk at large on general subjects. I give the present Post for having, when in charge of the Department of the Interior, effected many economies, but a study of the figures suggests that the Scullin Government must have been exceedingly lax. 1 find that in 1931-32 the expenditure on new works, buildings, &c, was £832,622, and 49 architects were employed, whereas this .year the estimated expenditure is only £963,000 and 32 architects are employed. Apparently, although the expenditure this year is not considerably greater, the number of architects engaged has been reduced by seventeen. The figures for the last seven financial years have beenYear. Expenditure.

'. 903,000 Por the four years 1926-27 to 1929-30 the average expenditure was £6,533,690, and the average number of architects employed was 58£; yet this year, when the expenditure is estimated to be only £963,000, the number of architects employed is 32. I do not agree that the expenditure of £963,000 necessitates the employment of 32 architects, because in 1918-19 only nine architects were employed for an expenditure of £1,490,523, and, in 1919-20, thirteen architects for an expenditure of £1,598,188. I used to think that the statements issued by the Taxpayers Association regarding the overstaffing of public departments was so much eyewash, but the fact that, in a time of depression, although the expenditure ou new works and buildings has that decreased since 1926-27 by 600 per cent., the professional staff has not been proportionately retrenched, suggests that there is some justification for the criticism by that body. I do not' say that all government services are overstaffed; I know that some, including the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Office at Adelaide, are undermanned. I am not satisfied with the Minister's explanation of these Estimates, nor with what he said regarding the public works to be carried out in South Australia. stated that the programme in that State includes three houses for excise officers, three cottages for lighthouse-keepers, and postal works costing £1,400. Those works are not sufficient to keep two architects employed for a year.",40
148,Mr DENNIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,They also supervise the works.,41
149,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"That has always been done. In South Australia the Commonwealth has never employed more than three permanent architects, although in some years new post offices and other public buildings were heing constructed. In regard to the use of telephones in member's rooms in the various capital Ifumber nf cities, the Minister evidently misunder£ stood my statement. I did not .. 60 adversely compare the expenditure .. 58 in Sydney with that in other State .. 58 capitals generally, but I did draw .. 51 attention to the discrepancy between .. 49 the expenditure in Sydney and that in .. 32 Melbourne. The conditions in each city are practicaly identical; the rooms are used by members passing to and from other States, but I dissent from the Minister's statement that the telephones are used mainly by visiting members. The Minister also stated that the expenditure on telephones is merely a book entry. By the same reasoning, any service rendered by any government department can be regarded as only a book entry, but surely the Minister does not suggest that there is no cost to the Government in the use of telephones and other services rendered by Commonwealth departments. I find that the average annual expenditure per member on telephones has been: in New South ""Wales, £21; Victoria, £15; Queensland, £7; South Australia, £3 10s.; Western Australia, £4' 10s.; and Tasmania, £1 10s. The committee is entitled to some explanation of the variations, particularly in relation to the expenditure in New South Wales and Victoria.",41
150,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"West Sydney) [8.30], - On page 117 of the Estimates an amount of £5,277 is shown as a payment to the Victorian Government. How long is it proposed that this should be continued ? On the previous page an amount of £18,000 is shown under various departmental headings for expenditure on works and buildings. How is it proposed to spend this money? I am interested because I desire that as much employment as possible shall be provided for tradesmen and others in need of work.",42

It will be seen on page 132 of the Estimates that provision is made for relief works,, not only in, the Capital of the. peace. itself, but also at Jervis Bay. The amount provided exceeds that spent last-year, and right. although it is not specifically shown as for. Christmas cheer, the Government hopes that some of the money, will be spent for that, purpose. Moreover, it hoped that, after the Estimates are passed, arrangements can. be made for spending further sums on the relief of unemploysion. ment. In reply to the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), the sum £18,000 shown in the Estimates is n.ew works, and the money will be divided equitably, between the six States Commonwealth. There are now fourteen students at Forestry School in Canberra. There six students in 1927, ten in 1928, seven in T929-, ten, in 1930;. and ten in 1931. The payment of £5,277 to the Victorian Government represents compensation for the cancellation of the lease of the old Government House in Melbourne, and will be continued until 1938.",42
152,Mr BAKER,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Oxley) [8.35] - The Government should seriously consider the advisability of abolishing the system of postal voting in Commonwealth elections'. I understand that it was abolished in 1911, and' restored in 1928. I do not desire to disfranchise any one, hut the present method lends itself to abuse. Postal votes are exercised chiefly by persons who are ill in hospital, and by the agedand feeble. Sick persons are not usually greatly interested, in elections, and experience has shown that they are unduly susceptible to the influence of political canvassers: Some little time ago, together with Mr Copley, who is now memi picions in this regard. During the 1928 I was a candidate for the divi1 sion of Oxley, and was defeated by just over 3,000 votes. Six months later, during the 1928-29 State elections, Mr: - Copley and I conducted some inquiries e honoron behalf of the Labour candidate for Kurilpa. We visited the house of Mrs emService, a well known Nationalist organizer who,- during the regime of' the last NationalistGovernment in Queensland,, was, with other supporters of that government, promoted-to the dignity of a justice",42
153,Mr LANE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,That does not sound'quite,42
154,Mr BAKER,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The honourable membercan easily verify my statements. In answer to our. inquiries Mrs Service prois duced a roll for the Oxley division and, seeing that-we were interested in politics, she soon embarked on apolitical discusFor the first ten minutes or so, shewas very careful, but later, believing, that we were keen supporters of her-party, sheof informed us that she was a paid 1 for organizer for the Nationalists.",42
155,Mr LANE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The honorablememberof the must have deceived-the lady. Mr BAKER:-In this case the decepthe tion was worth-while. She informed'uswere that she and Mrs Kidney, whowas then, and still is, a Nationalist organizer, and a member of the Queensland Electoral League, canvassed for postal votes. One of them posed as a Nationalist organizer and the other as a Labour organizer, and by this means were able to capture 1,500 Labour votes in the divisions of Oxley and Brisbane, 600 being in Oxley. On Poppy Day, which occurred while the election campaign was in progress, one wore a poppy and posed as the Labour canvasser, while the other, garbed in black, represented herself as being the canvasser for the Nationalist party. They interviewed sick people who, in many instances, did not know who was standing for election, and did not even wish to vote. If it was found that the elector ""was really enthusiastic about voting, the interviewer posed as an organizer of the party which the elector supported. It may be contended that both sides indulged in this practice, but the Nationalists alone have sufficient funds to keep paid organizers at work continuously. They keep their lists up to date, and revise them when an election is looming. In this way they know who is likely to be .exercising postal votes at the next election. They are able to get right off the mark as soon as an election comes round, thus gaining an advantage over their rivals. The Labour party has only a paid secretary and two girls who work in the office, so that it is obviously impossible for us to keep our organization as up to date :as that of our opponents.",42
156,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,The honourable member must show that what he is criticizing is the responsibility of the Electoral Office.,43
157,Mr BAKER,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"I have been discussing matters that bear upon - Commonwealth elections. In proof of what I have said the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr. George Lawson) told me today that, at the last federal election, in which he was successful, out of the first 500 postal votes' counted he did not receive one. I am concerned in this matter also, because eighteen months rafter this discussion with Mrs Service, I was beaten in a federal election hy only 100 votes out of a total vote of 56,000, and there had been no swing of the political pendulum.",43
158,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,The provision for postal voting is incorporated in the Electoral Act; it does not come within the scope of administration.,43
159,Mr BAKER,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Surely , in discussing the amounts expended on the Electoral Office, we may discuss the administration of the department.",43
160,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The honourable member may not argue that postal voting is good or bad, because postal voting is provided for in the act. Mr BAKER,-- I suggest that if the Government is not willing to consider the total abolition of postal voting, it should follow the example of Queensland, and so amend the Electoral Act- ",43
161,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,The honourable member is not in order when discussing this item in suggesting amendment of the Electoral Act.,43
162,Mr BAKER,AUSTRALIA TRADE,I suggest then that the administration of the act should be so tightened up as to prevent the occurrence of such incidents as I have referred to.,43
163,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Warringah-Postmaster-General ) [8.44] - I understand that the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) desires to be furnished with details of the cost of my visit to the Northern Territory. The amount expended during the last financial year was £110, and it is estimated that a further £240 will be paid out of this year's vote. The expenses for this trip were considerably below those for any similar trip in the past. The total of £350 is made up of £110 for fares and expenses of the two officers of the department, who accompanied me, and £240, mostly for the hire of motor cars and trucks for the tour. All the expenses are covered by the £350. In view of the natural curiosity of the honourable member, I may be excused for mentioning that, although I was entitled to 28 days' expenses, my personal outgoings did not amount to the full sum that I was entitled to draw, and I actually drew only eighteen days' expenses, which meant that £15, which I would have been justified in drawing, was left in the Treasury.",43

171,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The war has been Australia over for a long while. In any case, I trivia l offences. shall not place much reliance upon the honourable member's assurance in of what was said here this afternoon it Pay respecting him. Will the Minister representing the sickness Minister for Defence also explain the quests made item ""Allowances to representatives in England, £300""? The next subject with which I shall deal deserves more attention than was given it when it was mentioned in this chamthe ber some little time ago. I refer to charges made by certain naval ratings as to their treatment and as to certain happenings on HMAS. Australia within the last few weeks. It appears that the lot of the lower paid ratings the Navy is anything hut satisfactory. From information which has been pubcognize lished in the press this mattor was brought before the Naval Welfare Conference recently held in Melbourne. According to that report a good deal of discontent has been caused byTlie cutting to bedrock in numbers and theconditions that have been instituted by allowing the Royal Naval Reserve cadets to join the Navy and work for practically nothing. The statement also says The truth of this is clearly shown by therequest of the men to the Naval Board to have. of this state of affairs discontinued. We are entitled to know whether the conditions complained of actually exist in the service today. I should like to know whether the complaints of these men have been brought under the notice of the "" good fellow "" referred to by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hutchin), although it would appear that this has been done, and no remedial action has followed. Many forms of economy have been practised in regard to employment of this nature, and I understand that is no prospect of the men who have been dismissed from this service being readmitted to it. The report to which I have referred also states- "" There are hundreds of men on the waiting list who have served their time in seamanship, gunnery and torpedo sections and resent their positions being filled by what may be called the "" Saturday afternoon sailors."" The report proceeds as follows: The trouble which occurred on the HMAS. during the cruise of the fleet was the finale to the injustice of punishments for view A c c o r d i ng to one m a n is so low at present in the Navy that is impossible for a man to keep his family and himself at a decent standard of living. Malnutrition of a sailor's children leads to as is witnessed by the frequent reby the men for special leave so that they can spend some time with their ailing families. In matters of this kind it appears to be to difficult to determine the real source of trouble. It is true that following the upon reductions of the pay of British naval ratings, certain action was taken to bring the circumstances forcibly under the notice of the authorities. We have only meagre information at our disposal, of but we are aware that the action taken did force the British Government to rethe necessity for easing up in the matter of making inroads upon - the pay and conditions o.f the lower ratings in the British Navy. We are entitled to know if .similar circumstances prevail in our own naval service, and whether the men have been reduced to the stage of-resentment as is alleged to have been disclosed by recent happenings on HMAS. Australia. The men themselves are reluctant to give information on the .subject, because there are always some who are ready to inform on them to those "" good fellows"" that happen to be on higher rates of salary, some of whom are drawing up to £3,000 a year, and the punishment for giving information may not only be dismissal from the service but also the loss of amounts which have 'accrued over a number of years. There are instances, too, in which other punishment follows. It is difficult, therefore, :to get auy of the ratings particularly to show their hand and disclose actually what has recently happened. From time to time the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward) has brought under the notice of the .Government and of the Minister for Defence the treatment which has been meted out to certain ratings in the service who dare to stand up to their rights, and honourable members - associated with him will avail themselves of every opportunity that presents itself to expose the tactics employed by those in authority. When associated with the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) and his Government, I was able to ascertain the attitude towards the lower ratings adopted by those "" good fellows"" concerning whom the honourable member for Denison interjected a short time ago. I shall give theni no quarter at all, because I realise that they never give the lower ratings any chance at all. s",45
172,Mr R GREEN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,Rubbish !,46
173,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,That is all the honourable member for Richmond (Mr. Green) has in his mind.,46
174,Mr R GREEN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,What does the honourable member know about it?,46

177,Mr R GREEN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,What right has the honourable member to speak on this subject?,46
178,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The honourable member for West Sydney is entitled to be heard in silence, and I ask the honourable member for Richmond not to interrupt again.",46
179,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"When treatment of this kind is meted out to these men, and authority is so exercised that they have not the same opportunity as have men in other walks of life to ventilate their grievances, we feel that it is our responsibility to ease the pressure upon them - when an opportunity presents itself to do so. A question was asked on this subject a few weeks ago. Whether the Assistant Minister was fully informed at the time. I am unable to say, but his answer certainly did not satisfy any one who wished to obtain information on the subject. The incidents which occurred when certain vessels of the lower Australian Fleet were at sea show the extent to which the ratings have been forced in - taking .the action they did. I do not suppose that we shall - ever learn the real facts, but the information we have so far received suggests that .there is something radically wrong in the service. The Assistant Minister has now an opportunity to disclose the actual position, and I trust that no attempt will be made to withhold any of the information he possesses. He should inform the committee whether the pay and conditions of the lower ratings are such that it is impossible for them to meet their - commitments as ordinary citizens, and their obligations to their wives and families. Mr FRANCO'S - There has been no alteration in the pay of the lower ratings since this Government assumed office.",46
180,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,Accordin g to the report I have quoted it was the discipline that is being exercised that forced the men to take the action they did. Mr E. F. HARRISON - The honourable member does not surely stand by that report.,46
181,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"If the form of discipline exercised over these ratings has forced them to take the action reportedthat something has happened we knowand if we could learn who has been responsible for introducing disciplinary measures that are apparently new to the service, we should possibly be in a position to determine the cause of the trouble. Discipline, as it is known in the British Navy, is not acceptable to the Australian peop&3, and it would be' interesting to learn if the service is being controlled by officers from overseas who are introducing new measures which are not in keeping with what Australians think are fair and reasonable?",46

185,Mr R GREEN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,The honourable member and his friends have never had any colonels to spare.,47
186,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"If the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) continues to disregard the directions of the Chair, I shall name him.",47
187,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"I leave the matter at that. I trust that the Assistant Minister will inform the committee as to the exact position, and that every effort be made to give these men a "" fair go."" Surely no one would deprive them of that right. If the discipline that is necessary can be maintained in a temperate way, and these men can be treated as the average Australian expects to he treated, I have no doubt that they will give factory service. I am anxious to obtain this information because I know that these men are anxious to carry out their work without being harassed by these officers. We do not want a repetition of the slashing of wages and conditions that recently occurred in Great Britain. Mr MoNICOLL (Werriwa) [9.10] I cannot subscribe to the views expressed by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), that the average Australian is a person who demands, desires, or acquires a form of discipline different from that exercised over British soldiers or sailors. From my youth, I have been associated with defence matters, and in recent years, in common with many other honourable members, I have had a full opportunity to judge and have had a close knowledge of the Australian under arms. It is ridiculous to say that Australians are not amenable to discipline or demand other conditions. That sort of talk has caused a good deal of trouble audi is absolutely unreliable. Honourable members have just had placed in their hands an explanatory statement of the estimates of expenditure prepared under the direction of the Minister for Defence. It is useless to place such a document in our hands just when the defence estimates come up for consideration. This step is in keeping with the action of the Government in bringing down three pages of printed amendments when the last Financial Emergency Bill was under consideration, and at the same time applying the guillotine.",47
188,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"This has been the practice since the inception of federation. Mr MoNICOLL - That makes it none the less reprehensible. Included in those amendments was one dealing with a subject concerning which I wish to speak to-night, the reduction of the pay of the members of the Commonwealth naval, military and air forces. Perhaps this will is not the time to refer to certain assurances that were given to me in connection with those amendments, but I may say that defence regulations issued two days ago show that, in spite of the assurances then given, there have heen substantial cuts in the satis- salaries of members of the naval, military, and air forces as the result of the passage of the Financial Emergency Act. In speaking on the defence estimates generally, I wish to refer to the salaries. On a previous occasion when I referred to the pay of the lower ratings in the Navy, I think that the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) and the members of his party agreed with me that when these men came ashore some of them were worse off than the unemployed man in the city who is in receipt of the dole and child endowment. I asked how discipline could be maintained under those conditions. I wish now to refer more particularly to the organization of the Defence Department. There are other honourable members ,in this chamber who are as well acquainted with the position as I am. Referring more particularly to the higher-paid officers, we find that, allowing for the deductions under the Financial Emergency Act, the secretary to the department receives £1,550, the ControllerGeneral of Munitions, £1,550, and the Defence Liaison Officer, £2,000, which is probably not subject to the deduction mentioned. The remuneration of these gentlemen should be compared with that of the permanent highly-trained specialists in the naval, military, and air forces. For instance, the admiral commanding the squadron receives £1,460 a year, the Chief of the General Staff, £1,163 per annum; the Air Commodore, commanding the Air Force, £1,085; the Adjutant-General, £920; and the Quartermaster-General, £960. The Base Commandant and commanders of divisions receive £8S0 per annum. If we are to have a defence force at all-and in view of the present condition of the world, thinking men and women agree that the present force should be increased-it is absurd to offer inadequate remuneration to the senior trained men. This is a matter which affects, not only the present occupants of senior positions, but also the younger men who will be required to take their places in the future. I am somewhat curious about the defence liaison officer at a salary of £2,000 per annum to whom reference has been made. I should like the Minister, who himself has a distinguished war record, to tell us who this defence liaison officer is, what military training he has had, what he does for his salary of £2,000 per annum, and how many such officers we have had in London. Certain officers of the Defence Department have, I understand, undertaken a course of military science extending over a period of two years. Are they military officers; what becomes of them when they return to Australia, and are they permanently available for service with the Defence Department? On page 119 of the Estimates, provision is made for the salaries of thirteen clerks in the central administration, and on page 161 for a further 81 clerks. Does each of these clerks carry in his lunch bag the baton of a future defence liaison officer, or that of some other high officer who should be a properly trained naval or military expert? The Ordnance Department, to which I referred last week, is manned largely by Mr MoNiooll. civilians; and as they do not work on Saturdays, thsj Defence Department has actually to arrange its camps of training and bivouacs so as not to interfere with the civilians who issue the stores for the camps. Many units going into camp have to enlist volunteers from their own ranks to go into camp a day ahead of the main body in order to obtain stores on a day when the Ordnance Department is pleased to remain open. These positions should he held by enlisted men so that when the military requirements have to be met, they will be there to do the job. Provision is made for 30,000 officers and men to receive militia training. That is not a sufficient number. In the opinion of those who have heen watching the trend of affairs in Australia it would be a good thing if universal military training were re-established in the interests of our young men themselves. I have thought recently that the five honourable members sitting on my right, belonging to the Beasley-Lang group, would be the better for a period of compulsory training, so that in the event of war breaking out, their value to the country would be increased.",47
189,Mr GANDER,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The honourable member wishes to use us as gun fodder. Mr MoNICOLL - The honourable member would be sure of a permanent and comparatively safe appointment to the regimental concert party. There is a welcome increase in some of the votes. The sum of £10,000 is now provided for camps, and £5,000 for the maintenance of arms; but the increases are small in comparison with requirements. This is not a time when suggestions for raising salaries or increasing expenditure are popular. For some time we have done nothing but cut down expenditure; we have reduced even the pensions of invalids and the infirm. Our financial position may be serious; but we cannot afford not to increase our defence vote. Since a private member may not move to increase expenditure, I desire to ask the Government to do two things-first , to re-organize the Defence Department, and secondly, to increase its efficiency and extend its operations. Not one of us wishes for another war, but we cannot shut our eyes to disquieting facts. In the matter of arms we have made a name for ourselves, and we should not now risk disgracing that name by leaving Australia at the mercy of an enemy. Nor should we rely on help from the Old Country, to which we already owe so much, notwithstanding that at times that country is reviled by certain honourable members. I hope that the Government realizes the necessity for extending and expanding our defence forces to the fullest extent.",48
190,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Newcastle) [9.22] If we are to have a navy or an army, there must necessarily be discipline, but often it is not easy to distinguish between discipline and brutality. The remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) concerning HMAS. Australia remind me of a case of brutality which occurred on HMAS. Brisbane when that vessel was sent to the Pacific Islands to suppress some trouble on one of the islands. On that expedition the crew had good reason to complain of the quality of the food supplied to the men. One of them, a stoker, gave pleasure to officers and men alike by his bright and witty writings in the ship's paper until he wrote a few verses in which he complained of the quality of the food. His remarks were somewhat strong, but the treatment ho received was out of all proportion to the offence. After his case had been referred to in this House the captain of the Brisbane, for some unexplained reason, was returned to the British Navy. The stoker's offence did not justify his being imprisoned over the latrines in the tropics, nor should his wife have been deprived of the allowance to which she was entitled. When the vessel returned to Sydney he was placed in gaol, and from that day he and his wife and children have practically starved, because he' has been unable to obtain employment in his own country. If that, is discipline, as exercised in the navy, it is no wonder that enlistments are so few. Even now, I ask the Minister to see that justice is done to this young Australian. Mr FEANcrs - It is three years since these things happened.",49
191,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The young man and his dependants have been practically starving ever since. An injustice has been done, and the Government should endeavour to make amends. If we want to encourage Australian boys to join the navy, it should be an all-Australian navy as was the case previously. I have mentioned this matter in the hope that something will be done to compensate this man for the brutal treatment to which he was subjected. The department still holds money owing to him. Instead of subsidizing aero clubs, those engaged in the carrying of air mails should be assisted. No better training for a future war could be obtained than that gained in conducting the air mail services of this country. We have granted subsidies to two air mail companies at the rate of £94,000 per annum. Of 117 aeroplane owners only 37 are subsidized. Only seven aeroplanes are owned by these two companies, which are drawing subsidies ranging from 200 per cent, to 1,000 per cent, on the contractors' gross earnings. During the last ten years the cost to the Commonwealth for the carriage of Australian air mails has been £20,000 per.ton. Eor this we have toblame the Bruce Page Government, which made these contracts. One company in Western Australia has benefited to the extent of £500,000. It is time that the whole of our air mail services were co-ordinated, so that, with the development of civil aviation, we shall also be building up an efficient air force for defence purposes. The existing conditions should not be allowed to continue for another 24 hours. I mention the matter now in the hope that some action will be taken to put the position right.",49
192,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Moreton-Assistant Minister) [9.32] - The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) has asked for information with reference to payment of £300 as allowances to representatives in England. There has been no alteration of this vote. It is required for the payment of allowances to officers of the Permanent Forces who are sent to London for temporary duty at the High Commissioner's Office, and the War Office.",49
193,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,Are they Australian military officers?,49
194,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Yes . The honourable member also referred to alleged discontent on HMAS. Australia, while on a cruise to the islands of the Pacific. I discussed the allegations with the First Naval Member, Rear-Admiral Hyde, at the time. The vessel was then at sea. Admiral Hyde has since informed me that, upon the vessel's return, he discussed the matter with the senior officer of the ship, and has assured me that the whole story is a fabrication; that the ratings were quite happy, and did their work loyally and faithfully. It appears that there was some fear that, under the Financial Emergency Act, further substantial reductions of the pay and allowances of the lower ratings would be effected; but I am pleased to be able to state that, there has been no reduction since this Government took office. Unfortunately, certain reductions of pay and allowances were made under the regime of the previous Administration.",49
195,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Tho3 e reductions were made under the Financial Emergency Bill, which the Minister and his friends supported.",50
196,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Nevertheless , the honourable member conveyed the impression that such reductions had been made by this Government under its financial emergency legislation, and, as I have explained, they were not. Concerning - the references to RearAdmiral Hyde, the First Naval Member, all I need say is that he is Australian born, was specially appointed to, and received his early training in the Royal Navy, and after some years service in the Royal Australian Navy on loan, was transferred permanently to the Commonwealth service in 1912. He has served in our navy ifi peace and in war, has risen to the highest position which the Australian service has to offer, and may be trusted to uphold the best traditions of the Royal Navy, and of the Royal Australian Navy.",50
197,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,All of the officers on the Australia are not Australian-born.,50
198,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The honourable member for West Sydney also referred to the personnel of the Royal Australian Navy. On this point I refer him to the explanatory statement on the Estimates of expenditure for this year prepared by the tion of the Minister. On page 4 of that document he will find the following information :Fulfilment of the policy of building up an RearAustralian personnel for the Royal Australian Navy is progressing satisfactorily. Of a total of 2,787 petty officers and men borne, three only are on loan from the Royal Navy, and these will be replaced in the near future.",50
199,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,At least one is on the Australia.,50
200,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The""statemen t continues The number of officers on loan from the Royal Navy has been reduced to the following: - Seve n commanders and higher ranks, six warrant-officers, or thirteen out of a total of 384 borne. There are also ten Royal Naval officers on exchange service.",50
201,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,Does the Minister say definitely that there is no trouble on the Australia .11,50
202,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,Such is my information.,50
203,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,I should prefer to rely upon statements made by the men who were'there.,50
204,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Possibl y there was some agitation; but I am pleased to be able to say that there was no trouble. It is only fitting that I should pay a tribute to the ratings for the way in which they have conducted themselves during the disappointing time through which they, in common with other sections of the community, have passed owing to the difficult financial condition of the country. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr MCNicoll) referred to the abolition of compulsory training, and urged the need for re-organization of our defence system. Every one admits that the present state of our defence services is unsatisfactory; but, as I have explained, we are governed by considerations of finance. I am quite certain that the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) wishes to see the three arms of our defence system brought back to the excellent standard which they had attained in 1929, before drastic economies were made by the previous Administration. Unfortunately, that will not be possible until the financial position improves. I hope that the steps which this Government is taking, following the decisions of the Ottawa Conference, will usher in a direcnew era of prosperity in Australia, so that we may then be able to honour the sacred obligations which are imposed on ns to make our defence system adequate for our needs. With regard to the position of "" defence liaison officer in London,"" I would point out that the work formerly done by .senior officers of the Defence Department is now being carried out by Mr Trumble. As honourable members are aware, it was necessary, for financial reasons, to return those officials to Australia. Mr Trumble, who has had extensive experience in an administrative capacity in the Defence Department, is being assisted in liaison work by junior officers from the three arms of our defence forces. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) again mentioned the case of an ex-naval stoker. He has repeatedly discussed this matter in this House since 192S, when the offence for which the stoker was punished occurred. then there have been two or three changes of government, and successive Ministers for Defence have examined the files. I also have done so, and I am satisfied that the procedure followed was the correct one. The ex-stoker was charged under the naval regulations with an offence to the prejudice of good order and naval discipline, his offence being the typing of poetry, the subject-matter of which was subversive to naval discipline. All the facts of the case are to be found in Mansard. The charge was investigated by the captain of the ship in the ordinary service way. The accused, exercising his rights, selected an officer to assist him, and also called and examined witnesses. The captain found the charge proved, and, under the authority vested in him by the Australian Naval Defence Act, he sentenced the stoker to 90 days imprisonment and recommended his dismissal from the service. The Naval Board reviewed the evidence, and confirmed the sentence, except that discharge was substituted for dismissal. The discontinuance of sustenance to the ex-rating's wife was a consequential penalty of the punishment of imprisonment or detention during which a rating may not be borne for pay. His discharge was ordered by the Naval Board in accordance with the authority - vested in it by the naval regulations. As I have said, the offence for which the - stoker was punished occurred in 1928, so it would appear that the honourable member for Newcastle, who now appears to be anxious to have the case re-opened, neglected opportunities which were avaih able to him for at least two years, during which time a Labour Government was in power. I know that at the time the Minister for Defence investigated the charge thoroughly, and I am convinced, from my own study of the files, that former Ministers gave this matter very careful consideration, satisfied themselves that the charge had been proved and that everything had been done in accordance with the regulations.",50
205,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"If that is so, why was the captain sent Home shortly after the inquiry was held?",51
206,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Hi s term of service in the Australian Navy expired, and, in accordance with the usual procedure, he Since rejoined the British Navy. The honourable member for Newcastle also read a circular communication which honourable members have received dealing with civil aviation, and urged that our air mail services should be developed with a view to the training of air pilots for the Royal Australian Air Force. A sub-committee of experts appointed by the Disarmament Conference to draw up rules to govern civil aviation has included in its report a recommendation that the high contracting parties should refrain from requiring that civil aviation enterprises shall employ personnel specially trained with a view to their employment for military purposes. There must be a definite distinction between the two air services. The Government arranged for an interdepartmental committee to make a thorough investigation into all aspects of aviation matters in Australia, with a view to determining its future policy, and that committee has made its report to the Minister. He is now considering the question, .and at a very early date will bring the matter before the Cabinet, which will formulate a policy covering civil aviation generally, including the carriage of mails by air. Tho majority of our contracts or arrangements with the companies that carry air mails expire early next year, and the new policy will provide 'for a system that I am sure will meet with the approval of all honourable members.",51
207,Mr R GREEN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Richmond) [9.46] The provision for the development of civil aviation is £102,930, made up of subsidies for aerial mail services, £93,451; grants to aero clubs, £8,600; and miscellaneous services, £S79. For some considerable time a proposal to link ,up with Imperial Airways in an all-air route to Great Britain has heen discussed, and evidence on the subject has been taken by a committee in Australia. A proposition has been made by three Australian companies, two of which are at present drawing subsidies from the Commonwealth-Qanta s and Westralian Airways Limited. The third company concerned-Australia n National Airwayscarried on for some time a satisfactory service between Brisbane and Sydney. These companies appear to consider that they are entitled to all the plums in connection with civil aviation in Australia. New England Airways took over the service between Brisbane and Sydney that was relinquished by Australian National Airways, and at present are providing a daily service between those cities. At no time has the Government been asked for a subsidy by this company; it has carried on the service purely and simply as a commercial venture. I do not wish to anticipate the result of the inquiry that has been conducted, but, considering the length of time that it occupied, it is difficult to understand why the rather vague statement was made only the other day that it is likely to be some time before the Australian public will learn the nature of the report that has been presented to the Government. I should like the Minister to allay the fear that was expressed by an honourable member, that civil aviation may pass into the control of the three companies to which I have referred, two of which are already well subsidized. There are other companies and concerns connected with civil aviation which deserve consideration. It is thought likely that the Imperial Airways route will embrace a subsidized service between Sydney and Brisbane. I suggest that in no circumstances should the New England company, which has carried on a daily service without leaning on the taxpayers of Australia, be pushed on one side and displaced by other companies, one of which unfortunately found it necessary to cease operations. The explanatory statement placed in the hands of honourable members tonight, dealing with the department's estimates of expenditure, gives one cause for a good deal of disquietude, and makes one realise how totally inadequate are our defence forces. I do not propose to go over ground already covered by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr E. F. Harrison) in the very able speech that he delivered on the budget. Although that speech has received a fair degree of publicity, it should he distributed much more 'widely, because it was the utterance of a gentleman who is thoroughly acquainted with the subject. I commend the honourable member for having drawn attention to the very serious state into which our defences have fallen. Some honourable members may hold different views. One would expect, after listening to the puerile speech of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), who knows nothing about war, and has no intention of learning anything about it, that if an enemy invaded Australia, the honourable member would get up on a soap box and 33k it to return home. That is the only way in which he would defend Australia - wit h his tongue, which is dirty enough for anything.",52

209,Mr R GREEN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"He learned what he knows about the Navy when he went to Geneva, and sadly misrepresented Australia at an international gathering.",52
210,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,Order ! The honourable member must deal with the item before the Chair.,52
211,Mr R GREEN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Onl y four vessels are to be in commission during the current year, two of which-the cruisers Canberra and Australian-are supposed to be reasonably up to date. Incidentally, I may mention that those vessels did not add to our interest indebtedness, because they were purchased out of surplus revenue when the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) was Treasurer. Then there is the Albatross, which, so far as I have been able to gather, is somewhat out of date; also one of the "" T "" class destroyers, the Tattoo. All the other vessels are to be held in reserve, among them being the survey ship Moresby.. I am sorry that Australia is not deriving in surveying and chartmaking generally, the advantage that it should from the technical staff that has been built up in the Navy. Years of research - work and charting remain to be - done south from Thursday Island, particularly along the Great Barrier Reef. - Such work not only would benefit mariners generally, but is most necessary to - our own defence. If we desire to make - full use of that natural barrier, we should have a complete knowledge of it . If we Keep the survey ship in reserve, we shall lose a highly trained personnel, the like of which it is difficult to obtain. During the coming year, as well as in the future, at least one survey ship should be kept continually in commission. It is a very necessary portion of our naval work. The fact that it is beneficial to our commercial relationships should appeal to the militant pacifists in our midst. I understand that, after graduation, the cadets of Flinders naval base cannot all be absorbed in the Navy. They receive an excellent educational and naval training at the public expense, and if they canuot be absorbed in positions for which they have been definitely trained., they Bhould be transferred to some other branch of the Commonwealth Service to which they would be a decided acquisition. At their age they are far better equipped educationally than the average person admitted to the Public Service. I was perturbed to read in the explanatory notes the following paragraph, under the heading, "" Naval Stores "" Owing to the adverse financial position, will still uot be possible to maintain normal stocks of naval stores, purchases of which will continue to be made on the present reduced basis. I cannot close my eyes to the fact that the diplomatic waters of the Pacific are anything but calm. To the north of us we have the very serious trouble that exists in Manchuria. Originally, that disturbance concerned only China and Japan, but it is extremely possible that other nations, possibly including Australia, will be involved. I recall the comparatively minor incident of Serajevo in 1914, which led to a world conflagration. It is quite conceivable that a spark may be dropped into the powder magazine of Manchuria, and that before we know where we are, we shall be involved in another tremendous conflict. In view of that possibility, it is alarming to read the comment to which I have referred. If it is not considered a matter of high government policy, I should like the Minister to indicate whether the position can be rectified. The explanatory notes also indicate that HMAS. Canberra "" showed the flag in the Pacific"". It will be readily understood that, as the representatives of Australia, the officers and men of the ship would be entertained more or less lavishly, and in turn would be called upon to entertain representative people of Noumea, V i l a , Suva, and No r f o lk Island. An important medium of entertainment would be alcoholic beverages. I suggest that, to lighten the entertaining expense that must f all on the personnel of our warships, which visits outposts of the Pacific and elsewhere, liquor should he supplied to them free of customs duty and excise. A check could easily be kept of the amount issued,for the purpose.",52
212,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,I do not think that liquor purchased outside the three-mile l i m it is subject to duty.,53
213,Mr R GREEN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"I am led to believe otherwise. Perhaps an allowance could be made to assist those concerned. I am sorry that our naval, air, and military defence has been so reduced that Australia is left worse than naked in this respect.",53
214,Mr HUTCHI N,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Denison) [10.8] In reply to the honourable member for it ""West Sydney (Mr Beasley), the Minister stated that the lower ratings of the Navy have sustained no salary reduction since that made by the Scullin Government.",53
215,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"That is correct, so far as petty officers and lower ratings are concerned.",53
216,Mr HUTCHIN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"I am advised that a second reduction has occurred in respect of the lower paid personnel of the army and air force. If that is so, I should like to know the reason for the differentiation. Mr A . GREEN (Kalgoorlie) [10.10]. - I wish to refer to the administration of the Defence Department, more particularly because of the statement of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr E. E. Harrison) that the Scullin Government of which E, as Minister for Defence, was a member, had wrecked the defence policy of Australia. I have not the slightest objection to :;:.y honourable member holding vici'"" ? d.i>-.rent from mine , < with regard to the method of defence necessary to maintain the safety of Australia, but I do object to any honourable member questioning the patriotism of others just because his political views differ from theirs. The honourable member statedBut through the policy of the last Government, a highly efficient force was converted into a mere skeleton. That imposed a tremendous hardship upon enthusiastic soldiers and they felt the rebuff keenly. For reasons best known to themselves the members of the last Ministry had no sympathy with the profession of arms. That is not the true position. The honourable member for Bendigo may have persuaded himself that that was the attitude of the Scullin Government towards defence, hut I can assure him that one of the principal planks of the platform to which the Labour party is pledged, is the effective defence of Australia. When Minister for Defence, I spent a great deal of time, as the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) knows, in visiting drill halls in the capital cities of Australia to ascertain how our youths were faring nnder the voluntary system introduced by the Labour Government, and to encourage them. I personally had nothing against the Defence Department; I wanted' to help it, and I wish, at this stage, to pay a tribute to a number of its officers, who worked hard indeed in assisting the Labour Government to make a success of the voluntary system. The fact that the present Government has not interfered with that system is evidence that it has not brought about the great disaster that was prophesied by the present Minister, the honourable member for Balaclava, and others at the time of its institution. This Government, which the honourable member for Bendigo supports, is spending on defence even less than the Scullin Government spent. I find no fault with that, because of the need for economy. But the point Mr A. Green. is that the honourable member has raised no protest in this chamber against the action of the present Government in continuing the defence policy instituted by a Labour government. The honourable member said that the defence forces had been reduced to less than 30,000 men. The Labour Government's aim was to have a defence force of 35,000 men. We consulted the Council of Defence, the head of which was Sir John Monash, who, I say with all due deference to other soldiers in Australia, was the greatest soldier that this country hasever produced. He helped us to framethe scheme of defence which exists today. and which has for its object the employment and training of an adequate number of officers to keep in operation the same number of units as were then in existence. The honourable member also said that: the Labour party when in power seemed determined to depreciate the soldier. I challenge the honourable member to pointto any action on the part of myself or my successor, Mr Chifley, which would justify him in making such a statement.. The honourable member further statedWe have been told that by giving a man. a rifle and a uniform he can be made an integral and useful part of an army. The attitude of the Scullin Government was illustrated by the "" p run in g "" of the liaison officers at Australia House. The "" pruning "" of the liaison officers in London was carried out on the recommendation of the Defence Department itself, and it is now fully recognized, even by this Government, that the duties which were previously carried out by those officers are now heing successfully carried out by a civilian who has considerable ability. The difficulty in thrDefence Department is that various technical officers hold divergent views as to the arm upon which the safety Australia mainly depends. One officer will say that the most important is the military arm, and of course the naval and the air force officers will contend that the respective services with which they are concerned are the most vital. I refer the honourable member for Bendigo, who has had considerable experience in military matters, to the experiments which have been carried out by the air force of the United States of America under Mr Mitchell, an air force expert, who has claimed that warships are now chained to the beach because of the ease with which they can be destroyed by aerial torpedoes. Sir John Monash informed me that this dispute as to the importance of the different defence arms was taking place in every country in the world. was even taking place in India at the time of his visit there. The honourable member for Bendigo went on to sayThe. expenditure upon defence in Australia during the last few years bears a pitiable lation to the expenditure prior to the war. In 1913-14 the expenditure was 23s. 7d. head; this year it is estimated to be 9s. 3d. The Scullin Government was faced with a financial deficit. It had no towards the soldier or the Defence Departwhich ment. We all know that during the war the workers represented nine-tenths of those who enlisted.",53
217,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"And now they are starving. Mr A. GEEEN - They certainly have not received what they expected at hands of this country. But I am not dealing with that subject now. Scullin Government, when it took office, was faced with a deficit of £20,000,000, and with the prospect of a deficit £40,000,000 at the end of the next financial year. . Australia, unfortunately for us, expended £700,000,000 on the European war. That expenditure represents the major portion of our total debt of £1,100,000,000. Because of the war expenditure, Australia and other countries are now faced with serious financial problems. Australia the finest country on God's earth, yet has 400,000 people unemployed. Scullin Government during its first year of office, reduced the expenditure defence from £6,500,000 to £4,850,000. Other departmental expenditure was also reduced. The nations of the world have been so exhausted by past wars that there is no danger of another war within next ten years. I make that statement on the authority of officers of the I telligence Corps. Mr E. F. HARRISON - Before the orable member became Minister for Deaeroplane come from ? fence, I was director of that branch for five years. Mr A. GEEEN - The information that I received from the intelligence officers was very different from that supplied by the honourable member in his speech, and I leave him to reconcile his arguments with the facts that I have presented. In the year 1930-31, the goI t vernment with which I was associated reduced the expenditure on defence by £972,000, and the present Government is reducing it still further. In 192S, the people of this country had' to pay £29,000,000, or £4 12s. per head, in respect of old wars, and 17s. 8d. per head rein preparation for new wars. Only £2 per 12s. 6d. per head was left for financing other governmental services. The compulsory system of military training is not in operation in any British animus dominion, not even in New Zealand, is far more isolated than Australia, nor in South Africa, which ha& a comparatively small white population. The speech of the honourable - member for Bendigo shows that he takes a gloomy view of the position of Australia from the a defence view-point. I am reminded of the fact that many years ago we were The told to beware of Eussia. I served under General Hutton in Victoria under the voluntary system, and I well remember of his saying that we should watch the Russians. To-day we are watching Eussia, but for another reason; we are interested in the great experiment that is now being carried out in that country. I have seen something of militarism as we have knowu it in Europe, and as we had a taste of it in Australia during the last war, and it is certainly is a thing that we should avoid as far as it practicable. The honourable member for The Bendigo remarked that at the present moment the condition of Australia is one on of absolute insecurity. The honourable member is associated with a party that has a large majority in this Parliament, and it lies within the power of the Government immediately to change the present the defence system, if it so desiresThe honourable member remarked that during n - the last war, an aeroplane from an enemy cruiser was alleged to have flown over Sydney. This is the first time that I honhave heard that story. Where did the Mr E. F. HARRISON - From the raider Wolf. Mr A. GEEEN-We may dismiss that tale as being unworthy of credence. He also remarked that mine-fields had been laid off Gabo Island. I was not surprised to hear that German vessels had laid a few mines; not even Australia could have hoped to escape from the danger from that source. I know that enemy cruisers laid many mines in the China seas when I was there during the war: But if every man in Australia were armed to the teeth, and the expenditure on defence were ten times as great as it now is, such things would happen. The honourable member also observed that it was probable that in the next war, Australians would see bloodshed in their own country. That may be the honourable member's opinion, but the advice given to me by the intelligence officers was that there was only one nation in a position to attack Australia. Knowing the psychology of that country, I do not fear attack from that quarter. In any case, it would take that country six months to prepare for war with Australia, and our intelligence officers would be well-informed of any preparations of that kind. If it would take another power six months to establish a base in Australia, it would have to reckon with the British Navy. Seeing that it is not practicable for a foreign power to hold this country, I maintain that the present defence system meets our requirements under existing conditions, at any rate, I admit that an aeroplane from an enemy vessel could destroy the Sydney Harbour bridge, or drop bombs on the capital cities. That would be only a raid, which could not be followed by occupation. ""We should recognize that our first duty is to develop this country, and not spend money needlessly in providing for defence. New Zealand and South Africa are far more exposed to invasion than is Australia. I agree with the honourable member's statement that it would be nothing less than murder to send ill-equipped and untrained men into the field, but I do not admit his claim that Australia is the weakest link in the chain of Empire defence. The outlook in Europe may not be encouraging. Mr Ward,-It looks black in India, too. Mr A. GEEEN - Yes . But. the Japanese have bitten off as much as they can chew in Manchuria for the next 30 years. The very fact that Australia has adopted the voluntary system of military training is a gesture in favour of peace among the nations. The Labour party has always opposed compulsory service. If this country were attacked,, every member of the community would beanxious to give his services in helping to repel the invader, and we should haveseveral months' notice of preparations for attack before an enemy could land here. The voluntary training system was rereceived with a good deal of enthusiasm; all the technical arms were fully recruited, but the response for the infantry was less satisfactory, and I understand that enlistments have declined since the Labour Government went out of office, although even now they are within 5,000 of the required strength of 35,000. In 1929 conferences of militia commanding officers held in all States recommended, in order to give a fillip to the voluntary system(a) increase the rates of pay for private soldiers substantially; (6) expedite the complete issue of the more attractive uniforms which it was decided to adopt when the change over from universal training took place; (c) ensure that camps of continuous training arc held annually. I believe that if all these recommendations were carried out we could quickly recruit the extra 5,000 men necessary for the defence of Australia. But the Minister has declared "" it is not practicable, under present financial condition's, to increase the rates of pay or the vote for provision of uniforms, but it is proposed to hold camps in lieu of bivouacs in 1932-33."" The committee will see that, despite the criticism that was hurled at the last Government by the Assistant Minister (Mr Francis), the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White), and others, when they have responsibility they continue the system which the predecessors of the present Government inaugurated. When I was Minister for Defence, I was advised that there was no likelihood of a war occurring within the next ten years; and judging by the present economic state of the world, there is little prospect of war on a large scale for at least two decades. Trouble may occur in Europe, but if it does I hope that Great Britain will manage to keep out of it and not risk a repetition of its experiences in the last war when, although it was mainly refore, sponsible for the success of gained the least benefit from victory. In 1921 the Nationalist Government suspended for a period all camps of training. The number of training centres was reduced from 371 to 42-i Queensland, from 63 to 11; in New South Wales, from 129 to 14; in Victoria, from 90 to 9; in South Australia, from 31 to 3; in Western Australia, from 19 and in Tasmania, from 37 to 4. I do say that the present Government is dismember, loyal because it does what the financial exigencies demand; it is merely acting with common sense. Train a lad to use his fists and he immediately wants to fight his fellows. ' Similarly, when a prepared nation is armed to the teeth, it is always spoiling for a fight. Whilst in my endeavour to economize I received a lot of assistance from officers in the Defence Department, I obtained no help in reducing the expenditure the Royal Military College at Duntroon from £52,000 a year to £17,000 a year. I was told that such reduction could be effected without destroying the morale Minister. of the cadets. We were training 69 cadets at a weekly cost of £14 per The college had cost £1,000,000 from its saving. inception. At the Royal Naval College, Jervis Bay, £871,000 had been spent, only 200 cadets had graduated. The annual cost of training 51 cadets was £67,000. When I declared that this penditure must be reduced, I obtained help from the commandant in charge. Labour Government decided to transfer the Royal Military College from Duntradict troon to Sydney, where it is being tained at a cost of about £15,000 a year, whilst by transferring it from Jervis to Flinders, the annual expenditure on the Naval College has been reduced from £67,000 to £15,000. The charge of disloyalty which, has been levelled against the Scullin Government cannot be sustained. That Government had to reduce expenditure, but fortunately when a man is placed in charge of any service, whether a governknown to be wrong. ment department or a military establishment, he maintains that it is to keep his expenditure within the limits prescrihed hy the government. Thereable a third party has to he brought in the Allies, it to do the job Mr E. F. HARRISON (Bendigo) [10.37] - The committee has probably been misled by certain statements made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie n (Mr A. Green) ; for instance, he stated turethat in his endeavour to reduce expendion the defence colleges he received no assistance from me when commandant to 1; at Duntroon or from the captain in not charge of the Royal Australian Naval College at Jervis Bay. If the honourable when Minister, failed to get that assistance, it must have been through lack of attention to the work of his department, because, during his regime, I two schemes for the reduction of expenditure at Duntroon, and, in cooperation with the then captain in charge at Jervis Bay, drafted a third. Those proposals may or may not have been submitted to the honourable member for Kalgooidie, but in justice to my opposite on number at Jervis Bay and myself, I must place on record the fact that these schemes were prepared and should have not been brought to the notice of the then",55
218,Mr A GREEN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"They were imprachead. ticable and proposed practically no Mr E. F. HARRISON - I listened and carefully to what the honourable member had to say in criticism of my speech, and I do not see that I am called upon to exreply to any of his remarks. He quoted no portions of my speech almost verbatim, The and made verbose comments upon them, but in no instance was he able to conanything I had said, except my mainstatement that there was always a possibility of a world war. I know of Bay the statement referred to by the honourable member as to the unlikelihood of a world war taking place for some time, and, in my opinion, it should not have been mentioned in this House by the ex-Minister for Defence or hy anybody else.",57
219,Mr A GREEN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The honourable member unhimself made a statement diametrically opposed to it, and - which he must have Mr E. F. HARRISON - I did not impossible know it to he wrong. I do not propose to follow the honormember into a discussion of those matters which came under my notice when I held an official position, and which should not be discussed publicly. It seems - to me to be a poor foundation for a defence force to rely for immunity from attack on some psychological trait in the character of one's enemy. It would not be right for those charged with the defence of the country to take such a factor into consideration as a reason for neglecting proper defence measures. My statement that Ave are the weakest link of the Empire chain of defence has also been criticized by the ex-Minister. I am afraid that he is not in a position to dispute the truth of that statement; while I am in a position to prove it, and will do so at any time he feels inclined. Upon inquiry it would he borne out by practically every officer charged with the responsibility for defence of this country, no matter to what branch of the defence forces he may belong.. It is all very well to make gestures of disarmament to the world. The ex-Attorney-General, the former honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), at a conference in Geneva, publicly announced that Australia had led the world in disarmament. My experience of life has taught me that it is not safe to play according to the rules if you are playing against people who do not know the rules, and that it is not safe for a nation to become the sole disarmed unit in the world while other nations-as many are doing now-ar e increasing their armaments from day to day. To say that because we arm ourselves to protect our homeland we are likely to invite attack, is a statement hardly worthy of an answer. Most honourable members will agree with me that the man who has learned to use his fists keeps out of fights until the occasion arises when he must fight, and then he knows how to use them. He does not seek quarrels. He avoids fights because he knows the danger and trouble incidental to them, even though he prove the victor. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie accused me of being an advocate of compulsory training. I do not think that I used the term in my speech the other night. It is an expression I do not use. Whenever I am discussing that aspect of defence, I use the expression ""universal training "". The object of my speech was Mr E. F. Harrison. to draw attention to the fact that we in Australia were not in a position to defend ourselves. I said that the condition of our finances had a great bearing on the present condition of our defence forces. I said that system of training previously in operation in this country had provided us with an efficient force, but I did not recommend a reversion to that system. I believe it is possible to build up an efficient force under the present system of voluntary training; but we must have adequate reserves, and to have them, we must be prepared to pay more for defence. I do not propose to follow the honourable member for Kalgoorlie into all his comments on my remarks. I have other reasons for speaking to this item, one of them being to correct an error into which the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) has fallen in more than one speech dealing with our defenders. On previous occasions, as well as 'on the present, he has made erroneous statements which have not been challenged because, perhaps, no one has had the exact information at his disposal. He said that the cost of training cadet midshipmen at Jervis Bay worked out at approximately £4,000 for each cadet. He then drew a parallel between that and the cost of training students in the so-called learned professions at a university. I remind the honourable member that the conditions are not parallel. In an institution such as the Royal Australian Naval College it is necessary to teach the same number of subjects as in any faculty at a university, but the classes are much smaller in comparison with the number who take courses in medicine or law at a university. The cost of running small classes is always higher than that of running fullsized ones. The honourable member said that there were 162 teachers at the college, but that is not correct. I tried to correct him by interjection when he was speaking, but I was informed that I did not want to hear the truth. I protest that I do want to know-the truth, and I have been at some pains to learn it. At the Naval College, besides a number of officers and civilians, there were lower ratings who did the ordinary work about the college, such as painting and repairs. Others were cooks, who prepared meals for the cadets and the staff, while others were at the college partly for health reasons, recuperating after coming out of hospital.. They were: not really connected with the college at all - The figures quoted by the honourable member were, T believe, supplied to him by the Defence Department, which was at fault in furnishing such information. The honourable member then spoke of the expenses of the Royal Military College at Duntroon. He - said that 69 staff cadets were under the charge of 98 teachers and others. I know that when that answer was furnished to the honourable member, there were eight officer"" instructors at the college. There were nothing like 98 others. In cluded among the "" others "" were persons who were allowed to ply their own trade such as boot making, hairdressing, tailoring, and the like persons', who by no stretch of the imagination could be put down as teachers. A consideration of these facts does not make the case quite so amazing. I believe that the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) was misled in using the figures he quoted, and I htipe that he will not use them again. The Capital Cost of the Royal Military College was criticized by the honourable member for Melbourne, and has been referred to again this evening by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. Both honourable gentlemen put the figure down at £1,000,000 up to date, taking into account all expenditure since 1911. On that basis, a calculation has heen made to show how much it cost to turn out each cadet from the college. The number of cadets, alive or dead, was divided into the £1,000,000, but no regard was paid to the fact that during the war period 1,400 other officers were trained at the college. To train these, the staff frequently worked double shifts without any extra remuneration or expectation of it. Certain anomalies in the three arms of the Defence Force have been awaiting rectification for a long time, hut since no one has been in a position to voice the complaint nothing has been done. I refer to the unequal rates of pay of the three services. To illustrate the position, I shall take three equivalent ranks in the Royal Australian Navy, the Army, and the Royal Australian Air Force. A rear-admiral in the Navy receives, in active pay, £2,250^ subject to no reductions under the financial emergency legislation, and until three 1 or four months ago he also received £134 per annum deferred pay. Theseamounts, with a lodging allowance, made his total pay £2,464 a year. This rate is fairly in accordance with, therates ruling throughout the British. Empire, although in the Royal Navy they are slightly higher and the allowances are definitely better. In the Army,, a major - general,. who is also chief of the : general staff and senior member of a the Military Board, receives £1,163 a year. A major-general who is also adjutant-general, but is not chief of the general staff, receives- £891 a year. These ranks afford a fair indication of the relative rates of pay in the respective services. The age of the youngest incumbent in each case shows considerable disparity. In the case of the rear-admiral it is 55 years, in that of the major-general, who is chief of the general staff, it is nearly 59 years, and in that of the adjutant-general, it is 60 years. It will he seen, therefore, that at 60 years the adjutant-general of the Army receives £891, while at 55 years the rear-admiral, who is also chief of the naval staff, and has perhaps heavier responsibility, receives £2,464 a year. In each of the services there has been a different scale of examination for a considerable time. In the service to which I had the honour to belong, cadets who complete their preliminary course are examined for the rank of lieutenant, captain, major, and lieutenant-colonel before they may receive either promotion or increments in piy. In addition, it might almost be said that dozens of other courses of special instruction have to he taken by an officer during his career. In the Navy, examinations are held only for the ranks of sub-lieutenarit and lieutenant. Beyond the rank of lieutenant promotions depend upon reports on conduct and upon a certain degree of suitability and seniority. To continue the comparisons of pay, a brigadier draws from £752 to £891, the age of the youngest incumbent being 48 years, while an air-commodore draws £1,293, the age of the youngest incumbent being 42 .years. A captain in the Royal Australian Navy draws from £1,100 to £1,300, while a colonel, which is the equivalent rank in the Army, draws £661, and a group captain, the equivalent air force rank, draws £1,224. To take another group, a commander in the Royal Australian Navy draws from £671 to £849, while his brother officer in the Army, a lieutenant-colonel, draws from £565 to ±'627, and a wing-commander draws from £672 to £930. Right down the scale the - same disparity is to be found. This has been a source of irritation to officers serving in the Army. It does not make for harmony when officers in other branches of the service, younger in .years and subject to fewer examinations for promotion, draw in some cases .almost double the pay for their year's work. The age disparity is in every case - against the Army officer, and shows that the latter is nearly always five or «ix years older .than his brother officer - of equivalent rank in the Navy and Air Force; yet nothing has heen said or done with the object of correcting the anomaly. In these forces overseas vast changes 'have been made in recent years, with the - result that today it might almost he that a group of officers holding equivalent trank in the Navy, Army, or A i r Force receive much the same pay. I consider that some degree of equality in pay should be introducced into the three arms of our Defence Force, to avoid the irritation that exists at present.",57
220,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Melbourne Ports) [11.0] - Thos e honourable members who have discussed the subject of defence night have neglected to deal with fundamentals. I listened to the orable member for Werriwa (Mr machinery MCNicoll) with a good deal of artisans attention, and while disagreeing with him on some of the views he exmanufacturing pressed concerning militarism, I am tain that he is sincere in trying to assist the people of Australia to defend this - country effectively against an invader. ""We all wish to do that; but the difficulty is that from year to year governments, Ministers and various political parties :are insincere. If they were sincere trying to perfect a scheme of defencenot something that will aggravate other nations-the y would set aside all personal business considerations in an endeavour to formulate a truly national scheme. That is what we ought to do if we wish to defend this country as we think it ought to be defended. Surely every honourable member will agree that the methods of warfare have changed as have conditions generally in our economic life. The basis of any defence scheme is largely economic, and.the question of private profit should be eliminated from the consideration of any scheme of defence. Let me give two illustrations. When the Attorney-General (Mr Latham) submitted his report on the recent Disarmament Conference, he said that the outstanding difficulty-if he had not said so we could have obtained the information from his report or from our general reading-wa s to define where schemes of defence began and ended. He said that it was almost impossible to determine the amount of expenditure that should be permitted to one nation as against other nations, because of the inroads which defence makes upon the ordinary industrial activities of a nation. I remind said honourable members of another statement made during the second year of the war. It seemed as if the allied countries would be wiped off the map, and Britishers were at their wits' end; we were all wondering what was going to happen. But Mr Lloyd George placed his finger on the cause of the whole trouble when he said, ""England is not heing defeated on the battlefield; she is being defeated in the workshops."" toThat statement was based on the fact that the British people had allowed their inhondustrial technique to drift, their .to become rusty, and their to be out of training. Commodities which Great Britain should have been were heing obtained from cerEssen, Berlin, Paris, and elsewhere and transported to the dominions, thus allowing the British plants to become obsolete. On the outbreak of war these plants were useless and practically all branches of the navy, army and air force were ill-equipped or left within out supplies to meet the situation which then developed. Following upon the advice which Mr Lloyd George gave Great Britain built factories, constructed machines, installed plant and trained men and women to make the equipment necessary to enable her soldiers to carry on the struggle. A cablegram containaimed ing the words of Mr Lloyd George which I have quoted, was flashed all over British Empire. Great Britain's experience during war leads me to say that the millions of pounds which are expended on defence could be spent to greater advantage. We could get better rebut sults from the expenditure of the the same amount if we would only disinstall card the obsolete idea that our defence workshops should not enter into competition with private enterprise. In scheme of national defence it is of mount importance that, in peace time, these workshops should engage in work undertaken by private enterprise in order that it may be possible to maintain them at no cost to the general taxpayer. It is in that respect that honand the work was regarded orable members are inconsistent when, for instance, they say that Cockatoo Island Dockyard shall not make a boiler for a private firm. Under defence scheme we have difficulty in continuing the training of our engineers, electricians and artificers, who are equal to any in the world. I have heard men from Vickers works could admit that. I have seen some of the per machines in Vickers works fashioning huge pieces of iron resembling tree trunks into big guns. It was work which the general public is not supposed to see. staff in our clothing factory which is ing uniforms, canvas goods, and leather equipment is equal to any in the world, hut because this Government and those it represents stand for the sacred rights private enterprise, it is not maintained at its proper strength, and the factory prevented from earning profits which would help us to maintain an efficient defence system. If those engaged in that factory were allowed to make tents and other canvas goods instead of making only covers for hangars, it would show a much better return. If continuous employment were provided for these artisans, we should be able to maintain a more efficient defence machine than have at present. About 25 or 30 years [54] ago a Commonwealth Government, whose name has gone down in history and which was a credit to this country, established for the first time a defence scheme which at making Australia self-reliant. That scheme was jeered at by those who the said that we should subsidize Great Britain and expect the vessels of her fleet the which were stationed 12,000 miles away to defend us should the need arise. That Government did not only train men for active service, and establish workshops, it also subsidized people to open up iron ore deposits in this country, and plant to roll steel plates so that we could construct our own ships. It built .woollen mills and clothing and harness any factories, and developed all kinds of inparadustries fundamental to any real scheme of defence. While the war was in progress no one objected to the development of these national workshops, or to increased expenditure upon them, hecause every one's skin was in danger as necessary, but when the war was over those who now say that we are not adequately defended, that our defence our machinery is obsolete, and that we are not spending as much money upon it as we should, undermined and sabotaged these national workshops hecause the work that was being undertaken in them not be classed . as 100 ceut. for defence purposes. We have since tried to carry on the workshops with the machinery working at only half capacity; we have neglected The the proper technical training of the emmakployees; we have undermined the fundamental basis of our defence scheme. If the defence of our country is worth doing, it is worth doing well. Let us have of a decent scheme of defence. Only by having trained artisans, a succession of is apprentices, and workshops equipped with modern machinery working at full, capacity, if necessary doing work which is not strictly either naval or military,, can we hope to establish a proper scheme of defence. When it was proposed to dismantle the Commonwealth harness factory, I interviewed General Ryrie, who told me that the leather and the canwe vas equipment of the Australian troops in Palestine was better than that of any other group of soldiers engaged in the war. I thereupon urged that, instead of disbanding the staff, which we had scoured Australia to secure, the manager, Mr Crowe, should be allowed to make footballs, or cricket balls, or to do other work which could not come strictly within the category of naval or military requirements. The general agreed that the machinery should be kept up to date, and the staff well trained, hut he added that the government of that day did not believe in governments engaging in trading operations. In other words, that Government would not do anything to encroach on the profit-making preserves, of the Fluid crsJane merchants. The Commonwealth clothing factory showed a profit from the beginning; it paid for the land on which it stood and for the equipment, and, in addition, it contributed to the general revenue from time to time. But because the government of the day did not' believe in the factory doing other than strictly defence work, it was proposed to close the factory. Representations were made that the management of the factory should be permitted to tender for the making of policemen's uniforms and helmets, uniforms for postal and tramway employees, &c, so that the staff, including the makers required for the making of aeroplane hangars, might be kept in employment, but the request was refused, because it was said that to do so would be to enter into trade. If those fess to believe in a scientific scheme of defence were in earnest, they would agree that the munition factory at Maribyrnong, the dockyards at Cockatoo Island, and the clothing factories in the several capitals, are all parts of a comprehensive scheme of defence, and they would allow the management to accept any work necessary to keep a trained staff fully employed. Mr E. J. HARBISON - Is that not now being done at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory ?",60
221,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"In order to keep that factory going, the last Government tried to find work for the special machines installed there, and, after some time, it decided to make shearing machines at Lithgow. That was done only because there was no private firm in Australia prepared to accept the risk of making those machines. Shearing machines are still made at the Lithgow factory, but on the part of some who pretend that they want to provide for the defence of Australia there is a constant endeavour to take that work away from the factory.",62
222,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,Me n are heing put off at the rate of nine a week.,62
223,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The Maribyrnong workshops are in charge of a first class management. It was the first factory in Australia to roll sheets of brass, but as soon as it showed that there was profit in the operation the work was given to private enterprise. The management is not allowed to make the factory pay, notwithstanding that it is a necessary part of an adequate defence scheme. I want our people to he self-reliant: I want Australia to have a real defence scheme, and that can be done only by having workshops properly equipped with modern machinery, and staffed with trained mechanics. Those who would deny the right of these workshops to maintain a trained staff by training apprentices year hy year, and would refuse to permit the machinery to be kept up to saildate, are not playing the game; they are not real Australians, and are not really concerned about the defence of Australia. What is it that makes Hitler appeal to the young Germans of today who prounless it is that he and his Nazi lieutenants are seeking to establish a system of State socialism in Germany? They are out to build up the internal position of Germany. They claim that too long has Germany expended her energies in sending goods overseas without any real concern for Germany itself, and they are now concentrating upon building up the nation from within. Their appeal is meeting with a ready response. Germany is not allowed to manufacture arms and munitions of the orthodox kind; but its people know that the methods of warfare are changing, and that, in future, technicians will determine the soundness or otherwise of any nation's scheme of defence. Consequently, Germany is training electricians, engineers, chemists, and skilled tradesmen, and has established a system of compulsory physical culture. Groups of men, comprising university - students, mechanics, and uneducated farm labourers, are put together in - camps, and, .at tike expiration of twelve months of compulsory manual labour and educational .training, the university .student cannot he distinguished from the mechanic or the manual labourer; they are all better men physically and mentally than when they entered the camps, .and are possessed of greater initiative. Within a few years the whole German nation will be trained to the last ounce. This training is not classified as training for warfare:; yet it is the basis of any sound scheme of defence. We must seek to make Australia worth defending hy providing full-time work, decent wages, proper education, and reasonable hours and conditions of labour. If we make Australia worth defending, every man will be willing to defend it. Our defence scheme is too costly for the results, achieved. A sound scheme of defence necessitates intensive training, sO that the nation, if forced into a war, can conduct its operations on a scientific basis. That cannot be done without trained men, or workshops equipped with machinery which, in times of peace, is used to promote peaceful development, and can, when the occasion arises, make implements of war. We should see that our defence scheme is established on such a basis. Mr E. J. HAKBISON (Wentworth) [11.20],- I pay a tribute to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Holloway), whose contributions to the debates in this chamber are always interesting and instructive. I believe that he is thoroughly sincere in all that he says with reference to our defence system, but I disagree with him when he says that we are spending too much upon it. I endorse his remarks with reference to the need for national workshops which could be devoted to defence purposes when the need arises, and I submit that we should make adequate provision for the training and equipment of our forces. Those of us who went through the horror of the Great War have no desire to take part in another, nor do we wish to see put into operation defence policies which may give offence to other countries and perhaps cause another conflict. however, essential that we should put our defences in such a state as to deter any foreign power from endeavouring to occupy our shores. [Quorum formed.] I should not have spoken in this debate but for the remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) who, as an ex-Minister for Defence, should be able to enlighten the committee - upon the real state of our defence system. But before commenting upon his observations, I desire to compliment the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr E. F. Harrison) upon his comprehensive survey of our position and his exposure of our impotence in defence matters. I cannot help thinking, however, that he did not give us the whole story-that he let us down somewhat lightly; I should like to hear him say exactly what is in his mind about the state of our defences, in the hope that it would awaken the people to the danger of .unpreparedness. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie made statements which, to me, appeared to be ridiculous and absolutely insincere. Mr A. GEEEN - I take exception to the offensive remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr E. J. Harrison) and ask that they be withdrawn. He has charged me with insincerity. Mr E. J. HARRISON - I withdraw the remarks if they are offensive to the honourable member, but I hope to be able to prove what I have just said. As an ex-soldier the defence of this country is of some consequence to me, particularly in view of the fact that portion of Sydney Harbour defences is in my electorate. Members of the Labour party never tire of telling us that the party stands for the effective defence of Australia, but its more recent attitude to this important subject would lead one to believe that its ideas of the defence measures necessary to protect this country from aggression are, to say the least, somewhat humorous. I , in common with many other honourable members on this side of the chamber, take a serious view of our position. Recently, in company with the Assistant Minister for Defence (Mr. Francis) and one or two other members, I had an opportunity to inspect the defences of Sydney Harbour. At South Head I was particularly struck with the It is, inadequacy of the guns and equipment. I understand that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, when he was Minister for Defence, also inspected the South Head Military Reserve with the object, I believe, of considering a proposal to make it a public reserve. If the present arrangeHe ments at South Head-the y are a travesty of what defence measures should be-ar e allowed to stand, the reserve might as well be handed over to the people for a public park. I asked the officer in charge how the range of the guns would compare with naval guns, and was informed that modern vessels would be able to stand off and blow South Head to atoms. Will honourable members believe me when I say that candles are used in the magazine for lighting purposes, and that the machinery used to drive the searchlights is so exposed that it could be put out of action by one shell? After inspecting South Head our party crossed to the other side of the harbour to have a look at Chowder Bay. There I was horrified at the conditions under which the men comprising the garrison were carrying on their work. The engineei - 1 ing officer in charge has, under his control, a number of efficient machines, iathes, &c, but I was astounded to notice that the overhead shafting was supported from hangers which, in their turn, were supported by broken beams screwed together with bolts. The first question that I asked that particular officer was, whether the State factory inspectors allowed this sort of thing. He replied, "" Unfortunately for us, they have no jurisdiction. If they had, we should have been put through long ago."" I then asked why the beams were bolted together as they were; whether it was due to the fact that there was not a sufficient supply of timber. I was told that the amount of money available did not permit of decent joistings being put in. I then said, "" Where did you get all this broken timber ?"" and was told "" We simply tore up the floor, took out the beams, bolted them together, and swung them overhead "". The reply to my inquiry as to what supported the flooring was, "" We have rubble built under .the joistings to support it "" . This establishment is a travesty of a defence system for Australia. It reminded me of a song that was sung on the other side, "" We are a ragtime army "". Mr E. J. Harrison. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie argued that no army could land on the shores of Australia, because it would be prevented by the British navy. is one of those who would hold on to the apron-strings of the Mother Country. In the mouths of such people-the worse word is too good for the British navy in times of peace, but as soon as war threatens they expect it to get us out of our troubles. The honourable member also said that if any nation should dare to make an attempt to invade Australia, every man; woman and child would go to the waterfront to resist it. Presumably they would be armed with pop-guns, or would endeavour to prevent a landing by the use of hot air, a practice in which the honourable member is well versed. When an ex-Minister for Defence says that the defences of Australia are effective, his qualifications for that position ought to be investigated. I am pleased that in the present Assistant Minister we have a military man. Ho has given us the assurance that when the finances permit the whole of the defence system will he thoroughly re-organized. I may have peculiar notions in regard to those who should hold Cabinet positions; but I maintain that the defence system of this country can be properly administered only by a practical soldier, not by a theorist or one who has had no experience of warfare. Any man who endeavours to administer the system without possessing the requisite knowledge cannot do justice to Australia. Those who have practical knowledge of the subject should lay hare the sorry state to which our defences have sunk. If the Government were really aware of the conditions that exist it would not restrict the expenditure to such a miserly pittance as we find in these Estimates.",62
224,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"East Sydney) [11.35] I feel somewhat timid at obtruding into this debate after all the spare colonels, generals, admirals and commodores have taken part in it. The other evening, I suggested to the Government that it is useless to send delegates to the League of Nations and disarmament conferences, because wars are inevitable so long as the present economic system operates. That has been demonstrated to-night by the speeches of every honourable member who has had naval or military experience. Each bas said that we must prepare for war. If that be so, why should we continue the farce of sending delegates to disarmament conferences and the League of Nations-which , I understand, was supposed to be established to preserve the peace of the world? Australia is one of the signatories to the Kellogg Pact, under which a great many nations undertook, in no circumstances, to resort to aims for the settlement of their differences. Practical demonstration of our sincerity in sending delegates to the League of Nations and disarmament conferences, and in signing pacts which provide that the nations shall not resort to arms for the settlement of their differences, would be given by a substantial reduction of the defence vote. I agree with the honourable member for ""Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) that if we want an efficient army and navy we must give the people something to fight for, some interest in the conflict. Even military gentlemen will not contradict that assertion. If they were to go among the unemployed'returned soldiers and gest their participation in another war, what measure of success would they have? Unfortunately, many of the men who were promised much when they were asked to fight, now have nothing to defend except the dole ticket.",64
225,Mr HUTCHIN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,They would have to defend the honourable member.,65
226,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"If I depended on the honourable member for Denison I should lean on a rotten reed. If I were sure of the same protection as he had during his war service, I should be prepared to serve. Those who did the actual fighting in the last war are today in the ranks of the unemployed, existing on the dole. Honourable members say that it is unfortunate that the salaries of men in the army and the navy should have to be reduced. Who are the men who voted for that reduction under the Financial Emergency Act that was passed last year? They are the brass hats in this Parliament, the returned soldier members who, today, parade their wonderful concern for the defence services. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr E. F. Harrison) xnentioned the salaries of admirals, commodores, brigadiers and majors-general, but said not a word about the pay of the lower ratings or the privates, who do the actual fighting. I was not old enough to go to the last war, but even had I been I should not have gone. That conflict was not caused by the assassination of a member of a European Royal family, as asserted by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) to-night. We know full well that it was the result of conflict on the economic field - among the various Imperialist powers. They are not able to settle their differences by negotiation or other peaceful methods, consequently they arm for the day when inevitably, they will have to resort to war. Take the position in Australia today. Japan is represented as being one of Britain's allies. Will the Minister, then, explain why his department is erecting defences at Port Darwin? Is it because the Government is afraid of Japan or some other nation attacking this country ? Whenever a trade agreement is entered into which interferes with the markets sug- of another nation, the way is prepared for a future war. The Ottawa agreement aims a severe blow at our secondary industries, in which capital of the United States of America is invested. Is it imagined that the capitalists of that country, who have their funds invested in our secondary industries, will remain quiet and allow us to shut them out of the markets which they have prepared for themselves ? There will be a continual conflict over the Ottawa agreement, and, when it is found to be impossible to settle differences on the economic field by peaceful methods, armed conflict will result. I shall refer to discipline in the Navy, which was mentioned hy other honourable members. 1I have in mind the case of one of the lower paid ranks who was involved in an ordinary brawl which took place on the mess deck of his ship. He was thrown into the vessel's prison, dumped ashore when the mainland was reached, drummed out of the Navy, and denied the deferred pay to which he was entitled. Courts martial and inquiries held aboard warships receive no publicity, so that, the general public do^c not know whether the men concerned receive a fair deal. I see no reason why publicity should not he given to these proceedings, so that the public who subscribe funds to maintain the army and navy through the medium of taxation, may know exactly how their men are treated. Practically every honourable member who has spoken to this item went to the last war, and in consequence lays claim to some knowledge of defence matters. The inference is that those who did not go are ignorant on the subject. being so, Sir George Pearce, the present Minister for Defence, must be placed in that category. I was surprised hy the suggestion of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr. R. Green) that the way to bring about efficiency in the Navy is to provide the officers and sailors with free liquor, so that, when visiting the Pacific Islands and other ports, they may appropriately maintain the dignity of the Navy. If that indicates a knowledge of defence, I plead guilty to ignorance on the subject. I should like an explanation from the Minister regarding the £300 which, he said, is paid to Australian officers in London, and I shall he glad if he can supply the number, name, and rank held by those officers in the Australian army, and what their duties are on the other side of the world. I should also like to know what are the duties of the liaison officer who is retained in London at an enormous salary. Now that honourable members opposite have acknowledged that Australia does not believe that the peace of the world will he preserved for long, that war is inevitable, and that Australia should prepare for it, I urge that we should end the farce of sending delegates overseas to armament and League of Nations conferences. If it is"" desired to have an efficient defence force, we must first have our lines of communication secure. How can that be attained when we have an enormous army of discontented unemployed ? I say, frankly, no matter what the nation may be with which Australia comes into conflict, I shall not only not support the project, hut also advise our unemployed not to participate, as they would have nothing to gain hy doing so. Those returned soldiers who are out of work today realise the error they made when they Mr V'anl. went to the war. As one honourable member has said, when the cry went out that the Empire was in danger and their patriotism was appealed to, those men willingly rushed in, saying, "" Give us a rifle, supply us with a uniform, put us on transports going to the other side of the world, and we will protect the Empire "". But those who controlled the situation said, "" Oh, no, we do not do things like that. We shall not give you a rifle and transport you free to the other That side of the world, but will loan you those articles and advance your fares overseas. If you are fortunate enough to come back to Australia, we expect you to repay us "". It is all very well for the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr E. J. Harrison) to talk about "" our country "". He probably has some decent stake in it. What have the unemployed to protect? Give them homes, decent working conditions, and security for their wives and children, and there will be no need to appeal to their patriotism. Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel. I happen to be an Australian of the third generation, not a foreign agitator imported to this country of whom honourable members opposite express so much fear, and I play second fiddle to none insofar as being a real Australian is concerned. Probably I have a greater right to talk about ""Australia, our country,"" than many who have spoken to-night. I contend that the true Australian patriot is not the man who waves a flag, beats a drum, and urges somebody else to do the fighting when there is a war on, but he who seeks to lift the living conditions of the people of Australia to such a high standard that he can justly take pride dis- in being a citizen of this country.",65
227,Mr NAIRN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Perth) [11.48] - I moveTliat the item, ""Secretary, £2,000"", be reduced by £500. I am confident that, if it receives proper consideration, my amendment will be accepted. After the application of the provisions of the Financial Emergency Act, the Secretary's salary is £1,560. The relative position of this officer to that of the principal soldier of the land, the chief of the military staff, has already been referred to by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr MCNicoll). The chief of the military staff, a major-general, has a position classified at £1,500 a year, and after statutory deductions are made, he is actually paid £1,163. My proposal is to bring the chief of the clerical staff down to the same grade as the chief of the military staff. The history of the Secretary of the Department of Defence is not unknown. This officer was at one time private secretary to a former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes). The succeeding Prime Minister desired a new secretary, so the old secretary was appointed to the High Commissioner's office and later transferred to the Defence Department. It is an anomalous position. The honourable member for Werriwa has compared it with the positions of military aud naval officers. Several honourable members, who have spoken to me about the position of the Secretary for Defence, have contended that the salary is much too high. I now suggest to them that it is of no use to talk and take no action. This Government was returned to office to reduce expenditure. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), who is in close touch with the secretary of the department, has not seen fit to propose any reduction in his salary. If we believe that the salary is higher than the po""ition warrants, it is our duty to take the steps necessary to effect its reduction. Motion (by Mr Rosevear) negativedThat the question be now put.",66
228,Mr A GREEN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Kalgoorlie) [11.55]. - I oppose the amendment. Shepherd, the Secretary of the Defence Department, is a man of considerable experience, and I have a high opinion of his ability. His salary of £2,000 has, under the financial emergency legislation, been reduced by £450. This officer is not popular, mainly hecause he does necessary things without fear of the consequences. Because of his ability, he was selected by Mr. Fisher, when Prime Minister, as his private secretary. He was subsequently appointed to the position of Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister, but the right honourable memher for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), when Prime Minister, was anxious to place in that position his own private secretary, and in order to do so proposed to appoint Mr. Shepherd to the position of Secretary to the High Commissioner in London. Mr. Shepherd refused to go to London in that, capacity unless he received a higher salary. The Prime Minister agreed to this,, and the salary was increased to £2000; Mr Shepherd remained in London for a considerable time, and upon his return was appointed to the position of Secretary to the Department of Defence. Mr. Shepherd is a valuable officer, because he acts as a go-between between the Minister and the heads of the various arms of defence, each of whom considers his branch of supreme importance. I hope that the amendment will not be agreed to.",67
229,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Moreton-Assistant Minister for Defence) [11.58] - I ask the committee not to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn). Mr Shepherd is receiving a salary of £2,000 a year, which, is subject to a definite reduction under the financial emergency legislation. The position he occupies is an important one, and the work of Mr Shepherd has been rendered more difficult because of the reduction in the total vote for defence purposes. Prior to going to Great Britain, this officer was Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department, and, as such, received a salary of £1,200. That position is now classified at a salary of £2,000 per annum. When the position of official secretary in London became vacant in 1921, the Government of the day offered it to Mr. Mr Shepherd at a salary of £2,000 a year. He accepted and held it until 1927 when he was transferred to Australia as Secretary to the Defence Department and took the place of Mr Trumble, who is now liaison officer in London at a salary of £2,000 a year. Mr Collins is also paid £2,000 a year. Both salaries are subject to deductions under the financial emergency legislation. Honourable members, by referring to page 1081 of Hansard, of the present session, will see that a number of officers in the Public Service are receiving a salary equivalent to that of the Secretary to the Defence Department. Mr Shepherd, who has had 42 years' service, is the oldest permanent head in the Service, and it is only just that after such faithful service he should receive a salary at least equal to that enjoyed by niariy other officers who are his juniors in the Service. The honourable member for Perth does not allege that Mr Shepherd is not an efficient officer, nor has he given any reason in support of the amendment which he has moved. As a matter of fact he is an officer of conspicuous ability, and is carrying out his work extraordinarily well in view of the difficulties with which he is confronted. His work is doubly trying because of the difficulties of administration brought about by the reduced sums made available for defence. I hope that, in view of the facts presented to the committee, the honourable member for Perth will not press his amendment.",67
230,Mr NAIRN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,I do press it.,68
231,Mr ERANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Then I urge the committee to reject it. Thursday, 27 October, 1932.",68
232,Mr JENNINGS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"South Sydney) [12.1 a.m.] - I am given to understand that when increased rates of pay in the navy were granted seven or eight years ago, the claims of petty officers in the Permanent Forces were overlooked, but that when the last two redactions of public servants generally were made they were called upon to participate in them. If that is a fact, I suggest to the Government that the position of these men should now be reconsidered.",68
233,Mr HUTCHIN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Denison) [12.2 a.m.]. - - I feel disposed to support the amendment. As the honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn) has said, we should be prepared to take action to overcome the financial difficulties of the country. Possibly the Secretary for Defence has sound claims to the salary which he is now receiving; but it is, to say the least of it, anomalous to grade a non-professional officer in the department much above the responsible heads of the various arms of the Defence Force. When the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) requires information about the navy, he does not go to a sailor, nor does he consult a soldier about the army, and, presumably, when he wishes to know the state of his bodily health he asks a Inwyer to examine him. I was not at all '-ouvinced by the honourable member's remarks. No doubt when he was the ministerial head of the department, he was closely associated with the present Secretary for Defence, and was probably impressed by that officer's worth. I have no desire to disparage the value of his services; hut it is inconsistent to grade that officer so far above the chief of the general staff and the chief officer in the air force as to cause comment in this chamber. I have heard that Mr. Shepherd's salary is protected under a certain agreement made at the time of his London appointment. If his salary is protected, I presume that that agreement stands.",68
234,Mr RILEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,Does it hind this Parliament ?,68
235,Mr HUTCHIN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,I am merely asking for information.,68
236,Mr ABOIIDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIA TRADE,It does not.,68
237,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Moreton-Assistant Minister) [12.4 a.m.] - The honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) referred to the development of civil aviation, and particularly to certain air routes in the Richmond electorate. The future policy to he pursued in regard to civil aviation was recently the subject of an examination by a departmental committee. That committee has furnished its report, and the Minister is now considering its recommendations. I shall see that the remarks of the honourable member for Richmond are brought under the Minister's notice. The suggestion that naval cadets who fail to pass the final examination for admission to the navy should he absorbed in other branches of the Public Service will also he taken into consideration. The honourable member will be glad to know that provision has been made for the continuation of the hydrographic survey of the Great Barrier Reef. Owing to the limited financial resources of the country, it is not possible to commission the survey vessel Moresby for that work, but as the vessels trading on that part of the Australian coast are using, mainly, charts which were prepared by Matthew Flinders, the Government is anxious that this work should not cease. Personally, I have for years stressed the importance of this survey, and - many other Queenslanders have supported my representations. I am pleased to he able to state that the work has not been discontinued. Until the finances will permit of the survey ship Moresby being recommissioned, arrangements have been made for the work to be carried on by a naval survey party operating in motor boats. When the financial position improves there will be no delay in bringing the naval stores up to date. I have no desire to follow the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) in his attempt to justify the defence policy pursued by the Scullin Government, of which he was a memher. I do not think that the honourable member himself, nor anybody else, is satisfied with the present condition of the Defence Forces as the result of that policy. I certainly am not. I ought not to resume my making passing reference to the remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr E. J. Harrison),' particularly those concerning my colleague Senator Sir George Pearce. Owing to his many years' experience in administering the Defence Department, no other man in Australia is better fitted for that than Senator Sir George Pearce. He was first appointed Minister for Defence in November, 1908, and, except for two short periods, continued in that position* until December, 1921. During the earlier years of his administration he was largely responsible for the introduction and development of our defence forces under the universal training scheme force was provided the. foundation of our magnificent Australian Imperial Forceis Sir George was in charge of the destiny of the Defence Department during practhere; tically the whole of the strenuous war years. Under his direction and adminisreferences tration some 417,000 men were recruited, equipped, and trained, and approxiable member for Denison. mately 330,000 were transported overseas. After the termination of the arrangements for the return and dethe Government afraid? mobilization of this huge force also came directly under the administration of the right honourable gentleman. The record of our gallant Australian Imperial burned Force overseas'provides a lasting monukept ment to his capacity and initiative as administrator. I think that Australia is indeed fortunate in having had such an able and distinguished man as its Minister for Defence during these difficult times. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) has referred to the defence liaison officer in London. Mr Trumble was appointed by the Scullin Government to discharge temporarily duties that previously were carried out by senior officers of the army, navy, and air services. His responsibility is to keep the defence authorities in Australia posted regarding the latest developments in Great Britain in armaments, munitions, methods of training, &c, affecting the various arms of our Defence Force. The honourable member for East Sydney referred, also, to the honourable member for Denison (Mr Hutchin) as one who had participated in the war from a safe position. That, was an unwarranted reflection upon seat without a gallant officer.",68
238,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,I did not see him over,69
239,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"That is all the more reason why the honourable member should be careful in his references to an officer who served his country faithfully and well - The honourable member for Denison work commanded a company of the 21st Battalion, and for his distinguished service and gallantry was promoted in the field and awarded the Distinguished Service Order. He completed a fine war record as brigade major of the 3rd Brigade.",69
240,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,Why was he not taken into the Cabinet? What about preference from which to returned soldiers?,69
241,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Unfortunately , there not room in the Cabinet for every honourable member who is qualified to be but it ill becomes men who have no record as soldiers to make slighting to a man with such an honourable military record as that of the honor",69
242,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"What is the reason for the war, garrison at Port Darwin? Of whom is",69
243,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"A nucleus force has been established at Port Darwin to protect the oil supplies there. When our fleet coal, large stocks of that fuel were at Thursday Island, and a small an garrison was maintained there to defend those stores. Our ships are now converted to oil fuel, of which quantities are stored in tanks at Darwin, whither the military organization formerly stationed at Thursday Island has beeu transferred.",69
244,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Why is the oil stored at Darwin, instead of Sydney?",70
245,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Supplie s are stored at Sydney and elsewhere. Our trade routes must be protected against menace from any quarter, and, therefore, it is necessary to have supplies of fuel .in the north, so that when ships of the Seet are operating there they may .replenish their stores, speedily and conveniently.",70
246,Mr WARD,AUSTRALIA TRADE,Will the Minister explain the item of £300 for allowances to departmental representatives abroad?,70
247,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Officer s sent to the United Kingdom on duty receive an allowance to meet the additional expenses to which they are subjected. Similarly, an officer in Australia who. is required to Undertake duties which involve his absence from home, receives a special allowance for travelling, &c. The amount of £300 is to provide for the expenses of representatives of the Defence Forces sent abroad on special duty. A similar amount was voted last year. I again appeal to the committee not to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Nairn). The Public Service is classified by a board.",70
248,Mr CAMERON,AUSTRALIA TRADE,Has this particular office been classified by the Public Service Board ?,70
249,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"The classification of heads of departments is the prerogative of the Government. I understand that special circumstances and conditions surrounded the appointment of the Secretary of the Defence Department. He is, however, the senior departmental head and has rendered faithful service in every position he has occupied.",70
250,Mr GANDER,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"So have the -4,000 men who are to he sacked from the New South Wales railways.",70
251,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIA TRADE,They have my sympathy. But I hope that this committee will not apply that example to a faithful officer who has qualified by long and able service for the remuneration he now receives - I support the amendment. Motion (by Mr Rosevear) negativedTliat the question be now put.,70
252,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,Capricornia) [12.18 a.m.] - I oppose the amendment.,70
253,Mr NAIRN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Member s of the Opposition always battle for the "" tall poppies.""",70
254,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"That is untrue, but we are opposed to further cuts. There might be some justification for reviewing the salaries of all departmental heads, simultaneously, but the singling out of one officer for a cut of £500 a year, suggests limelighting on the part of some honourable members who would have the public believe that they stand for economy and that other members who oppose this drastic and unfair proposal do not. The Secretary of the Defence Department has already suffered a reduction of £450 a year under the Financial Emergency Act. At least four other departmental heads receive £2,000 a year, whilst the Director-General of Postal Sendees receives an annual salary of £3,000.",70
255,Mr HUTCHIN,AUSTRALIA TRADE,That is different.,70
256,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"That is a matter of opinion. We should act fairly if any action is taken at all, and Cabinet should reconsider the salaries of all permanent heads of departments. Any cut made in the salary of the head of the Defence Department should apply also to the heads of other Commonwealth depart""ments. If that is done, the Opposition is prepared to consider favourably proposals for economizing along those lines. As a general principle, however, we are opposed to any further cuts in salaries. We believe that the Commonwealth Public Service has already suffered sufficient reductions under the Financial Emergency Act. A few days ago this Parliament in its wisdom refused to agree to a proposal to reduce the salary of the Clerk of the Senate. Although I admit that the Clerk of the Senate is an estimable officer, and gives good service, no one will contend that he is overworked, and if Parliament did not think it proper to reduce his salary, there can be no justification for further reducing the salary of the Secretary to the Defence Department. It is not equitable to single out one man for such treatment.",70
257,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIA TRADE,"Swan) [12.22 a.m.]. I have nothing against the officer personally, but if we compare his salary with that of other permanent heads of departments, it is evident that he is receiving more than he is entitled to.

I have come into contact with him when placing before him the cases of the lower paid men in the Service, particularly those employed at Garden Island. ""Whenever he had an opportunity to deal a blow at the conditions of the lower paid artisans, he did not hesitate to do so. At no stage in my negotiations did I ever detect in him the slightest sympathy with those on whose behalf I £1,153. had interested myself.

It would be entirely unreasonable for honourable members to accept this amendment, in view of the fact that nothing has been said against the efficiency of the officer concerned.

As this department is not now one-fiftieth of its normal strength, it seems to me that there is no justification for continuing to pay the present salary to the secretary. Although an honourable member owes a certain loyalty to his party, he must make up his own mind on a subject of this kind, and act in what he believes to be in the best interests of the country.

If so, will the Minister inform the House whether the Tariff Board reported on the facts to him? 3. If a report were furnished, did the board suggest that the import duty of Gd. and 7d. per lb. on butter should be reduced if the manufacturers and distributors of that commodity did not reduce their prices and make the price uniform in all cities of the Commonwealth? 4.
