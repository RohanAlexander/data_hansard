3,Mr MENZIES,HONORABLE JAMES HENRY," As honourable members know, the Right Honourable James Henry Scullin died on the 29th January, at the age of 76 years. The late Mr Scullin first entered this House in 1910 as member for the Victorian division of Corangamite. He was defeated in 1913, but in 1922 he was again elected, on that occasion as member for Yarra, and he continued to represent that electorate until his retirement from politics in 1949. During Mr. Scullin's long parliamentary career he occupied a number of important posts. In 1927 he became deputy leader of the Australian Labour party and of the Opposition in this House. From 1928 to 1935 he was leader of the Australian Labour party and during a part of that period, Prime Minister of Australia. He became Prime Minister at the end of 1929. He was, it is very interesting to record, Australia's first native-born Labour Prime Minister. He remained Prime Minister until 1932. I have only to mention those dates for honourable members to recall that during those years immense difficulties, associated with the great economio depression, assailed this country; and Scullin found himself Prime Minister at that time. In 1930 he was made a Privy Councillor. He represented Australia the Imperial Conference of 1930 and the Eleventh Assembly of the League Nations at Geneva. He was Leader of health the Opposition from 1932 to 1935 and subsequently as honourable members know, of course, he served on important mittees which dealt with problems of taxation. That is a very curt account of our late friend's parliamentary care.er, but the mere dates and the mere facts would not do justice to the work that he did in this country. Long before he entered the Parlistened liament he was a stout-hearted fighter for the things that he believed in. I can remember, when I was a schoolboy at Ballarat, having the opportunity of ing our late friend speaking in Ballarat. He began his notable activities in that city and he was .closely assowere ciated with a great deal of its work. He was the editor of an evening newsthe paper in Ballarat. He then entered the national field of politics and, as I have already reminded the House, he became Prime Minister at an intensely difficult country. time. I Want to say quite frankly that, despite political differences, I always the warmest personal affection and probelieve, found respect for him as a man of great character and of genuine religious views might have been, or are. faith, which sustained him under great difficulties. I remember that long after he had been Prime Minister, and long after he had gone through miseries, as they Were, indeed, to him, that were associated with his Prime Ministhe tership, I said to him one day here, "" have you given up being Leader of the Opposition ?"" In his reply, he said assure something to ine which illustrated his warm humanity to perfection. He said, "" Well, you know haVe been Prime Minister in difficult times and it is not easy when you have been Prime Minister in difficult times the arid know all sorts of things that happen to be a really effective and, if necessary, ruthless Leader of the Opporecord sition. You know too much of what goes on behind the scenes. You know all too frequently that some cable has been received and the government of the day Mr Menzies. Mr has been asked to do nothing, or say nothing, about the matter for a few weeks while other arrangements are made. Conat sequently, I have not been content at as the Leader of the Opposition, and of now that I have been .told that my really requires that I go out of the active field, I go out with a good grace "". And, indeed, everybody knows that he comdid. Then^ having gone out of active political leadership, with all the controversy that necessarily associates itself with political leadership, he sat in this House as a highly respected elder statesman. Every one of us in this place, whatever his political views might have been, sat up and to the words of Jim Scullin. He always selected a subject that was not a matter of real controversy, but a matter on which, in his view, the standard of hearjudgment ought to be raised, and I am bound to say that he never failed to raise it. All those honourable members who his contemporaries will recall, as I do, with great pleasure and warm regard, contribution to public life, to the standards of public debate, and to the honesty of public administration made by this late former Prime Minister of this I attended his funeral in Melbourne had on behalf of the Government and, I in a sense, on behalf of the people of Australia, whatever their political I very could not help feeling that Australia is a fine country .to live in, when a man may proceed from obscurity and, by the the strength of his own mind and character, achieve the highest position in gift of the people. On behalf of the Why Government, and, indeed, of all of us, I express our sympathy to his widow, and her that, as long as we who sat here with her late husband are here ourselves, we shall remember him with pride and I affection. I move That this House expresses its deep regret at death of the Right Honourable James Henry Scullin, a former member of this House for the Division' of Yarra and a former Frime Minister and Minister of the Grown, places on its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow in 'her bereavement.",12
4,Dr EVATT,HONORABLE JAMES HENRY," On behalf of the Opposition, I second the motion. I am sure that I am speaking for the whole House when I say that we greatly appreciate the spirit in which the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) has summed up some of the salient features of the public career of that great Australian, Jim Scullin. As the Prime Minister has correctly pointed out, the late Mr Scullin came to high office at perhaps the most critical period economically of our history, and undoubtedly, the anxieties which beset him during that period left their mark on him physically. He appeared to be. a man of frail physique, and certainly the anxieties of the depression period weighed very heavily upon him. The Prime Minister also mentioned that the late Mr Scullin was a great public speaker. I regarded him as an orator when he addressed great meetings, but perhaps he was at his best as a parliamentarian in this House. Among the great debaters whom it has been my privilege to hear, I have not heard a greater debater than Mr Scullin on his subject. He did not often intervene in a debate, but, on his subject, he debated superbly. He did not underestimate the argument against him, and tried to grapple with it. He was always listened to with rapt attention ih this House. Mr Scullin, in his political life, showed great chivalry. He looked beyond the immediate conflict of politics towards greater objectives. The Prime Minister put his finger on another important point vital to an understanding of the character of Mr Scullin when he referred to the humility of the late right honourable gentleman. This spirit of humility sprang from the fact that he was a man of the deepest religious convictions. . I hope that the tributes paid the memory, of Mr Scullin will be some additional comfort to his widow and family, and his friends, because no one stood higher in the opinion of the Parliament than he did. I refer particularly to the years of World War II . It will be left to historians to describe what he contributed to Australia's security. They will tell what he did for Australia's great secondary industries as the Prime Minister of this country during the early 1930's. Only when World War II . came was his work in that field fully appreciated. Mr. Scullin took part in a very important imperial conference at which the principles of ,dominion self-government were defined and extended. One result of that was the appointment, on his recommendation, of Sir Isaac Isaacs, the first Australian to be Governor General of the Commonwealth. That was an important development. On matters of finance, Mr Scullin was a recognized authority in this House. During World War II , by which time he had ceased to be an official of the Labour party, he was a valued adviser of two Labour Prime Ministers, Mr Curtin and Mr Chifley. Indeed, as the present Prime Minister will recall, Mr Scullin was, on certain occasions, the adviser of the war-time Menzies Administration. He was always available in the service of the Parliament and of the nation. He was an elder statesman of great wisdom and experience, ancl he was able to lighten considerably the great burdens that fell upon the war-time Prime Ministers of this country. We shall remember him as we should remember him, with pride and affection, as a great Australian who contributed much to the life of this countiy, and showed to people in all parts of the world how well democracy could work.",13
5,Sir EARLE PAGE,HONORABLE JAMES HENRY," In view of my long, happy, personal, political and professional association with Jim Scullin I am very grateful to my leader, the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) for permitting me to voice the Australian Country party's tribute to our deceased friend today. Time passes so rapidly in the turmoil of political life, with one event succeeding another ceaselessly, that it is hard to to believe 31 years have passed since Jim Scullin entered the Parliament in 1922. He was elected by the constituency formerly held by the Lahour leader, Mr. Tudor, who had. died suddenly. Almost from the first day, Mr Scullin established himself as a force in this House. He was one of the best debaters ever to enter the Commonwealth Parliament. Within a very short time, he was first, deputy leader, then leader of the Labour party, and finally Prime Minister. He became Prime Minister in 1929 in the midst of the great world depression which brought tragedy to all countries, and placed Australia in a desperate position. As head of this nation, he seemed to take not only our own troubles but also those of the whole world, to heart. ""Within a few weeks we saw his physical characteristics change completely. From an auburnhaired man, he became absolutely white in two or three weeks, and although his spirit remained undimmed to the end of his political career, there can be no doubt that the personal torture that he suffered in the depression days shortened his life considerably. He snowed great courage in all that he did. He was always ready to fight for his ideals and for what he regarded to be right, and, because he was a born debater, he was able to fight with probably the most admirably chosen words and logic that we have ever heard in this Parliament. I agree with the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) that he was essentially a great orator, who served up not only the words, but also the actual substance of any matter that he debated. He continued to the end to fight for his ideals, and he proved himeslf, even though he was out of office, to be a wise counsellor to his party. I do not think that he had one enemy in this - Parliament throughout the period during which he was a member of it. Though he wielded a whirlwind rapier in debate, he was gentle and friendly in his demeanour and in all his personal relations. Therefore he was the friend of every one. He gave very great service indeed to this Parliament and to the people of Australia, and I offer our sympathy to his devoted widow and to his relatives. I know, as do all other honourable members who knew him during the many years in which he was a member of this Parliament, that, although he suffered from physical disabilities which would have prevented an ordinary man from working, his high sense of public service drove him to continue to work for the good of this Commonwealth. He was able to continue in this work only because, of the devoted attention of his wife. I am sure that all of us wish to express to her our deepest sympathy in her loss.",14
6,Mr KEON,HONORABLE JAMES HENRY," As the man who was privileged to succeed James Scullin as the representative of the electorate of Yarra in this House, I wish to add a few words to the tribute that we pay today to a great gentleman and a great Australian. Indeed, our words are no.t needed to emphasize the high regard and the admiration that the people of Australia bore towards him. Those who saw the thousands of humble people who attended in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne, at his funeral service and who lined the route to the cemetery, whose sorrow was so obvious, could not have any doubt about the genuineness of the tribute to his memory which that demonstration represented. It was fitting that this should be so, because it was to the service of these, the humble people, that Mr Scullin had devoted his life. He was one of those who hunger and thirst after justice, and I think it would be, true to say that that hunger and thirst were the inspiration of the whole of his life and the whole of his political career. But such is the irony of life that, although none of our Prime Ministers, I suppose, has deserved better of the political fates, none faced crueller circumstances. I.think it is true to say also that only a Jim Scullin could have led this nation through the cruel days of the depression and still have retained not only the respect, but also the warm admiration and love of the people upon whom the heaviest blows of the depression fell. With unerring instinct, the people, irrespective of their political views, knew that, in the cruel circumstances in which he found himself, Jim Scullin chose the harder path. While there was a chance of lightening the blows that the political and economic circumstances of those days rained upon his people, James Scullin refused to desert his post. Not for him, despite the superb oratory that has been mentioned by other speakers, the easy road of the demagogue! He sacrificed his health and risked that which was dearer to him than all else-the love and affection of his people for him. He did so in the hope of saving the humble people, who looked upon him as a champion, frOm the worse blows of the crisis. None knew better than did James Scullin the sacrifices and the risks involved in the course that he pursued. The ease of the other path, and the difficulties of the path which he chose in order to try to save the people from the severest scourgmgs of the economic crisis, are, think, obvious to all. His political reward was heartbreak and shattered health, but a reward that he treasured above all others was the warm, love and affection of the people of Australia, and Australian-born particularly of the humble people of electorate that he represented - In hearts and minds is the greatest monucarried ment to him, and that is the monument that Mr Scullin himself would have preferred above all others. Some have the high intelligence to see where the path of duty lies. It is only the James Scullins, however, who have the high character to follow that path and fearlessly and sacrificially to the end.",15
7,Mr CREMEAN,HONORABLE JAMES HENRY," I join with honourable members who have already spoken on this. occasion in paying a tribute of respect and affection to memory of a great Australian, James made Henry Scullin. To that glittering spective of his political life and the gifts that stamped him as an unusual and unique Australian in the forums of the places. people I add my tribute and the tribute of the electors of the portion of the original division of Yarra whom I now re present. Truly, he was a great man. All the political honours that we might heap upon the head of the departed former right honourable member for Yarra are as nothing when compared with the respect, affection, love and esteem in which he was held by the common of man. Transcending even their affecat tion and the political advantages the position that he held, were the sonal merits of the man himself. I was fortunate enough to be associated with him during almost the whole of the time that he represented the division of Yarra. He never lost sight of the eternal verities of life, and he distinguished himself by sturdy Christianity and a knowledge the requirements of the ordinary man. He applied that knowledge to his public life as well as to his private life. public life was but a mirror of his private life. The respect, esteem and affection in which he was held were marked by tributes that were paid at his obsequies on last Saturday week. Mr Scullin's activity did not diminish throughout his political life, although it was circummembers scribed to a degree by his poor health. I However, he surmounted the obstacles and difficulties of a condition of almost invalidity in order to serve the country that he loved. As the Prime. Minister has said, James Henry Scullin was the first Labour Prime Minister. the He never forgot that fact during his their Prime Ministership, and, indeed, he it right through the course of his political representation. Ho loved this country, and this country loved him. Reference has been made to his widow, Mrs Scullin, who patiently nursed him through his many illnesses. She was his constant guide, philosopher, and friend, to her from this Parliament today go the respect, sympathy and affection of all members who knew of her association with her esteemed and celebrated husband. I conclude my contribution to the the far superior remarks that have been with the prayer that the soul of this pergreat Australian may rest in peace. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their NA HARTLEY CHAMBERLAIN .",16
8,Mr MENZIES,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN," This Parliament has been all too frequently wounded by the death of some member of this House or of the ""Senate. As honourable members know Senator John Hartley Chamberlain, one of the senators Tasmania, died on the 16th January, the age of 66 years. Senator Chamberof lain came to Australia from England. perHe became a farmer in Tasmania. He was a member of the House of Assembly in Tasmania for seventeen years. He was a member of the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia only during the last two years. Therefore, perhaps he was not a so well known here as he was in Tasmania, of but I will say that he was well enougn known here to enjoy the warm regard of honourable members on both sides of the His Parliament. He was a fine, warm, human character. I think his strongest politcal opponents will retain a pleasant and the warm feeling a.bout him as a man. He was very deeply regarded by honourable senators on both sides of the Senate, and he was very deeply regarded also by those of the House of Representatives who had the pleasure of knowing him. One has only to go to Tasmania to discover that in that State, particularly in the north-western corner, his name was a household word. It is a fine thing that Parliament should be able to attract the services of such men-honest , upright men, whose motives are beyond question and who set out for a long period of their lives to make a self-sacrificing contribution to public affairs. In that sense, I join with honourable members in mourning the death of Senator Chamberlain. I should like to send to his widow and his family-becaus e he left a son and two daughters- a message of sympathy and of appreciation from the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. I should recall that the late Senator ' Chamberlain served in Prance with the Australian Imperial Eorce in World War I . , and was wounded in action. He was a very well-known figure in the affairs of the returned servicemen's league in Tasmania. I think he was a member of the executive of that body in Tasmania for something of the order of twenty years. Here we have, in war and in peace, fine honourable service to the people of Australia. I am sure that the motion that I am about to propose will have the concurrence of all honourable members. I move That this House expresses its deep the death of Senator John Hartley Chamberlain, a. member of the Senate of the Commonwealth Parliament, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.",16
9,Dr EVATT,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN," On behalf of the Opposition, I second the motion. The Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) has referred to the meritorious services of the late Senator Chamberlain, not only during the long years of peace, when he was a member of the House of Assembly of Tasmania and of the Senate, but also in World War I . The right honourable gentleman has said correctly that no one in this Parliament could have won in so short a time a higher regard than did Senator Chamberlain. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has told me of the influence that the late senator brought to bear upon the deliberations of that chamber. He was a man of courage, always courteous and always strong in putting his views before the Senate. His death will be mourned sincerely by all members of the Senate and of this House. I hope that this motion will be accepted as an expression of comfort by his widow and his family.",17
10,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN," I desire to associate the party that. I have the honour to lead, and also myself with the sentiments that have been so aptly expressed by the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt). Senator Chamberlain only entered this Parliament as a senator after the last general election. We did not have the opportunity to know him as well as his record merited, but we did have the opportunity, even in the short time available to us, to assess his outstanding and sterling character. I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in conveying my heartfelt sympathy to those who have been left to mourn the loss of such a worthy man who had performed such service in war and peace for Australia. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. ADJOURNMENT.",17

22,Mr MENZIES,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. A travelling allowance of £5 5s. a day or part thereof is payahle to Ministers when absent primarily on official business from the place where the Minister's home is situated, but excluding whole days spent in Canberra. 2. See 1. 3. When the Government first took office, the travelling allowance payable to Ministers was 52s. Od. a day payable on an hourly basis. This rate was varied to the rate specified in 1 during 1951 and the present rate was supported by the Nicholas Committee. 4. There is no specific provision tax law which exempts a travelling allowance, but expenditure incurred would be deductible from the allowance. 5. The Commissioner of Taxation has authority to require a taxpayer to submit whatever evidence he considers necessary to support the particulars included in the taxpayer's return, but whatever evidence he does require is a matter entirely between the Commissioner and the taxpayer and I am certain it would be regarded by the Commissioner as secret. (i and 7. All other salaries and allowances payable to Ministers in respect of their duties as members of Parliament and Ministers of State are clearly set out in the Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952 and the Ministers of State Act 1952, both of which were passed without dissent by this House earlier in the current year. 8.

24,Mr MENZDBS,DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1 to 8. The honourable member will recall that inquiries about visits overseas by Ministers have been made on several occasions in the past. The question was last raised by the lionorable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) on the Sth June, 1952. Since a reply was given to that ' question, the Minister for External Affairs (Mr Casey), the Minister for Immigration (Mr Holt ) , the Postmaster General (Mr Anthony) and the Minister for the Navy (Mr MCMahon) hare been abroad, while I recently attended the Economic Conference in London accompanied by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr MCEwen) and the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner). It is the policy pf this Government, as it was the policy of the previous Labour Government, that Ministers should keep abreast of international ideas and developments that concern the departments they administer. Unless they do this they cannot serve the people as they should. The pursuit of this policy had occasioned visits overseas by various Ministers and senior departmental omcers who are their advisers, but, as the honourable member well knows, there is nothing new in this. Indeed ministerial responsibilities cannot be carried out (without a considerable measure of direct negotiation with other governments. I do not propose, unless otherwise directed by this House, to make available the detailed information requested by the honourable member.
