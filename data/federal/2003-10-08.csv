Sydney's second airport. In an article in the Director, Stephen Byron, put in a bid for second airport controversy. Mr Byron's argument from regional centres to go somewhere else to take over as a regional hub because it has as a regional hub and then to see it develop into increased numbers of international flights. He within three years and Singapore within further into the future. Mr Byron's argument is Sydney's second airport site by the Labor Party a condition of sale, the dynamics of the airport Canberra's favour over the long term. I support Bankstown Airport at one end of the Fowler I have a special interest in aviation safety. densely populated areas of the electorate that I the busiest in Australia, you will appreciate that But my main concern in this debate is the efairports and what those sales mean for aviation the busiest airport in Australia. While it be noted that Bankstown Airport is completely as the 1940s, Bankstown was rejected as a site of the site. Since then, urban developWhilst some of that development has been induselectorate lie less than one kilometre from the aircraft, the frequency of those flights is a industrial and residential areas. Bankstown operations, and in terms of noise problems arisoperations are among the most intrusive. at Bankstown, however, is that whilst the Minisrejects the idea of regional services operating a large number of movements into Bankstown centres in New South Wales. My concern is that be just as intrusive as scheduled regional serwhich is under the flight path and less than a runway at Bankstown. Another kilometre west the business centre of Cabramatta. I know that NA because my electorate office is under the flight charter aircraft that are operating out of Bankstown mention this because at the present time Fairfield ning in areas close to railway In Fairfield the council is looking at developments looking at 14 storeys. Both town centres and storeys in the next few years. So in the case of high-density residential developments directly port. With the airport in private hands, we can airport operator and councils to minimise the not aware of flight paths being considered in they certainly should be. This leaves us all planned in a way that suits urban development. I can remember driving past Bankstown Airport when there was very little development in the potential problems caused by further development would have happened if governments had given aviation and development needs. So today we greater access by larger and noisier aircraft ment of high-density, tall residential We need to carefully plan any developments sites and we need to make the hard decisions density developments, aircraft operations around tial development and the development of new residential growth. If we do not take the hard these same problems over the next decades. When Bankstown was first developed and was miles from the nearest urban development. caught up with Bankstown. The cries of ‘we need to ask if we can continue to allow airports The same can be said of Hoxton Park-although, environment surrounding Hoxton Park, the sale dium term is accepted by most people. It was program Hoxton Park was presented as a sparsely 60 years ago during the Second World War aircraft operating from Bankstown-and even small farms-but for the past decade or more urban residential development.

I am assessing the suitability of developments, but asking why Sydney's aviation needs have not been in the 1950s, when I was a very wee lass, areas around the flight paths. Faced with the at Bankstown, I can only wonder what greater attention to planning for Sydney's are left with a situation where the demands for at Bankstown will come up against the developbuildings in areas of high demand. at airports which can sterilise development about the future of airport operations near highthe clock at airports surrounded by residenfacilities planned to be out of the way of future decisions now, we will continue to be faced with during its heyday in the Second World War it. But Sydney's urban sprawl has long since were here first' may seem understandable, but we to sterilise large areas of scarce urban land. in recognition of the change to the urban proposal considers that its closure in the meof some concern to me that in a recent Stateline settled area.

In fact, the route of the ment impact statement for the orbital noted ture Road overbridge would need to be made to ton Park. So here we have an airport surrounded by commercial or industrial development which portunity in the area.

I do not think this As I have said, Hoxton Park is surrounded by while continuing operations of even light aircraft ment on such a sensitive site. That leads me to ask the question: just Park go? Clearly no-one in this government is posed Badgerys Creek airport envisaged the interference in flight paths. As far as Labor is definitely off the agenda. But Labor is in the the type of planning that this government should on notice concerning airports in Sydney's south traffic would simply be shuffled to Bankstown, ment keeps ducking the question: if Hoxton Park tions of Bankstown, just where will the overflow question. At least Labor is prepared to come clean ahead with Badgerys Creek, Labor will be proposing will not face up to the need to make a decision. and urban development encroaches on every existing airport planning into the too-hard basket. The decisions off. They are all looking for an alternative the 1940s. It was Labor that took the original types use Hoxton Park and, when performing is limited to light aircraft, its impact on the more than 100 hectares of land.

I was moved to speak on the bill by the Western Sydney: the honourable member for and the honourable member for Greenway. I just record. Badgerys Creek has been raised as an 20 August 2003 by Mr Hockey, the Minister cabinet minister. I thought he made a very significant like to quote his words. He said: The second point in relation to Sydney airport port in Sydney. Existing government policy is Creek, with a review in 2005. That is the policy that commitment that we have made, and that is our existing in the Sydney basin at Badgerys Creek, with a review we have had since the 1996 election, and it is entirely of 80 movements per hour at Sydney airport ... He goes on to talk about Sydney airport. This cabinet minister, a senior minister in the breathed airport issues because he is also clearly, that the government is committed Creek. I would be misinforming the House if I turn the Labor Party policy in favour of building have made many contributions in this place and to his eternal credit, the Leader of the Opposition, Workers Club and said: ‘Badgerys Creek as built under Labor.'

That is the policy. It is a commitment to a second airport of the need for it in 2005. That is the policy that consistent with the fact that we legislated the cap is a highly significant contribution by an acting Howard government and someone who has lived and the member for North Sydney. He is saying, quite to building Sydney's second airport at Badgerys did not say it has been a long struggle to overSydney's second airport at Badgerys Creek.
