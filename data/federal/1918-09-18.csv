2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. W. Elliot vention, Johnson),-""Wit h deep regret I inform inauguration honourable-members that during the recent adjournment I received from His. ExcelPrime lency the' Governor of [Sierra Leone a the cablegram which, when , decoded, read as and; follows: - SPEAKER, Melbourne. Regret to inform you that Lord Forrest nt sea 2nd September,' and waa buried"" with military honours here on 3rd September I have further to state that, on being informed of the death of Lord Forrest, I at once despatched to Lady Porrest, on behalf of honourable members and myself, a cablegram expressing our sincere condolencewith her in the loss which she had sustained.",20
3,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3^2] - Since last we met, as you have announced, Mr. Speaker, death has taken from us one of our most distinguished and beloved members, Lord Porrest, the late representative of the Swan division of Western Australia. Before we had recovered from theshock of this intelligence, a cablegram gave us the sad and unexpected news' of the death in London of the Right HonorableSir George Reid, at one-time Prime M in ister of the Commonwealth, and our first High Commissioner in Great Britain. There is something peculiarly tragic in the coincidence that these two eminent,, and I think I may say unique, personalities, who for a generation were political foes but personal friends, and figured so* .conspicuously in the consummation and development of our Federal Union, should pass out into the Great Beyond almost simultaneously! The Government proposes to ask the House to mark the national sorrow in an appropriate manner by adjourning as a token of respect to the memory of these departed statesmen. As the first step, for the regretful, but unanimous, concurrence, of honourable members, I wish to submit the following; motion:That this House places on record its profound regret at the loss the Commonwealth' has sustained in the death of the late member for the Division of Swan, the Right .Honourable Lord Forrest, P.C, G.C.M.G., LL . D . , F:G.S.. F.L.S., whose great publicservioes as .Premier of the State of - Western Australia from its constitution as a self-governing colony,, as a member of the Federal Conas a member of this House since theof Federation, as a Minister of State for the Commonwealth, and as Acting: Minister,' are sincerely appreciated by people of Australin.. This House tenders its deepest sympathy to the sorrowing widow relatives of a' distinguished explorer audi statesman whose devotion to - duty was combined Sierra. Leone, with a kindliness and courtesy which endeared . 13th September, 1918. . him to all with whom he was associated. died I think I may say on behalf of every member of the Housethat the benediction. - of a grateful people falls upon the memory of our dead friend at the close of his long and illustrious career. I propose to briefly mention some of the landmarks, of his remarkable life. John Porrest, at the. age of twenty-rtwo years, was placed in charge of an important expedition sent to search for the remains, of the explorer Leichardt. For this, and subsequent explorations in the .then unknown interior of this country, he was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society, and ranks today, it can be said without rhetoric or exaggeration, with those great Australian explorers, Stuart, Grey, Eyre, and Sturt. Later, his survey opened the wilderness of Western Aushonours tralia to civilization, and subsequently became Commissioner of Crown Lands which and Surveyor-General of the colony} as then was, with seats in the Executive Legislative Councils, positions which he held from the year 1883 to the year 1890. When the Colony of Western Australia was granted responsible government, John Forrest was appointed its first mier, and proved in the higher walks of life-if we may call them higher-wha had been indicated in the earlier stages his career, that he was a stout-hearted optimist. He saw the almost uninhabited territory of the west grow into a great State, and he had unbounded faith in future of that Territory. The Adminhaps istration that he inaugurated and"" conbody, ducted was marked throughout by courage and capacity. He was the author most of the important early legislation the Western Australian Parliament, «luding its land laws. Amongst almost «ountless achievements, he was responto sible for the great gold-fields water scheme, and for the Fremantle Harbor - works. For ten years continuously he Premier of the Colony, and only relinHe quished that office in 1901 to join the"" first in private life. Federal Administration. In the meancourageous time, he had, as most honourable members know, played a veiy conspicuous part into quotethe moulding and framing of the Federal Constitution. At various times, after entering this House, he held the portfolios of Postmaster-General, Minister for Defence, Minister for Home Affairs, and Treathe surer, being Treasurer of the Commonhim, wealth on four occasions. He officiated as Acting Prime Minister. lived to see-and this, perhaps, was most pleasing feature of his later lifethe realization of his great continental dream, the construction and operation of the trans-Australian railway. By and large, his record of service is, I think, paralleled in the history of this Dominion, or of any other British Dominion, and rotable in that, during thirty-five years public life, he enjoyed Ministerial office and respect for nearly twenty-seven years. That fact speaks volumes for the public other approbation and favour which he won, the highest testimony of success to which work a public man can aspire. Of course, came to the deceased gentleman: he honours from the learned societies to the highest of our race have aspired, it and honours from His Majesty the King, and the most recent-hi s elevation to the peerage-bein g in recognition of long and distinguished services to the Empire. We who knew him say that there was no man Sir in Australia more worthy of those Prehonours. The press of other countries has,"" on many occasions, described him a3 t a great empire and nation builder, and of he was that. In addition to these honours - and titles, the people gave him titles of description and affection. When I first remember him, he was known as "" B i g the John,"" words which described him, perbest of all, because he was big of big of mind, and big of heart. In the height of his power, he wa3 of known as the Emperor of the - West, of a sobriquet which caused him some inamusement, and, I ^have no doubt', considerable personal gratification. As his personal characteristics, he was supply a man of most kindly disposition. He wa3 respected by his political opponents. was He was simple and lovable of character. was clean and virtuous in public and A far-iseeing, shrewd, man, in the choice words of the great poet, whose works he often loved He.was a man, take liim for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again. . When he was attacked by the disease to wihich he eventually succumbed he showed fighting spirit that had made and carried him to victory, on so also many occasions. It was suggested by the He press that he was proceeding to the the Motherland to accept enthronement in the House of Lords. All of us would have liked to see him accomplish that also; but his real purpose was to fight the disease that' he died fighting. In the. unletters which he wrote to some of us, who had been his colleagues, he made' that perfectly plain. He is buried, as Mr. of Speaker has intimated, in the lonely black country of Sierra Leone. The Government, if the House concurs, will, at the proper time, and in the proper way, ascertain the views of his widow as to whether his mortal remains should not be brought back to his native place. It seems to me that the proper tomb for such a man is in the country he loved so well, and foT which he worked. In giving this tribute to his memory, we offer to his stricken, partner in life our highest respect and deepest sympathy, and we trust she will find strength to support her in her great sorrow.",20
4,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Capricornia) [3.14] - In the absence of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor), owing to a family bereavement, I have to second the motion. While regretting the occasion that calls for its submission, I second it with pleasure, because the longer I remain in the political arena the more faith I have in the sincerity of my political opponents. Our emotions at the death of the two distinguished statesmen whose services are thus to be placed on record are not quite of the same character as those we experience when a young and brilliant member, such as was the late Mr Alfred Roberts, passes suddenly away. We do not experience, the same painful shock in this case, because both Lord Forrest and Sir George Reid had lived beyond the allotted span of three score years and ten. Their - lives were full and complete.' For over thirty years they had served in the public life of Australia. Sir George Reid had been Premier of New .South Wales and of the Commonwealth, while Lord Forrest had beeu the first Premier of the State of Western Australia, and had held office as Treasurer of the Commonwealth. The Federal Parliament has been spoken of as a place to which State politicians bring high reputations only to lose them. That oould not be said of either Lord Forrest or Sir George Reid, since they both added lustre to the distinctions they had gained in their respective States. Both were bom leaders of men; but they belonged to the old, rather than to the modern school of politics. They grew up in the days of Parnell and Gladstone, of Sir Henry Parkes and Sir George Dibbs, when the political leader created the political party. For good or ill , in these modern times-it may be a permanent or a transient phase of public life - the political party creates the political leader. Both of these statesmen were democratically inclined, although Sir George Reid would venture further in experimental legislation, especially when supported by a strong party, than would Lord Forrest, who always believed in ""hastening slowly."" Both men had much in common,, and yet they were different-Lord Forrest always dignified, courteous, and kindly; Sir George Reid witty, good-natured, and benevolent. ""Both had their faults; though at the moment I cannot remember what they were. Whatever their faults, their great abilities and their achievements have placed their names on the scroll of fame, and in our school books, and in the histories of our land, their records will be placed for young Australia to try to emulate. They might have chosen an easier life. They worked for honour and distinction, not for monetary gain-for the love of their country and its people. As I have said, we felt no painful shock at the sad news,, but our hearts go out in sympathy to the relatives, who could not part with such noble characters without the most poignant grief. The fine qualities which attracted to their standards men of the world outsidej must have inspired, both for Lord Forrest and Sir George Eeid, the most passionate love .and . affection in the hearts of their nearest and dearest relatives. We must all be especially mo fed when we think of that beautiful character, Lady Forrest, who was not only a devoted wife, but a constant. companion, now a lonely and pathetic figure, who will rarely, if ever, be seen again within the walls of this Parliament, where there is so much to remind her of her irreparable loss. The motion which we propose to place on the records of our Parliament will, let us hope, assuage the grief of the sorrowing ones, and make their sad loss a little easier to bear, since it will show' that we, on behalf of the public whom we represent, are proud to do lasting honour to the memory of their distinguished relatives.",22
5,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Perth) [3.19] - Whil e joining with the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) in.regretting the death of two eminent Australian kind words are justly said of men after statesmen, I wish more particularly, as the senior Western Australian representative in this House, and as one who enjoyed the intimate friendship of the late Lord Forrest, to thank both honourable gentlemen for the sympathetic and appreciative tributes they have paid to the memory of this distinguished deeply mourned son of the Western State. By political opponents, well as by political friends, the late Lord Forrest was esteemed, I might say loved, above all other members, perhaps, who ever sat in this Parliament. Like all truly great men, he had a noble simplicity of character which attracted not only admiration, but personal affection. . The keynote of his public career was an in tense loyalty to his native land and to the Empire. In both regards cherished high and unselfish ideals, and to work for these was to him as the very breath of life. Warm-hearted, whitesouled, and clean-handed, Lord Forrest will take a foremost place amongst our nation-builders; and his example will , I hope and pray, inspire many other sons of Australia to follow in his footsteps.",22
6,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Dampier) [3.21] As one who knew Lord Forrest as far back as 1897, and had been associated with him in politics for about twenty-one years, I should like to make a few remarks, more particularly as I - wish to prefer a request to theActing Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) in regard to a matter he has mentioned today. I went to Western Australia so long ago as 1893. My first experience of Lord Forrest was when, as chairman of a progress committee at Menzies, where fever was very preva-. lent and the hospital accommodation very primitive, I wired a lengthy telegram to the. honourable gentleman asking for assistance. The next day, through the warden of the goldfields, advice was received that £500 would be available for the work we desired to do. I only mention this to show the care that Lord Forrest always took of those who went to Western Australia in the early days of the goldfields. It is noteworthy what the State Government and people of Western Australia did to help those who were pioneering the out-back goldfields at that time, when railways were rushed forward, telegraph lines set up, and water supply provided. I do not think that in the development of any new country under the sun so much work of the kind was ever done so rapidly. The conceptions of the deceased - gentleman were as great as his courage in carrying them out. The great water scheme for the goldfields represented an enormous sum of money in view of the handf u l of people who were asked to expend and it-a n expenditure, I desire to impress on the House, proposed by Lord Forrest as almost in opposition to the goldfields people themselves. I , amongst many others on the fields at that time, was op- posed, to the expenditure, and the circumstance is mentioned merely to show the great confidence that Lord Forrest had at that time in his country. A f t e r the deceased gentleman left Western Australia, and came to the Federal Parliament, I am satisfied no member on either he side earned the same loyal respect and, I think I am justified in saying, the love of all members of the Chamber, and there is no man whose loss will be more generally regretted. We understand that the remains of Lord Forrest have been interred at Sierra Leone, and the request to which I have referred is that the Government shall at a later period consider the question of removing these remains to Western Australia. Nothing would please the people of that State more than to know that the Government had determined, when the opportunity permits, that the body of this distinguished statesman should be brought back and receive here, in his native country, that honour which his memory deserves.",23
7,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Eden Monaro) [3.28] - I endorse all that has been said, because I feel that in Lord Forrest I have lost the greatest and best friend I ever had. I thank the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt ) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) for the kind words used by them today. No one more than myself knew or loved the late Lord Porrest, and I hope that the suggestion made by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) will be carried out. When I look round the chamber, as one who came here at the inception of Australian Federation, I am reminded of the strenuous l if e that most of us lead. Although there are some sixty members present, I cannot see more than four who came here with the late right honourable member for Swan and myself. It has occurred to me that, while many fchey are dead, we might say a few while they are alive. I have had considerable experience, and have seen some of the ups and downs of political life, and I realise that even amongst my strongest opponents there are some very good fellows. There is no necessity, when we are all aiming at the one goal of trying to achieve the best for the country we love so well, .to introduce any spirit of bitterness into this House. I have no desire to lecture honourable members, but I must say that of late there seems a disposition to make matters more personal than in the old days. When I look back to the captains of the first Ministry, of which I had the honour to be the Whip, I can recall the good feeling that then prevailed amongst us all. . As an example of this I may mention the late Sir George Reid, with whom I had been in Parliament here and elsewhere for nearly twenty-eight years. We both took an active part ' on opposite sides in politics, and yet we never any cause for quarrelling; there was no necessity. I feel sure that it would be the greatest tribute to my old friend, Lord Porrest, if his grand example in this House had some leavening influence on members. While we strive strenuously and hard foT what we conceive to be right, we should try to realise that each one of us is actuated by good motives. I cannot add one word more to what has already been said by others, except to.recall what'was said of the late Lord Forrest^-and whafc I think he prized most-namely , that he was a man who made a way in the wilderness and a river in the desert. Question unanimously resolved in affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. Motion - (by Mr Watt ) agreed taThat Mr Speaker be requested to transmit to Lady Forrest the foregoing resolution and a copy of the speeches delivered thereon.",23
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," I have to in for m the House that, on learning of the death in London, on the 12th instant, of the Right Honorleadership able Sir George Houstoun Reid, a former Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, immediately, on behalf of honourable bers, despatched to Lady Reid, by cableenjoyed gram, an expression of their sympathy with her in her bereavement.",24
9,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Balaclava-Actin g P r i m e Minister and Treasurer) [3.30] - I move That this House places on record its high* appreciation of the eminent publie servicesrendered by the late Eight Honourable Sir George - Houstoun Eeid, P.C, G.G.B., G.C.M.G.; D.C.L., KC, as Premier of the State oJF New South Wales, as a member of the Federal Convention, as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, and as the first High Commissioner in London. This House tenders to Lady. Eeid and themembers of his family its deepest sj'mpathy in their bereavement, and assures them of theregret felt throughout Australia at the death of one who was for many years a leader in the political life of this country, was held in the highest esteem by its citizens, and with) marked ability represented the Commonwealth at the centre of the Empire. I fee] sure that this motion will recommend itself automatically to the minds of honourable members. Like .the deceased? gentleman of whom we have been speaking, Lord Forrest, Sir George Reid was the architect of his own fortune. Asfound most members of this House would proindeed, bably say of themselves, he received ir* his early days merely the ordinary p r i mary education. He arrived in this country when a very young lad, and of a career of seventy-three years, nearly sixty years were spent in Australia. His start in life was humble, as a clerk in the Treasury of New South Wales, where he remained for fourteen or fifteen years. He showed the desire, ambition, and ability that were in him in those days by graduating in a course of law while still i a Government employment, and he was admitted to the Bar in the mother State in 1879. About nineteen years later his: distinguished gifts afc the Bar entitled the him to rank as Queen's Counsel. He was a conspicuous and rising member of the Parliament of New South Wales for twenty years, and from 1894 to 1899 was Premier of that State, In the early nineties he succeeded fco the leadership of that great Free Trade party formerly lee? by fchafc other distinguished Australian, Sir Henry Parkes, and it may be said truth , even by those who differ front the tenets of that faith , that no man marked so pre-eminently the g if t of his> as did Sir George Reid during the days that he led in the State ParliaI ment, and later in the Federal arena. memWhen in power in New South Wales he quite the most remarkable, popularity of which I have read or heard in this country. . He built as much as any single member of the Conventions the Constitution under which we are now working, and he rose in this Parliament, » f t e r years of honourable fighting, to position of Prime Minister, which he occupied for almost a year."" In'1909, with the full approbation of the t r a l i a and of its Parliament, he was nominated b.y his political opponents as the first Australian High Commissioner in .Loudon, to which position he again transcopy ferred that popularity which made him a marked figure in Australian public life. He was, and as such will remain for many - a long day in our memory, one of the greatest, if not the greatest, platform speaker Australia has heard for a generaRight t i o n , and certainly the of its after-dinner speakers. m a n of unfailing wit, tact, and great courtesy, and those qualities enabled, him to captivate audiences and confound interjectors. As the honourable member for Capricornia said of him, he was ' ' a merry m a n , "" and played the game so thoroughly that even those who opposed him liked him. I think his commanding ability would have ranked him as a leader in-any assembly in the world, and had he devoted his great gifts to forensic instead of political work he would h#ve died rich as well as famous. But he died very poor, and thus his honest public service represented a heavy personal sacrifice. Perhaps the best tribute to his sterling worth is to be found in the deep and loyal attachment of so many of his former f o l lowers ; they w i ll not hear - a word said ' against his integrity or sincerity of purpose. He possessed great learning and - dignity, yet he was never unapproachable. To know him was to like him. the most supremely human person whom it has ever been my privilege to know. Aa was said by the honourable member for Capricornia, we do not approach these resolutions with the. deep personal regret that would fill our minds were we talking of the death of brilliant geniuses who t a d been cut off in the flower of their youth. These men had lived their lives, - and lived them worthily, and we do ourselves honour in paying tribute to their - memory. We trust that this resolution will convey to Lady Reid and her family the knowledge of how sincere is the grief m Australia, and assist to support her in ""her hour of deep tribulation .",24
