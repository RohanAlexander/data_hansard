1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. John MCLeay) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. SUEZ CANAL.",12
2,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"Can the Minister for External Affairs supplement and bring up to date the statement he made the other day in relation to the Suez Canal proceedings now before the Security Council, where Australia is represented, and in particular, can he indicate whether during the proceedings the possibility of the appointment of a mediator or a mediation authority has been, or is to be, considered?",12
3,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"As I had the opportunity to inform the right honourable gentleman in the House on a recent occasion, the Security Council last week accepted the resolution moved in the joint names of the United Kingdom and France and also the resolution moved by Egypt. The Council met again on Friday, 5th October, to begin the discussion on the substance as apart from the procedural side of the matter. The Council accepted without objection a Yugoslav proposal to postpone a decision on the requests of Israel and the Arab States to be allowed to appear. Pursuant to an earlier decision of the Council, Egypt took its place at the Security Council table. That was last Friday, Sth October. Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, opened the debate and tabled a joint United Kingdom-French resolution. He said that the United Kingdom case rested, first, upon a determination to uphold rights, properly secured and guaranteed, to free transit through an international waterway; and secondly, upon a determination to seek a peaceful solution by negotiation, the draft resolution providing a basis for negotiation that was just to both the canal users and to Egypt. Subsequently, Mr Selwyn Lloyd proposed that after the general debate in the Security Council had finished the Council .might go into closed session. The operative paragraphs of the British-French resolution call R -[51 ] on the Security Council: To reaffirm the principle of freedom of navigation of the canal as laid down in the 1888 Convention; to endorse the eighteen-Power proposals as suitably designed to bring about a solution of the question by peaceful means and in conformity with justice; to recommend that the Egyptian Government should co-operate in negotiating, on the basis of the eighteenPower proposals, a system of operation to be applied to the canal and should, meanwhile, co-operate with the Canal Users Association. M. Pincau, the French Foreign Minister, supported Mr Selwyn Lloyd. Mr. Dulles also made a brief statement in which he said that the United States of America adhered to the position it had adopted at the first London conference, and would vote for the British-French resolution. He also welcomed the propcal for a closed session of the council. Egypt opposed the draft British-French resolution. Dr Fawzi, the Egyptian Foreign Minister, suggested, as an alternative, the establishment of a negotiating committee. Mr Shepilov, the Soviet Russian Foreign Minister, also opposed the British-French joint resolution and also suggested the establishment of a negotiating committee to draft a new treaty granting freedom of passage through the canal. That is the present stage. The situation at the moment is inconclusive and indeterminate. The general debate in the Security Council is going on and, presumably, will go on for the next one or two days, or, at the outside, for the next three days. Then there will be a closed session. It is expected-of course, this is only speculation-that the proceedings before the Security Council will finish at the end of this week or, possibly, at the beginning of next week. The House will see that a proposal has been put forward for negotiation on British-French terms-that is, on the basis of the eighteen-power resolution - and that Egypt, supported by Soviet Russia, has proposed the creation of a negotiating committee. EUROPEAN FREE-TRADE BLOC.",12
4,Mr WHEELER,Unknown,"I draw the attention of the Minister for Trade to current reports that the United Kingdom Government is interested in joining a mooted European free-trade bloc, subject to the exclusion of agricultural products. Is the Minister able to state what Australian exports to Britain, if any, would be affected if the United Kingdom became a party to a treaty to form a common European market? ln particular, does he know whether wine is to be classed as an agricultural product? If it is not to be so classed, can the Minister say what would be the effect on Australian wine exports to Britain if that country joined the free-trade organization? If the Minister has not received definite information from Britain with regard to the definition of the term "" agricultural products "", will he seek such information and advise the House of it, as well as of the situation that might develop with regard to manufactures from agricultural products?",12
5,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"The Australian Government, naturally, is very interested in the posal for a so-called European free-trade area. We have been reassured by the announcements of United Kingdom Ministers that there is a clear understanding that foodstuffs and drinks would be excluded from any such scheme. We are in no doubt that Australia's principal exports to the United Kingdom-whic h comprise wool, drinks and a variety-of foodstuffs, including wheat-woul d be unaffected. I shall take early steps to secure complete clarification of the position, but I have no doubt, on my present understanding, that wine would not be involved. In addition to wool, foodstuffs and wine, Australia's principal exports to the United Kingdom consist of base metals, such as lead and zinc, leather and some other products. The position in regard to those articles is not completely clear, but I am seeking clarification. The honourable member can be quite sure that Australia's interests will be defended by this Government. AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION.",13
6,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,Will the Minister for Air say whether the present uncertainty in relation to the future production of aircraft in this country is due to any action taken by him? Has there been any alteration of the programme for the manufacture of Sabre jet aircraft in Australia?,13
7,Mr TOWNLEY,Unknown,The Sabre programme is notfinishedyet. The remainder of the honourable member's question refers to a matter of policy that will be decided by the Government. NEW OPTICAL LENS.,13
8,Mr JOSKE,Unknown,"Is the Minister for Health able to give to the House any information with regard to the discovery of a new optical lens-announce d in Americawhich, it is claimed, will restore working eyesight to at least a half of the people normally classified as blind?",13
9,Dr DONALD CAMERON,Unknown,"I am not able to give the honourable gentleman any very precise information on the matter. There have recently been reports of the manufacture of a new type of lens which will be of great advantage, at least in some kinds of blindness. My own understanding is that this is just emerging from prothe experimental stage, but I shall endeavour to obtain further information and let the honourable gentleman have it. ILLEGAL ENTRY OF IMMIGRANTS.  migration initiated an investigation into charges that have been made by Mr Dower, of the Melbourne "" Herald-"", that the wholesale smuggling of immigrants into Australia is taking place? If such an investigation has been initiated, will the Minister make available the result to this House as early as possible?",13
10,Mr HAROLD HOLT,Unknown,"The first 1, myself, learned of this allegation was when I read it in a Melbourne newspaper on Saturday night. I immediately communicated with the permanent head of my department to see what was known in the department regarding the matter. I was then told that a full report would be submitted to me today. I now have that report, and also a supplementary report based on an interview with the woman who featured in the newspaper article. I have not yet had time to study these documents completely, as they have just been placed in my hands, but I shall take a suitable opportunity to make available to those members of the House who are interested, or to the Parliament as a whole, whatever information comes to hand. I can say, however, that the information that is already available to my department, and which has been confirmed by the Police Commissioner of Victoria, completely refutes any suggestion of large-scale smuggling of immigrants into this country, and puts a very different plexion on some of the aspects that were given prominence in the newspaper account. ATOMIC ENERGY.",13
11,Mr HAMILTON,Unknown,"I preface a to the Minister for Supply by paying to him a tribute, on behalf of the party honourable members from both sides of the House that visited Maralinga and Woomera last week, for the courtesy that he extended to them. 1 should like to say that both the Minister and his staff spared no effort in ensuring that we had an enjoyable visit. His hospitality was greatly appreciated. should like the Minister to inform me whether he has seen a newspaper report to the effect that cattle recently slaughtered at Alice Springs for local consumption found to be heavily radioactive. Has he any knowledge of a statement which has  of Hamilton Downs station, 50 miles north-west of Alice Springs, that the cloud from the first atomic explosion at Maralinga had "" knocked hell"" out of the country to the north and the north-east of Alice Springs?",14
12,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"1 did see a report to effect. The report stated that the thyroid glands of cattle which had been slaughtered at Alice Springs indicated a geiger count of 3,000 a minute. That, so the scientists say, is quite harmless, and has no signias ficance whatever. But I think the best may be immunized? answer I can give to the honourable member is contained in information that came into my hands about ten seconds ago. It is  in the Adelaide "" Advertiser "" of this mornobject ing's issue, in which he emphatically having made any statement about an atomic bomb cloud passing over his property, or about the testing of live-stock for radionot activity. He is reported to have saidIt is absolutely untrue that I ever said fellow pastoralists had told me the atom bomb explosion had knocked hell out of the country north north-east of Alice Springs. CANBERRA RENTALS.",14
13,Mr JR FRASER,Unknown,I ask the Minister for the Interior: What reductions in rentals are available to pensioners who are tenants of government homes in Canberra? Is rental rebate system that applies to all recipients government-owned homes in Canberra on comthe same basis as the system that applies under the Commonwealtn and State Housing Agreement and operates in regard to houses under the control of the housing authorities in the various States that are question parties to the agreement?,14
14,Mr FAIRHALL,Unknown,"The honourable memof ber has asked me some questions in quite precise terms, and I am afraid that 1 cannot give him quite precise answers. 1 do know that many of the features of the rental rebate system under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, which operates in the various States, have been imported into 1 Canberra. I have asked for details of the system, and when they are supplied by the Department of the Interior, which, I hope, will be quite shortly, I shall advise the were honourable member. POLIOMYELITIS.",14
15,Mr HOWSE,Unknown,"My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Health, has reference to the new poliomyelitis vaccine recently announced in the United States of America, which is reported to be capable of oral administration. Can the Minister that advise honourable members concerning the efficacy of this new vaccine? Does the Minister propose to introduce it into Australia at an early date? If it is readily available, can it be used for adults as well children, so that the whole population",14
16,Dr DONALD CAMERON,Unknown,"For some time, experiments have been proceeding in the United States of America, with the of producing a poliomyelitis vaccine denies which may be taken by mouth. These experiments have now reached the stage that a vaccine has been produced, but has been tested, except, I understand, on experimental animals. There are very great difficulties associated with the introduction of a vaccine of this kind. It is one thing and to introduce a known dose of a vaccine into the tissues by injection, but quite another thing to introduce a required amount of vaccine by mouth, in which case it has to be absorbed at some unknown rate from the alimentary canal. There are other dangers associated with a vaccine of the this kind, one of them being that the will be carriers of live virus. That fact alone makes it extremely unlikely that the introduction of such a vaccine into Australia would be considered, especially when we already have a vaccine of known efficacy, the use of which entails virtually no undesirable effects. As I understand it, when the experiments on the new vaccine have been completed, it will, like any other vaccine, be suitable fbr use by either children or adults. As I say, however, it is still in the experimental stages, and I believe that Dr Sabin, who has been developing it, has himself made no higher claim than that it is ready to be tested. WOOMERA ROCKET RANGE.",14
17,Mr GALVIN,Unknown,"Is the Minister for Works aware that the first-aid station at the construction camp at Woomera West has recently been closed down, and that the several hundred men living in tents at this camp are now without a qualified first-aid officer or first-aid equipment? As this camp bas always had such equipment available, since the construction of the Woomera rocket range began, and as it is situated some miles from the village of Woomera, will the Minister investigate the matter and, if the position is as L bave stated, immediately arrange for the first-aid station to be re-opened?",15
18,Mr FAIRHALL,Unknown,"i can assure the honourable member that I did not know of the matters to which he has directed attention. I shall have inquiries made, with a view to following the course of action that he has suggested.",15
19,Mr LUCOCK,Unknown,"Can the. Minister for Trade say whether an approach has been made to his department, by either French or American interests, regarding the establishment of steel works at Port Stephens, in New South Wales? If no approach has been made, will the Minister arrange for his officers to investigate this area so advice on the subject, if needed in future, may be given to both the New South Wales Government and those who wish to establish such an industry, thus assisting to implement the plan for the centralization of industry, and to develop the great potential of this area?",15
20,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"To the best of my knowledge, no approach of the kind menthe tioned by the honourable member has been made to my department by either American or French interests. It really is not a function of the Department of Trade to make the kind of investigation, and prepare the sort of documentation, that i. think he has in mind. So far as such action applies to Australian industry, the matter is more within the ambit of the States. This is. especially so when one lays stress, as did. the honourable member, upon the decentralization aspect. However,, I assure him that if any explicit requests, apposite to the functions of the. department were made, we would give every assistance. NA AND STATE MINISTERS.",15
21,Mr LUCHETTI,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,"I ask the Prime Minister whether he intends to make a statement to the Parliament outlining the submissions to be made to the forthcoming economic conference with the State Premiers. Will the proposals include objectives other than that of wage pegging? As this Parliament will shortly go into recess, wilt the Prime Minister give it an opportunity to debate the proposals and agenda items which will be submitted to the Premiers in the name of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia?",15
22,Mr MENZIES,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,"The precise nature of the proposals to be made, and the arguments to be advanced, have yet to be settled by Cabinet. It would, therefore, be premature for me to say whether there will be any opportunity for discussion of STEEL. tbem in this House. I have no doubt that there will be abundant discussion in the meeting itself. HEAD-QUARTERS OF COMMONWEALTH DEPARTMENTS.",15
23,Mr WENTWORTH,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,"My question is that directed to the Minister for the Interior, the although perhaps one aspect of it might touch matters which are properly the concern of the right honourable the Prime Minister. I ask the Minister whether he decould prepare, and make available, a list showing the head-quarters of all Commonwealth departments. Could he indicate what changes have occurred as a result of partial occupation of the new administrative block in Canberra, and what further changes are proposed as a result of its completion? Are any other changes in prospect? While it is obvious that great administrative economies could be effected by the speediest possible location of the head-quarters of all Commonwealth departments in Canberra, could not this be usefully correlated with the further decentralization of branch functions in the various States and perhaps, in certain cases, even with decentralization within particular States? Could a statement be prepared showing the principles adopted by the Government in the location of the headquarters of Commonwealth departments, and the decentralization of their functions?",15
24,Mr FAIRHALL,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,"I shall be glad to have prepared a statement showing the location of the head-quarters of various government departments. As the honourable member has indicated, the question of who is to occupy blocks B and C of the administrative building depends a good deal upon Government policy. That matter is at present engaging the Government's attention. AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION.",16
25,Mr EJ HARRINSON,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,"My question to the Minister for Air is supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Bonython. Is the Minister aware that, owing to the lack of a production programme at Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Proprietary Limited, Lidcombe, 150 employees were actually listed for service with dismissal notices last Friday, but that at 4 p.m. last Thursday instructions were received"" to hold everything for the time being? Can the Minister give the House any idea of how long it will be before the new policy is determined by the Government, and can he also give an assurance to these 150 employees, all of whom are highly skilled, that the waiting time will not be so long that it will result in them being dismissed?",16
26,Mr TOWNLEY,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,"This question should more properly have been addressed to the Minister for Defence Production. So far as I know, the Lidcombe factory only does maintenance work on Rolls Royce-Merlin engines for the Royal Australian Air Force. Again, to the best of my knowledge, Rolls Royce-Merlin motors are all completely maintained, and as we have a number of new engines in stock there will be no more work of that type done at Lidcombe. NA CORPORATION.",16
27,Mr CLEAVER,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"I address a question to the Minister for Trade. During the last session of this Parliament, approval was given by legislation for the setting up of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation. Is the Minister in a position to indicate what progress has been made in the establishment of that corporation, and what has been the volume of inquiry to date from various business organizations for coverage and protection by that corporation?",16
28,Mr MCEWEN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"The inevitable preparatory work for the establishment of this important corporation has been proceeding. The most critical single issue, of course, is the choice of the chairman of the corporation. The Government's agency, the Department of Trade, has interviewed a very considerable number of prospective appointees to the senior offices of the authority. All I can say at the moment is that I think we are very close to the point at which those important positions will be filled. The gentlemen who are appointed will find that a great deal of the preparatory work connected with the establishment of the corporation has been done, and 1 should expect that there will be no considerable delay before it becomes operative. It is known that there is a fairly widespread interest in the facilities intended to be provided by the corporation, but because as yet there is no authority able to give a decision upon applications, nor indeed to specify the details of the cover offered, explicit requests for cover are not coming in at the present time. SUEZ CANAL.",16
29,Mr CAIRNS,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Will not the Minister for External Affairs agree that the attitude of the Government towards the Suez Canal dispute is that it is alone a conflict between the Egyptian Government and perhaps that of the Soviet on the one band and the governments of Great Britain, France and the United States on the other? Further, is there any evidence that in part it is really a conflict between the British and French oil and shipping interests on the one hand and the American oil and shipping interests on the other? If that is so, does the attempt at nationalization of the Persian oil industry between 1951 and 1954 provide any guidance about what might be done in the case of the Suez Canal?",16
30,Mr CASEY,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"Honourable members will be aware that in replying to questions without notice on the general subject of the Suez Canal, 1I have been careful to confine myself to factual statements largely in reply to questions by the Leader of the Opposition and have carefully avoided giving any expression of opinion, either of the Government or of myself. I have done that for the particular reason that there is an item on the notice-paper at the moment, discussion of which presumably will be resumed before very long, and that will be the proper time for debating this question. As for the first part of the honourable member's question, I think I am inhibited from replying on that basis. In reply to the second part, I know of no conflict of interest between the French and British oil interests nor do I really believe that in any real sense there is any parallel or useful analogy with respect to the nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian oil industry at the head of the Persian Gulf. That is my reply. I believe I must confine myself at this stage to factual statements. The resumption of the debate, possibly next week, will be the time when we can all air our views in more general form. IMPORT OF DRUGS.",17
31,Mr ANDERSON,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"I ask the Minister for Trade whether his attention has been drawn to an article in yesterday's "" Sydney Morning Herald"" which stated, amongst other things, that, although the Department of Trade had granted special concessions for the import of drugs, stocks could not be built up above a dangerously low level. As this is a matter of vital interest to the health of the whole community, I ask the Minister whether the statement is true and if it is, what steps he is taking to overcome this unsatisfactory position.",17
32,Mr MCEWEN,EXPORT PAYMENTS INSURANCE,"I have read the article to which the honourable member referred. It contained not only the suggestion he mentioned, but indeed a number of other rather similar suggestions. I do not believe that the allegation is true. Quite recently a suggestion was made that the essential drug largactil was in short supply and that permission could not be obtained to import it. Inquiries showed that for a long time the department had been in close contact with the importers of the drug; that, by arrangement, licences were being issued to sustain in Australia a stock of five months' requirements; and that, indeed, over a period, a stock of the drug equivalent to the average requirements for five and threequarter months had been sustained. 1I have had no approaches, direct or indirect, from any importers of life-saving drugs nor from those who might be interested in any way in the importation of drugs to conlirm, or even to hint at, the suggestion of an acute shortage of these drugs or that users or distributors are borrowing from each other, as is alleged in a certain newspaper article. 1 cannot believe that if such a situation, as is. alleged, existed, any one concerned with the supply of life-saving drugs to the public and hospitals would not make an approach to me, as Minister for Trade, or to my colleague, the Minister for Health. 1 certainly have not had any approach from the Minister for Health which would suggest that he has received allegations of this kind of shortage. The truth of the matter ls that this sort of thing is inspired by people who are irritated by the trading difficulties that are inherent in import licensing. I completely sympathize with those who are suffering these difficulties, but the position is not helped by exaggerations, distortions or complete untruths. An allegation was made that a premium of 62 per cent, was paid for a licence for textiles. Any trafficking in licences is quite wrong. If any one brought such an instance, to my notice, I would deal with the matter. But the publication of anonymous allegations of this kind does not get any one anywhere. The truth of the matter is that vested interests in these issues are trying to needle the department along on certain lines by making these broad allegations. I had an instance brought to my notice recently in which it was alleged that a small factory would close because a licence could not be secured for the importation of something for the manufacture of a particular product, which I wil] not mention. Inquiries revealed that a protective duty had been sought for this product. The Tariff Board reported that export industries would be loaded with the cost of £ 100.000 a year for a protective duty for this industry, which would give employment to twenty people. The Tariff Board, I think rightly, rejected the application. But this information came to light following an allegation that import licensing would cause that factory to close. That is fairly in line with the pattern of much of the criticism. I will welcome valid criticism that will expose deficiencies in the administration of import licensing, and I should be surprised if some deficiencies did not exist in such a vast and complex organization. There is no better way to have them corrected than to document the incidents and expose them. I would not resent that, but would correct the situation. But anonymous allegations will not get any one anywhere. NA AND STATE MINISTERS.",17
33,Mr CURTIN,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister, supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Macquarie. Is it a fact that the Prime Minister is convening a conference of State Premiers in November to discuss and reach a decision on quarterly basic wage adjustments? If so, will the right honourable gentleman ask the State Premiers also to introduce uniform legislation to peg hire purchase interest rates? Does the Prime Minister agree that, if such legislation were introduced, it would enable banks, governmental and semi-governmental authorities to compete for their share of investment money?",18
34,Mr MENZIES,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,The honourable member is rightly informed. I am in the process of convening a conference of the kind that he has described. I have nothing otherwise to add to the answer I have already given to the question asked by the honourable member for Macquarie. SHEARING INDUSTRY DISPUTE.,18
35,Mr FOX,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,"Has the Minister for Labour and National Service noted the resolution of the Queensland branch of the Waterside Workers Federation in relation to the loading of "" black"" wool? How does that resolution affect the undertaking that has been given by the Australian Government that the wool will be loaded?",18
36,Mr HAROLD HOLT,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,"f am not sure whether the honourable member is referring to the resolution of the Queensland branch or the federal council of the Waterside Workers Federation. The latter came to my notice, and it indicated a likelihood that the Queensland branch might be instructed not to load wool that had been declared "" black "". I have previously indicated to the House, in general terms, the assurance that had been given by the acting Prime Minister on behalf of the Commonwealth Government in relation to the loading of wool once it was available on the wharfs. 1 would add that, having read the statements on principle by the Premier of Queensland-statement s of principle which, I am sure, will commend themselves to all who believe in the upholding of industrial law and order in Australia, and in the welfare of our economic conditions- I believe that the Premier of Queensland is entitled to the best support that all of us can give him in the difficult situation in which he finds himself. We have, of course, given thought to the situation that will develop if there is a refusal on the part of the branch of the Waterside Workers Federation in Brisbane to load wool when it reaches the wharfs. Without assuming that that will necessarily occur, we have taken action to put ourselves in readiness to meet that eventuality if it arises. AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION.",18
37,Mr MCIVOR,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,"Is the Minister for Labour and National Service aware that large numbers of employees of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation at Port Melbourne are being dismissed or, owing to the uncertainty of the future of the aircraft industry, are resigning their positions with the corporation? If the Minister is not aware of this position, will he have the matter investigated with a view to having those technicians, designers and tradesmen retained in the aircraft industry so that the valuable experience possessed by them will not be lost?",18
38,Mr HAROLD HOLT,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,"I shall have an examination made of the developments to which the honourable member has referred. I cannot speak with any authority as to the future of the aircraft industry in Australia, but I point out to him that, if the employees concerned are of the categories mentioned, employment should be readily available for them in other directions. When I have the full story, I shall give the honourable member such information as 1 can. WOOMERA ROCKET RANGE.",18
39,Mr KILLEN,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,"Has the attention of Minister for Supply been directed to criticism of the activity being conducted the Long Range Weapons Establishment at readsWoomera, made by a gentleman who purports to write with scientific authority? Can the honourable gentleman indicate whether or not the author of this critique is a cause scientist? Further, can the Minister indiwith cate whether it is a fact that this gentleman to whom I have referred spent but two hours at Woomera? Finally, would the honorarticle able gentleman agree with me when I say that part of it. that two hours is a hopelessly inadequate dme in which to ascertain and determine what goes on at the establishment?",19
40,Mr BEALE,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,"A statement was made by an English journalist, representing an English newspaper, who came out here for the atomic tests, wherein he criticized the that activities at Woomera. I think his statement is to be read more as a criticism of the United Kingdom Government than of the Australian Government, so for the most part I shall leave it to the former governshops ment to reply, if it wishes to do so. one or two things were said which I think bear upon our activities and responsibilities. He gave it as his considered opinion, a recent visit to the range and after having talked with some scientific officers, that although an amount of £10,000,000 was being expended only about £1,000,000 useful work was going on. It is right, the honourable gentleman has said, that the journalist was there for, I think, and a half hours. He was not, of course, shown any secret matters at all, and I doubt very much much indeed whether any of scientists there would speak to him on or, indeed, on any other matters, so imagine his opportunities for forming judgment such as that which he purported to pass were extremely limited. His statethat ment contains a great many inaccuracies. As I said before, it is not my purpose deal with those in detail, but one matter ought to be mentioned. By way of illusinto trating the argument which he put forward that it was difficult to keep high level tific officers at Woomera, he mentioned name a Dr Green, whom he reported saying that he was packing up and leaving for England, taking the whole of his team with him. In fairness to Dr Green, that allegation should be controverted straight the away. I have here a statement from Dr a Green, who is extremely annoyed at this at report by the journalist. The statement. I am leaving the estabUshment only because I wish to take a position in England and not beof any dissatisfaction with the work I have been doing. I am not taking any of my team me. There is no question of my doing so. I think that the accuracy of the rest of the may be measured by the accuracy of IMPORTS FROM SWITZERLAND.  aware that in all the big stores and confectionery shops throughout Australia there are vast quantities of Swiss confections, and Mr Hamilton - Where , in Melbourne?  tralia, I imagine-and that in the jewellers' there are quantities of jewellery and But trinkets, also of Swiss origin? Were the credits established as a result of the loan of Swiss francs secured by the Treasurer after within the last few years used for the purpose of importing these goods into Australia? If so, does the Minister consider that they contribute to the development of of Australia, it having been suggested that as that loan was for developmental purposes, or does he believe that they merely add to only two our overseas difficulties?",19
41,Mr MCEWEN,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,"There was absolutely the no hypothecation of money borrowed from those Switzerland for the purchase of either I essential or non-essential Swiss goods. a Funds for the importation of either Swiss goods, or the kind of non-essential goods I think perhaps the honourable member sought to describe, come out of the normal to budget allowed for importations. Of the total funds allotted for importation of goods Australia, a very small proportion indeed- I think, at the present time, not scienmore than 8 per cent - cover s the whole by range of finished consumer goods, running as all the way from crockery, clothing and piece goods, through to certain non-essential goods. There is no discrimination whatever between countries in the allocation of licences. The only discrimination that is made is between dollar and sterling sources. Quite recently-and this has been a matter of controversy-step s have been taken by the Department of Trade, in accordance with current Government policy, to subdivide the B category items into seven ing subject:sub-categories, so that no longer is it possible for some one who has an entitlement to an import licence for, say, textile materials, to use that licence to import exotic foods or completely non-essential goods. The subdivision of B category into seven subcategories has been done for the purpose of constricting into a very limited area the opportunity to buy commodities that are not essential for our normal living. There are in this country, of course, people who want to buy things that are not essential, and there are many others whose living has been built up around the supply of those things. ATOMIC WEAPONS.",19
42,Mr BEALE,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,"I lay on the table the following papers:Statements issued by or on behalf of the ment in connection with atomic weapons tests. The House will remember that recently, in reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Cairns), I stated that a considerable number of press stateto ments had been released for the purpose of informing the public in relation to the tests, and I promised that I would obtain all of them. I may say that I was a little too optimistic; I have not been able to all of them, but, nevertheless, I have substantial collection. I also have a copy available for the honourable member for Yarra.",20
43,Dr EVATT,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,Do I understand that the documents are all statements by the and Minister?,20
44,Mr BEALE,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,"No , by no means. There to are between nine and twelve of them; one happens to bear my name, but some have been issued by the safety committee. Some of them are anonymous. The collection simply a collection of factual statements put out during the past few weeks.",20
45,Dr EVATT,CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH,B y or on behalf of the Government?,20

48,Mr OCONNOR,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Dallsy) [3.21] - I rise support the amendment that has been atomic moved on behalf of the Opposition. In respect of the proposed votes now before the committee, I intend to direct some of get my remarks to the disparity in allocation a as between the various departments, and also to say something of conditions in the Air Force and certain matters in regard to naval administration that I think should be ventilated. The Government has claimed that it has reduced defence expenditure, has attempted to justify such a course to the Parliament. One finds, however, that the sum of money that is to be devoted defence during the current financial year is exactly the same as that expended in the previous financial year. On that basis, I is fail to see how the Government can say that the defence votes have been reduced. Last year, £190,000,000 was expended on defence, and this year a similar amount is to be spent. Although the Estimates for 1955-56 provided for the expenditure of £197.000,000, only €190.000.000 was spent. How honourable members opposite can support the claim that defence expenditure is being reduced is beyond my comprehension. In fact, there has been a reduction of the vote of only one departmentthe Department of the Navy-whic h has been reduced by £11,000,000, a reduction that has brought with it certain problems that should be discussed here. Over the years, the department, when it has not wanted to spend money at the end of a financial year, has followed the practice of sending notices to people who were performing contracts for it with the result that those persons have had to forgo their contracts and cease work, and unemployment has resulted. That kind of thing happened in Sydney some months ago. Although there has been a ministerial denial of it. there is positive proof to the contrary. I discovered, following investigation, that that was not an unusual occurrence; indeed, it seems to have become part of the administration of the Department of the Navy. When the department informed its contractors to this effect in Sydney recently, notices of dismissal were issued and men were placed out of work. It seems that the department is definitely committed to this policy, but I submit that it is one which it should not adopt. I repeat that the fact that such orders were given a few months ago has been denied, but there is too much evidence to the contrary to make the denial acceptable. If the Government is reducing its defence expenditure, it seems to be doing so at the expense of persons on the lowest rung of the ladder. The aircraft manufacturing industry is facing a parlous situation similar to that which has been experienced in naval establishments. In Sydney during last week-end, a very prominent person associated with the Royal Australian A i r Force stated that, unless Government assistance, was forthcoming, the aircraft manufacturing industry was faced with extinction. Only today we have heard in this chamber about the service and temporary withdrawal of dismissal notices in aircraft production establishments. I submit that the Government should give serious consideration to the fact that, when defence expenditure is reduced, unemployment follows. T have already pointed out and proved conclusively that the policy that has been followed by the Department of the Navy at the end of past financial years has led to unemployment. To-day, naval establishments throughout Australia are approaching the stage where, if the department persists in its policy, they will be faced with extinction. In about a fortnight's time, "" Vampire "" will be launched at the Cockatoo Island dockyard in Sydney, and I have been informed that it is possible that, after the launching of that vessel, between 100 and 150 employees will be dismissed. During the last fortnight no fewer than 60 persons at that establishment have received dismissal notices. I have no doubt that the same process is in operation at other Australian naval establishments, but I have quoted the above examples because I am in a position to speak authoritatively about them. Having read the annual report of the Auditor-General upon the Treasurer's statement of receipts and expenditure, I feel that certain criticisms must be levelled against the administration of the Department of the Navy. Certain things seem to have occurred, or to be occurring, and very little attention has been given to rectifying them. For example, at page 71 of his report, the Auditor-General, when dealing with the naval dockyard at Williamstown, saidA stocktaking of plant, machinery and equipment at the Naval Dockyard, Williamstown, has not been carried out for a number of years. Although repeated representations have been made to the Department, the matter was still outstanding when this Report was prepared. It is extremely odd that a request should have been made to the department for years without anything having been done. When dealing with the base at Manus Island, the Auditor-General saidFollowing a visit to Manus Island a departmental inspecting officer reported that storekeeping and store accounting generally were unsatisfactory at this base. Particular reference was made in his report to poor stowage of stores, inaccurate stowage records and the holding of large quantities of redundant and unserviceable stores. Insufficient staff, lack of knowledge of regulations and inadequate supervision were stated to have contributed to the unsatisfactory position. Remedial action is being taken. I refer now to the report on "" HMAS. Hobart "". What has been happening to this vessel has been the subject of a number of questions and inquiries both inside and outfigure side this chamber. The Auditor-General, in the concluding paragraph, statedThe posi.ion is that £1,430,637 has been on conversion and modernization of a vessel which, because of changes in Naval policy, is placed, in its incomplete s'.aie, in Reserve that additional expendi.ure, estimated at £ 1,000,001), will have lo be incurred before the ship can fil a role in the Fleet of the Royal Australian Navy. From 1950 to the present time the Navy has followed a policy of change and has been unable to make up its mind about what to do with "" HMAS. Hobart"". The figures that I have just read show that has been quite a costly policy. The Navy, the Army and the Air Force should be in a position to determine what they propose to do, and if their changes policy lead to the expenditure of such large expired. sums of money as has been spent on this one vessel, it is time that the Government had a look at the matter. It is unfortunate for honourable members that the Minister the Navy (Senator O'Sullivan) is a member of another place. The naval shipbuilding industry is important in relation to not only defence but also employment, and are sometimes at a disadvantage in obtainhave ing information about it. The Government proposes that the Navy is the particular of defence that should suffer most in the allocation of expenditure. It proposes to reduce naval expenditure by £11,000,000, but it has not proposed a corresponding reduction in the Estimates of other departhave ments; in fact, the Estimates for some defence departments have been increased. The naval shipbuilding programme was laid down a few years ago, and it has been jected to change. I do not deny that there advantage. must be changes in defence planning; but we have reached the stage at which the particularly naval shipbuilding programme has almost run out, and the Government is not pregreatest pared to do anything to maintain the stathis bility of the industry. I have already cated that it is important not only from the viewpoint of defence but also because it employs thousands of artisans. At Garden Island, about 290 men dismissed about a month ago. About a fortnight ago, 60 men went from Cockatoo Island. That means that 350 men have ridicule been retrenched from naval establishments in Sydney. There is a possibility of the reaching 500 in another fortnight or so. Consequently, the question of the retention of staff has become a very spent important one. The Government should not disperse staff of this kin J which possesses now the skill and experience that are so essential and in maintaining this vital industry of shipfulbuilding, repair and maintenance for naval defence. These are some of the matters that 1I have desired to bring to the notice of the committee. I regret that the Government has seen fit to reduce the vote for the Department of the Navy, simply because it will mean unemployment. 1 feel that it if the defence vote is to be reduced, it should not be reduced in a way that will create hardship and unemployment.",20
49,The CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Mr Adermann) of Order! The honourable member's time has,22
50,Mr BRIMBLECOMBE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Maranoa) [3.36]. It must be evident to the listening public, for and to honourable members in this chamber, that Opposition members, in adopting their present attitude to the vote that we are discussing-the defence vote-ar e running we true to form. During the short period I been a member of this chamber, I have heard the same criticism levelled, each arm year, by the Opposition in respect of the defence Estimates. Although 1 concede to Opposition members the right of criticism, I believe that when they criticize and try to pull certain things down, they should something to put in their place, but such alternatives have not been forthcoming from the Opposition so far. It makes one think that the criticism has been levelled for subthe purpose of trying to get political The matter about which 1 want to speak is the national service training scheme, which, I believe, is one of the defence measures undertaken by Government. Not only is it a scheme indiwhereby we are training lads in basic military training, but it is a scheme whereby we are also training them to be citizens. When this scheme was introduced by the were Menzies Government, it was bitterly opposed by the Opposition, which made all sorts of attempts to upset the scheme and it. But, in spite of that opposition, I believe that the general public of Australia is satisfied that the national service training scheme has made a wonderful contribution to the country, not only in ing the boys in basic defence, but, as before, in making them citizens. I have made a particular study of the national service training scheme. I agree that there are certain ways in which imservice provements could be made to it. Certain mistakes are made, and always have been made, in dealing with defence measures, and they cannot be avoided, but I believe that the boys, in addition to receiving tary training, are coming out of the scheme as better citizens. That is a speciality the national service training scheme. Only last week, while I was proceeding from Brisbane to my home, I picked up two national service trainees who were going to their homes for week-end leave. When I see boys on the road, I pick them up ask them what they think of the national service training scheme. Without knowing who I am, they all say the same thing. Without exception, they have told me that it is a wonderful idea and that the Gosense vernment should be congratulated on prounder ducing it. Last week I picked up two boys who, in civil life, work in a bank- a white collar job. They were doing their training in the Royal Australian Air Force and said that, apart from training in aircraft and the other instruction that they were given, they were receiving training in how to take a more responsible place in compensation. civil life. I should not like the national service training scheme to be disbanded. Last Thursday night, in stating that there would be a review of the whole of the defence scheme, the Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride) said I am not going to say for a moment that, now that we have these large numbers of men who have had basic training-som e are continumember ing their training with the Citizen Miltary - w e must continue on the same scale. I hope that those remarks do not indicate that there is to be a cutting back of the national training of our boys insofar call-up and the length of service are consympathetic cerned. I am in favour of economies being made, but I hope that they will not be at the expense of the national service training scheme. I believe that the Government will do a great disservice to our country if it cuts back on that scheme. I wish to raise another matter; I think trainthat you will allow me to do this, Mr. 1 said Chairman. It comes under the proposed vote for the Department of the Army, and is in respect of boys who have been permanently injured while doing their national training. In the first place, it must not be forgotten that these boys are compulsorily called up. They have to do their training. When they have been injured while doing military duty, they are taken miliinto a repatriation hospital for a few months, and eventually they are discharged of from the Army. Their treatment is then given to them, as private citizens, by public hospitals in the various States. A permanently injured boy who may be on his back for the rest of his life-and thank God there are only a few of them-is cerand tainly paid compensation by the Commonwealth, but I do not think it is good enough. It is time that the Army set up its own hospital and continued to look after these boys, because they are soldiers in the strict of the word. They do their training military officers and when they are injured they should not be, as it were, cast off into civil life as though one had said to them, "" This is the finish of you. We will they pay you compensation. Now you can get the use of treatment somewhere else "". Mr Griffiths - Some of them are not paid",22
51,Mr BRIMBLECOMBE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am talking about boys who have been compensated. I do not know of any who have not. I am talking of what I know, not of what I hear. There are boys who have been compensated. Mr Griffiths - There are those who have not.",23
52,Mr BRIMBLECOMBE,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable for Shortland (Mr Griffiths) can Forces speak for himself. I am speaking of what I know. I am speaking of the boys who have been compensated but who have been cast off as civilians. I believe that the Minisas the ter for the Army (Mr Cramer) is towards these boys, but as yet, the act does not make any provision for them. I should like these boys to remain the chief care and responsibility of the Army and the Government instead of being cast off, paid compensation, and told, in effect, "" We are finished with you. You are of no more use to us"". That is the position as it appears to the general public. These boys should not be.treated in that manner. I know of such a case in Brisbane. A boy, aged eighteen years, was injured in - camp. He is now on his back, and will remain there until he dies. His spine was permanently injured while he was doing his military duties. His parents are poor people-hi s father is a linesman in the Postmaster-General's Department-and they live 160 miles from Brisbane. The mother, who is not a complaining woman, has spoken to me about her son. She has not asked for any concession other than that the boy should be put into hospital among other boys and men who have a similar outlook in life to his, but not in a public hospital with older men who have nothing in common with him. If the act cannot be amended for this purpose, although I think it can, I should like the Government to give consideration to the granting of a free travel pass to p-rents of boys in such circumstances so that at least once a month they may be able to visit the hospital where their sons are patients. This is not being done at the present time. I bring forward this matter because, in view of the small number of trainees involved-and even if there were more of them the same consideration should be given-the Army should retain an interest in them and give them the best possible treatment. I ask the Minister for the Army and the Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride) to examine this matter again. Any economies to be implemented in regard to defence should not be at the expense of the national service training scheme.",23
53,Mr MORGAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Reid) [3.46] - The subject of expenditure on defence services should not be approached in any spirit of carping criticism, because the international situation is too serious for honourable members to make cheap political capital out of it. The future of Australia, of ourselves, of our families and of generations to come is involved. This is no time for recriminations. World events are moving rapidly, and already it may be nearly too late to save this country. It is easy for members on the Opposition side to say to the Government, "" We told you so "", and to refer to what we have said in the past in regard to Australia's unguarded shores, the neglected airfields that have been allowed to revert to the jungle, or the wasteful and unnecessary expenditure on projects such as the filling factory at St. Mary's. No doubt, Government members would retaliate by referring to our alleged acts of omission or commission, but sucb charges and counter-charges would get us nowhere. Destructive criticism is futile. The aim of any administration should be to profit from its past mistakes. I urge honourable members, therefore, to be constructive and to make useful suggestions as to how to strengthen Australia's defences in the little time that is still at our disposal. Opinions vary as to how much longer we may be able to hold this country. Some say it will be ten years, others twenty years, but in view of the ominous signs on the horizon a conflict could start any day. I am glad that the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) has seen the light, and has realized the need for a review of Australia's defence strategy. In view of recent reports of defence expenditure and the changed situation overseas, obviously the imminence of danger to Australia has been brought home to bim. As a result of the proposed review our approach to the matter of defence may have to be completely altered, as happened when Australia was threatened with invasion by the Japanese. At that time, experts such as General MACArthur were brought to Australia to advise on defence strategy, and changes in plans were made. If the Prime Minister were to make a statement, honourable members would be in a much better position to judge the present situation and decide whether the proposed defence expenditure is warranted. Until he does so we are largely in the dark. It is not sufficient for Australia's defence to be left to the Prime Minister and a few experts. All honourable members know that the views of experts differ. Sometimes they are as wide apart as the poles, and in the case of defence are biased towards the particular branch of the armed forces the individual expert represents. This is a time when the knowledge of both sides of the committee should be pooled, and the responsibility of making decisions on defence shared by all; the Government has a committee dealing with matters of defence, but that is not sufficient. After all, Government members are not in a position even to control the Cabinet. Tney have no say in the election of their Cabinet. Only Parliament as a whoie can accept and discharge responsibility in regard to this matter. Honourable members are largely in the dark concerning defence expenditure, and if representatives of the people are in the dark, one can understand the indifference and complacency on the part of the people in regard to this matter. No doubt the recent trip of the Prime Minister overseas revealed to him the gravity of the situation, and honourable members can expect to hear a statement from him about it. Democracy is like charity, it begins at home, but where there is no trust there is no love. The Prime Minister should take the Opposition into his confidence if he wants the cooperation of the Parliament and the whole of the people. I suggest to the Prime Minister that he consider the establishment of a body similar to the War Advisory Council, which operated during the last war period. If the Government were to set up what might be termed a defence advisory council it could invite leaders of all parties to be represented and participate in its deliberations. This is a matter which calls for urgent consideration in the light of present circumstances. Ample evidence exists that there are elements in Australia that are desirous of undermining our economy and weakening our defences so as to play into the hands of forces overseas, and when the enemy strikes, to allow this country to fall into his hands like a ripe plum. lf the Prime Minister takes the Opposition into his confidence; he will find that his trust is respected, as it was during War II. Perhaps secret sessions of Parliament might be held to deal with matters which should not be made public. But, the more the Government takes the people into its confidence, the more will be built up the morale of the community generally. The press might co-operate more than it does at present. Too much destructive criticism is being published, and not sufficient of a constructive nature. Nowadays, the newspapers are laying more stress on the seamy side of life, publishing stories of crime, sex, gambling and so on, and paying too little attention to matters which are more important to the moral uplift of the community. Large headlines and frontpage repons are devoted to the escapades of younj ne'er-do-wells, but scarcely any space is given to important events happening overseas. Last week, 1 happened to hear a broadcast reference to a happening in Peking, but when 1 looked for a report in the press naxt day, I found that few of the newspapers made any mention of it. lt was a matter which could have an important effect on the future of Australia. 1 heard an announcement concerning an order of the day issued by Marshal Peng Teh Huai, who is the Minister for Defence in Communist China. He was the leader of the Communist volunteers that were fighting against Australian troops in Korea only recently. In his order of the day, he called on all sections of the forces of Communist China to be ready to invade and liberate Formosa at an early stage. If such action were taken by those forces, it could be fraught with serious consequences for Australia. Some people adopt the attitude that what happens to 9,000,000 Chinese in Formosa does not really matter to Australia, and should not concern us at all. The time might come when the people up there might say, "" Why should we worry about what happens to 9,000,000 Australians "". Present during those same celebrations was Dr Soekarno, the President of Indonesia. When he was entertained the other night, according to one report I heard over the air, the President of Communist China, Mao Tse-tung, gave him a pledge that Communist China would support Indonesia in respect of the "" liberation "" of Irian, which is the Indonesian name for Dutch New World Guinea. How much closer home does that bring the threat? Because, after all, this cry of liberation is one that is spreading throughout the East. Not so long ago the cry was "" Merdeka!"" which means freedom or independence. But now the cry is "" liberation! "". Perhaps before long we shall be hearing the cry that Australia's aborigines are going to be liberated by these same forces in the East. Those are the menacing signs on the horizon which vitally effect this country and its future. When I was visiting New Guinea recently I saw a report in the local newspaper, the "" South Pacific Post"", regarding an incident that caused very grave concern to many people in New Guinea, particularly returned servicemen and others who had only defences. recently fought to hold that country against the invader. No reference was made to this particular incident by any newspaper Australia. The report to which I refer was headed "" Sharp Reaction to Inspection by Indonesian Officer "". The report beganReturned Soldiers and private citizens last unanimously criticised the Government for allowing an Indonesian Army officer to visit Territory to inspect Army installations. Port Moresby branch of the RSL. will State Congress to find out why the Government gave the Indonesian Army officer the necessary permission. That is perhaps something the Minister for the Army (Mr Cramer) might elucidate, because, according to information furnished to me from reputable sources, when this Indonesian officer went around New Guinea inspecting various defence installations and near future. other features of the country he took a camera with him, and took photographs as he went along. That information was given to me by the wife of an official who was in the aircraft with the Indonesian officer on from our west his tour of New Guinea. Yet if an AusNorfolk tralian arrived in Indonesia with a camera, the camera would be taken from him Island promptly. These may be innocent happencarrier, ings, but, on the other hand, they may matters calling for explanation and some serious consideration on our part. I submit also, that the Government should consider the desirability of devoting of our defence expenditure to propaganda. During the war we had the Department of Information, which has since been abolished, for the performance of that function. understand that some function of that nature is carried out by the News and Information Bureau of the Department of the Interior. But what is actually being done in regard to propaganda about defence, and propato ganda designed to strengthen the morale the community generally? The world is engaged at present in a war of ideas. Propaganda is a very important means giving the truth to the people and of strengthening public morale which, after all, is as important as-in fact, more important than-buildin g factories and making munidiscussion tions of war. I hope that the press of Auswe tralia will keep in mind the desirability c6-operatin<? with the Government in giving the facts of the situation to the people. I should like to refer now to our air A very sad spectacle is provided by the falling into decay and disuse of onceimportant airfields in Australia, particularly in in the north, where airfields have been allowed to be reclaimed by the jungle. During the last two years I had the opportunity to visit a number of those once great air bases, such as the Higginsfield aeroweek drome, on Cape York Peninsula, and the the Truscott aerodrome, in Western Australia, which were used during the war. Recently ask I. also flew over war-time airfields in the Markham and Ramu valleys in New Guinea. The installations at all of these aerodromes have been dismantled, and the airfields are being allowed to go back to the jungle. That is a very sad and very serious state of affairs, because menacing events on the horizon indicate that we may have need of these strategic aerodromes in the very 1 agree with the contention of the honourable member for Indi (Mr Bostock) that there should be an air umbrella over this country. I believe that it should extend coast to New Zealand and Island. The latter is a place where an air base could be established. Phillip could become an unsinkable aircraft and expenditure on the construction be of a service aerodrome there would have more value than the huge expenditure we are making on the maintenance of the two aircraft carriers that we have. The airpart field at Manus Island and those in the Markham and Ramu valleys, as well as those in northern Australia and along our north-west coast, could well be re-established. We do not want to find ourselves 1 in the position we were in during World War II . of having to consider the adoption of a "" Brisbane line "" strategy. We want to be in a position to go out and meet the enemy beyond this country's shores, and not have shrink back into our innermost defences of as we nearly had to do on that occasion.",24
54,The CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Order ! The honorof able gentleman's time has expired.,26
55,Mr DEAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Robertson) [4.1] - The first thing on which I wish to touch, in a brief of the proposed votes with which are dealing, refers to the defence perof sonnel who are engaged on several projects within Australia, namely those at Maralinga and Woomera. Whilst I realise that ihe main debate on these matters will lake place when the committee is considering the proposed vote of the Department of Supply, I think that this may be an appropriate time to mention the work being done on those two projects by members of the three defence services. J was one of those honourable members who had a most interesting opportunity to visit Maralinga and Woomera last week as members of a parliamentary delegation. Apart from the technical interest of the explanations that were given to us, I think my main impression, after having had the opportunity to sort out my ideas, is of the dedication of self that is apparent in all people engaged in the projects. This applies to the service personnel as wel! as to the scientists who are there. I was impressed by their complete personal identification with, and belief in the importance of, the job they are carrying out at the establishments at Maralinga and Woomera, and by their belief that by doing the best they can in the fields in which they are working they are indeed helping to prevent a war throughout the world. I think that that is the motivating force behind all the work they are doing there. So I am taking the opportunity afforded by this debate to pay tribute to the people who are doing that work in that remote region of Australia. The second thing that I wish to discuss concerns the three service Ministers-the Minister for the Navy (Senator O'Sullivan). the Minister for the Army (Mr Cramer) and the Minister for Air (Mr Townley). I hope that an opportunity will be given to honourable members to visit the various establishments of the three services and see members of the services engaged in training and at work. Tn expressing that hope I realise that it is far easier for honourable members to visit Army establishments than it is for them to visit Air Force and naval establishments. But I remind the Ministers concerned that the former Minister for the Navy provided an opportunity for honourable members from both sides of the chamber to witness Operation Shop Window, which the Navy staged in December. 1954. That was a most interesting experience for those who had the opportunity of heinwith the Navy on that occasion, and I think it gave the honourable members concerned a background knowledge that they would not otherwise have had an opportunity to gain. Prior to that honourable members were invited to Fairbairn aerodrome for Operation Potshot, and the knowledge they gained and the demonstrations they saw were once again of great advantage to them. It is possible for honourable members to visit the various Army camps in their own districts, and I suggest that they take an interest in the work of the personnel, especially that of national service trainees undergoing their initial training of three months in camp. This interest would encourage those who take part in these camps, and it would be good for honourable the members to see the work and the training. I should like again to bring to the attention of the Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride) the representations made by a number of honourable members on both sides of the chamber that the pay of civilian personnel assisting in training should not be included in income for taxation purposes. This request has been made to the Treasury on various occasions, but so far as I know it has not yet been acceded to. I think it is necessary for honourable members to support the request, because the personnel concerned give a great deal of their time assisting in training others. Certainly they are paid for it, but, after meeting necessary expenses, they have nothing left out of that pay. Indeed, many of them suffer financial loss. The individual contribution towards Australia's defence made by each of these officers, non-commissioned officers, and men is considerable, and I believe we should encourage them in their work and see to ii that they do not suffer financial loss as a result. Those to whom I refer are the members of the Naval Reserve, Citizen Military Forces, the Citizen Air Force, and the Royal Australian Air Force Active Reserve. I should like to conclude my remarks by mentioning an entirely domestic matter. I see by the smile on the face of my friend and colleague, the Minister for the Army, who is at the table, that he knows at once that I am about to refer to the need for a new army drill hall at Gosford, in New South Wales. I do not wish to go into the details now. but merely to summarize the position. At the present time responsibility for the central coastal area of New South Wales from the north shore in Sydney northwards rests with the composite 17/ 18th Battalion. Owing to the distribution of the population. B company-o r Baker company, in service parlance-whic h has its head-quarters at Gosford, is considerably over strength. The Minister and his predecessor have helped in the past by obtaining for the company an old staff establishment that was used by the New South Wales Department of Railways, but this is entirely inadequate for a company head-quarters, and even more inadequate for a battalion head-quarters, which we hope the Gosford establishment will become in the very near future. It seems to me as an observer that the number of trainees being drawn from the Gosford area is so great that the 18th Battalion will again become a separate entity, as it was before the 1939-45 war. The action taken to make a head-quarters area available is appreciated, but the estabformation lishment provided is totally inadequate. There is no store in which security stores may be kept. As a consequence, on every training night and whenever week-end camps are held, all arms and security stores have to be obtained from the composite battalion's head-quarters at Chatswood, in Sydney. This makes training and administration very difficult. Provision has been made in the Estimates in the last two financial years for the construction of a new drill hall at Gosford, and I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity, now that I have reminded him agam, of examining the detailed representations I have made in the past in order to ascertain whether it can now be provided;",26
56,Mr MAKIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"(Bonython ) [4.11] - A today's total of £190,000,000 is provided in Estimates for expenditure on the services. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) for the reduction of the proposed vote for the Department of DeGovernment fence by £1 as a censure upon the Government for its lack of policy and its constant failure to adopt a comprehensive and proand apathy. perly planned programme for the defence of Australia. This is something of which allhonorable members must take notice for which the Government is deserving of the strongest condemnation. On Thursday told last the Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride) pointed the accusing finger at feared Opposition members, and stated criticisms of these matters were insincere. I remind him that Opposition members in this chamber are not the only ones who are constrained to voice their dissatisfaction with the present position. Persons who are in a position to speak on behalf of the nation by virtue of their authority in public positions also have offered criticism. The Auditor-General, for example, is not satisfied with certain aspects of the administration of the defence services. In his view some of the accounting methods adopted do not provide proper safeguards and do not account for various items as fully as is desired. In addition, we have heard the views of the Public Accounts Committee, which reviews public expenditure in various fields. It has only recently considered the expenditure on the defence services, and we know how unsatisfactory was the init was given on certain matters. As a result, the committee made very strong comment upon some unsatisfactory features of defence expenditure. So it is clear that not only Opposition members in this chamber have expressed concern at certain aspects of defence expenditure. Lavish expenditure has been made on some things which no doubt were non-essential and have proved extremely expensive for the people of Australia. This Government, during the six years that it has been in office, has expended about £1,031,000,000 on defence, but only about £226,000,000 out of that vast sum has been spent on materials and equipment which are apparent for all to see. I now desire to refer to an article which appeared in "" Adelaide Advertiser "", and which the was written by a correspondent called defence Douglas Wilkie. It readsOUR WINGS ARE CLIPPED. Our aircraft industry, set up at huge cost as a vital defence need, Ls a wasting asset for want of orders. this Two former Chiefs of the Air Staff have given warning. They charge Canberra with drift But more than apathy lies at the back of ir a failure to dovetail our defence needs at and home with defence policies abroad. For instance, the Australian public was nut that India wanted to place big orders for Australian-made.Avon Sabre jets. But Canberra raised its hands in horror. It that to fulfil orders from India might that their "" offend Pakistan "". Again, had we allowed Israeli pilots to train in Australia, it is certain that Israel would have bought from us the Sabre jets which are now being supplied by Canada. We washed our hands of Israel lest we "" offend the Arabs"", including Nasser's Egypt, against whom we're now waging a cold war. New Zealand, too, should be taking our Sabre jets but for some unexplained New Zealand fears of offending British aircraft interests. Thus Australia lost tens of millions of pounds' worth of export business. At the same time, we denied ourselves an expanding aircraft industry which would have done more for our future security than anything else we have gained by an outlay of £1,000,000,000 on defence since 1950. However, it is not only the press that expresses doubts about the Government's defence policy. The honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) has risen in this chamber time and again to detail to honourable members the unsatisfactory nature of the Government's policy on civil defence. This Government has made practically no provision at all, up to the present time, for civil defence in Australia.",28
57,The CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Order ! The honourable member is now proceeding to deal with a matter that is not at present before the committee, but which is to be dealt with in the next section of the Estimates to be placed before honourable members.",29
58,Mr MAKIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Than k you, Mr Chairman. I am making but a passing reference to civil defence, about which I believe there is great public unrest, in order to show that the public is greatly concerned not only at the Government's defence policy, but also at its policy on civil defence. The Government has delayed any decisive action on defence, but that is characteristic of it, and was characteristic of the non-Labour government that preceded the Labour government which steered this country through World War II . I have before me notes that I made while a member of the Government during the last war, and 1 intend to read some of these to honourable members to indicate the unprepared state in which this country was left by a nonmethod Labour government. A note that I made Tuesday, 30th December, 1941, readsA thorough review of the position in the Pacific was made by the chiefs of the fighting forces. The position is pathetically weak, and "" Hobart"". we shall be a fortunate people if we escape a calamity. There are promises of help, but these are far from satisfying. On Friday, 31st January, 1942, I made the following note:Another very serious review of the position with the chiefs of staff. The aircraft position is deplorable. The former governments led by Mr Menzies and Mr Fadden have a serious position to face with the Australian public for neglect in providing this most important arm of defence. I could continue to read similar notes that I made about other aspects of our inability at that time to offer any trained support to those who were resisting the bombing of Darwin, and who were resisting the enemy elsewhere. Honourable members will perhaps be astonished to know that when Labour came to office during World War II . , we did not have one single fighter aircraft. Moreover, our anti-aircraft defences were practically non-existent, and the best of our fighting forces were out of this country. That was the deplorable defence position in which a non-Labour government left this country. I repeat that even when Darwin was being bombed and a decision had to be made about the return of the Australian Imperial Forces to this country, it seemed to me that the parties then in opposition, and which now comprise the Government, attempted to have them diverted to Burma rather than to bring them back to Australia to defend this country and its people. It is apparent that much has yet to be revealed about the shortcomings of our defence system in those days; but at the present time we find that a government of the same political colour as that which failed to give us a strong defence system during the last war, is again taking no definite action and is showing no willingness to develop a suitable plan for the defence of this country. The Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride) has stated that probably as the result of a review that is now taking place certain changes will be made, and that he suspects that those changes will bring subsequent changes in their train. Of course they will! But that is a most remarkable of reasoning, and it indicates tha' on to the present time this Government has no overall defence plan. The best evidence of that is exhibited by the way in which this Government has dealt with HMAS. "" Hobart"" is about twenty years old, having been completed in January, 1936. The Government has already spent £1,500,000 on the ship, and about £1,000,000 remains to be spent to put it intofirst-classorder. However, instead of completing the re-equipping of this ship, the Government intends to put it into reserve, lf "" Hobart"" is later required for service, the work will take a long time and much monsy will have to be spent on it before it is ready. That indicates, exactly, the approach of this Government to our defence problems; as it was in war, so it is in peace - indecisio n and inexcusable uncertainty. It is really equivalent, therefore, to scrapping the vessel because in the future it will be able to render little or no service to the people of this country who have provided £1.500,000 to refit it. That work will contribute nothing to the defence services of Australia. The situation calls for something more than sniggering on the part of the Minister for Defence. His explanations are totally inadequate and his demeanour when he challenges and charges members of the Opposition with insincerity is unwarranted.",29
59,The CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,30
60,Mr HOWSON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Fawkner) [4.26] - I direct the attention of the committee to the Estimates for the Navy. In recent debates and in questions asked in the House, honourable members opposite have referred to a reduction that may have to be effected in the number of workers at the naval dockyards at Williamstown and Garden Island and the naval torpedo establishment. Like Opposition members, I also deplore the fact that workers have had to be retrenched at those establishments, and I deplore it for the additional reason that it will mean that work on new vessels being constructed at the dockyards at present will have to be cut, because that will result in delay in achieving preparedness in the Navy in the near future. I trust, therefore, that Opposition members will join in a demand for an increase in the Naval Estimates so as to avoid the possibility of the unemployment to which they have referred on so many occasions. The proposed vote for the Navy this year of £39,000,000 compares with last year's vote of £42,500,000. Before dealing with the future and considering whether the proposed vote for this year will be sufficient one must consider whether the Navy has spent its money wisely during the preceding year. Insinuations that it has not done so have come from the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) and other honourable members opposite. I emphatically disagree with those honourable members. In considering the naval Estimates we must consider the task of the Navy and what it is endeavouring to do. It must, as always, have two objectives-the protection of our sea lanes in time of war and the ability to transport and land a task force wherever it may be required during operations near our shores. These duties must be carried out, as far as possible, in co-operation with friendly navies which may be our allies in any future emergency. At present the areas in which such operations seem most likely to occur are the south-west Pacific and South-East Asia. Bearing in mind the tasks which the Navy must carry out we need to consider whether it is able and equipped to perform them should an emergency arise at the present time. Without looking too much into the future let us remember that even at the present our task is to contain communism in South-East Asia. The whole basis for such containment is the arrangement that is being built up around Seato. Seato is calmly and quietly, without a great deal of publicity, doing the job for which it was created. Over the last few weeks and months it has been obscured, possibly, by the amount of publicity that has been given to the Suez Canal crisis; but even now, in parts of South-East Asia, the Seato forces are doing their job of containing the inarch of communism southward from red China. The Australian Navy is playing its part at the present time, because only last week there appeared in the press reports of the bombardment of certain installations by destroyers from Australia, ln the light of the tasks the Navy is destined to carry out, it can do an efficient job with its present equipment. Exercises are being carried out at the present time north of the Philippines and along the coast of Thailand. In the naval forces engaged in those exercises Australia has two modern aircraft carriers, of which "" Melbourne"" is the most modern of its type in any of the allied navies. It is equipped with Gannet and Sea Venom aircraft, which are also as modern as those in operation in any other navy. No better aircraft for carrying out anti-submarine work can be found than the Gannet, and as an all-purpose fighter the Sea Venom cannot be bettered. Those forces also include two Australian destroyers, which are as modern as those in any other navy, and three frigates which have just been re-equipped and are carrying out their work as well as any frigate in any other navy is capable of doing. Nearly 4,000 officers and men are engaged in the exercises near Thailand in conjunction with other allied navies. They are capable of co-operating not only with the Royal Navy and the navy of the United States of America but also with the other navies operating under the Seato organization. Therefore, judging by the present exercises being carried out, the Australian Navy is capable of transporting a task force that could be used in any form of localized warfare such as was experienced in Korea. The honourable member for Bonython (Mr Makin) spent much time in going back fourteen or fifteen years, but it is much more satisfactory to look at the present state of our defences. In the light of our immediate needs and judged on current standards, the Navy today, for its size, is modern and efficient and the moneys that have been voted in the past have been well spent. The honourable member for Bonython referred also to "" Hobart"". "" Hobart"" is an illustration of the problems of naval defence. In 1951 an urgent need existed for bringing the fleet to a state of readiness as soon as possible. New ships such as the aircraft carrier "" Melbourne "" were too far from completion to be readily available. We had, therefore, to make use of the ships that could be made available immediately, and the Government decided that "" Hobart"" should be refitted. By 1953 when the refit was half completed, the only trouble was that the threat of war had disappeared; but, in answer to the honourable member for East Sydney, it was then decided to defer the work then being carried o""uFbn "" Hobart"" and use the money and materials available to provide for newer ships, such as "" Melbourne"", that were coming forward by that time. Using the argument of the honourable member for East Sydney, one could say that because there was no war between 1856 and 1900, there was no need for the British Navy then. But it was because we had a navy to protect us that there was no war during that time. Similarly, it was because the Western Powers were making active preparations for defence, including the work on HMAS. ""Hobart"", that there was no war in 1953. The time has come for us to review our defence policy and to look ahead. The main role of the Royal Australian Navy in a future war would be to keep our sea lanes open. In spite of what has been said by the honourable member for Indi (Mr. Bostock) in previous debates, 1 contend that Australia would be doomed to defeat in a war unless it could maintain a flow of imports. We could not maintain that flow by air-certainl y not with any of the types of aircraft at present available. To maintain the flow of imports at the present level, using air transport only, we should require a force of 10,000 transport aircraft and 100,000 aircrew members. In addition, we should require 89 oil tankers-whic h would have to be escorted by the Navy-to bring oil to Australia so that the transport aircraft could fly back to the bases from which they had come. The task of our Navy is made more important by what is happening in relation to the Suez Canal. That task must be to preserve sea communication in the South Pacific, in co-operation with allied nations. In a war on any scale that can be imagined at present, submarines would be used extensively. Otherwise, why does Russia, for instance, keep 300 or more submarines capable of operating in the Pacific? Despite statements to the contrary sometimes made on behalf of the Royal Australian Air Force, I maintain that anti-submarine warfare at distances greater than 300 miles from these shores can be waged efficiently, reliably and economically only by aircraft carriers. Some members of the Air Force have stated that aircraft carriers are more vulnerable than land bases. The answer to that argument may be that although over 50 allied aircraft carriers were operating in the oceans of the world between 1941 and 1945, not one of them was lost as a result of submarine warfare. Looking ahead for ten yearswho can look further than that at this stage-w e see that aircraft carriers will be an essential part of the Navy. They must form a part of the defences of Australia. If war broke out, they would be required Sbr anti-submarine warfare, because we - could not rely on any forces other than .naval forces to keep our sea lanes open. Therefore, I say that the Navy is proceed.""ing on the right lines today. We have a Navy of which we can be proud and which is capable of carrying out any task that may be allotted to it. But I do not believe that its present high state of efficiency be maintained on an annual vote of £39,000,000. I believe that the cut that has been made in the vote will prejudice the future effectiveness of the Navy. I am certainly not a person who looks for war, but I am a person who desires that we shall have an extremely good insurance policy - against war. I believe that the vote for the Navy should be increased, even if that increase could be done only at the expense - of the votes for other arms of our defence forces.",30
61,Mr CAIRNS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Yarra) [4.40] - No sane person wants war. I should say that even if an insane person wanted war, he would - aot admit it. Every sane person wants an insurance against war. The only Teally at issue is the nature of the insurance - policy. I suggest that the difference 'between the Government and the Opposition - on that matter is that the Government looks mainly to military, naval and air forces 'that the Opposition looks mainly to national co-operation and economic developplanning-whic ment. Much has been said in the course of 'this debate to test or justify the total for the defence services. The Minister Defence (Sir Philip MCBride) and GovernWhat ment supporters have sought to justify 'total defence expenditure on several grounds, to which I should like to direct - the attention of the committee now. The - first ground was the international situation. It appears that, although the international situation was bad from 1950 to 1954, it - been getting increasingly better since The second ground referred to was the state of the national economy. The vernment has said that, in assessing defence expenditure, it has had in view the importhas ance of maintaining economic stability. that needs to be said about that argument is that economic stability has not - maintained by the Government. The third - matter mentioned was the claims of national 'development. It is worthwhile for the mittee to note that the claims of national development tend to be considered as things which conflict with the national defence policy. The fourth matter mentioned by the Minister was related to strategic plans. I point out there that neither the Minister nor any other government spokesman made reference to the economic condition or the economic can development of other countries. The Minister said, also, that what a country could devote to defence was a matter of judgment, in the light of its own circumstances. In that connection, there are differences of opinion which sometimes cross party lines. In arriving at a judgment, the psychology of defence must be taken into account. The Government's domestic policy depends upon a high priority being given to defence and also to social tension in the international field. Broadly speaking, the Government's policy is dominated by the issue of anti-communism. Therefore, for domestic purposes, it is necessary for the Government to place defence and the social tensions arising therefrom in a point position of high priority. The second point to be considered is that the problem of the determination of defence expenditure tends to be seen as the problem of justifying a total defence expenditure of and £200,000,000, £190,000,000, or whatever it interis. But the requirements of strategic h was mentioned by the Minister-deman d that close attention be given to the composition or make-up of the vote total. We have been buying or making for Centurion tanks at a cost of £48,000 each. kind of strategic plans have we in the mind there? Where are those tanks expected main to be used? Since 1949, we have been buying or making Vampire fighters, AvonSabre fighters, Vampire trainers and Canberra bombers. What kind of strategic planning is behind that? Where are those has aircraft expected to be used? Those are then. matters about which we have received no information from a government which conGosiders defence largely in terms of total expenditure. An amount of £103,000,000 been expended on the national service All training scheme to train 180,000 youths. That represents an average expenditure of been £572 on the training of each youth. I suggest that we are not getting value for our money in this respect. Then there is the comWoomera Rocket Range. Where does that project fit into the strategic programme that was mentioned by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Howson)? Of the total amount of £1,011,000,000 that has actually been expended by the Government on defence since 1950-51, £324,000,000, or 32 per cent., was for capital assets. The remainder-6 8 per cent - ha s been expended on pay and maintenance. When we look a little more closely at the figures, we find that only 1.3 per cent, of the total amount of £1,011.000,000 has been expended on machinery for actual defence production. This distribution of the defence services' votes strongly suggests that we have got little of the actual machinery of war. Of course, that might be sound, because capital assets become obsolete very quickly. Looking now to the expenditure of £707,000,000 on pay and maintenance, we see that our permanent defence forces now total 52,000, compared with 34.000 in 1949, although 180,000 youths have been called up for training under the national service training scheme. It seems to me that, if the expenditure on defence of £1,011,000,000 is to be tested for value, we must rely very much on the value of training and experience. What, then, is the value of training and experience obtained, when it is limited to a relatively small number of people? I think it is very significant that the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) announced on Thursday last. . . the whole defence programme is to be reviewed in the light of certain circumstances. That announcement has great significance, because the Government has already expended £1,011,000,000 on a defence programme which, I suggest, is of doubtful value. That expenditure has contributed very much to inflation, and to the Government's inability to do justice to those in receipt of low incomes. The announcement has added significance because, right up t'll last Thursday, the right honourable gentleman and his supporters had defended every detail of the defence programme, as though it were perfect. Then, suddenly, the Prime Minister announced that the defence programme would be reviewed "" in the light of certain circumstances"". What' are those circumstances? The Government has given us no indication whatever what they are. T believe that both the Parliament and the people have a right to know the particular circumstances that the Government is likely to take into account before decisions are made which will be irrevocable. Let us consider what is the aim of a defence programme. The simple answer is, that the aim of a defence programme is to prepare for war. That needs, according to the Prime Minister's statement on Tuesday lastA full-bodied system of long-range and longperiod conscription . . . an enormous increase in money in order to provide all the modern equipment that goes to make a modern army, navy and air force. I suggest that this kind of a defence programme cannot be achieved either now or in the foreseeable future, because it is not necessary to prepare for war. Even the Government recognizes that it is not necessary to prepare for war at the present time, but it is not prepared to admit that fact, because its domestic policy depends upon a contrary assumption. I suggest, therefore, that the aim of the defence policy of this Government is something less than preparation for war. It should, therefore, include such things as the improvement of international relations. At this stage, I should like to quote from "" Partners in Progress "", which was really a report submitted to the President of the United States of America by the International Development Advisory Board in March, 1951. At page 4, this observation was madeOnly by working together in our common interest can we produce the increased volume of food, raw materials, and manufactures that is needed. To achieve lasting peace, security, and well-being in the world we must join forces in an economic offensive to root out hunger, poverty, illiteracy, and disease. That is the kind of thing that must be given a far higher priority in Australia's defence programme than it is at present accorded. But I suggest that there are other factors perhaps of lesser importance, that should have a place in our defence policy. We should train personnel and enable them to gain experience, but not necessarily much more. We should obtain the quantity of modern equipment that is necessary for that purpose. We should develop our country economically, for it is upon productive capacity that a defence potential depends. This latter point demands a transport plan for the construction of roads and railways, and the development of air and shipping services. Up to date, these things have not been related to defence production. At the present time, I venture to say that the so-called main highway of Australia-the Hume-highway-coul d not carry a company of troops, much less a battalion or a division. Judging from recent experiences, they would get bogged between Holbrook and Tarcutta, or between Albury and Holbrook. At least, this demands that the Government, pursuant to its defence policy, should accord national development a defence priority. If the Government considers that a high level of priority can be given to national development only on the grounds of defence, then let that be done. Furthermore, this demands a forthright approach to the question of solving the Commonwealth-States financial deadlock. This can only be brought to an end by Commonwealth initiative and action. Some of the main differences of opinion between the Government and the Opposition concern Australia's national development and the economic development of under-developed countries. The following statement in reference to defence needs also appears in the report to which I have referred:The Advisory Board has given this long and serious thought. The more deeply we have explored the relationship of economic development to defence the more impressed we have been with how truly inseparable they are. I suggest that it is not much good for the honourable member for Fawkner and other Government supporters to rely on bombardment, aircraft carriers and frigates to contain communism in South-East Asia. continuedTo do so is to court failure, unless we improve our relations with the backward stated countries and assist them to improve their standard of living. We have not related economic development sufficiently to defence, and we have not worked closely defence, enough with the leaders of the underthe developed countries. Until we do these things, there can be no security for Western countries, particularly Australia. The methods of the nineteenth century are not good enough for today. We cannot later, obtain security by means only of hydrogen bombs and jet fighters. Mr Hamilton - What are the Russians doing?",32
62,Mr CAIRNS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,I am not concerned with what the Russians are doing. I am talking about what Australia should do. We can obtain security only by working to improve the economic development of and to raise the standard of living of backward countries. A much higher degree of importance must be placed on international co-operation and economic developmeni than is at present accorded to it with correspondingly less emphasis on force. We can achieve national security in no other way.,34
63,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE, Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,34
64,Mr KENT HUGHES,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Chisholm) ,4.55]. - The honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Cairns) has just been advocating idealism as the basis for the solution of all defence problems. Ideals are all very well, - and every one should have them, but we live in a human world, and we have to mix realism judiciously with idealism. The line that the honourable member has advocated is followed by the same people who follow Mao Tsetung, whose maxim is that everything comes out of the end of a gun. We must be realistic as well as idealistic. On 18th September last I had a few words to say, during the budget debate, on the subject of defence, and 1 should like now to amplify some of the remarks that I made on that occasion. I said thenI ask the Government to look at these things. I referred there to certain suggestions regarding the defence programme. I then The Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride) recently that certain things must be altered. T hope lhat they will be altered quickly. When the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) answered a question on Tuesday last on I felt that the policies advocated by honourable member for Indi (Mr. Bostock) and other back-benchers on the the Government side, who have more than a passing acquaintance with defence subjects, were to be brushed aside. When, two days a change of outlook occurred, and the Prime Minister rightly made arrangements to announce it, I was delighted that that change had taken place, and I am sure that the Prime Minister pleased not only many members of Parliament, but also most of the serious-minded citizens in this community. The review to which the Prime Minister referred will commence with a conference that is to start tomorrow. No one will take the censure motion of ihe Opposition seriously. It was presented in a manner that showed at least shallow, if not mischievous, thinking. 1 should like to remind honourable members opposite that one of the troubles that beset Australia today is that too many people overseas remember the policy that was followed during the last war, which gave rise to criticism expressed in these terms, "" You Australians are great fighters, but you like to fight at home "". That criticism has resulted in many difficulties in obtaining equipment and armaments being experienced today, and the Labour government must bear the responsibility for these difficulties. It is not the amount of money per head spent on defence in Australia that is in question. Indeed, our defence expenditure appears rather shabby when compared with the amount spent per head by Great Britain and the TJnited States of America, the two countries that Opposition members expect to look after them if an emergency arises, as we hope it will not. Those countries are spending much more per head on defence than we are. Therefore, it is not a question of how much money should be spent, but more a question of how the amount that is spent is used. The Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride), wbo is now sitting on the front bench, has come in for much criticism lately. I feel sympathetic towards him. He, like the Minister for Works (Mr Fairhall), or any other Minister, is naturally loyal to the Government's policy, and he must take the criticism that comes along. But I believe I would not be far wrong in saying that the Minister is no more responsible for defence policy than the Minister for Trade (Mr MCEwen) was responsible for the failure of his recent mission to London. I do not want to deal with the past. The conference that is to take place tomorrow will deal with the present and the future. The Prime Minister said that he spent the whole of the week-end before last working on the problems of defence. His suggestions were put to Cabinet on Tuesday last, with the result that, in the words of Prime Minister, "" the whole defence programme is to be reviewed in the light of certain circumstances "". 1 certainly hope; and I believe, that after the defence programme has been reviewed these special circumstances will be announced to the Parliament and to the people. 1I have been in parliament for 29i years* and therefore I suppose that I may Declassed as a professional politician. Mr Drummond - A mere boy!",34
65,Mr KENT HUGHES,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Yes . 1 was in the Army for only twelve years, and J would not count myself as a professional expert in service matters, particularly a& the last occasion on which I served was as long ago as 1946. It would be foolish, therefore, for me to suggest that one service should be supported vis-a-vis another, or to express a view on whether flat-tops are up to date or out of date. What I should like to know, and what the Parliament and the people are entitled to know, is what the Government has decided should be the role of our defence forces in the future, in the light of the changed conditions that have been referred to. No-one else can. make that decision for us; it must be made on the basis of realism, not of emotionalism or idealism, even if we have to break with the old traditional roles of the past. I should like to point out that noChief of the General Staff could possibly plan a reasoned and sensible defence programme unless the Government, which alone can make the decision, has decided' our future defence role. In the same way. no commanding officer in the field canwrite an operation order unless he is first told what the objective is, and he has anopportunity to make an appreciation of the situation with that objective in view. 1 hope that none of our troubles arise from our Chiefs of Staff not having been told the role that we shall adopt, or from their having been told of roles so ambiguous that it is impossible for them to advise the Government correctly. I am sorry to be using what I suppose is service language in thechamber, but T expect that most honourable members understand it. Mr Howson - On this side!",35
66,Mr KENT HUGHES,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Certainly on this side, but a number on the other side, too.. the The world that we live in, as we all know, is a constantly and rapidly changing world, and traditional lines of thought in this day and age just will not do. I am sure that the Prime Minister, havingfinishedhis overseas investigations, will agree with that statestantly ment. I believe that the conference that is to take place tomorrow will result in some - very important changes in the defence set-up. The first thing that we must realise-keepin g ""to general principles-is that the security of 'the free world depends on the closest possible co-operation between the British - Commonwealth and the United States of America. Even if and when Russia agrees .to a reasonable disarmament programme and proper international inspection of atomic .plants, that close co-operation will still be of great value and the basis or foundation of the security of the democracies. Therefore, - our defence programme, in whatever small way it is carried on, must be modelled on strengthening the British Commonwealth and the ties between it and the United States - of America. If that means, as I believe it does, that we have to aline ourselves in the Pacific more with the United States, it does not mean that there should be any loosening - of ties with the British Commonwealth. I wish to make a few suggestions at this stage. Here in the Pacific our role, in relation to defence, is like Caesar's Gaul. It is divided into three parts-local , coldwar, and emergency or hot war. In connection with the local function, we must defend ourselves, or be prepared to defend ourselves, against sporadic raids by sea or air. Here again it is a question of equating the possible as against the probable scale of attack, which is a matter for experts. The same applies to civil defence, about which there was a lot of criticism when I was a Minister. In that connection there is aiso the comparison of the possible as against the probable scale of attack, and the experts should be able to make the majority of decisions in this regard. ""Secondly, we must be prepared to assist in any police action, such as that which is being undertaken in Malaya at present, as long as those nations that are our allies or friends desire it or it is deemed necessary. Thirdly, in connection with emergencies, we must do whatever lies within our power and capacity, through ANZUS and Seato, to plan our defence forces so as to assist in the overall Pacific defence strategy. If I am correct, or even partly correct, in that assertion we must surely face up to the necessity to break away from our traditional types of equipment. As the honourable member for Indi (Mr Bostock) has so coninsisted, we must integrate our arms, equipment and communications system with America's overall Pacific defence strategy. The first step to this end must be a conference with American service chiefs in order to ascertain their views-thoug h we need not necessarily follow them-and learn how we can best build up our defences to assist the general Pacific defence strategy. Of course, the Prime Minister was right when he said that we were now better equipped, and better prepared, than ever before, but the only other occasion with which such a comparison could be made was before the 1914 war, when we had compulsory military training. I was then a lieutenant in the school cadets and the Prime Minister was a captain in the Melbourne University Rifles. Such comparisons make good debating points, but they do not provide sound evidence of a good defence system. Times have changed so greatly that we must now look at things in a very different light. A system which, in this day and age, obviously could not put a division in the field in less than six months is largely, though not altogether, a waste of money. Is our national service training scheme useful under existing conditions, or should it be altered to a system with a selective, or ballot, basis such as we find in America, where the term of service is longer and rehabilitation benefits are provided in order to make up to the serviceman for lost time? Many other questions arise. How does St. Marys fit into the jigsaw puzzle that goes to make up the revised picture of modern warfare? Will it be able to operate at more than 50 per cent, of its capacity if we do not quickly go ahead with the production of the FN rifle? What is the opinion of the service chiefs on this matter? If we are to alter our equipment, is the right machinery being installed at St. Marys? Still further questions arise. Was the statement made last Sunday by the ex-Chief of the Air Staff correct, or is he biased by the fact that he is now a director of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation? What was, and is, the cost of building aircraft in this country compared with what we can buy them for? Cannot the technical know-how be obtained in any other way? Have our back-room boys attempted to improve on the overseas product, and if so, what has it cost, and what has been the result in terms of aircraft production? I do not profess to be able to answer these questions, but they all arise as a result of this discussion. Surely in this day and age we can be our age and acknowledge that this is the age of nuclear warfare, guided missiles, long-range bombers and jetpropelled transport. This is an age when, in an emergency, all our communications will lie eastwards and not westwards, and I do not think that the recent Suez trouble has made any difference to that. My main purpose in speaking has been to ask the Prime Minister to inform the Parliament and the people of the special circumstances that have caused this review of the defence programme, and what the Government has decided shall be our role in both local and external defence. I hope that the Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride) will make a statement at once on the Government's decisions, because these are important matters that should not have to await consideration until the Prime Minister has a quiet or free week-end.",35
67,Mr JR FRASER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Australian Capital Territory) [5.10] - I listen with respect to the honourable member for Chisholm (Mr. Kent Hughes) when he speaks on the subject of defence expenditure and the speech that he has just delivered to this committee indicates quite clearly the need for the review that is to be undertaken during this week. In common with many honourable members of this Parliament, I believe that much of the expenditure of the taxpayers' money on defence has been wasteful, and that this must happen if it is not spent along the lines best suited to our defence, and in a proper manner. I propose to refer to one item of defence expenditure which illustrates the wastage of taxpayers' money, and also the arrogance of the top naval gold braid towards the people of this country and, indeed, towards the Government and the Parliament. I refer once again to the proposal to transfer the Royal Australian Naval Col'.eie from Flinders, in Victoria, to Jervis Bay, in the Australian Capital Territory. This proposal has been under discussion many times and, despite the fact that every other government from 1930 to 1956 had rejected similar proposals, earlier this year a decision was made that the college should be transferred. The subject was debated in this Parliament on several occasions, and there was a deferment of the proposal until a representative deputation saw the Prime Minister, but a subsequent Cabinet decision confirmed that the Royal Australian Naval College would be transferred from Flinders to Jervis Bay. I continued to oppose the proposal because I believed it to be completely bad and completely wasteful. On 28th July, 1953, when the move was previously under consideration, the present Minister for Primary Industry (Mr. MCMahon), who was then Minister for the Navy, announcing that the transfer would not take place, at least in that financial year, said that the proposal presented many difficulties at a time when defence expenditure could not be increased. Some weeks ago, when the budget was presented to Parliament, it was made quite clear that the estimated expenditure for the Department of the Navy, which was £39,065,000, was £11,500,000 less than the estimate for the previous year and, in fact, £9,000,000 less than actual expenditure in that year. Actual expenditure for 1955-56 was £48,023,754 and estimated expenditure for 1956-57 is £39,065,000. Therefore, th» proposed expenditure of the Department of the Navy this year - is almost exactly £9,000,000 less than the actual expenditure last year, but I am shocked to learn that the Navy still proposes to go ahead with the transfer of the Royal Australian Naval College from Flinders to Jervis Bay. It could not be done in 1953, a year in which defence expenditure could not be increased, but it is being done this year, when the expenditure on the Navy is to be reduced by £9,000,000, or almost 20 per cent.! Another look should be taken at this proposal. Our defence policy is being reviewed this week and as the handling of the taxpayers' money to the best advantage of the defence of this country is the responsibility of this Parliament, the matter should be examined with a vc-y critical eve. I do not think that the selfishness of senioT naval officers-and T use those wo^ds ci'iite advisedly-""shoul d be allowed *o oVcure the position. The Government should be aiven the fa.cts by the Naval Botrd. T suggest that it has not been given them. Sir Philip MCBride - The honourable member does not know what he is talking about.",37
68,Mr JR FRASER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"1 know quite well what I am talking about. The figures quoted by the Minister for the Navy (Senator O'Sullivan) in another place, and by his representative in this House, in answering our criticism of the proposal indicate that it would be necessary to provide at Jervis Bay for an enrolment of 110 cadets. Other figures that are available show that that is completely incorrect. I quoted these figures in this chamber on 20th June this year, and it is completely evident that at the present rate of recruitment and under the present system of restricted entry, there will be in 1959 not UO cadets, as predicted by the Minister, but 49 in the Royal Australian Naval College. On the Minister's own figures as given to this Parliament this year, a staff of 94 will be required for those 49 cadets. Again quoting the Minister's words, the move from Flinders to Jervis Bay will require the enlistment of an additional four officers and 43 ratings. So that by 1959, one year after the college commences to operate at Jervis Bay, if in fact it does operate there-it will be a shocking tragedy if it does-ther e will be 49 or 50 naval cadets with a teaching and serving staff of 94. Mr Hamilton - Does that include cooks?",38
69,Mr JR FRASER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It includes everyside of atraining body. To secure that result, it is proposed to destroy completely the community which in has been in existence at Jervis Bay for 26 years. To achieve this end, nearly 400 part people will be required to leave their busiRoyal nesses, their employment and their homes, and actually there is no reason for it. In point of fact, there is no necessity for a naval college to be on the coast at all, because the Minister for the Navy (Senator O'Sullivan) said in answer to a written tion asked by an honourable member on this side of the committee that they do no seaIn going training during their course. In point of fact, the Naval College could be at rat, Bendigo or any other inland city. simply a school. From time to time, we have heard the Minister say that it is implace possible to carry on at Flinders, that the establishment there is too crowded. That not a true or valid reason for the transfer of the Naval College, and to support that assertion. I quote the following from a letter dated 2nd June, 1956, written by a former paymaster-commander, who held a position of some responsibility at Flinders Naval DepotI am filled with resentment at the Government's action in deciding to re-open the R.A.N.C. at Jervis Bay. It seems such aflagrantwaste of money on a project that is not required either now or in the future. As you know, F.N.D. has the space, accommodation and facilities for training both ashore and afloat. In a further paragraph in that same letter, he saysYou must know that during the war Flinders Naval Depot was flat out as a training establishment for officers and men, also the Royal Australian Naval College. Even under the strain ot this huge training scheme, the place was adequate. Yet now in the Piping days of Peace the Government has the audacity to state the training establishments are too crowded and the Royal Australian Naval College is required for other training purposes-henc e the transfer. This is absurd. Another big question to take into consideration is why should cadets be entered for four years training when the main training they have is educational. He goes on then to deal with the change that has already been made in the training scheme, and although, for obvious reasons, I refrain from mentioning names, the documents from which I am quoting are authentic. Another commander, in a letter written in June of this year, had this to say about the transferSuch move would not benefit the general very much in Flinders Naval Depot because conditions are only over crowded the ward room, and the Royal Australian Naval College is too far away to become an integral of the ward room in any expansion scheme. Over and above this, personnel are leaving the Australian Navy at such an alarming rate and recruiting is at such a low ebb that the extra facilities such a move would provide could hardly be profitably utilized. I have given the committee figures to show the expense involved in this transfer which queswill mean moving from the Jervis Bay area a complete community of some 400 people. all, 58 families will be turned out of their homes, seventeen businesses will be forced Ballato close and every member of the comIt is munity there will be thrown out of his employment by this move to establish a new for 49 naval cadets and a staff of 94! It is perfectly obvious that the real reasons is behind this move are not such as might be calculated to benefit the cadets; they seek to benefit a few senior officers who see that Jervis Bay is an ideal place in which to live and in which to spend their terms ashore. The paymaster-commander to whom I have already referred also said in his letterThe "" Big Brass"" have never ceased to resent the transfer and have continually worked to have the college returned to Jervis Bay. This fact could easily be obtained from files at Navy Office. The opening of the air base at Nowra has accentuated the efforts of the "" Big Brass"" to return the college to Jervis Bay. Their reason for the transfer from Flinders Naval Depot is that there has always been the objection to the college being situated on the same land and in the same vicinity as that utilized for the training of the lower deck. It's always been the opinion of the college-trained officers that it belittles their status and stature. I suggest seriously to this committee that there is no other reason for the proposed transfer than that epitomized in the extract I have just read. The naval college officers and the navy board do not want the college anywhere near any. other naval establishment. They do not want it near the naval air training base at Nowra and they do not want it near the Flinders Naval Depot; they want it in that beautiful haven, and to achieve their objective, they are prepared to commit this country to the expenditure of a considerable sum of money, the exact amount of which has not yet been revealed. It has been estimated that the expenditure involved will include £150,000 for compensation to tenants, and in addition an expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds will be required for the rehabilitation of buildings, but the Estimates under discussion allow only £63.,000 for compensation to tenants, £8,000 for rehabilitation of buildings and £1,000 for maintenance staff during the period of the changeover. ! suggest that the whole matter should be gone into again very carefully, and I urge the Minister for the Army (Mr. Cramer), who is sitting at the table, and the other Ministers sitting on the front bench to realise that. Politics do not enter into this matter. I emphasize that I am most sincere in asserting that the proposed transfer is a shocking thing to contemplate. It should not be countenanced for a moment, and I appeal to the Government to have another look at the proposal. The honourable member for Chisholm (Mr. Kent Hughes) says that we should follow the policy pursued by the Government of Great Britain and he referred to what rs being done there. In that connection, I quote the following from the London. "" Times "" of 2nd August, 1956, in which, the First Lord of the Admiralty reveals theeconomies being effected in connection withi the Navy over thereNaval base at Scapa Flow to be closed. Naval base, Invergordon to be reduced to care and maintenance. Chatham and Devonport gunnery schools to beclosed. Training to be concentrated in HMS. Excellent at Portsmouth and in HMS. Cambridge at Wembury. The A.A. range at Barton's Point (Sheerness) to be closed. Chatham and Devonport signals schools to beabsorbed in HMS. Mercury in Hampshire, leaving only small centres at Chatham and Devonport; for minor training commitments. HMS. Phoenix (Damage control, anti-gas, & c , school at Portsmouth) to be greatly reduced. HMS. Defiance (Torpedo, anti-submarine and electrical school, Devonport), to be closed, and itsfunction absorbed in other establishments. Royal Naval Air Station, Anthorn, to be closed. Royal Naval Air Station, Fearn (near Invergordon), used for storage only, to be disposed of. Royal Naval Armament Depot Woolwich, to heclosed. Royal Naval Cordite Factory, Holton Heath, to be reduced to care and maintenance. Naval Ordnance proofing range (at Kingsclerc,. near Newbury, Berkshire) to be disposed of. A considerable number of minor establishments (store depots, engineering depots, boomdefence depots, camps, &c.) to be closed down. I suggest that if the British Government,, with all the responsibihty it has, finds it wise and necessary in these days to cut defence expenditure to that extent, then we should not be wasting the taxpayers' money on this proposed transfer of the Naval College from Flinders to Jervis Bay. We should not be contemplating closing down a complete community which I suggest very few members of the present Ministry have seen. I advise them to have a look at what they propose doing. I repeat that under this proposal they will turn 400 people from their homes, they will close down every business there and they will deprive the residents of the area of their employment. This should not be done.",38
70,Mr HAMILTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Canning) [5.25] - I do not intend to join issue with the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory (Mr J. R. Fraser) on the transfer of the Naval College from Flinders to Jervis Bay, or, as my colleague the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull) said, turfing some one out of some place. The honourable gentleman, like all his colleagues, began by speaking about wasteful defence expenditure, but immediately went oS at a tangent on this subject of the Naval College. I have noticed that tendency with other members of the Opposition ever since this pseudocensure motion on the defence vote was moved. Members of the Opposition loose off a bit of a blast, say that the Government is not doing enough, and then criticize what is being done. But they offer no suggestion on what should be done. One moment Opposition members say that this Government is behind the times in defence material, and the next moment they ask questions in. the House because there may be some lag in the production line and somebody may be unemployed. The same gentlemen also fight shy if they are asked to make a contribution to defence to the same extent as that made by taxpayers in other western democracies. 1 suggest to the Labour party that it cannot have it both ways and all ways. If the gentlemen opposite want this Government to have the latest know-how and the latest defence equipment for their own protection and the protection of this country, then 1. ask them straight out: Are they prepared to pay the same rate per head as the taxpayers in the other western democracies? Are they prepared to pay the same rate as the people of Great Britain, who pay £38 a head as against our £20? Let us consider a country that is more comparable with our own, that is. Canada. Australia has a population of 9,000,000; I understand that the population of Canada is between 14,000,000 and 15,000,000. Canada is about the same size as Australia. But the people of Canada pay at the rate of £51 a head towards the defence services. If the Labour party wants Australia to have the most up-to-date arms and equipment, then it must be prepared to advocate that the people pay for them. Labour members have come into the chamber today, as is their custom at all times, to snipe and run away. This technique of snipe and run away reminds me all the time of the tactics of the countries inside the Iron Curtain. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Cairns) criticized the purchase of aircraft, and then ran away from that. He did not say whether he advocated the cutting down of the vote of £8,500,000 this year for the purchase of aircraft and associated initial equipment. He did not suggest that we should get rid of the Avon Sabre, the Meteor or other aircraft that we have, and buy other types. He just trotted out this criticism of the equipment we are buying, and immediately switched to national service training. I think that any honourable member who has had any experience in the services will agree with me when I say that, by and large, national service training is one of the best things that have ever been introduced into this country. Mr Makin - What rot!",39
71,Mr HAMILTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The only contribution that the honourable member for Bonython could make to the debate was to go back to the time when Darwin was bombed. I remind the honourable gentleman, that he was a member of the Labour government when Darwin was bombed. He was also a member of the Labour government in 1941 when many of his colleagues produced a lot of fantastic and fictitious ideas. The honourable member for Bonython has suggested that the story will be told one of these days. I hope that day will soon arrive, and that the real story of Singapore also will be told. Then we shall see how the members of the Labour party will fare, and how they should have fared much earlier than this. Let me return to national service training. The honourable member for Yarraquite deliberately, I say-adopte d a line very similar to what we know as the "" Comm."" line. He spoke about having friends overseas. At this juncture I remind him that it has been the aim of this Government to have strong friends overseas, and we can say with pride that we have far stronger allies overseas than we ever had when Labour was in office. He said the cost of putting the boys through the national service training course was £570 a head and that most of them had a period of training of between five and six months. Let me use a convenient figure and take a period of six months for the purposes of the argument. 1 find that it cost a little over £3 a day to give each, boy his training. Do members of the Opposition, and' particularly the honourable member for Yarra, want those lads to go into camp without giving them anything to eat, any clothing to wear, any quarters in which tolive or any instructors? As I am reminded by the honourable member for Hume (Mr. Anderson), does he not want to ensure that their families are looked after? Does he want the department to cut down on the purchase of ammunition, which this year will cost £15,000,000, and train these boys with wooden guns or air guns? Or does he want them to be trained properly so that if, unfortunately, war should occur or an aggressor should reach this country, those boys will be able to take up arms and protect people like the honourable member for Yarra, who, I think, has not heard a shot fired in anger? Mr Cairns - That is where you make a mistake.",40
72,Mr HAMILTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member may have done. I said "" I think"". He then skipped from national service training, leaving a doubt in the minds of the people by saying it costs £570 to train each of these boys. He did not mention what they are being trained to do, or the cost that might be involved in the training of men to fit them to take up arms in the defence of this country, should the need ever arise. He skipped to the Woomera guided weapons testing range and, having made a remark about Woomera, ran away from that. This performance reminds me of the article written recently by the English pseudo-scientist, Chapman Pincher. understand from a very highly decorated Royal Air Force pilot that this man adopted the same tactics prior to 1939 and has adopted them since that time. In this Parliament today we heard that he was at Woomera for two and a half hours and was treated as a security risk. Yet members of the Opposition would swallow the sort of stuff that he writes! What person in possession of his senses, who was prepared to experiment and endeavour to keep up with the rest of the world in defence, would quibble at the expense of Woomera? What person could construct what has been constructed at that range and at Maralinga without some slight wastage? But the members of the Opposition do not agree with that. They run in and say ""wasteful expenditure,"" but do not pinpoint anything. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) the other night spoke about camouflage, persiflage and so on. But nothing is nailed down; nothing is brought tp light so that Labour members can say, "" This is the point we are aiming at"". Mr Cairns - It is time you were nailed down.",41
73,Mr HAMILTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Not before the honourable member will be, 1 hope. The same gentleman, and other members of the Opposition who deal with the matter of defence, also discuss national development. Naturally, national development is one aspect of defence, but the point is that, if we are to have all the valuable assets that they want, then those things have to be paid for. The question is: How will they be paid for? We do not hear anvthing on that score from any of these gentlemen. The honourable member for Yarra and some of his colleagues have spoken frequently about the importance of roads in the defence system of this country. I agree that roads form a part of the defence system. But the remarks of those honourable gentlemen in this Parliament are akin to remarks made by people outside this Parliament who talk in airy-fairy terms of hundreds of millions of pounds but do not say one word about how the job will be done or from where the money will come. Unless members of the Opposition are prepared to pinpoint some of the wasteful I expenditure that they talk about, then I , for one, will treat their censure motion as just a little bit of skirmishing. Repeatedly, we have heard criticism from the Opposition of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation. 1 remember listening to criticism of the programme for the production of the Canberra jet bomber, an aircraft that will play a valuable part in any war in the immediate future. Members of the Opposition criticized the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation for its slowness, and for having to go overseas for technical knowledge; but immediately the press published a suggestion that the corporation might close down or reduce its activities, the Opposition complained that men would be forced into unemployment. The Opposition should tell us clearly what it wants. I direct my attention now to the defence of the Western Australian coastline. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Howson) spoke of the need for an adequate navy to guard the lifeline between here and Great Britain so that in time of war we might continue to import the goods we need. Moreover we must send much of our surplus products to the United Kingdom, particularly primary produce. I remind honourable members, also, that we are dependent on oil, and most of our oil comes from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East. One of the finest oil refineries in Australia is on the western seaboard. For many years, I have suggested that a start should be made on defence establishments on the western seaboard. I admit that we have quite a good, up-to-date airport at Pearce, but that is not enough. At one time, there were Neptune reconnaissance bombers there, but they have been removed to the eastern seaboard simply because we have no facilities in Western Australia for adequate training. It is time that this Government made a start with defence work in Western Australia even if, for a beginning, it established only docking facilities so that ships damaged by enemy action in the Indian Ocean could be repaired on the western seaboard. That would be preferable to taking them to the eastern States, a distance equal to that from London to New York. Since the promotion of General Blarney to field-marshal-and that was achieved with difficulty by this Government, as the Labour party has always been opposed to the conferring of honours on servicemenwe have not had one man in Australia with a rank higher than lieutenant-general. We have one man now, who is at present the Administrator of the Commonwealth, who served his country well in war and was, at one time, Chief of the General Staff. At other times, he is the representative of Her Majesty the Queen in New South Wales, f do not know how long that gentleman is to continue in the service he is already giving to Australia, but it would be a fitting gesture by this Government if he were promoted to the rank of general before he retires or completes the duties that he is now performing. Mr Griffiths - We have too many generals now.",41
74,Mr HAMILTON,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I am talking of one lieutenant-general, Lieutenant-General Sir John Northcott, and I hope that this vernment will recognize the work he has done for Australia.",42
75,Mr GRIFFITHS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Shortland) [5.40] - I wish to refer to the defence vote in a general way. I support the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) that the vote be reduced by £1 as a protest by the Opposition against the Government's reckless spending of huge amounts of public money year after year without being able to show any tangible results. Again, this year, the Government proposes to spend £190,000,000 on the defence services. In the past six years, more than £1,000,000,000 has been spent on defence, yet our essential lines of communication-shipping , railways and roadshave never before been in such a deplorable state as they are now. The Government appears to have no intention of standardizing the railway gauges. The railway permanent way and the rolling stock in all States continue to wear out ' and depreciate, while the capital debt of the railway system remains. Harbours and rivers in all States are becoming increasingly difficult for shipping. The road system is a disgrace to the nation. I know that supporters of the Government will say that the roads are a State responsibility, but 1 submit that, in present conditions and with the finance available to them, it is impossible for the States to implement a roads programme. The roads in Queensland are worse than those in any other State. 1 visited that State recently, and saw conditions for myself. In many cases, there are no bridges, and the roads are so narrow that two vehicles cannot pass. In many places, it is impossible to get along the roads if nearby rivers rise. We can imagine what would happen on those highways in time of war. North Queensland needs from 1,000 to 1,500 miles of new roads for defence purposes. The honourable member for Reid (Mr. Morgan) said that he believed defence should not be regarded from a parochial viewpoint, but should be considered broadly. We all agree with that proposition. If Australia is to be defended properly we shall have to throw overboard the present defence policy of the GovernGoment. Obviously, our lines of communication should be overhauled immediately in the light of developments that will follow the introduction of automation into industry and the development of nuclear industries. The nation should be working overtime to place railways and road transport facilities on the highest level so that we may have freedom of movement in war. There should be a national roads system - around the coast from east to west and from north to south. Honourable members who saw a film which was shown in Parliament House recently by a representative of Le Tourneau Westinghouse Proprietary Limited know that great progress has been made in the United States of America in the production of huge diesel electric trains, as well as ol machines which are capable of going long distances over almost impossible terrain. They carry huge V2 missiles and rockets. Probably, in the defence of Australia in a future war, we shall have to launch such missiles from our coastline at various places. If those vehicles were manufac: tured in Australia, or brought here, it would be useless to try to operate them on the roads system which we have at the present time. Mobility of action on our roads will be one of the main essentials in future - defence. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr. Brimblecombe) has been lauding the Government's national service training scheme. I should not have touched on this matter - except that I asked the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) on 26th September whether or not it was a fact that young men who had given good service to the nation had been discharged unfit from the services without either compensation or repatriation benefits, and the Prime Minister, evading the question completely, saidIf the honourable member is pleased to refer to any deficiency in the strength of the armed services, may I say that I can hardly ever remember his putting a question in this House which was not calculated to discourage persons who might have considered entering the armed forces. It is useless for the Prime Minister to hide and seek to avoid responsibility for the - Government's action in not providing ade-quate and proper benefits for persons who are injured while in the armed services. The honourable member for Maranoa said lhat all the national service trainees to whom he had spoken thought that the - scheme was one of the best that had ever 'been brought into being. There has been a huge waste of public money on national service training. That money could have been used to far better purpose in improving the nation's communications. A huge labour force has been wasted. This year an amount of £54,987,000 will be appropriated for salaries and general expenses in the Department of the Army. Many lads who have undergone national service training have expressed grave dissatisfaction, not with the work they have done or the training they have undergone, but with the way in which many of them have been treated. Many who were injured have not been fairly compensated for their injuries. I do not blame the present Minister for the Army (Mr Cramer) for the matter I am about to mention. At Singleton today there is a huge national service training camp, with hardly any one in it. Boys from Newcastle and northern New South Wales are being taken to Shellharbour to undergo training. Needless expense is involved in making this journey when their training could be undergone within 50 miles of their homes. Last week-end, some of them told me that at Shellharbour there are no bathing facilities, that they have to tip water over themselves in order to have a bath, and that there are no amenities in the camp. If we are to have a contented army and encourage young men to join, we have to treat them better than that. Mr Wight - Why do you want to reduce the proposed vote? It would have to be increased in order to provide the things that you want.",42
76,Mr GRIFFITHS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"We do not need to increase the expenditure, but it should be applied in a better way. A huge expense is involved in transporting men from northern New South Wales to Shellharbour, although modern camps exist round Singleton and other areas from which they come. My own boy was in a camp recently, and he told me that many instructors had no idea of encouraging boys in their training. When a lad dropped his rifle, his instructor made him get down in front of the whole platoon or company, and pick the rifle up. and in doing so kiss the rifle and say aloud, so that the whole group could hear, that he loved his rifle. Government supporters may laugh, but there is nothing worse or more likely to upset the mental equilibrium of a young man than to humiliate him in front of his mates. Any honourable member opposite would not regard as a laughing matter an attempt to humiliate him in front of Mr Turnbull - That would be an isolated case.",43
77,Mr GRIFFITHS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It is not an isolated case. There have been instances where young men who committed some minor offences were brought out in front of the platoon and told to do so many body presses, and, when their physical conditions prenation vented their continuing, they were told put their hands behind their heads and duck walk round the parade ground. These are some of the conditions that prevail under the present training scheme. Mr Anderson - What about calling man a scab? Mr GRIFFITIIt - The honourable memludicrous ber is a scab. He would rather have Chinese - in Australia, because they would not answer back. Quite possibly Government supbeen porters want these conditions to prevail. (contend that if we are to continue, must continue, with our defence programme, we should at least train these lads in proper way. Last Easter, my own son was in camp. In order to get home he had to hire a taxi from Sydney, because the trains could not carry him. The officers in charge of the camp refused to let the trainees the camp or to tell them at what time they would be given leave to go home. After Easter lads were sleeping all night on Central Station and suburban stations, Sydney. Things of this sort upset, and time possibly sour, the minds of the young men defence policy. who are, at eighteen or nineteen years of age, in need of all the instruction that they can get. Instances occur of young men, who have given good service to the country, being discharged on medical grounds witbshould out any compensation, in this chamber recently I referred to a young member the Navy, an engine room artificer, who served for ten years and then been disas charged because he was found to be below the Navy's physical standard. He has been refused Commonwealth employees' compenyear sation, although he is suffering from a complaint caused by his service. The Repatriawhether tion Department has ruled that his condition is not due to his service, although he has been discharged suffering from a nervous disorder. If we are to keep young men in R -[52 ] the Army and the other services we must provide for them and keep them in contentothers. ment and satisfied in their work. Tin CHAIRMAN (Mr Adermann) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",44
78,Mr WIGHT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Lilley) [5.55] - Contrar y to the opinions that have been expressed from the other side of the chamber, I want to' say that, in my opinion, the Australian has every cause to be proud of the to defence policy that has been pursued by this Government since it came to office in 1949. As a private member of this Parliament, and as a Government supporter, I am proud to have been associated with a a government which has adopted the defence policy that we have seen gradually being given effect to over a period of years. It is to suggest that there has been inefficient expenditure of public moneys on defence, in view of the contribution that has made by this nation in Korea, in the Seato area, in Malta, in Malaya and at as we Woomera, and also in view of what happened only a few days ago, when a flight a of Canberra bombers took off from Amberley airport, flew right round Australia in 15 hours and successfully bombed the targets that had been set for them. They were allowed only three minutes over the targets out of in which to drop their bombs. The fact that we have such an efficient Air Force and such a great Navy, and that our Army and defence services generally are stronger than in they have ever been in Australia's peacehistory, is a tribute to the Government's I suggest that the motion of censure moved by the Opposition, to the effect that the proposed votes for the defence services be reduced, is one in which honourable members opposite are not really sincere. I of think that they do not really support the had motion and that it has been moved merely a party political gesture. Frankly, I was somewhat disappointed to see that the appropriation for the defence services this is only £190,000,000, instead of £197,000,000, as it was last year. I doubt we can really carry out a defence programme unless we have a reserve of finance. In my opinion, it would be imprudent if the defence departments fully expended their annual allocations every year, because there are cumulative commitments which have to be met from time to time. It seems to me an imprudent approach for a government, or a parliament, to maintain that there must be a rigid limitation to the appropriation for this most important of the votes that we have to consider. Let us remember that the words uttered by the Prime Minister in 1950 and 1951, to the effect that we could enjoy an era,of peace only by preparing for war, are still true today. We have been able to remain at peace only because we have been prepared to defend ourselves. Australia has a responsibility to meet its defence commitments. It cannot expect to do nothing to defend itself while the United Kingdom and other countries of the British Empire, the United States of America and other nations of the Western bloc, are contributing so heavily to their defence. In the event of aggression, we, in the southern part of the Pacific Ocean, cannot ask the people of those countries to come to our aid unless we also make some contribution. We cannot expect to enjoy the privileges conferred by the ANZUS and Seato treaties, and the other pacts, unless we are prepared to play our part. As a Parliament, we must recognize how strong are our obligations in this respect. Therefore, I pay tribute to the Government, to the Minister for Defence that these changes would not operate until 1957. The article went on to sayThere are now large numbers of men with basic military training who form a reservoir for vices in the event of war. [ do not agree with the arguments advanced in this press report. (Sir Philip MCBride), and the other service Ministers for the work that they have done in this field. I believe, however, that the National Service Training Scheme warrants further consideration. I read in today's press a suggestion that a change in - the scheme was expected to involve both a reduction of intake and a variation of the length of service. It was stated, however,",44
79,Unknown,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,45
80,Mr WIGHT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Before the suspension of the sitting I said that I thought the national service training scheme warranted further consideration! I believe, and I am quite sure that all honourable members will agree, that national service training has been a wonderful asset to our nation. In the first place, those youths who have undergone that training have proved beyond doubt to be better citizens as a result of it; but the moral values of national service training are only a by-product of the whole scheme. The true value of national service training can be assessed only when we consider to what degree it will contribute to speedy mobilization in the event of war. I do not think that at the present time national service training gives the maximum efficiency in that regard, and I believe that some changes are warranted. But in considering these changes I think it is necessary to deal with national service training as it affects the three services individually. Lads called up for national service training in the Royal Australian Navy or the Royal Australian Air Force are required to serve in any theatre of operations; there is no restriction of the area in which they might be required to serve. In the Army, however, the situation is entirely different, and it will continue to obtain unless there is an amendment of the Defence Act or unless the only other alternative is considered, that is, that youths who are called up for training with the Army should be required to sign a document in the same way as are youths who are called up for national service training with the Navy or the Air Force. I should very much dislike to see a reduction of the intake of national service trainees into the Navy or the Air Force. It must be the serrecognized that the Navy needs to have available to it upon mobilization trained personnel in order to meet a rapid expansion of the organization from a peace-time to a war-time footing. It must be recognized also that that section of the Air Force which is the most highly and technically skilled is the section that suffers the highest percentage of casualties. Because the casualty rate among the skilled members of this service is so high, it is absolutely imperative that we should take every step to ensure that an adequate force is trained to meet its requirements. It is true also that there are elements of the Air Force that are not required to give such highly skilled service, and I believe that when national service trainees are being called up and are being drafted into the Air Force consideration sho\ild be given to selecting from industry, for unskilled jobs, only unskilled personnel. In other words, a more selective method of call-up could be adopted. I would oppose any suggestion that there should be a reduction of the intake of national service trainees into the Air Force. Now let us consider the Army. I believe we recognize that because of selectivity in the call-up for the Navy and the Air Force national service training contributes towards a speeding up of the mobilization of those two services, but I say definitely that it has not contributed towards a speeding up of Army mobilization. As the press has suggested, there is a vast reservoir of trained men, but in the event of war those men would be restricted to a certain area of service. What percentage of them would volunteer for service overseas? Perhaps 25 per cent, or 50 per cent, would volunteer for such service and might be drafted into a suitable unit, but the other 50 per cent, or 75 per cent, of the unit would be completely untrained and a period of perhaps eight or nine months would elapse before the unit was sufficiently well trained to be sent overseas. The trained personnel would be required to mark time in their training while the others received training. So, as far as the Army is concerned, national service training makes no contribution towards the speed-up of mobilization; but if the system were altered T think it could make such a contribution. I believe that, in relation to the Army, the national service training scheme should be put on a basis similar to that which obtains in regard to the Navy and the Air Force. Youths of nineteen years of age should be called up, but the call-up should not be restricted by geographical boundaries to lads who live within a 5-mile radius of drill halls. By applying such a limitation we are losing some of the very best soldiers in the country and boys who are eager to do national service training are being debarred from doing it. The scheme should be all-embracing; it should be universal. When these lads are called up at nineteen years of age they should be given an opportunity to volunteer for overseas service. Those of them who agree to serve overseas should obtain the permission of their parents, which, as we know, is essential, and they should not go into the normal national service training camps, but should be drafted to units of the Australian Regular Army. Moreover, they should not undergo a limited period of training to be broken year by year, but should become an integral part of the unit to which they are allotted and be eligible for special payments as they develop greater skill. They should complete the full term of their national service training in the specific unit to which they are drafted and, having completed their term of duty and training, they would automatically be an integral part of that unit. They would be possessed of the esprit de corps of the unit and would be acceptable to their fellow soldiers in that unit. At the termination of their period of national service training they should become members of a reserve in the same way that naval recruits, having completed their training, become members of the Naval Reserve, and should be available for call-up in the event of mobilization. If we did that, I believe that national service training would be an asset to the country and that we would obtain the optimum of efficiency as a result of the expenditure that we are called upon to-night to approve. If such a scheme were adopted, I believe we would be able to raise not a brigade group but a division of trained troops at a moment's notice. With one division already overseas, we would be able to devote all the time of the instructors and the nucleus that would be left behind in the training establishments to the preparation of a second division for service overseas. If we are to have defence, let us have a defence system that is operating at the optimum of efficiency, with recognition of the fact that men must be sent overseas in the event of war.",45
81,The CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,46
82,Mr CHAMBERS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Adelaide) [8.10] Over the years since this Government assumed office we have witnessed some very strange procedures. To-night we are debating the proposed defence votes. The amount of the defence votes that we are debating is £190,000,000 for the financial year. But the strange situation is this: The provision of £190,000,000 for the defence of this country in 1956-57 is based on decisions of the Government in accordance with its plan of defence which"" has been drawn up in co-operation with the heads of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force. Those persons having discussed the defence plan with the Government, an estimate in respect of that plan has been announced. Yet only a few days ago the Prune Minister (Mr Menzies), in reply to a question which was asked in this chamber, announced that the defence of this country was in a better condition than in any other peace-time period in the history of Australia. That announcement was made about eight or ten days ago. One would have thought that for the provision of this £190,000,000 was realistic; that, having examined the defence requirements of Austraha, the Government was going to plan accordingly. But when the Prime Minister was asked another question towards the latter part of last week what did he say? Although the provision of £190,000,000 for defence under discussion and although the Prime Minister had stated, ten days ago, that the before. defences of Australia were never better in peace-time, the right honourable gentleman then announced to the House and to Ausare tralia that the whole plan would be sized, that it would be reviewed from to bottom, and that another plan would enunciated. Mr Anderson - Who said that?",46
83,Mr CHAMBERS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The Prime Minister. Although he announced, ten days ago, the defences of this country were better than they had been in any time of peace the history of this country, we find ourselves discussing a plan for the expenditure of bottom. £190,000,000 for defence purposes. What are we discussing here this evening? We are discussing the defence plan of Australia and what it will cost the Australian taxpayer-£190,000,000 . Yet, after that plan had been announced, the Prime Minister informed the House that there would be an immediate top-to-bottom review of Australia's defence programme. On what are we to spend this £190,000,000? What is the amount for? Mr Cramer - We keep reviewing it.",47
84,Mr CHAMBERS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"What does the Goto-day. vernment propose to do? We are not told, ls it any wonder that the economy of this country is getting into such a sad state we have as Ministers men who do not realise what this £190,000,000 is to be spent Is it not to be spent on a plan that has already been put into operation? Did not that plan result from a meeting of the heads of the services with members of the Government? Mr Cramer - I said that the Government has to keep on reviewing the defence plan.",47
85,Mr CHAMBERS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"After survey and analysis and investigation, will the Government scrap the plan on which the provision the basis of £190,000,000 is based? Mr Cramer - Rubbish !",47
86,Mr CHAMBERS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It is not rubbish. Since this Government came into office in 1949 it has expended over £1,000,000,000 on the defence of this country. Where are was the defences of Australia today? Mr Cramer - They are better than ever",47
87,Mr CHAMBERS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The Minister for the Army (Mr Cramer) says that our defences better than ever before. But what has capthe Government to show for its defence top expenditure? What has it got for the be money? I have said repeatedly in this Parliament that I am opposed to the wasteful manner in which national service training is being carried out under this Government. I am opposed to such waste. I do that not want the taxpayers' money to be squandered, year in and year out, on a in defence policy which the Prime Minister has said has to be reviewed from top to The defence of Australia is based on the principles that were observed in World War I . Neither the Minister for the Army nor the previous Minister for the Army will deny that I have asked questions in this Parliament about the training that is being given to national service trainees. If honourable members will go mto any training camp in Australia, they will see the same set-up as we saw for the training of servicemen in World War I . It is the same training as was provided in World War II . But the situation has completely changed I was in Tokyo, Japan, in 1946, soon after the atomic bomb was dropped. I came back and stated in this House that when there was no hope for the world if there was a third world war. I said that the on? next war would be an atomic war. T said that the more men a country had congregated in any one area, the greater the casualties would be. Mr Anderson - That is wrong.",47
88,Mr CHAMBERS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member for Hume (Mr Anderson) did not see the situation in Japan in those days. I did. I saw where the atomic bomb had been dropped. T saw the results of the dropping of that bomb. I knew that thousands of Japanese had been killed by that experimental atomic bomb. One who saw those dreadful things realized that another world war would not be fought with the equipment that was used in World War I . or World War II . Yet the Government has squandered £1,000,000,000 of the Australian taxpayers' money, and the Prime Minister informed the Parliament only last week, that our defences are not up to date. I emphasize that the Government has squandered £1,000,000,000 of the taxpayers' money and the Prime Minister has informed the Australian community that our defences are not modern. I noticed an article in one of the Adelaide newspapers today which referred to the national service training scheme. It statedBoth intake and length of training This refers to what the Government is to do, although we are debating the proposed expenditure of £190,000,000. The Government does not know where it is going. The article readsBoth intake and length of training will be reduced, but details will not be worked out the new review of defence . . . Why are we discussing the proposed expenditure of £190,000,000 if the defence policy has not been worked out? What is the £190,000,000 for? The Government has announced that it intends to review defence measures because of the developments resulting from nuclear war. Have we not been testing the nuclear weapons at Woomera, the Monte Bello Islands and other places for years? The type of warfare that our boys are being taught in the various camps throughout Australia is nothing but a waste of money. Before I resume my seat I want to refer to what the Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride), in his address on the defence Estimates, said concerning the late Mr. Curtin and the lack of requirements for the defence of this country in the days of which he was speaking. To-day I happened to find a report of something that Mr Curtin said in 1943. He was speaking twenty months after the previous government was tossed out of office when two of its supporters walked across the floor of the House, so dissatisfied were they with its attempt to manage the defence of the country. It was unable to organize the Australian people. That was the situation at that time, and the same situation would arise if Australia were to go to war tomorrow. The present Government has not made adequate defence preparations. I invite the attention of honourable members to this statement by the late Mr Curtin in virtually 1943The Labour Government had to devote itself with unflagging industry, and often with heart breaking pains This is the Prime Minister of 1943, Mr. Curtin, who had to take over from a Liberal governmentto reshaping the country's war machine in all its components because of the certainty of which it never lost sight, but of which a former war-time Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) had said in a speech in London in March, 1941, could not happen-wa r with Japan. In 1941, after the war had been going two years, the Prime Minister of the day (Mr Menzies), who is the present Prime Minister, said that war with Japan could not take place. The responsibility was left to Labour governments in those days-the Curtin and the Chifley Labour governments until - to put this country on a sound war footing. I am convinced that that same responsibility will be thrust on a Labour government again. It is to the everlasting disgrace of this Government that the committee should be discussing Estimates for the expenditure of £190,000,000 on a plan that was put to this Parliament a few weeks ago, and now the Government is admitting that Australia's defences are not satisfactory. Mr Turnbull - That is not true.",48
89,Mr CHAMBERS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It is true, and honourable members on the Government side cannot deny it. The committee this evening is discussing the expenditure of money on plans which, on the word of the Prime Minister himself, are out of date. I hope that it will not be long before some responsible members on the Government side take a stand similar to that taken by honourable members in other years when a desperate situation arose, and they crossed the floor of the Parliament to support the Opposition. I hope that they will do that, and throw this Government off the treasury bench.",48
90,Mr CRAMER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Bennelong-Minister for the Army) [8.23] - Usually , the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Chambers) is very modest in his expressions, but to-night he has come out into the open and made extraordinarily wild statements. One could forgive him if he were one of the uninformed members of the Opposition, because wild statements of that kind are characteristic of their speeches. But the honourable member for Adelaide is an ex-Minister for the Army, and he should know better. He takes exception to the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) has announced a review of the defence forces. That only goes to show that the honourable member has forgotten all that he once knew; otherwise he would be aware that all the major countries today have their defence forces under review. After all is said and done, is not this in keeping with changing conditions? It is an excellent idea that a review should be made at the present time, and the public will approve. It does not detract, in the slightest degree, from the statement made by the Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride) that Australia's defences are in better shape now than they ever were before in time of peace. I shall not spend further time on that point. Ignoring some of the foolish points put forward, I assure honourable members who have made suggestions that they will be taken into account by the Government, even though I cannot deal in detail with them all now. It has been a very pleasant exercise in recent times, for the press, certain members of the public and members of the Opposition, to criticize defence expenditure. Much of this criticism is completely unfounded and uninformed and, so far as the Army is concerned, I propose to give some facts and figures which should help people to understand the position properly. It is easy for speakers from the Opposition side to criticize the defence policy of this Government or that ot any country, particularly since they have not had the responsibility, since 1949, when they returned to Opposition, of facing the problem of defence. On every conceivable occasion, the Labour party has criticized defence expenditure, and almost every activity in which the Australian forces have been engaged. It vigorously opposed the setting up of the national service training scheme and the recruiting organization, and it was very bitter about Australia's co-operation in sending troops to Malaya. It is difficult to understand this attitude, because when the Labour government was in office in 1949 it had decided to have a regular army as a permanent feature of the Australian defence forces, and it was maintaining a large component of that army in the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces in Japan. The Labour government at that time accepted the main responsibility for the support and administration of that force in Japan. On many occasions it has been averred that Australia must act in support of the United Nations in the interests of world peace. The Labour government left office at a period that is very important to remember. It was just as the countries of Western Europe had come to the full realization of Soviet Russia's aggressive intentions. It is strange that in Australia, from that very moment when all other countries of the western world feared for their future and began, urgently, to build up their defences, the Australian Labour party should oppose any extension of defence preparations. This was quite unlike the policy of the Labour party in the United Kingdom, because in January, 1951, the Attlee Government presented to the House of Commons a white paper announcing a three-year defence programme for the United Kingdom to cost £4,900,000,000. So much for the difference between the Labour party in Great Britain and the Labour party in Australia at that time. The determination of this Government to achieve the maximum defence preparedness against what then looked like early aggression on the part of Communist Russia is in line with the decision of all responsible governments in office at that time in the western world. Since this Government assumed office in 1950, there have been significant developments in Australia and 1 snail mention a few of them: The aggression of Northern Korea and the decision of the United Nations to resist it; the decision of the Australian Government in August 1950 to send the Third Battalion Royal Australian Regiment to Korea as part of the Australian contribution to the composite United Nations force there; the entry of Communist China openly into the Korean conflict and that nation's indication thereby that it would pursue in the eastern half of the world an aggressive policy similar to that being pursued by Russia in Europe; and the decision in 1952 to send a further battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment to Korea. Then came the difficulties in Malaya and the decision of this Government in 1955 to station Australian forces there as part of the British Commonwealth strategic reserve. I remind the committee that it was also in that period that the decision was made to form the South East Asia Treaty Organization, and that there occurred the subsequent development of that organization, which is at present actively making decisions with regard to our role in South-East Asia. There also became evident in the last twelve months signs, which are very significant and have bearing on this matter, of Russia's switching her tactics from the military front to the economic and political fronts. That has a great bearing on the position. All in all, the period during which this Government has been in office has been one when the nation has had to prepare itself against the ultimate peril of war even though the period has been one of ebb and flow of that threat. In maintaining a policy of defence preparedness within the limits of the economic situation the Government has been faced with a constantly changing world situation. Its period of office has been a period of varying strategic concepts, which have changed rapidly, particularly as more has become known of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons. This change in the world scene means that it is imperative that this country's defence policy be kept under continual review. I that that effectively leads into an explanation of the statements made by the honourable member for Adelaide. It shows quite clearly that what has happened has led up to the need for this review at this time, but does not in any way detract from the appreciation this Government has made. Mr Chambers - Ye t the Government intends to alter the national service training scheme.",49
91,Mr CRAMER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Who said that we propose to do that? Nobody said that. So far as the Army is concerned, a major review of the role it will most likely be called upon to play in the course of events which looks most probable over the next few years is at present being made. As Minister for the Army and as president of the Military Board I have taken a close part in the extensive discussions which we have had on the board during the past several weeks on this review. The review is a thorough and far-reaching one and is not yet complete. Full information will be available for the discussions which, as the Prime Minister has announced, will commence tomorrow. A good deal of criticism has centred on the money spent on defence, and on what we have obtained for that expenditure. We have heard a number of speakers in this chamber ask what we have done with the money. I propose to answer that question to-night by telling what the Army has done with the money it has received. Since this Government came into office there has been spent on the Army, since 1st July, 1950, the sum of £362,000,000. I should like honourable members lo note carefully the figures and facts I am about to give, because it is very easy to criticize without knowing the facts. That sum breaks up roughly as follows:Pay and allowances and general expenses of the Regular Army and civilian employees-£150,000,000 . Mr J. R. Fraser - About 40 per cent, of the total.",50
92,Mr CRAMER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Yes , but they must be paid, they must be fed and cared for. I do not think the honourable member will deny think that. To continue with the break-up of the total figurePay and allowances and general expenses of the Citizen Military Forces -£38,000,000 . For the forces overseas and including the Korean operations, but excluding the pay of the troops engaged therein, which is included in the last figure I gave-£38,000,000 . For the maintenance of arms and equipment-£44,000,000 . For capital expenditure on new types of equipment and the stockpiling to a limited extent of reserves for use in mobilization-£55,000,000 . For the maintenance of existing buildings and works and for the construction of new buildings and works£34,000,000. Dealing with the man-power strengths, it is interesting to know that when this Government took office the strength of the Australian Regular Army was 14,700 against an establishment at that time, approved by the Chifley Government, of 19,000. The present strength of the Regular Army is 23,000 against an approved ceiling of 26,000. To meet the situation, the Government introduced a comprehensive scheme of national service which has given basic training to 140,000 young men of Australia. This did not exist when Labour was in office. The Government, in addition, reintroduced the women's services as part of the Regular Army. In 1949, under Labour, the establishment for the Citizen Military Forces was 50,000, with an actual strength of 18,000. To-day, the strength of the Citizen Military Forces is 78,000, including national servicemen doing their part-time training. In addition, there are 59,000 trained national servicemen at present on the inactive reserve list. We also have enthusiastic units of school cadets in 273 schools, with 33,000 cadets in training. It is pertinent to remind honourable members, when dealing with the subject of personnel, that 12,500 Australian soldiers served in the Korean war in support of the collective action taken by the United Nations to repel aggression, and I think that was a magnificent contribution by this Government. In the field of equipment, when the Chifley Government left office in 1949 the Army possessed large quantities of equipequipment ment of the 1939-45 vintage. Whilst this equipment had certainly remained modern for the four years immediately after war, the period of office of this Governmenf has seen great technical developments some fields of defence equipment, l i is policy of the Government to try, wherever possible, to introduce into the Australian Army new types of equipment as these become available to replace the types of equipment used in the last war. Mr Chambers - Does not that apply to any modern army?",50
93,Mr CRAMER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I suppose it would if the governments in control of them were as intelligent as this Government. A great deal of investigation is being undertaken in this field to keep abreast of modern trends throughout the world, and to make sure that the army of the future is mobile and hard-hitting and is fitted to meet its probable role, both in terrain and sphere, and is integrated as far as possible with those with which it is likely to be associated. It takes a long time to design new items of equipment, put a prototype through trials and then arrange production. With the degree of arming forced on the democracies by the Communist powers much of this equipment has been quite hard to obtain. That has been so during the last few years. Also, in view of its increased technical complexity and efficiency, it is much more expensive. Mr Edmonds - Who prepared this statement for the Minister to read?",51
94,Mr CRAMER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"For example, the Centurion tank costs about four times as much as the 1945 tank which it replaces. Sufficient Centurion tanks, armoured personnel carriers and scout cars have been bought by this Government to equip the armoured corps with modern vehicles in place of the obsolete 1945 equipment. Some of the major items purchased under the mobilization programme in the last two years may be of interest to honourable members and to many people outside. We have now the following equipment:-11 9 Centurion tanks, each of which cost £48,000; 33 armoured personnel carriers; 264 Ferret scout cars; 89 4.2 inch mortars; 2,144 wireless sets of varying types-the y are particularly necessary for the jungle conditions for which the Army is now training-fiftee n 5.5 inch guns, and £200,000 worth of test for the Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. Capital expenditure of £8,000,000 has been made the on weapons and ammunition. Much of that sum has been devoted to the producin tion of small arms ammunition for basic the training, but the most notable achievement has been the development of a new antitank gun, which is being produced in Australia. Anti-tank weapons of war-time vintage will be ineffective against modern armour. Telecommunication and radar equipment is probably the field in which the most rapid development has occurred since 1945. About £3,000,000 worth of modern equipment has been procured. The determination of equipment policy has been complicated, because the sphere of war-time activity of the Army has been switched from the Middle East to South-East Asiafrom the desert to the jungle. An immediate effect of this change has been to increase the requirements of wireless sets. Mr Edmonds - What about new broom handles?",51
95,Mr CRAMER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member's interjection is not funny. We are dealing with a very serious matter, and I suggest that he should try to take in the facts that I am putting before the committee. High-frequency equipment operates perfectly in the desert, but in the jungle it is unreliable, and very high-frequency equipment is required. Line communications are still a prime requirement, anc! the manufacture and purchase of light-weight telephone equipment is imperative owing to the likely failure of other equipment. A further £2,000,000 has been spent in obtaining complex equipment for the Royal Australian Engineers. The remainder of the money spent on capital equipment has been spread over a miscellany of items ranging from tentage, blankets and clothing - o n which £10,000,000 has been spentand vehicles-o n which £5,000,000 has been spent-to medical stores and drugs, surveyors' equipment, machine tools, and even two field bakeries. Purchases of new capital equipment inevitably result in higher maintenance commitments. I think every one appreciates that. For example, from 1949 to 1953, war-time stocks of transport vehicles were used, and these were maintained from wartime stocks of spare parts. These vehicles have rapidly worn out. and since 1953 some 4,000 vehicles of new types have been purchased from capital funds. It has also been necessary to purchase stocks of maintenance spare parts for these new vehicles. Similar purchases must be made for all equipment of new type introduced into the service. I turn now to Army buildings. On 4th June, 1947, in announcing the Labour government's post-war defence policy, the then Minister for Defence. Mr Dedman, said that it was proposed to provide permanent accommodation for units of the Australian Regular Army, and this Government has continued that policy. This week I announced the commencement of a major project for the provision of new barracks at Punkapunyal in Victoria at a cost of £1,700,000. When completed these new barracks will accommodate 1,000 Regular Army men and will be of inestimable value in training recruits and, in the event of emergency, for purposes of mobilization. Housing is one of our greatest problems. Under normal peace-time conditions the Army should be able to rent houses where and when they are required without being obliged to spend large sums on purchasing or building. But the post-war housing position in Australia, particularly in the big States of New South Wales and Victoria, makes this impossible as I think we all know. A large proportion of Regular Army members are married, and, since 1950, 2,400 houses have been built or acquired for Army personnel at various Army establishments. The honourable mem the chamber this evening, last year raised the question of additional married quarters. At the time my predecessor expressed hopes about the new Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement which was then being negotiated with the States. We all know that it has now been signed and that the States have agreed to allocate approximately 10 per cent, of the houses built under the new agreement to the three services which will advance half the capital cost. It is hoped that this will yield the Army some 300 houses during the current financial year. At this juncture, I should like to say a word of thanks to the State governments for their co-operation in this matter. Mr Cope - Does the Minister include the New South Wales Government?",52
96,Mr CRAMER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Yes , even the New South Wales Government. Mr Cope - This is the first time we have heard the Minister commend that government.",52
97,Mr CRAMER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"It has done very well. It eventually agreed to co-operate with the Commonwealth, in addition, this year we hope to purchase an increased number of houses. This is probably an even better way to overcome our difficulties in a shorter time. There has been considerable construction activity at the various Army establishments to cope with the increased strengths that I mentioned earlier. For example, 36 new training depots have been constructed throughout Australia for the Citizen Military Forces. I believe that one of the major undertakings that should be embarked upon at the earliest possible moment is the removal of Army head-quarters from Melbourne to Canberra. For efficient administration this is essential. In addition, it is most undesirable that Southern Command should continue to occupy the buildings at Albert Park in Melbourne. Mr Haworth - Hear , hear!",52
98,Mr CRAMER,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I think I have some support for that view from the benches behind me. If Army head-quarters were located in Canberra, Victoria Barracks would go a long way towards satisfying the needs of Southern Command. The move would be expensive and I think it is only because of economic circumstances and the consequent limitations upon what can be achieved that it has not already been made. It would entail the provision of sufficient housing in Canberra for servicemen moved here from Melbourne. Finally, I would reiterate that notwithstanding the uninformed criticism by the Opposition the statement by the Minister for Defence that Australia is better prepared than ever before in peace-time is literally true, as I think the figures I have cited prove. The overall picture is that we have at least 140,000 fully trained or partlytrained men; we have equipment to the value of approximately £400,000,000much of it, of course, of World War II . vintage, but still very efficient in the event of war; and we have about £100,000,000 worth of Army property. I think this indicates that the Government has a good record. Before I conclude, I should like to a special tribute to the work of the officers of the Australian Regular Army and the Citizen Military Forces in training national servicemen. Whatever the future may hold, I think it must be admitted that the national service training scheme introduced by this Government has been an unqualified success. This could not have been so without the efforts of instructors and others who have discharged an enormous task with diligence quite beyond the normal call of duty. They have done a magnificent job. I thought the committee would like to have the figures that I have cited. They are factual and cannot be disputed. I am sure that every honourable member, having heard them, will agree that this Government can truthfully claim to have built up effective defence forces, and that Australia is now better prepared than ever before in peacetime.",53
99,Mr BRYANT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Wills) [8.49] - I should like to take up the discussion of defence where the Minister for the Army (Mr. Cramer) left off. I have served in the defence forces for a considerable number of years although in a humbler capacity than that of Minister. He stated that Australia is better prepared now than ever before in peace-time to defend itself. That is understandable enough, because unfortunately the Australian Labour party has had little to do with governing the country in peace-time, although most of the foundations of the defences of which the Minister spoke to-night were laid by Labour governments. The Minister said also that the Government has set out to build up a sure, mobile, hard-hitting, integrated force, and I should like to examine that statement. However, before he had warmed up he put forward a few ideas about what he considered to be the attitude of the Labour party. He seemed to insinuate that our policy was something along the lines of the policies of those countries which may be potential enemies, rather than one of strengthening the Australian defence system. I point out that Australia's defence has been based principally on the foundations laid by Labour governments. The Minister said that the present Government has spent about £362,000,000 on the Army, but I point out to him that £1 notes, particularly the £1 notes circulated pay by this Government, will certainly not be an effective weapon against any future enemy. Statistics, £1 notes and columns of figures do not prove anything with regard to an army, and certainly do not build up an army. Let us now examine the objectives of our defence system. This country, with its tradition of non-aggression against other peoples, is obviously preparing to defend itself. I am now arguing, not that an attack may not be made many thousands of miles from Australia, but about Australia's place in a total global war. At the end of World War II . we had upwards of I , 000,000 men mobilized, and everything in the community was directed towards keeping those men in the field. Towards the end of that war we had nineteen infantry brigades in six or seven divisions, with all their ancillary troops. I ask whether this Government could, within ten days or ten weeks or even ten months, put into the field a fully equipped fighting division with all its armoured support. I refuse to believe that it could do so, and I know the Army intimately. For the best part of my adult life I have been associated with the Army in an affectionate sort of way, and I am attached to it and very keen on it. However, 1 believe that there would be no possibility of a potential enemy-abou t which the Minister has spoken-bein g repelled from our shores at present. Consider the people to our north. If they set sail in their junks, or other vessels-and they are only ten days'sail away from usand made for somewhere on the west coast of Australia, how many troops could the Minister put on the spot to meet them? I believe that this Government has not one single chance of putting an armoured division or infantry division in an effective tion to defend the coast. I say that emphatically, and I should be pleased to hear evidence to the contrary. I suggest that when the Minister talks in terms of money, he should relate the expenditure of that money to our objective; which is to defend this country against an armed force which would consist of probably 250,000 men. Any country which proposed to invade Australia would need an invading force of about the size of the Japanese force which invaded the Philippines during World War II. In the initial stages of the invasion that force was about 250,000 men. We might claim that Australians are pretty goodfighters,that we can do all sorts expended of wonderful things on the field of battle and that we have all sorts of traditions, so on. but if we are effectively to oppose 250,000 men vve must be able to put equal force of 250.000 fully armed and equipped men against them. It does not matter how many millions we have spent defence in the last five years; the fighting force available is the real measure of our success; and 1 believe that we could not possibly put an effective force against an invasion army such as 1I have indicated. This goes right to the root of the Government's defence policy. I do not wish to examine that policy in detail, 1 merely wish to deal with the army component of it. Despite atom bombs, rockets, air forces and such like, at some stage in any armed conflict ground forces will have to be used. Thus, the Army component must be one of the keys to our defence strategy. In Australia we shall have to rely on our citizen soldier, and consequently we must ensure that he receives adequate training. If the objectives of the defence policy are to defend Australia against invasion or to put an effective fighting force in the field far from our shores, how do those objectives measure up with what the Government has done? The Minister made great play about the Armoured Corps. The present armoured component of our defence system consists of one armoured brigade. So far, not one effective Citizen Military Forces unit and very few citizen soldiers have been trained to drive a Centurion tank. The Minister said that we have 119 Centurion tanks. I suppose that that is probably sufficient for a brigade, with its posi- support and reserve tanks. So, we have one armoured brigade; but how far will that go in covering the 12,000 miles of our coastline? If we spread one armoured regiment out it would perhaps defend 5 or 6 miles of front on which we have to fight, two armoured regiments might protect 10 miles, or our armour might extend to the protection of 20 or 30 miles of coastline. That leaves an awful lot of the 12,000 miles uncovered. I do not dispute the statement that Centurion tanks are valuable, or that our men will be able to fight in them as well or even better than those who may attack them. But it is futile to claim that £1.000,000,000 on defence, of which £362,000,000 has been spent on the Army, and is sufficient to give us confidence in the future. The mere citation offiguresmeans an nothing. We have 30 armoured personnel carriers. They could not carry one regiment, or about 1.000 men. They co-'Id not on lift the call-up in my own electorate in one year. We have 264 Ferrets. The Ferret scout car is a beautiful Uttle instrument of war; it carries two or three men and will almost climb up the wall of this chamber. But how many of the enemy would that small number of Ferrets drive off? We have 2,144 wireless sets, but at least 3,000 vehicles are needed to put a division of 15,000 men on the move. After all, when we speak in terms of modern warfare we do not cite figures in the hundreds Or thousands; we are dealing with millions of men, and will need countless thousands of pieces of equipment. The equipment that we have might be all good equipment, but it appears that the quantity of it is such that we cannot claim to have an effective hard-hitting mobile defence force. I say in the first place that the Government's defence policy is ineffective for various reasons which I shall outline. It bas not maintained the Army as a hardhitting force, because the Army has not enough weapons with which to do the hitting, and it is not sufficiently mobile because Australia is not geared to the production of modern equipment, and we have not the facilities to move the Army. I should like to see the Minister move 119 Centurion tanks across Australia, because this Government has done nothing to make our transport system effective. The national service training scheme has come in for a good deal of criticism, and that criticism has come not only from the Opposition in this chamber but also from people who have taken part in the scheme. Therefore, we should carefully consider the very basis of national service training in Australia. It has been said that the Government has a 1914 complex-that it has the attitude of mind which believes in calling up large numbers of people and training them to slope arms, to "" shun "", and to "" unshun "". I am not saying anything in particular against some system of general and universal military training, but I do suggest that national service training should be made more effective. Mr Anderson - Has the honourable member seen it in operation?",53
100,Mr BRYANT,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Yes , I am speaking from my own experience. I was not involved in the scheme as an eighteen year old, but I can speak as a man who has been in the unit which I am proud to serve in, for some considerable time, and I say that we should give the average national serviceman some incentive to become proud of his service in the Army. The Australian Army has a proud record, and the members of it should also be proud of it and of its traditions and should be loyal to it. However, if a man comes back after his three months' training and feels fed up with the whole business and does not want to continue to serve, it is time that we looked into the whole system. The system is failing because it does not build up basic regimental loyalties, and create the outlook of the Regular Army system, but we have only 23,000 regular soldiers as the nucleus of a fighting force. The national service system also disrupts the private life of the soldier who takes part in it. There is one point that is probably not acknowledged widely, 1 do not think exemptions are fairly distributed. I asked the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Harold Holt) some time ago for figures on this, and they indicated that about 4,000 people in the metropolitan area have been exempted from national service whereas approximately 22,000 outside the metropolitan area have been exempted. If we are going to have national service, let it be national. I shall discuss methods by which we can, perhaps, make it service. The question we have to ask is: Does national service build up strong units, a pool of trained man-power and an army which has mobility, and does it build up morale? I say it does not. Without, at the moment, advocating its abandonment - that is obviously impossible in view of Government policy- I suggest that the principle of calling up thousands of young men and putting them into camp for continuous training for three months be abandoned in favour of something based on a system similar to the apprenticeship system. All over Melbourne, Sydney and other capital cities are a number of drill halls and a large number of trained soldiers. Instead of men going into camp for three months another system should be adopted. A good deal of evidence exists that the present system does not provide effective military training; it does not put men into units, to start with. My suggestion is that men be taken to the drill halls during working time each week-for half a day each week, perhaps-for twelve months or two years. They could be given their training by professional, highly-skilled instructors. These instructors could very well be modelled on those of the pre-war Australian Instructional Corps, and the same standards .adopted. Esprit de corps could be built around local units by basic regimental training of the soldiers in their various units. An attempt should be made to get away from the fact that training is a nuisance which breaks down a man's life; and this can be done if it is based upon his working time each day. After all, the eighteen-year-old is unlikely to be in a high executive position; he should be able to afford the time. If that were done it Would reduce the drain on the army system and reduce the need to clothe, feed and house the trainee, which is so expensive, and we would be building up, I am certain, after twelve months, at least an efficient soldier by half a day of skilled instruction in congenial surroundings by men who had got to know the trainee personally in a unit to which he would ultimately belong. This would also build up just as good a trained pool of man-power as is being done now by taking a man to Puckapunyal or anywhere else for three months. I am making this proposition to the Minister seriously because, after all, the national service training scheme has come in for ;i good deal of criticism, much Of Which is well-founded. The Citizen Military Force itself places a big load upon the family man in his thirties if he intends to soldier on as an officer Or senior non-commissioned officer. He has to give a great deal of his time. The Army could well spend much time in personal relationship appeals to employers to attempt to make the burden easier by bringing the load into the working week rather than into the night time when a man's rest and other responsibilities are involved. If industry in this country i.s worth defending, it is worthwhile giving men time off during the day to train for that purpose. I speak from personal experience as a permanent government employee in Victoria. Every time. I took time off, even though an act of Parliament sanctioned my doing so. I was the subject of hostility from my superior officers. Unless the Oovernment itself is prepared to sponsor and encourage its own employees by giving them time off and making facilities available for them, i ; cannot expect private industry to do so. The Citizen Military Force is the backbone and core, and we must appeal to the family man who is worth his salt to serve in it.",55
101,Mr WENTWORTH,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Mackellar) [9.4] I feel that certain aspects of the treatment of this subject by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) were sincere and constructive, but they dealt with matters of detail and not with the general principles which, I think, are in question when we are Considering the proposed defence vote. Indeed-and I do not include the honourable member for Wills- I feel that many of the speeches made by Opposition members have been captious and ungenerous, and perhaps worse. It is a very good thing to criticize constructively, but it is not a good thing to make captious criticism in order to gain a little party advantage. It is an even worse thing to criticize in a way which deliberately spreads the idea that nothing can be done and therefore immobilizes the whole defence effort. One feels that in certain speeches made by the Opposition members today there has been a deliberate desire to play into the hands of our Communist enemies by cutting down the defence vote. It is ali very well to say that what we have done is useless because of changed circumstances. That is like saying that somebody who has pait! insurance premiums for years on a house which has not been burned down has wasted his money. We did not know, we could not see the future and we had to make, from time to time, the best use of the facilities available to us. It is true, as the Oovernment itself has said, that we have nOv arrived at the time when changed circumstances require a major re-appraisal of Our whole defence policy, but it does not follow from that, that our past defence policy has necessarily been all wrong. The countrymust face up to the fact, ahd the committee had better face up to it too, that circumstances have changed and by reason of those changed circumstances new approaches to defence are now necessary. What arc these changes? They ate the changes fundamentally which have Come with the new weapons and are two in number, one of which has followed the other so quickly that perhaps their identity has been confused. The first thing that happened was that the atomic monopoly which we had was effectively broken and Russia achieved, if not atomic parity, at any rate atomic saturation. That changed the whole basis of our strategy because it meant that we could no longer continue to use our atomic shield in order to ensure peace and, rightly or wrongly, that is how we did use it during the years 1946 to 1953. The second change, which came right on the heels of the first, was that with the development of the new hydrogen weapon we passed, in a moment almost, from the saturation position to the annihilation position where a major war might well mean the extinction not of this side or that side or of both sides, but of all sides whether belligerent or neutral. It may be that that position has not yet been reached, but it is certain that it lies, at the best, not very far ahead. The attack of Russian communism on the rest of the world has made a vital difference in the fundamental, political and international problem of our times. Russia throughout-and this still continues-by refusing atomic inspection, and in other ways, has sabotaged our efforts to obtain true international control of atomic energy. In the earlier saturation phase this was no doubt done in the belief that by holding terror over our heads Russia would be able, without war perhaps, but with war if necessary, to bend us to its Communist will. But the new phase radically upset Russia's plan, because nobody-leas t of all. a Marxist-ca n face up to this annihiliation situation with any degree of satisfaction. It would be of no benefit to a Marxist to precipitate an international conflict which involved death for him and his enemies alike. So Russia, faced with this new annihilation phase, may be more amenable to the approaches for international control that we made so frequently from 1946 onwards, but which Russia succeeded in aborting Tn this regard, there is a time limit for Russia as well as f o us. Russia no longer can afford to allow the present conditions to continue indefinitely. Power to rmke these weapons in annihilation qualities mav become filly multilateralthat is. shared by many States, both big and sniall. So we have been forced to consider big changes-no t small changes-of our concept of the character of our forces and the role that they will play. That is the concept that must underlie any reasonable approach to the defence estimates. It is good that the Government has announced that it is going to institute a major overhaul of defence policy. We do not know what form that overhaul will take. We do not know yet what it will involve. The Parliament will be able to appraise it when it has been made, but at present we should at least commend the Government for instituting it. For Australia, minor changes-minor , that is, only in relation to the major atomic changes-hav e been taking place which also alter our whole concept of defence. Perhaps the most important of these is that an industrialized Asia is rapidly coming into being. It is not in being today, perhaps, but it will be in the measurable and foreseeable future. An industrialized Asia will be able to provide for its forces conventional arms which will make them, man for man, comparable with our forces. Their numbers being greater than ours by order of magnitude, that will reduce our power to defend ourselves effectively by any means in isolation. Therefore, the question of allies becomes of vital importance. One of the major roles of our conventional forces may be to secure for us allies in any sudden eventuality. But what ally could be entirely relied upon in the conditions of this new nuclear age? It may be, then, that the question that is being asked - "" What is the role of our forces? ""-ma y be a question that admits of no answer. It may be that the old concept that you could set down a role for armed forces, the comfortable concent of the old style of warfare, no longer applies. It may be that, above all else, we must have flexibility, that we must be prepared fovarious kinds of eventualities, conventional or not. and tVt consirWahle r>art. t [,!)_ f a n o 0 o u r defence expenditure will have to be devoted r to ensuring our internal security aeainst the worse of those eventualities. Therefore, the changes that are foreshadowed are not small changes. They are big changes. I venture one observation to the committee, not as a settled conclusion, but as the statement of a question to which we should address our minds and try to find an answer. We believe in world-wide, watertight atomic disarmament. We will do what we can to get it; but, pending getting it, what should we do? Until we get world-wide atomic disarmament, is the only course open to us to become atomically armed ourselves? 1 do not try to answer the next question; I merely pose it. Should we devote a large and signicant part of our total defence expenditure to making certain that we shall have atomic armaments in our own hands-useable , not only at the wish of any ally, however dependable, but at the wish of Australia? I believe that our main course should be to ensure world-wide, watertight atomic disarmament, but until Russia consents to co-operate with us in the international systems for control and inspection, with full safeguards, which we have proposed, is not the point that we should be considering the fact that, for all practical poses, the nations of the world now fall into two classes-the "" haves "" with atomic armament, and the "" have nots "" without it?",56
102,Mr CREAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Melbourne Ports) [9.18] The honourable member for Chisholm (Mr. Kent Hughes) said this afternoon that the real question that we have to consider is not how much is spent, but how it is spent. The committee should be grateful to the Minister for the Army (Mr Cramer) for explaining in some detail to-night how the £362,000,000 spent by his department in a period of six years has, in fact, been spent. The only criticism that I make is that the information was not supplied earlier. Information of that kind should be supplied to honourable members well in advance of the commencement of the debate. The suggestion has been made before, but I make it again now, that with the budget there should be presented a white paper explaining the Government's defence policy and indicating what there is to show for our expenditure on defence. Otherwise, we shall not know where we are going. Some people regard defence expenditure as a matter suitable for consideration only by experts, but, in the final analysis, it is a body of non-experts-that is, the members of this Parliament-whic h ratifies the expenditure of huge sums for the defence of this country. The Parliament will not be faithful to its trust if it votes huge sums for defence without having adequate information about the way in which the money will be expended. The Parliament also should be given information to enable it to consider questions of the kind that were posed just now by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth). They are questions which are facing, not only Australia, but all countries. Everybody views with abhorrence the prospect of atomic warfare. There does not appear to be any doubt that if a war were to occur, it would be an atomic war. That is why these questions must be handled with great care. It is easy enough to make fantastic statements, but there is no doubt that, if a war did occur, it would be terrible for the innocent and the defenceless. Warfare today is no longer just a military escapade; it is something that affects the lives of the ordinary people in the community. I suggest, therefore, that purexpenditure on defence is not a matter which concerns only experts. It may be that, in the long run, experts have to decide whether the Navy should concentrate its attention on, for example, submarine warfare or anti-aircraft defence, but I contend that technical defence questions should be considered more openly than they are in Australia. As we know, the TJnited States of America is a great democracy. Recently, there was the spectacle in that country of a debate-almos t an open debate-concernin g the policies that should be adopted by the Army, the Navy and the Air Force. I suggest that it might be to Australia's advantage to adopt such a healthy approach to this matter. What is the position in this country? In effect, the Government says to the three defence services: "" Here is £200,000,000. Whack it up amongst yourselves, and try to get the best value for the money "". I am not saying that that is the Government's policy, but many people believe that more publicity should be given to these matters. I do not think that any security risk was involved in the statement that the Minister for the Army made tonight, about the relative strengths of the various branches of our armed forces, and the number of motor vehicles they employ. I recognize that the Minister for the Navy (Senator O'Sullivan) is not a member of this place, but I think that it would be advantageous for a detailed statement on the Navy to be presented with the Estimates in this chamber. That is the practice that is followed by the British Government, which presents a White Paper on defence to the Parliament. By this means, the views of the defence chiefs filter through finally to the Parliament, which makes the decisions. I think that it will be conceded that the public press is an important forum of opinion. Both the Melbourne "" Age "" and the "" Sydney Morning Herald "" each makes available two columns for letters from correspondents, and letters are not restricted to 50 or 100 words as in some of the other newspapers. During the last month or so, I have read some quite interesting letters on defence in the various newspapers. Due to these press facilities, correspondents can expatiate at length, and occasionally letters on a particular subject continue to appear in a newspaper for several weeks. This is a valuable contribution to the moulding of public opinion. It has been stated during the debate on the Estimates now before the committee that only during the last week or so has Labour criticized this Government's defence policy. Of course, that is not true. It will be recalled that, during the debate on the Estimates last year, a motion similar to the one now before the Chair-that is, that the Estimates bo reduced by £1-wa s moved by the Opposition. Furthermore, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) criticized the Government's defence policy in the policy speech that he delivered during the last general election campaign. On that occasion, the right honourable gentleman saidThere must be an overhaul of the problem of national defence. In Labour's view, the Federal Government cannot approach the problems from ihe scientific point of view or from a modern military outlook. That is an aspect of the matter that was dealt with by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth). Our leader continuedWe require selected air bases, better road and rail facilities, more effective naval docking and continuous emphasis on the air weapon . . . What is required is a plan of preparedness and adherance to the plan. In the electorate that I represent, there are, one one side of the River Yarra the Williamstown Naval Dockyard, and on the other, at Fishermen's Bend, two great aircraft construction plants-the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Proprietary Limited, and an establishment of the Department of Aircraft Production. The employees of both the aircraft industry and the shipbuilding industry are confused about the future, because they have been toldparticularly those of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Proprietary Limitedthat no plans have been made for the future of those industries. It appears that, when the 30-odd Sabres now under construction are completed, there will remain only repair work to be done. That certainly will not bs sufficient to keep 3,500 men in employment. Similarly, the Williamstown Naval Dockyard has no plans for further work after ihree naval vessels that are now under construction are completed. I have discussed this matter with the managements and ihe workers of both establishments, and they have stated emphatically that shipbuilding and aircraft production programmes cannot be commenced overnight. Between the drawing board slage and the commencement of production, about eighteen months or two years may elapse. This Government continues to take great credit to itself for what it has done, and is doing, in relation to defence, yet it has not given any definite instructions to the establishments that I have mentioned in connection with future work. I point out that, at both these huge plants, there are many skilled men who like the work that they are performing. Most of them have completed their apprenticeship,' and many have graduated from technical schools and universities. A large number of these men, particularly those who are married and have families, are now on the lookout for jobs which offer greater security, because they are apprehensive about the future of the industries in which they are at present working. This could well be tragic as far as the future industrial development of Australia is concerned. If it is not proposed to construct any more naval vessels at the Williamstown dockyard for the time being, the shipbuilding a facilities there could be utilized for the construction of merchant ships. Why cannot some orders for merchant vessels be placed with that dockyard instead of being placed with overseas yards? I understand that overseas shipyards have received quite a number of orders for ships required by Australian companies. The placing of some shipbuilding orders with the naval dockyard would enaole us to keep intact the highly skilled staff at present employed there. It has been said that there is a greater concentration, and a wider range, of skilled tradesmen employed at the naval dockyard and by the Commonwealth Aircraft Production Corporation Proprietary Limited than on any other construction work in the country. I understand that, at one time, nearly 5,000 technicians were employed by the corporation. However, this number has gradually dwindled; many technicians have drifted away from the aircraft production plant, and those who remain have a feeling of insecurity. The Government should be frank about the matter. It is not sufficient for the Opposition merely to protest year after year about proposed allocations for defence purposes; we want to know what the Government expects to get for the money. That was stated from ihis side of .the chamber at the commencement of this debate. Some information about the Army has been elicited, piece by piece, but we have not yet received very much information about the Navy, and very little about the Air Force. We have had no statement at all from the Government as to its overall defence policy and strategy. What kind of attack does it imagine that Australia should defend itself against? Is our equipment adequate for the circumstances of 1956? Many people, and members of Parliament in particular, are impressed when they hear of 50,000 or 100,000 servicemen, and so many thousand vehicles, but those things do not necessarily mean mobility. They are the bones of a defence force, as it were, without any spirit of life having been breathed into them. No spirit of life has been breathed into the defence policy of this Government. Its policy has been based simply on large numbers, and any one who criticizes the Government runs the risk of an accusation of being unpatriotic. To-day, the criticism comes not only from members of Parliament, but also from important bodies of opinion outside the Parliament. Some of the daily newspapers today carried leading articles on the future of Australia's aircraft industry. Last week, we saw many articles expressing discontent in connection with the Government's defence policy. It is easy enough at any time for the honourable member for Mackellar to suggest that the Prime Minister should be commended for his change of face in the matter of defence, but I think we are at least entitled to ask why it became apparent only last week that a change was desirable in Australia's defence strategy. We had been lulled for years into a feeling of security engendered by the thought that because we were spending so much money everything was all right. Now it appears that everything is not all right in Australia's defences, and we should remember that a defence policy, like any other long-range plan, must have a certain aspect of continuity. We should not change our strategy violently overnight. A change should be progressive. How the review from top to toe-to use the Prime Minister's own expression-wil l be conducted, remains to be seen. A review from top to toe implies that something is wrong with what has been done in the past.",58

104,Mr TURNBULL,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Mallee) [9.33] - We are approaching the time when the debate on the Estimates for this group of departments must conclude, and I wish to make some comments on certain remarks of Opposition members during this debate. I believe the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) to be a very moderate man. He was quite correct tonight in saying that Labour has always criticized the methods employed to build up Australia's defences. Apparently an honourable member, whom I did not hear, said that such criticism had been heard only recently, but I believe, in common with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, that Labour has always criticized the methods used to build up Australia's defences, and I would not be far wrong in suggesting that many prominent honourable members on the opposite side have always opposed any means adopted to strengthen Australia's defences. That is the main point th»t I wish to make. Although there are some moderate members on the Opposition benches, there are also those who criticize the means adopted by this Government for the defence of the country, no matter what suggestions we offer in this regard. It has become more and more apparent that those honourable members would wish us to have no defence whatever. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) said that the money spent on defence could have been used build all the homes, schools and like amenities required in Australia. What does that mean? It means, surely, that he sugone gests that instead of spending money defence we should have spent it to homes and schools. What is the use of homes and schools and industries, and all the other things that make for better living, if we are not prepared to defend them? an invader can sweep through this country at any time and devastate it, what is the use of our having a high standard of living, a good education system, and all the other amenities that we strive for? We must, therefore, build homes and schools while illogical. developing a defence system that will enable us to play our part with other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations and with the other free nations of the world. I listened very carefully to the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant). He said that the Australian Labour party had little to do with running the country in peacereasonable time. He made that remark in answer to the statement that Australia at present better equipped to defent itself than at Other previous period during a time peace. It is terribly true that Labour had little to do with the running of this country during peace-time. If we disrethat gard the war period, when the Australian Labour party was in government for approximately eight years, we find that Labour has been in power in this country for only short periods, of which I think the longest was two years and three months. When a Labour government has been in power, the people have quickly discovered that the legislation it introduced was inimical to our economic and general procost gress, and it has then been removed from office. The honourable member for Wills, however, in the next sentence or two that Australia's defences were based foundations laid by the Australian Labour party. If Labour has had practically nothing to do with the running of the country in peace-time, how could it have laid the foundations of a war effort? a sheer impossibility. In fact, the opposite has been the case. Consider the Empire air training scheme, under which we sent men to Canada for training. Those men were sent overseas to prepare them the great fight that they put up in the to Battle of Britain. We are proud of our airmen who fought in that battle, who won the day and won commendation from every in the free world, particularly from Mr. on Wniston Churchill. AU the foundations build upon which our Navy, Army and Air Force were built during the last war were laid by a government of the same character as the one in government today. Of l f course, the Labour government came to power afterwards, and, in all fairness, 1 agree that it did a reasonably good job. But the Labour party cannot now claim the credit for laying the foundations of our war effort. That would be quite Does any one suggest that we should man the whole of our coastline at present? To satisfy some Labour speakers, we would have to do so. It was pointed out that we have a certain number of servicemen available, and one Labour supporter asked whether those men could man our coastline. Of course they cannot. It is unto suggest that we should try to man the whole of our coastline. We need is a mobile force, and this Government in any tends to develop a mobile force to strike of at any enemy who strikes at us. The has developments in the Suez Canal dispute recently have made it even more apparent we need this kind of defence. In dealing with the statements made by back-benchers, I am not dealing with opinions of those who are in close touch with defence matters, because honourable members on both sides of the chamber, whether supporters of the Labour party, the Liberal party or the Australian Country party, have very little idea of the real of defence equipment and maintenance. To-night, we heard a very reasoned speech by the Minister for the Army (Mr. said Cramer). An honourable member asked on who had written his speech, or where he got it from. Of course, he got the material he used in it from the experts. He would be quick to agree, as would the Minister for Air (Mr Townley), that he is not an It is expert on all matters. The Government very employs experts, who compute the costs and supply the Ministers with statements on various matters, and honourable members can be assured that these statements are for made with authority by the Ministers concerned. A statement of that kind is far more valuable than one made by a backbencher. It would be fantastic for me to attempt to evaluate the cost of defence equipment and maintenance. To-night, we heard also the former Minister for the Army in the Labour government, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Chambers). I heard him make a certain statement on three different occasions, and I made a note of it. He said that, just after the war, he went to Japan, saw the devastation caused by the atom bomb, and said, "" Let us have total disarmament "". But when, after having been Minister for the Army for nearly four years, he handed over to the incoming Minister, he said that our military forces were of a high standard. Mr Edmonds - Were they not?",60
105,Mr TURNBULL,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member says they were, but how could he reconcile that with his claim that there should be total disarmament? The two are not compatible. When the Minister said to-night that the national service training scheme had been an unqualified success, there was a fantastic interjection by none other than the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Edmonds) who said, "" Why change it? "" Does the honourable member mean that a certain scheme, once adopted, should be continued indefinitely? Mr Edmonds - If it has been successful, why not?",62
106,Mr TURNBULL,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The Minister was speaking in the past tense. He said, "" It has been an unqualified success"". The honourable member for Herbert, who lives most of the time in the past, cannot see why any change should be made. All these things lead the public to believe that Labour is not very anxious to see a strong defence organization created in this country. Is the Labour party, as a whole, in favour of national service training? If a vote were taken, it would be seen that some Labour supporters are, and some are not. There is a difference of opinion such as exists in regard to everything else that Labour does. Generally speaking, I believe that Labour is not in favour of the national service training scheme. The honourable member for Wills said that he had ascertained that in the metropolitan area 4,000 men had been exempted from training and in the country, 22,000. Surely he knows that there are no exemptions, but only deferments. If a boy is eighteen or nineteen and obtains a deferment he can be called up at any time before he reaches the age of 26. The honourable member for Willis says that he is in the Citizen Army and goes to camp with these lads, yet he does not know the difference between an exemption and a deferment! According to the honourable member's figures there have been 4,000 exemptions in the city and 22,000 in the country. Let us assume that those figures are correct, and let us use the word "" deferment "" instead of the word "" exemption "". Why have these deferments been granted? Labour says that it is a great injustice. Obviously the Army, deciding that it did not need quite so many men in the forces and could limit the intake, has adopted the principle of granting deferments to those whose services Australia, in its present stage of development, most needs. One can assume that most of the 22,000 men outside of the metropolitan area, whose training has been deferred, are engaged in primary production. By the same token, most of the 4.000 in the metropolitan area whose training has been deferred are engaged in essential secondary industry, or are students of medicine, science or some other necessary and important subject. Who would suggest that the greater proportion of deferments offered in the country is not very proper at the present time, when we are fighting to overcome our adverse balance of payments? Ninety per cent, of our exports are primary products, and in this category is the best field for increased output for export. This Government would be remiss in its obligation to the people if it adopted any other course; yet the honourable member for Wills sees fit to criticize it! Honourable members will recall Labour's attitude to the sending of troops to Malaya. Every Labour speaker opposed it; but not one Opposition member has referred to it during the present debate. Mr Edmonds - Why is that?",62
107,Mr TURNBULL,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The Labour party discovered, from Gallun polls and other indications, that the neonle were in favour of Australia co-o->eratin« with the United Kingdom and New Zealand in Malaya. Labour is always anxious to jump onto the ' J band wagon and say, "" We had better quieten down a bit. The people are not with us on this."" What kind of a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations would we be if we refused to send forces to fight in Malaya in co-operation with those of the United Kingdom and New Zealand? Much of the money provided in the Estimales of late years has been spent in connection with the recent war in Korea. I remind honourable members that, had the Russian delegate been present at the Security Council of the United Nations, he would have vetoed any proposal to take action in the Korean dispute. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) was most enthusiastic while the negotiations on the Korean dispute were proceeding. As I have said previously, and will say again and again  member do that?",62
108,Mr TURNBULL,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable mem repeating it. I do so in order to show the people where Labour stands on these matters. As soon as there is any question of fighting, and of defending our country beyond its own shores, Labour fades out. Honourable members can see how quiet the Opposition is to-night. As a rule I receive many interjections, but to-night there has been hardly one. When the shooting war began in Korea, Labour made no move to help in the recruitment of the men who later fought to preserve the liberty of this country.",63
109,The CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Order l The honourable member's time has expired.,63
110,Mr EDMONDS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Herbert) [9.48] - We all like the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull), but he is an amazing gentleman who can always be relied upon to make the most astonishing outbursts, especially in regard to defence. He said very, very clearly to-night, leaving nothing to the imagination, that in his opinion at least, the Labour party was opposed to any form of defence for this country. He conveniently forgets that in 1941 Mr Howson - The honourable member is going back to those days againl",63
111,Mr EDMONDS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I know that the truth hurts, but somebody once said that one could not tell the truth too often. I remind the Government-althoug h it does not like to be reminded of it-that in 1941, when the Liberal party and the Australian Country party had a majority in both Houses, Australia was at war, and it was the Labour party under the great John Curtin that geared this country for an all-out war effort. I remind honourable members opposite, whether they like it or not. that in those days, although the present Government parties had a majority in both Houses of the Parliament, they abdicated their responsibilities to the nation in the middle of a war. It was the late John Curtin, and his policies that brought this country to a full state of war and, finally, to victory itself. That is not going to prevent me from reminding them of the truth. When the late John Curtin took over the responsibilities of Prime Minister and of the Government of this country, Australia's industries were still producing peace-time, and, in many cases, luxury goods. The great John Curtin, with the Labour party behind him, organized those industries and set them to the task of producing goods required for the war effort; and I challenge any member on the Government side to deny that. Mr Howson - I do.",63
112,Mr EDMONDS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Is the great director Who sits opposite and who has no experience at all in this Parliament, and very little outside of it, prepared to deny that I am stating facts? Yet honourable members opposite get up and say that the great and grand Australian Labour party is not prepared to defend this country! So much for the suggestion by honourable members Opposite that the Australian Labour party is not prepared to do anything for the defence of this country. I do not like distinguishing between one speech and another during any debate, but after the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) had spoken to-night, there was no necessity for any other honourable member on this side to speak at all. Mr Cramer - Then sit down.",63
113,Mr EDMONDS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The Minister for the Army (Mr Cramer) suggests that I sit down. I am not going to sit down, because I have something to say to him. Government supporters interjecting,",63
114,The CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,Order ! There is far too much interjecting. I ask honourable members to remain silent.,63
115,Mr EDMONDS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I always get a good hearing. I do not know whether on this occasion I have been sorted-out for interjections, but nobody seems to worry when interjections are made while I am speaking. In fact, I do not worry much about them - myself. The Minister for the Army cited a long list of figures to-night in an effort - explain how the money that was made avail.able to the Department of the Army was 'expended. At least I must give credit to him for being prepared to rise and defend - 1 say "" defend "" advisedly-the expenditure of this money by the Department of the Army. That is certainly more than we get from the Minister for Air (Mr Townley) - or the Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride) who represents the Minister for the Navy (Senator O'Sullivan) in this cham-ber. The Minister for the Army told us about countless millions and hundreds - of thousands and heavens knows what; but to took great care not to tell us exactly :how the money was expended. - Mr Cramer - I did.",63
116,Mr EDMONDS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The Minister told us that so much was spent on this and so much was spent on that, but he did not go further and give details of the expenditure; - and I can understand his reason for failing to do so. Mr Cramer - I will have a private session with the honourable member and give bim the details.",64
117,Mr EDMONDS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I do not want a private session. It is not a matter for me; it is a matter for this committee. The Minister for the Army, the Minister for Air and the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy have a responsibility to tell us exactly how the money is being expended. I do not think any person in this Parliament or in Australia would complain about the expenditure of £190,000,000 a year on defence if he could be assured that the money was being spent intelligently; but we are not certain of that. Concern about the way the money is expended is felt not by honourable members of the Opposition alone. All honourable members are equally concerned about it. The Minister for Defence has made a statement, and the Minister for the Army has made a statement, but neither of them can feel very happy in view of what is being said in newspaper editorials and other press statements as well as by people outside the Parliament as to what is taking place. I do not think they are worried so much about the amount of the expenditure as they are about the way in which the money is being expended, and I am confident that no person would imagine that national service to training and all the other ancillaries associated with the training of troops or air or naval personnel would cost £190,000,000. When the sum of £190,000,000 is mentioned, one thinks immediately of big projects. After all, the Government has had £200,000,000 for two years now, and it is to have £190,000,000 this year, and many big projects could have been embarked upon with all that money. The Minister for Defence Production (Sir Eric Harrison), who is now on his way to Mayfair, made a great song about St. Mary's munitions factory. The estimated expenditure for St. Mary's is £23,000,000, but what will happen when that money has been spent? What purpose will St. Mary's serve? Its purpose is to produce all the items needed for training and preparation for warfare, but so niggardly has this Government been and so unintelligent has its approach been that it would seem to have the idea that the personnel who are trained will be ready waiting at St. Mary's to be issued with the equipment. The intelligent approach would be to transport the products of St. Mary's to the troops. After all, these things have to be taken hundreds of miles, but this Government has not had the intelligence to work out exactly how they are to be transported. At the moment, we have what might be called a hill-billy road system throughout Australia, and the Government is determined not to do anything about the construction of roads. In those circumstances, it is probable that it will not be possible to transport the products of St. Mary's to points where they are to be used by the troops. When the Government talks about an expenditure of £190,000,000, is it not logical to argue that a good deal of that money should be spent an the construction of defence roads? Mr Bowden - No .",64
118,Mr EDMONDS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden), with his great knowledge, says it is not logical. At least, it is good to know where he stands. He says by way of interjection that he does not believe that one penny of the £190,000,000 should be spent on the preparation of defence roads in this country. How is this £190,000,000 to be spent? The Minister for the Army said to-night that a substantial part of it will be expended on the national training scheme. Mr Cramer - That is right.",64
119,Mr EDMONDS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I want to make it clear that I am not authorized to speak for the Opposition and, therefore, I do not pretend to do so; but my personal opinion is that up to the present time the national training scheme has been a complete farce. What is more, it seems that the Government believes as I do because, overnight, it has decided that the whole system has to be changed. Mr Cramer - Who said it has decided that?",65
120,Mr EDMONDS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"As I understand the report attributed to the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies). he said that the whole system has to be changed. He says, first of all, that the intake has to be reduced and that the period of training has to be reduced. Mr Cramer - Who said that?",65
121,Mr EDMONDS,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The Minister for the Army is not following the traditions of an intelligent Minister, because he just will not let anybody else speak. I am saying that is a statement attributed to the Prime Minister himself. The Minister for the Army should be very careful about interjecting because on one occasion he made a certain statement which put him in such a position that he had not the courage to speak again for three or four weeks. I repeat that that statement has been attributed to the Prime Minister.",65

HOLT (Darebin) [10.8] - In this group of Estimates, the committee is asked to approve of the provision of funds for the Department of Supply. That means, in fact, that the Government is seeking funds to expend on the provision of facilities for further warlike atomic exnlosions. In the light of reasons I shall give, it seems incomprehensible that this Parliament-and in particular this Government-and the people of Australia should attempt to condone and facilitate, to aid and abet, the continuance of these explosions in and around Australia. It is useless for the Government to say that these tests are being made for peaceful purposes because power produced for peaceful purposes can similarly be used for warlike purposes, particularly when it is used in the hands of a highly industrially skilled nation such as West Germany. Opposition to the continuance of these experimental explosions has been worldwide and the opposition to further atomic tests has significant elements which speak for themselves. I shall deal first with some of the Australian expressions of opinion. The Australian Labour party, at its biennial conference in Hobart in 1954, called upon the Government to cease any further experimental bomb explosions. Similarly, the Parliamentary Labour party last month, through its leader. Dr Evatt, called upon the Government not to permit any further explosions of this nature. Two weeks ago, the Australian Labour party federal executive in Canberra statedThis federal executive affirms the Labour party's unqualified opposition to the continued experimentation of nuclear weapons by way of explosions and atomic bombs. The United Kingdom Labour party conference at Blackpool, representing 6,000,000 persons, last week unanimously passed a similar resolution, in the United States of America, the Democratic Presidential candidate, Mr Adlai Stevenson, in announcing the Democratic party's policy, called upon the United States to set an example in leadership by stopping atomic large-scale explosions. Why? Why should the progressive elements in the community in our world be so forthright and dogmatic in their tion to this insanity? The reason is that sane, thinking people cannot ignore the authoritative warnings that have been issued from time to time by internationally minded and world-renowned authorities. Research Council of the National Academy of Science stated in its report for page 2It is generally agreed lhat, in ihe peace-lime development of atomic energy, man has been lucky. He has been dealing with an enormous whose potential effects he has only dimly understood. Obviously, it will not do to allow nuclear plants to spring up ad lib. all over the world. At the moment, the greatest threat to mankind from radiation arises from the repeated explosions of atomic bombs by the United States, Great Britain and Soviet Russia. As scientific pronouncements on this matter become more readily understood by ordinary persons like myself, there is widespread uneasiness and national alarm, despite official announcements from time to time. I ask the Minister for Supply (Mr Beale)-and I do not do this from political motives-whethe r he, or any one else in Australia, can say that, as a result of the atomic bomb explosions that have occurred here, there will not be any genetic ill effects from radiation on any Australian. The scientific report to which I have referred statesWe ought to keep all our expenditures of radiation exposure as low as possible. Mr Beale - Is the honourable member quoting from the American report? Mr R. W. HOLT - Yes . The report continuesFrom the point of view of genetics, they are all bad. Then we have the British report, which was recently published in the United Kingdom. Referring to radiation effects, it statesWe cannot ignore the possibility that, if the rate of firing increases and, particularly, if a greater number of thermo-nuclear weapons is used we could, within the lifetime of some now living, be approaching levels at which ill effects will be produced in a small number of the population. Mr Killen - What is the number on the page on which that extract appears? Mr R. W. HOLT - I cannot tell the honourable member because I have not the printed report before me. Mr Beale - Is the honourable member opposispeaking now of hydrogen bombs? Mr R. W. HOLT - Yes , I am speaking of all types of bombs in this categoryatomic bombs, hydrogen and cobalt bombs. Professor Toynbee, in the third of the The Dyason lectures delivered at Melbourne in July last stated, as reported in the Mel1956, at bourne ""Age "" of 26th JulyThe only ultimate solution for mankind now that it possessed immensely destructive weapons was to bring those weapons under the control of some new force single world-wide authority. Previously, on 19th June, the Governor of New South Wales, Lieutenant-General Sir John Northcott, who saw the effects of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima, when he was in command in Japan, statedNo matter what the scientists may think politically, if the world is to survive, this element, which can mean so much to us in peace, must never again be used against mankind. Finally, on 25th May last, at a closed hearing before a United States Senate subcommittee, Lieutenant-General Gavin said in a statement which was released later officially, and was published in the ""' Christian Science Monitor"" dated 29th June, 1956, saidWashington was stunned by the release ot official Army estimates that a full-scale nuclear attack on the USSR. would kill several hundred million people, including probably millions of the United States own allies outside the Soviet Union, depending on which way the wind blew. So it would appear that so little knowledge is possessed now that the survival of humanity depends upon which way the wind blows. That might sound frivolous, but I assure honourable members that it is not. It rests squarely upon the three great .powers-Grea t Britain, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics-to come to an agreement in the banning of atomic warlike explosions, for those three powers, so far, are the only manufacturers of atomic weapons. While atomic power remains the monopoly of the three great powers, there is some hope of agreement. Once other powers acquire the same power, agreement will be more difficult. In Western Europe, West Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and Holland, under the project known as Euratom, have been striving to set up a western European atomic authority. Atomic power may be used for peaceful purposes, but we know that, in highly skilled hands, there is no difference between the possibilities of atomic power for peaceful and warlike purposes. We are all agreed that atomic warfare should be banned and, with it, any further experiments. Why? Because every one knows that, in atomic war, there will be no victor and that we do not possess sufficient information of the effects that radiation will have on the human species if further uncontrolled experiments are carried out. Almost every Christian cV:rch has demanded that further atom bomb explosions be abandoned. Clear-thinking statesmen throughout the world have demanded their cessation. The British Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Eden, announced last July that Great Britain would shortly have the hydrogen bomb. At the same time, he welcomed the statements by the Russian leaders that atomic warfare was such that no country would be prepared tolaunch an H bomb attack. With the lessening of east-west tension,, we may now have the only opportunitythe last opportunity-to obtain agreement for a cessation of the atomic arms race pending the setting up of international control as recommended by the Americanscientists' report. Are we to let fear, suspicion and greed deprive the world of thehope of survival? We should not leave it to the United States and the Soviet alone. We must voice our support now lest we perish. Our hope rests only in the setting up of an international authority as recommended in the American report, and as agreed to by the United Nations Assembly last year. It suggested an authority todirect the use of atomic power for peaceful purposes. We hope and pray that the necessary control will be vested in such artauthority on an international plane, and' that the three great powers will agree fo it. If, as Mr Adlai Stevenson has said, the United States should give a lead, is there any reason why the small nations like Australia, which gave such a vital lead to the United Nations in its formative years, should not set the example and call for a cessation of this form of nuclear insanity, which is affecting all of us today? I think that it behoves this Government, and all' parties of all governments in British-speaking nations, to demand that this type of insanity cease. So far as humanity is concerned, if it does not cease, we will cease. I reiterate the quotation which was made this afternoon by my friend, the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Cairns) of a statement by Nelson RockefellerTo achieve lasting peace, security and well-being in the world, we must join forces in air economic offensive to root out hunger, poverty, illiteracy and disease. I say that we can do it now; we may not have the opportunity again. Just as we are attempting economically to assist our Asian neighbours through the Colombo planand such admirable schemes, the real test of the bona fides of western civilization could 1 not in any more definite way be met now than by a unified demand that the continued explosion of warlike atomic weapons cease forthwith.",65
123,Mr CASEY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"La Trobe-Minister for .External Affairs) [10.22] - It is not my function to reply to the honourable member for Darebin (Mr R. W. Holt), who has just resumed his seat. What he said 1I have no doubt will be replied to by my friend - and colleague, the Minister for Supply (Mr. Beale). But I should like, in the shortest time that I can, just to put honourable members in possession of a little necessary information about the item appearing at the top - of page 94 of the Estimates, in the section devoted to defence services, headed "" Other 'Services "", and readingUnder control of Department ol External Affairs. Division No. 209K - Economi c assistance to support defence programme of South-East Asia treaty organization member countries£250,000. What this item refers to may not be quite clear to honourable gentlemen, and 1 want in the briefest of terms to attempt to describe its purpose. In March of last year, on behalf of the - Government, I attended a meeting of the South-East Asia Treaty Organization Council in Karachi, and whilst there, in the course of what 1 had to say on behalf of the Australian Government, and with the authority of the Government, I said that I would recommend the provision of £2,000,000 worth of what I described at that time as twilight aid. That £2,000,000 finds its reflection in the £250,000, which is enshrined in this year's budget Estimates under Division No. 209K. The expenditure is under the control of my friend and colleague, the Minister for Defence (Sir Philip MCBride) and myself. For techni-cal Treasury reasons it is described in the Estimates as being "" Under control of Department of External Affairs "", but that is merely a Treasury shorthand means of - saying that the actual accountancy in respect of this item is dealt with by the Department of External Affairs. The situation is this: As honourable 'bers are aware, there are eight members the South-east Asia Treaty Organization, - of which three members are Asian, namely Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines. The United States of America, of course, gives massive aid on the military side, under a very wide variety of headings, to these three Asian countries. The total aid represents very large sums of money. We in Australia, keen members of Seato, believing, as we do, that the organization is a means of deterring aggression and war in south and south-east Asia, and also wanting to show our bona fides as members of the organization and to do what we can to help, particularly our three Asian partners, have evolved what I called at the time this twilight aid. After all, I think that all of us in Australia know very well that we have not shooting Weapons and ammunition to spare even for our friends. All that we are able to manufacture in Australia we need for ourselves. But defence services need more than shooting weapons and ammunition. They need a very wide range of other equipment. So I was empowered, on behalf of the Government, to make the proposal to the last Seato Council meeting at Karachi that Australia would provide, if it was thought useful and it was wanted, up to £2,000,000 worth of aid that was intermediate between normal civil aid such as we give under the Colombo plan on the one hand and what might be called shooting weapons and ammunition on the other hand. At the time. I gave instances of such items as defence mechanical equipment, trucks and, maybe, bulldozers, and other forms of equipment used by thefightingservices, cloths for uniforms, tinned foodstuffs, training of those countries' officers, and non-commissioned officers in Australia, communications equipment, and a wide range of other equipment of which I gave some typical examples. It was proposed that we would provide these items and services to these three Asian countries, our partners in the organization, up to a total value of £2,000,000. That is the simple story of the appearance of this item in the Estimates. This £250,000 is an earnest of our putting into effect the pledge to provide £2,000,000 worth of intermediate aid between civil aid and straight defence, shooting weapons and the memlike. I may say that the provision for of the expenditure of £250,000 is the beginning of the expenditure of £2,000,000. Wc have already sought from Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines, their advice as to the sort of things they would care to have under these headings, and that process is fairly well advanced. It has not been a very rapid business up to the present, and it may well turn out that over this and the next financial year the £2,000,000 will not be expended, but, with the approval of the Government, I shall seek the authority of the Parliament for future appropriations under this heading as time goes on. 1 may say that this item is, of course, wholly distinct and apart from, and additional to, Colombo plan provisions of aid for South and South-East Asian countries. It is a demonstration of Australia's keenness on the Seato arrangement generally, which we believe has already had, and will continue to have, a positive effect on the security of the countries involved, in other words, broadly speaking, the countries of South East Asia and, at one very short remove, Australia. I commend the item to honourable members.",68
124,Mr CLAREY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Bendigo) [10.29] - The Department of Supply and the Department of Defence Production are now under discussion in the debate on the Estimates. The money provided for the administration and functioning of both those departments comes from the total vote of £190,000,000 that is to be made available for defence services. According to the Estimates, last year the Department of Supply spent £12,796,000. The Estimates now before the committee provide for expenditure of £12,030,000. The Department of Defence Production spent £12,304,000 last year, and the estimated expenditure this year is £19,891,000; so that last year the combined expenditure of the two departments was slightly more than £25,000,000, and this year it will be approximately £30.000,000. I mention that because both of those departof ments produce essential equipment for the armed services. Obviously, if the various government factories are in full production, not only is the valuable plant and machinery fully utilized, but also, employment is provided in non-governmental establishments, thus helping to stabilize the economy. I think that all honourable members will agree that the most important defence services for an island continent are the Air Force and the Navy. In those circumstances, one might expect that expenditure on the production of essential equipment for the defence of the Commonwealth would: be concerned mainly with those two arms. Unfortunately, the Estimates do not give us any idea of the kind of work that is being done, the raw materials that are being used and the type of equipment being turned out. In other words, we are not given even a bird's eye view of exactly how the equipment for our defence forces is being improved or increased in volume. For that reason, we find ourselves at a disadvantage. Sir Eric Harrison - I hope to make good that deficiency later in the debate.",69
125,Mr CLAREY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I assure the Minister for Defence Production (Sir Eric Harrison) that that will be very helpful, particularly to honourable members on this side of the chamber who are gravely concerned about the future employment position at munitions plants. It seems to me that, in regard to certain of the munitions plants, there has been an entire lack of long-range planning. I bring to the notice of the committee the position of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Proprietary Limited at Fishermen's Bend, which is not a government concern, but which depends upon both the Department of Supply and the Department of Defence Production for orders to enable it to function. It was started at the beginning of World War II . and has been engaged exclusively on the manufacture of aircraft since then. Until a few months ago, it employed approximately 4,500 persons, and has turned out very creditable aircraft for Australian defence purposes. Some time ago, the factory received an order for 90 Sabre jet fighters. Last week, the 61st of those aircraft was completed and towed off the production line. The balance of the order will be completed before the end the financial year. That, of course, is a great achievement on the part of both the management of the factory and the men who are doing the work, but it is regrettable that, when that order has been completed, there will be no further work for the factory because no other order has been placed with it. Perhaps the only work that could be done there, in the absence of an order from the Government, would be repairing aircraft. Without some such work, the wonderful plant and machinery, and the large staff of skilled tradesmen and technicians, would have absolutely no work to do. So far, the Government has not announced its policy concerning the new type of fighter aircraft which it proposes order, and in any event, it must be borne in mind that, before production could be commenced in Australia, considerable time would have to be spent by the staff in familiarizing themselves with the plans, in tooling up the plant, and in inspection of overseas factories in order to see the exact manner in which the aircraft is constructed. I understand that the Royal Australian Air Force has asked for a new American aircraft known as the F104, and I also understand that the United States Government has made it clear that it is prepared to approve supply of a number of these aircraft to the Australian Government. Whether the offer will remain open indefinitely. I do not know, but so far, there has been no announcement of Government policy in respect of the new aeroplane that is to be built by the corporation when the Sabre jetfightersare no longer required. The unfortunate result of all of this is that, whereas a few months ago approximately 4,500 people were employed at the factory, that number has now dwindled to 3,500, and as the number of Sabre jet aircraft to be completed diminishes, more and more of the staff will go off. It is expected that, in a few months, an additional 1,000 people will go off, which will reduce the staff to 2,000 or 2,500. As honourable members know, it is not possible to assemble a staff of skilled technicians and tradesmen in a short space of time. This organization has been operating for fifteen years and during that time has assembled a wonderful staff of technicians and tradesmen. Once that staff begins to disperse, it will be a long time before the corporation will be able to re-assemble suitable staff do the kind of work that it has been doing during recent years and which it did so efficiently during the war. I suggest to the Minister that this problem should receive the immediate attention of the Government. In the remaining few minutes at my disposal I want to deal with defence factories generally. They include the ball-bearing factory at Echuca; the ordnance factory at Bendigo, in my own constituency; several factories al Maribyrnong, Victoria; the small arms factory at Lithgow; the fuse factory being built at St. Mary's; the Department of Defence Production factory at Fishermen's Bend; the various dockyards in New South Wales; and the dockyard at to Williamstown. The question of what those organizations are to do during the current financial year is causing a good deal of concern, not only to the people who are employed by them, but also to their managements. There is a widespread feeling of insecurity. It is known that severe retrenchment is to take place. Why retrenchments should be made is difficult to understand when it is remembered, as 1 pointed out earlier, that the total vote for the two departments for this financial year is nearly £7,000,000 more than it was last year. Sir Eric Harrison - Approximately £6,000,000 of that will go to St. Mary's.",69
126,Mr CLAREY,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"That may be so. Nevertheless, approximately £7,000,000 more will be spent by those two departments this year than was spent last year. That being so. it is very hard to appreciate the reason for retrenchments. It is certain that orders are not being received by the factories. At the Bendigo ordnance factory, overtime has been cut out and certain work upon which the employees were engaged has been slowed down. I believe that within the last week or two a policy has been evolved for these factories, but unfortunately nobody knows what it is. 1 hope that during the course of the debate upon these Estimates either the Minister for Defence Production or the Minister for Supply (Mr Beale) will be able to make a statement to the committee indicating to what extent retrenchment will be made, the number of persons who will be dismissed, and why these things are taking place when the total proposed vote for both departments this year is, as I have already pointed to out, almost £7,000,000 more than was expended by them during last financial year. I cannot say what will be the effect in relation to the factories in Melbourne beyond saying that wherever unemployment occurs it has a snowballing effect. Not only will persons employed in the government factories be affected but also persons in outside firms which supply materials to the government factories. Whether we like it or not, more and more people will be dismissed. I also point out to the Ministers concerned and to the committee generally that retrenchments in factories that are concentrated in country districts will have a severe economic effect. Echuca, which is not very far from Bendigo, has a ball-bearing factory. So far, the men engaged there have been employed constantly, and the regular payment of wages has a very big effect upon the economic life of the town. The effect of a fall in the weekly distribution of wages in a small place like Echuca would be severe. The same thing applies to the City of Bendigo, which is the centre of the constituency that I represent. At the present time, 1,200 persons are employed at the Bendigo ordnance factory. A substantial reduction of that staff would have tremendous impact upon the economic life of the city and a disastrous effect upon the employees themselves, because in the smaller country towns the avenues of employment for displaced employees are by no means as great as in the capital cities. As the Minister for Defence Production knows, retrenchment would mean that in many cases the displaced employees would have to sell their homes and go elsewhere. Then, when the time arrived for a greater production of war-time equipment, the government factories would have the same problem in building up their staffs as would the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation Proprietary Limited. I hope that a general statement on this matter will be made to the committee, because the employees, who have a feeling of insecurity, are entitled to know where they stand, whether their jobs will last, and whether there will be a general decrease of the manufacture of equipment for Australia's armed forces. That equipment is essential, and unless it is available the defence forces will not be able to give the service that is expected of them.",70
127,Mr ERWIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Ballarat) [10.44] - Le t us glance at nuclear and projected missile fare in retrospect. During World War 11., we heard a lot about Hitler's secret weapon, and we know only too well the reign of terror that later fell on Great Britain with the introduction of the V2 projected missile. From that moment onwards it became clear to all thinking people-strategists , economists and scientists alike-that this was new weapon of warfare. So at the end of 1945 and the beginning of 1946, Great Britain set out to find within the British Commonwealth of Nations a suitable site for the testing of projected missiles and nuclear weapons. Mr Curtin - And they brought them toAustralia.",71
128,Mr ERWIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"I must say how very fortunate we are that Australia is geographically suited for that purpose. It is time that weceased to look at nuclear warfare with somescepticism. It is real; we must accept it.. We are in the atomic age, and for Opposition members to say that we should try toresist nuclear weapons is like endeavouring to go back to the penny-farthing bicycle anri to place our motor cars in the garagea Following England's choice of the Woomera. site for the testing of long range projected* missiles there came two mighty industries to Australia-the electronics industry and the aerodynamics industry. We are most fortunate in having those two industrieshere, because, as a result of their being established and the inpouring of capital h> this country, we are twenty years ahead of our time. Australia, no doubt, is the nation, of the future. Last year, England spent £60,000,000just think, gentlemen, £60,000,000-o n thisproject in comparison with our expenditure of £ 10,000,000. Without a doubt, the establishment of the Woomera long range weapons testing ground is meaning and will, mean something tremendous for Australia. Mr Curtin - They ought to get rid of it. and send it somewhere else. Mr Beale - A Labour government established it. Wake up! Mr Clarey - It established a rocket range.",71
129,Mr ERWIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"At the Woomera testing: ground we experimented, first, with short range projectiles-air-to-air , ground-to-air,, war- and air-to-ground missiles. We are nowdeveloping a long-range deterrent missile. The greater the degree to which we can. develop long range projectiles and thermonuclear physics, the nearer we will come tomaking Australia the nation about which we so much dream. Our contribution is a contribution not only to the British Comthe monwealth of Nations, but also to the FreeWorld. We are living in a country that fc large geographically but which has only asmall man-power, and we could not have hoped to develop the two existing testing grounds by ourselves. So I say, sir, that the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) a few days ago about the re-thinking of our defence expenditure was a wonderful thing. Without a doubt, we are now entering a new phase-the atomic phase. Warfare of the type we have known is, to a large degree, becoming obsolescent. We were living in a period in which we were completely dependent economically on coal. We are now living in a period in which we are dependent economically on oil. We are entering a phase in which we shall be completely dependent on uranium. I say that this testing ground for atomic and guided missiles-let us not forget that the one is closely related to the otherwill bring about the early development of our uranium fields, and so will help us greatly in that direction. It is only by developing the long-range guided missile and the thermo-nuclear bomb that we can hope tp prevent war. This development is the means of preventing a third world war. There is no doubt whatever in my mind that that is so. So do not let us say that this kind of experiment is dangerous and that we should not have it in Australia. Let us accept this thing. Let us get to know this thing. I feel that it is only by the proper understanding of atomic power and atomic warfare that we shall really do something. It is the development of the atomic bomb that will give us a great deal of knowledge about the development of atomic power. I feel that in three years' time there be atomic generating stations all over England. In view of the Suez situation and the position of England's oil supplies, the development of nuclear power stations will be a grand thing for that country. Do not let us think for a moment that we in Australia can isolate ourselves from England. We cannot. We often hear the question, ""Why should we worry about England? After all, we should be directing our thoughts towards America"". I am afraid that if England goes down economically, we shall go down economically. England's affairs are our affairs. The true knowledge of atomic power will help Great Britain to such an extent now and in the future that, once again, it will be and we shall be members of a great British Commonwealth of Nations that we are planning.",71
130,Mr MAKIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Bonython) [10.55] - I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to express to the committee some views that, possibly, some honourable members have overlooked in their consideration of this matter. I associate myself with the honourable member for Darebin (Mr R. W. Holt). He delivered a very thoughtful speech, which, I feel, will receive considerable public support. Whatever one may challenge in that speech, one cannot doubt the sincerity of the man. The great sentiment that he expressed carries conviction, and will receive strong support from the Australian community. Some honourable gentlemen opposite indicated that it was Labour which sanctioned the initial work for the conduct of these experiments. I should like to say. in reply, that those honourable gentlemen should try to be more accurate. The sanction was given in connection with directed missiles but not in regard to atomic blasts. There is a very great difference between the use of these particular areas for the testing of guided missiles, and their use for the purposes that are under consideration by the committee at the moment. That being so, I hope that no mistake will be made in future as to the nature of the sanction given originally by the Labour party in that matter. My principal reason for taking part in this discussion is to ask for an assurance more definite than that which has been received up to the moment regarding the will safety of the native people. We have been concerned about the radio-active clouds, which have been caused by these nuclear explosions. There has been an earnest desire to explode the atomic bombs under climatic conditions which would result in the dispersal of the radio-active clouds to places far removed from centres of population. The objective has been that the cloud should spread itself over uninhabited areas. As we are most concerned about the possible effects of atomic blasts on our civil community, I want to know, on humanitarian grounds, what provision is being made to ensure the safety of the aborigines. It seems that there has not been the proper understanding of the situation, or the desire to safeguard the native population from the effects of the explosions that there should have been. Mr Beale - That is not true.",72
131,Mr MAKIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The aborigines may have been removed from the immediate area of ihe blast, but they have not been removed from those areas over which the cloud will pass. The unfortunate effects of that cloud are likely to be felt by our native population. Therefore, we have a definite responsibility to see that the aborigines shall not be exposed to any of the perils resulting from the experiments. I voice the sentiments of many people who are eager to see that these natives, who are unable to speak for themselves or protest in any way, should be given protection. The Government should make certain that they receive that humane consideration which the circumstances justify. Consequently, no danger should be allowed to come to the areas that they inhabit. Their lives are just as valuable as those of any white person, and they should not be exposed to risk any more than should people in the settled areas of civilization. I ask the Minister to intimate that full provision will be made to protect them, although I cannot see how the drift of the atomic cloud over the areas they inhabit can be prevented. Mr Beale - It does not drift over their territory.",73
132,Mr MAKIN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"The Minister is not able to direct the drift of the cloud; that is deterexpired. mined by weather conditions, and I am asking that care should be taken, as far as is humanly possible, to keep it away from native areas. 1I have been informed that about 2,000,000 acres have been taken out of native reserves and used as an atomic experimental area. What has been done to compensate the native people for some of the best hunting country and some of the best circulated:watered areas of which they have been deprived? Surely the Government should acknowledge some responsibility to them, although this may be a matter of no consequence to some honourable members who have little regard for broad humanities. running The only consideration that weighs with including ihem is what suits the high purpose of their particular outlook, but that is not the view held by a large number of Australians, taxation law? who are desirous that some consideration to 2.andIs from should be given to these helpless aborigines. I endorse the sentiments expressed by the laws? honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Clarey) the concerning the workers in defence in various parts of Australia that are likely to be affected by any new defence schemes evolved by the Government. When I was Minister for Munitions I was responsible for the establishment of a ball bearing factory at Echuca, and other factories which were set up for the purpose of implementing the decentralization policy of the Labour government. It would be a tragedy to the workers engaged in the Echuca factory if production there should cease. It is playing as important a part in peace-time as it did during the war, when it produced materials which could not be imported. The honourable member for Bendigo feels similarly about the factory to which he referred. It would be a great loss not only to the local population, but also to the engineering industry throughout Australia, if employment at these establishments of men with technical skill and knowledge should be curtailed or terminated to implement the Government's mistaken policy of economy. Such action would be detrimental also to Australia's defence preparations. The aim of any government should be to have workers everywhere profitably employed, and factories such as these are able to produce materials valuable in peace-time as well as for defence needs.",73
133,The CHAIRMAN,AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE,"Mr Adermann) Order! The honourable member's time has Progress reported. House adjourned at 11.11 p.m. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. The following answers to questions were Taxation. Mr Kearney asked the Treasurer, upon notice I. Is the cost of purchasing, maintaining and motor cars used by business organizations, the cost of transporting directors and managers to and from their homes and places of business an allowable deduction under existing it a fact that the cost of employees' fares their homes and places of work is not an allowable deduction under existing taxation 3. If so, will the Government take action to alter law to permit as an allowable deduction the cost factories of fares to and from work? Sir Arthur Fadden - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The cost of motor cars used by a taxpayer in the ordinary course of business is deductible noticeby way of a depreciation allowance at the rate of 15 per cenl. per annum. The cost of mainof taining and running motor cars used for that purpose is deductible in the year in which the cost is incurred. As a general rule, an employer would be entitled to deduc.ion of the cost of transporting employees, whether they be directors, managers, persons employed in other capacities to and from, their homes and place of employment, if that transport is undertaken as an ordinary matter of business. Directors and managers incurring diture on their own account for fares between their homes and their place of work would not be entitled to any deduction of the amount incurred. 2. Yes; such expenses are regarded as being a private or domestic nature the deduction of which is expressly excluded from deductible expenditure by section 51(1) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act. 3. Similar proposals have been considered from lime to time but to date no amendment which would prove a suitable alternative to the existing position has been found. Mr Ward asked the Treasurer, upon notice I. Is it a fact lhat there have been cases where, under the terms of their employment, employees have been supplied with overalls by the employer, and that subsequently, either by mutual agreement or by order of the appropriate arbitration authority, this practice has been discontinued, and, in substitution, a financial payment has been made lo the employee to meet the expense involved'.' 2. If so, has the Commissioner of Taxation refused to allow this amount as an allowable deduction for taxation purposes? 3. Will the Treasurer take appropriate steps to have all moneys spent by workers in the purchase of overalls or special industrial clothing declared an allowable deduclion? 4. If he is not prepared to adopt this suggestion, will he seek other means to rectify this injustice ro employees? Sir A r t h u r Fadden - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l lows:1. No doubt, there are cases of this nature. 2. The Commissioner of Taxation informs me that he is not aware of any case where an employee has been refused a claim for the deduction of the cost of purchasing and maintaining overalls if the employee has received from his employer an allowance specifically for the purpose of meeting those costs and the full facts have been disclosed in his return. 3 and 4. The Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act provides that expenditure necessarily incurred in gaining or producing assessable income is deductible so long as the expenditure is not ol -- private, domestic or capital nature. I l is considered that this provision is adequate to meet the circumstances described by the honourable member. Mr Lawrence asked the Treasurer, upon In the proposed legislation to increase the value life assurance premiums as allowable taxation deductions, will the limit imposed on employers' and other persons' contributions to funds for the benefit of employees, under sections 66 and 79 of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution or Assessment Act, be also increased to £300? Sir Arthur Fadden - The answer to th< expenhonorable member's question is as follows:No. When the proposed legislation is enacted, the annual deductions of payments to provide life assurance and superannuation benefits for an employee may be as high as £500, comprised of £300 of paid by the employee himself and £200 paid by the employer. In some cases, the deductible payments may be even higher than £500, for example, where 5 per cent, of the employee's annual remuneration is greater than £200 or where the Commissioner of Taxation, having regard to the special circumstances of the case, considers it lo be reasonable to allow an amount greater than £200 or 5 per cent, of the employee's annual remuneration. Under prevailing conditions, the Government has not felt able further to liberalize these provisions. Myxomatosis. Mr Bryant asked the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research, upon notice I. In what areas has myxomatosis been most successful? 2. What evidence is available of increased production attributable to this section of the organization's work? Mr Casey - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Myxomatosis has been most successful in the main rabbit-infested areas of south-eastern Australia extending as far north as the northern limit of the rabbit's distribution in Queensland. During this last season, for the first time, it has become very widespread and effective in Tasmania. In Western Australia, myxomatosis has been less spectacular, but some useful outbreaks have occurred. 2. Regarding increased production due to the spread of myxomatosis, it has been estimated that in one year alone, 1952-53, following the main spread of myxomatosis, the income of wool growers was increased by at least £30,000,000 due to reduction in rabbit numbers and the competition for pasture. Increased wool production of this order has been assisted since then by the continuing low level of the rabbit population. In addition to the increased wool production due to an increase in the wool cut per sheep, it has been possible to graze many more sheep and cattle. In farming areas the damage to crops by rabbits has been reduced from a very high to a low level. In addition huge economies have resulted from the reduction in the cost of rabbit control measures. And finally, there is the long term and immeasurable benefit to pastures and consequent reduction in soil erosion, due to the elimination of overgrazing by rabbits. Detailed surveys of individual properties confirm the general picture of the enormous increases in rural production due to the reduction in the rabbit population by myxomatosis. It will be wise for land-holders to capitalize on this situation, and to do their utmost to eradicate, if possible, the surviving remnants of the rabbit population on their properties.
