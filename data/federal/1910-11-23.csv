1,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Is the Acting Treasurer in a position to say what arrangements have been, or will be, made for the hearing of applications for invalid pensions in country districts such as Bendigo, Ballarat, Kalgoorlie, Bathurst, and Newcastle? I understand that special arrangements have been made for the metropolitan districts.",14
2,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"So far as possible, the organization now in existence for the hearing of old-age pension cases will be used for applications for invalid pensions, and for .applications from those desiring old age pensions under the new conditions. Should the number of applications necessitate additional arrangements, the matter will be immediately attended to REFERENDA.  the Minister of Home Affairs whether, the taking of the referenda next year, the rolls used at the last election will be used, and whether supplementary rolls will also be used.

5,Mr WEST,Unknown,Has the Postmaster-General any further information regarding the ipio. arrangements with the AVireless Telegraph Company ?,14
6,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I have received the' 10.30 following letter from the company. Referring to your conversation with our chairman of directors through the telephone this day, and to the request made by you for certain information in regard to the materials and apparatus in connection with the erection of the Pennant Hills Station, we beg to reply as follows :Part of the apparatus has already been constructed at our factory, at 16 Underwood-street, Sydney. Part of the material is in stock, and will be purchased locally during the erection. Part of the apparatus, and the whole receiving plant has already been shipped, and will' arrive in Sydney before the middle of December next. Part of the apparatus has been constructed, in. Europe, and will be shipped during this month. All the rest of the apparatus and materials in connection with the station (including the mast, engine, and generator), was ordered by cable, on the 10th October last, and will arrive - in Sydney in February next. You will see from the above that no time has been lost by us in carrying out our contract in connection with the erection of the Pennant Hills Station.",14
7,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,I wish to know from the Postmaster-General whether the conin tract has yet been signed?,14
8,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,It has not been signed ,14
9,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Has the Minister taken the advice of the Crown Solicitor regarding the Government's position respecting the Wireless Telegraph Company's contract? If so, does he intend to carry out the contract which has not been signed ?",14
10,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The Department is taking the advice of the Crown Solicitor at every step.,14
11,Mr WEST,Unknown,Is it not a fact that the necessary guarantee bonds in reference to contract for the erection of wireless stations have been furnished?,14
12,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Yes .,14
13,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Is the Postwilling to inform the House as to the reason why the contract has not,14
14,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Tw o or three days ornaago, the adjournment of the House was moved to discuss this matter, and a verylong explanation was given. If the company is not what it ought to be, that is a heritage from the last Government.",14
15,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I want to knov why the contract has not been signed during the last few months ?,15
16,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The reason why it has not been signed has been on account of the difficulty of fixing upon sites. As regards Sydney, we have arrived at a satisfactory conclusion as to site, price, and everything else. The trouble now is with regard to Fremantle, where we suggested a certain site. The company turned that site down, and suggested the site on which it desires to put up its plant. Acting on the advice of Admiral Henderson, we turned down that site, and suggested a site on which we expect the company to build the station. The company was communicated with on Saturday last, and I think that a meeting was held on Monday or Tuesday to deal with our suggestion, but we have not yet had a reply. As soon as a site is fixed upon, of course, the contract will be signed.",15
17,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"Yesterday , I received a letter from the Department of the Postmaster-General pointing out that, after inspection, his officers recommended that the postal requirements of Thirroul would be met by the erection of two post-boxes at the expense of the public there. Is it the policy of the Department to grant only such postal facilities as the people are prepared to pay for ?",15
18,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I shall be glad if the honourable member will see me about the matter, or give notice of his question.",15
19,Mr FULLER,Unknown,I shall send back the letter to the Minister.,15
20,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"On the 27th October, the honourable member for Lang asked whether the late postmaster at Peak Hill had complained of overwork and applied for, and been refused, assistance. He also asked whether there is a considerable overworking in various ranks of the service at the General Post Office, Sydney. To these questions, the Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, has furnished the following replies : - ' 1. There is no instance where a postmaster in New South Wales has complained of overwork and applied for, and been refused, assistance. 2.. There is a considerable amount of overtime being woiked in the General Post Office in the Accounts and Telephone Branches owing to the want of space to allow additional officers to be emploved, and the inconvenience caused by the alterations to the building now in progress. Every possible inquiry is being made by an officer, specially deputed for the purpose, with a view to securing additional accommodation in order that temporary assistance may be engaged, and so relieve the strain on the permanent officers required to work overtime. Extreme difficulty has been experienced in obtaining oilers of accommodation of any description.",15
21,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,"the Postmaster General, upon noticeIn view of the fact that a 3,000-mile wireless telegraphy station is being built at Washington (the Federal Capital of the United States of America), which is lo have a tower 600 feet high, and about 60 feet diameter at base and about 10 feet diameter at top, built of reinforced concrete, will the Minister make provision for the chief wireless station.of the Coamonwealth to be built at the new Capital Site?",15
22,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The question of establishing a wireless telegraphy station at the Federal Capital will be shortly considered. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (for Mr. AUSTIN CHAPMAN) asked the Postmaster General, upon notice-1. Is it a fact that sorters in the General Post Office, Sydney, are compelled to work much longer hours than in the General Post Office, Melbourne, with less facilities and shorter time allowed for meal hours? 2. If so, will he take steps to bring about uniformity ?",15
23,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I am obtaining the information, and shall be glad if it is asked for on Friday morning.",15
24,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"for Mr Webster) asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice I.' Whether the Public Service Commissioner has authorized a sectional committee to report on the condition of the staff throughout the principal towns of the Commonwealth, with a view lo rebutting the recommendations of the Postal Commission ? 2. Has such committee furnished a report? 3. If so, will the Postmaster-General lay such report on the table of the House at an early date? 4. Is it a fact that such report is to furnish the necessary guidance to the Deputy Postmasters-General at the proposed conference with the Postmaster-General to consider the Commission's report?",15
25,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The following replies have been received from the Public Service Commissioner :1. No. 2, 3, and 4. See answer to No. 1. SUGAR COMMISSION.",15
26,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"Is it the intention of the Government to appoint a Commis-sion to inquire, during the recess, into the condition of the sugar industry.",15
27,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"So far as the information at hand goes, it is not considered desirable that that should be done, but a Cabinet meeting is to be held at an early date, possibly today, to consider finally the representations made on the subject, And when its decision has been arrived at, information regarding our intention will be conveyed to the House. PRESS CBE SERVICE. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Is the Minister of External Affairs yet in a position to reply to certain questions which I asked yesterday in reference to the subsidy paid to the Independent Press Cable service ?",15
28,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,No .,16
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,When may we expect the information asked for by the honourable member for Lang? We desire to know what newspapers are benefiting by this new service.,16
30,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"The subsidy is not granted to newspapers, but, on compliance with certain conditions, to a company which transmits news by cable. We do not know anything about the newspapers .which take that news.",16
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is not that more or less a quibble?,16
32,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,No .,16
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Will the Minister say whether we may expect information on the subject before ^Parliament prorogues ?,16
34,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Information has to be obtained from Sydney, and I am - writing for it, as I told the honourable member for Bendigo last night I would do. I do not know whether it will be available before Parliament is prorogued.",16
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Canno t it be telegraphed or telephoned for? Minister aware that nearly the whole of the daily newpapers in Australia, against which the subsidy was arranged, are partaking of its benefits? Is he aware that the subsidy is, in practice, more or less a subsidv to the great dailies ? Is he further aware that only about three other fresh newspapers are interested in the service?",16
36,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member is not asking a question when he merely prefaces a statement with the words "" Is he aware.""",16
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am doing what every other honourable member does everv dav.,16
38,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"When I notice it, I shall draw attention to the matter.",16
39,Mr TOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I ask the Minister if it is true that this 'kind of thing is going on. I have brought certain facts under his notice, and I ask him if he is aware of them.",16
40,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"If the honourable member asks me whether the statements which he has put forward are true, I say that they are not. If he asks me whether I am aware that things are as he says, I say that I know that they are not. Mr. JOSEPH COOK.'-Has the Minister taken any steps to inform himself as to whether any cablegrams are being sent to Australia in addition to those which are contained in the ordinary newspapers?",16
41,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,Yes . I think that this is the question on which the honourable member for Bendigo stated last night that he - wanted some information. I have asked for that information to be obtained. NA PROCLAMATION.,16
42,Mr FULLER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"After the recent visit of the Premier of New South Wales and some of his colleagues to Melbourne, it was stated in the Sydney press that they had received an indefinite promise from the Acting Prime Minister that the proclamation in connection with the taking, over of the Federal Capital site by the Commonwealth would issue before the end of this month. Can the honourable gentleman say on what date it is proposed to issue that proclamation ?",16
43,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I have not had time recently to look into the matter, but, so far as I know, no action remains to be taken except such as is purely formal. I stated last_ Friday that the proclamation would Is the be issued at the earliest possible moment, that is, in the course of a few days.",16
44,Mr WEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I wish to ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether it is not a fact that the Premier of New South Wales has furnished the Commonwealth Government with every facility to settle the question of the Yass-Canberra site? Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Government of New South Wales is doing everything that is possible to help the Commonwealth to advance.,16
45,Mr FULLER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The late Government did it, too. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. MANOEUVRE AREA, LIVERPOOL.",16
46,Mr CANN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I observe that the Federal Government has resumed land for defence purposes in Tasmania land Queensland, the latter case comprising some hundreds of acres. I should like the Minister of Home Affairs to state if the same procedure can be applied to the Liverpool manoeuvre area as was applied in those cases. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Liverpool manoeuvre area is now under the consideration of the Government of New South VVales.",16
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,And has been for the last twelve months. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Muc h longer.,17
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It is time that it was finished. Mr KING O'MALLEY - As soon as the matter can be properly arranged, there is no doubt that under the auspices or the segis of the grand Democratic Government of New South Wales everything will be fixed up to meet the wish of my honourable friend.",17
49,Mr FULLER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Fro m the answer just given by the Minister it would appear that the cause of delay in connection with the manoeuvre area at Liverpool rests with the New South Wales Government. The late Government of that State did everything to bring about a settlement.,17
50,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Order . The honourable member is transgressing the rule.,17
51,Mr FULLER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I wished to preface my question, sir. Will the Minister urge the present Government of New South Wales to have this matter settled as speedily as possible, 'so that the landholders in the area may know without delay the position in which they stand? Mr KING O'MALLEY - As soon as this session closes, I am going up to see about the matter.",17
52,Mr FULLER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,This is only humbugging the thing. Why does not the Minister get it done? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Why did not the honourable member do it?,17
53,Mr FULLER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I brought the matter almost to completion. This is only humbugging the business. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is it not extraordinary to hear honourable members who were in office for years talking to me in this way?,17
54,Mr SPEAKER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Order .,17
55,Mr FULLER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I was not there a year. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Since the ist July we have spent most of our time in this chamber, but as soon as I can go and talk to the Government of New South Wales we will probably fix up this business in twenty minutes, and so do away with the red-tape of communication. HI GH COMMISSIONER.",17
56,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I desire to ask the Minister of External Affairs whether it is true, as reported, that the Government intend to add £1,000 or £2,000 to the allowance which is provided for the High Commissioner in the Act?",17
57,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The report has not yet reached me. I have not heard of it. COMMONWEALTH OFFICES. ^ Mr Fenton - Did the Minister of External Affairs notice in yesterday's newspapers a paragraph intimating that the High Commissioner had selected a site for Commonwealth offices in London? I desire to know whether or not that - selection! is final ?,17
58,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I understood the paragraph to state that the High Commissioner had recommended a site. It. is true that he has recommended one of a number of sites which were submitted. Of course, as I have stated before, no selection will he made except by the House. AUDIT OFFICERS.",17
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"the Acting Treasurer, ufon noticeWith respect to his refusal to pay overtime to the Audit officers, will he say why officers in other Departments are paid overtime while those in the Audit Department are not so paid?",17
60,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Overtim e is granted only in cases where time in lieu cannot be arranged for. In this case arrangements can be made for allowing the officers time in lieu. NEW HEBRIDES.,17
61,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"the Minister of External Affairs, ufon notice I. Will the Minister state what is the nature of the item "" N e w Hebrides, ^750 "" (see Estimates, 1910-11, page 18)? 2. What aTe the names of the persons who received refund of duty during 1909-10? 3. Is the maize or other product of the New Hebrides on which duty is refunded grown entirely by white labour?",17
62,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The item is similar to one which has appeared on the Estimates for several years past. Its purpose is to assist British settlers in the New Hebrides by making them a grant to the extent of half the duty paid on maize imported into the Commonwealth, and to the amount of ,£4 per ton on coffee. Before 'payment is made a certificate is received from the British Resident Comniissioner that the articles have been grown by British settlers. 2. A return will be prepared giving the information desired. 3. Nothing is known on this point. ANALYTICAL DEPARTMENT.",17
63,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I. How do the rates of pay of the central staff of the Federal Analytical Department in Melbourne compare with the salaries paid for like work to the Sydney staff of the same Department? 2. How do the rates of pay of the central staff of the Federal Analytical Department in Melbourne compare with salaries paid in the Analytical Departments of the various States, except Victoria and New South Wales?",18
64,Mr TUDOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Every effort will be made to make the information desired available by tomorrow. BUDGET: ESTIMATES. In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed from 7th September, vide page 2690), on motion by Mr FisherTHE PARLIAMENT. That the item "" The President, J£I,IOO,"" be agreed to.",18
65,Mr DEAKI N,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Ballarat) [10.50] - I feel entitled to claim some credit over my colleagues, because, by considerable labour spent in what might be termed pre-hisroric research, I have satisfied myself by a perusal of the original document that there was a Budget speech delivered in a remote era of this session. an interval elapsed that the memory of man was not sufficient to satisfy us of the fact, except after an examination of what purports to be a faithful report of the speech delivered here in September last.",18
66,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Do we still speak the . same language ?,18
67,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Yes , it is not the language that is strange. There never has been such a Budget- I doubt if there ever will be such a Budget again. That is owing to a very remarkable combination of circumstances. It is also like no other Budget, inasmuch as we have, evidently by the exercise of the prophetic faculty in excelsis, the production of a balance for next June in which the receipts balance the expenditure to the last penny.",18
68,Mr HALL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,What more does the honourable member want?,18
69,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That is original.,18
70,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The finances of Australia, for some twelve months to come, are there summed up precisely, and the result stated in plain figures:-Revenue, £16,841,629; expenditure, £16,841,629. Not one penny-piece is to be left in the coffers of the Commonwealth when the Treasurer completes his first twelve months' experience. That, in itself, is a remarkable result, on which, seven months hence, we may be able to congratulate ourselves. It must have been a complex calculation, but it has been prophetically foretold with a simplicity which is absolutely charming. Then again there never has been a Budget delivered in such circumstances. Never before has a Treasurer of the Commonwealth been so absolutely free from all possible causes of apprehension as to the reception of his Budget. It came to the Opposition with some surprises; it came to my honourable friends opposite, to a majority in both Houses, without any shock, even of mild surprise. There was in that one feature another innovation worthy of note. Nor do I think that any Budget has ever been announced, certainly not in the Commonwealth, or, so far as I remember, in any State, under such favourable circumstances. The conclusion, of a constitutional obligation, which has hitherto occasioned immense anxiety to every Federal Treasurer, enabled the present Treasurer to lay before the House such a financial harvest as. had never been reaped by any predecessor. Finally, and above all, the So long bounty of nature, generous for several years, has been more lavish than ever. There never was such a Budget; there never will be In one sense, this miraculous Budget falls far short of most of its predecessors, even making allowance for the special circumstances of the case. While the balance-sheet is a political and financial curiosity, an examination of the Treasurer's exposition of it discloses a mere recapitulation of the heads of the policy of the Government, related in each case, if at all, in only the loosest way to their actual financial bearings. The recital of details was, in order, usual and necessary. Never do I remember having heard a policy propounded in many respects so remote from, and in some respects untouched by, its financial setting. In point of fact, reading the Budget speech again with a comparatively fresh mind, it appears as if it had been o84 Budget. [REPRESENTATIVES.] intended as a serial; this was the first ber, but owing to causes over which we, at least, have no control, the succeeding numbers, that were to have brought it up to date financially, will not be forthcoming until next June. Never has any Budget been treated in this fashion. - We have repeatedly listened to those of my honourable friends opposite who were in previous Parliaments demanding the early consideration of the Estimates, and dwelling upon the financial control of the Parliament, ,as exercised by the criticism of the Estimates, as the very palladium of liberty. Although our proposals formerly meant a postponement of the Budget debate for a week or two, at the outset of the session, in order that other measures might be fairly launched, we have been goaded and gibed at by those honourable members because of that trifling and necessary suspense.",18
71,Mr WEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Tim e makes changes. Mr DEAKIN,-If one had only been gifted then with the faculty of prophecy as discovered by the Cabinet in that eminent balance-sheet, and one could have prophesied the manner in which this Budget would be dealt with in this House when a Government of their own, with a majority of its own, was in power, all of us can imagine the shouts of repudiation and derision that would have arisen from the gallant band then insisting on the immediate consideration of the Estimates. . Do not let me, even by imputation, convey a mistaken idea. The same demand for the Estimates early has been followed by the Opposition here, and in every State Parliament, no matter what party happened to be in power. The Labour party having been in Opposition for the bulk of the ten years of the life of this Parliament, have - consequently played this part.",19
72,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,They were the strongest supporters the honourable member ever had.,19
73,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Excellen t supporters, but the withdrawals of their support were always untimely. If the honourable member had sat in previous Commonwealth Parliaments, he would know that a number of his party always sat in Opposition, and that a certain number always acted in Opposition. I am not, however, complaining. Every Opposition takes up this stand, and does so properly. But every Ministry has hitherto recognised, and properly recognised, the force of that argument. We have this session an entirely new «edent, certainly new to the Commonwealth Parliament, as well as in the Victorian ParBudget. num- liament for twenty years before the establishment of Federation. We have been told, with perfect truth, on innumerable occasions, that Parliament derives the whole of its authority from the power of the purse ; that this power can be exercised only by a vigilant scrutiny of the Estimates of expenditure, and a rigid examination of every proposal to increase the revenue of the country out of the pockets of the taxpayers. By the fulfilment of these allied duties, Parliament raises itself to its highest position constitutionally, asserting itself as representative of the people in the control of the government of the country. When we go back to the electors at the close of this session what can we say for our use of the power of the purse? What plea can we submit for our authority as a Parliament, in view of the fact that this Budget was not delivered until September, and never debated until within a day or two of the prorogation ? What scrutiny is possible of the Estimates either of revenue or expenditure? What examination of the position of the Commonwealth in relation to either its past or futurefinancescan be effectivelv accomplished between now and Friday night, when we are to receive a parting blessing? This House has parted with the power of the purse, or rather, so far as the Opposition are concerned, it has been taken from us. We have not been allowed to exercise it, but I shall not essay at this late hour to attempt to discharge the unfulfilled financial obligations that have rested upon us ever since September. They ought to have been so far achieved by this time as to leave nothing to be done, save to sum up in conclusion. But then this Budget is not a key to the policy of the Government. It is a catalogue. It is not the financial axis on which the business of the country is to revolve. It treats the situation as if by some happy accident all the necessities for financial adjustment and exposition were removed. I have already emphasized the fact that we are faced by an entirely unprecedent position of affairs, and certainly nm not bearing with undue severity upon the Budget, having already alluded to the sudden and golden transformation of our financial position. I have made full allowance for that, and shall throughout. But even apart from that, apparently intoxicated by the outlook, Ministers, expre- cept in the departmental figures and the extraordinary balance-sheet, have not provided us with more than an inkling of what their real financial position.or policy is, nor how they propose to give effect to their several projects. In these novel circumstances, did not expect this year tition of previous Budgets. .Budget with which I have been associated in this House has been one of parings and savings-indeed , of cheeseparings, economies, and postponements for the want of necessary funds. Every Budget was marked by a keen struggle, prolonged through several years, to resist what we regarded as encroachments on the part of certain State Governments, and at the same .time by an endeavour to be perfectly just - to the requirements of Australia, and, so far as we legitimately could, to give assistance to the local Governments whenever they could make out a good appeal. In good years or in bad, there was never submitted'to this Parliament a Budget that did not contain upon its face marks of a strenuous examination of every source of 'revenue, and of a prolonged scrutiny of the expenditure necessary before choices-and painful and difficult choices they were-betwee n a number of reasonable demands upon our Treasury that we found ourselves from time to time unable to meet. A number of them in good years we have been able to fulfil by means of supplementary Estimates. Budget represented a struggle, represented privations and severe economies; every new expenditure was most zealously and jealously studied. All these anxieties have vanished now as if by the touch of a magician's wand.",19
74,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,What was of the cheeseparing? Mr DE ; AKIN - The r e were a number of causes. There were always far more demands on the Australian Parliament than the Australian revenue could then meet. That is the case in every State.,20
75,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Was strong pressure was brought to bear upon the Federation by the State Governments?,20
76,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"At the beginning that did occur. During the serious drought in the early vears of Federation, when the revenues of the States fell off very seriously, the Commonwealth most generously, and in the wisest spirit of national cooperation, came to their relief and gave them enormous assistance. That, however, ceased with the return of good years. Nothing comparable to the present financial situation has existed prior to this. In deed, we now have, by a curious combination of circumstances, the position of the Commonwealth Treasury entirely reversed. one In the first place, this is due to the expiraa repe- tion of the Braddon section period, with its Every obligation for the payment to the States of three-fourths of our Customs and Excise . revenue. That period would have ended in any case, whether or not the Financial Agreement submitted to the people had been accepted by them. It has been accepted now, though for only ten years; but if accepted for an indefinite period, we should have been in the same position as we are today. This is the fulfilment of an expectation which we have been cherishing ever since Federation-the first opportunity afforded to the people of the Commonwealth to readjust the whole of their financial affairs as they please. In addition, this Parliament enters into the heritage of our labours in the ten years of preparation. While our greatest national projects could not be carried out then, they could at least be investigated and preparations made for making them. Hence this Parliament approaches tasks that have been long foreseen, not only under this most favourable change of circumstances for dealing with them, but also equipped with the results of a long and careful study of the situation and of the preparatory steps necessary to enable all Still, every these National enterprises to be launched either now or at some early period. We accomplished that essential work of preparation and investigation. But now the mere termination of the Braddon section and the control of the extra millions means a sudden translation, the cause so far as the Treasury of the Commonwealth is concerned, from poverty to riches. That is the first transformation. Then, again, the Treasurer, who addressed us in September last, spoke as the head of a party with an absolute majority of one colour in both Chambers. That is a conit not that dition of affairs never hitherto witnessed ii> the Commonwealth. Every Government that previously held office had depended for at least a portion-if not a large portion-of its strength upon some party allied, but not immediately associated with it in the whole of its programme. We have always had majorities built on the twoparty system. This is the first majority we have seen in either House, on the one-party system, in which all the supporters of the Government are of one mind and pledgeThat in itself removes a number of the restrictions which our partnerships, however fully and fairly carried out, necessarily imposed on certain subjects. The work of the Commonwealth speaks for itself, and needs no eulogy at this juncture. But those who judge it looking backward will have to imagine a condition of affairs entirely different from that which now obtains. They will not be likely to do justice to past Parliaments as a whole, unless they realise how keen our threeparty struggles constantly were and what elements of uncertainty they introduced into the conduct of business in this House. Then, again, the seasons, fortunately for us, appear to have taken a longer cycle of excellence than we have been accustomed to expect, and each year has filled the cup of the Commonwealth more bountifully. This current year promises to be no exception, and we shall all of us be very much disappointed if the total returns from Australia-ther e will, of course, be disparity between different districts and different States-d o not outstrip all previous records of prosperity. We have every reason to hope and to rejoice that our entrance into the new period, so much more advantageous for this Parliament than for any that preceded it, will also be assisted by this strongly flowing tide of prosperity in every part of Australia. Consequently it is not wonderful that with such a hopeful outlook the Treasurer himself, and this House as a whole, can regard the present financial situation with a light heart.",20
77,Mr WEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Has not the fact that our party has come into power inspired confidence in the people of Australia?,21
78,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The - public must have had confidence or the honourable member's party would not have come into power. We have to note today four great and new factors-first , our inheritance of the work done by previous Parliaments; second, the expiration of the Braddon section ; third, the absolute majority obtained by the Ministry in both Houses of the Legislature; and, fourth, the bountiful seasons throughout Australia making an amazing record of national growth. The consequence is that this Parliament finds itself in the tion of an heir who has not only entered into very great estates, but has found that the entail and all limitations hitherto imposed have been removed in his favour. He can now spend his ample means according to his pleasure. Nothing approaching the present situation has occurred in the past; and I doubt whether any of us can reasonably foresee a period likely to occur within the life-time of any among us in which a similar combination of circumstances is likely to set any Parliament of the Commonwealth in the happy position in which this Parliament finds itself on account of these accumulated advantages.",21
79,Mr WEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I anticipate that the future will be still better.,21
80,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,May the honourable member never be disappointed.,21
81,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,You cannot beat faith.,21
82,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Nevertheles s it would be surely a mistake if , in a situation so propitious we allowed ourselves to remain blind to the fact that circumstances over which we have no control, and conceivably circumstances not originating in Australia - worl d markets and world politics-ma y possibly affect us seriously. The suggestions of prudence, although not likely to be listened to by the thoughtless at this hour, cannot be ignored by any who reflect upon the immediate responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the possibilities of changing circumstances. It is in times such as this, when, without any strain upon the national finances, without a refusal to undertake progressive works, and without holding back national enterprises, we are fortunate enough to have a margin so considerable that provision can and should be made for a possible, if not probable, rainy daywhether it be soon at hand or more distant. Surely at this juncture all the counsels of prudence are that we should show some foresight for those possibilities, and set aside a reasonable provision for the purpose, if necessary, of equalizing accounts in years less prosperous. Now that the Braddon section has ceased to operate there is no longer the prohibition upon such a course which' has hitherto governed the finances of the Commonwealth. Until now, no Commonwealth Government could save if it desired so to do. It was not possible, except in minor ways. We generally had a little money to our credit posi- in the Mother Country to meet expenditure, and so forth, but nothing worthv of mention. Hitherto the hands of the Commonwealth have been legally tied against making provision for the future. We are free today to make whatever provision we think fit. We have the means-the flowing means-at our command. We have the opportunity. Now one of the most disappointing features of this Budget, when you carefully examine it, is that you will find no trace of any such foresight, or any such provision. Instead of that, the statement of our expenditure shows that we are to spend up to the last farthing of the last shilling of the last pound of our estimated receipts. We enter upon the next financial year, therefore, as far as the policy of the Government goes, without anything in the nature of an emergency fund, without anything in the way of reserves upon which we can depend. That, I think, while an unfortunate omission in any Budget, is especially unfortunate since this is a most favourable opportunity of exercising forethought, in view of the fact that the finances are flowing so freely in. course, our progress for several years has been continuous. Last year showed an admirably rising tide.",21
83,Mr BAMFORD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member forgets that we have invested in banknote printing machinery.,22
84,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"And have printed our millionth note. This year has not only been excellent in itself, but is a culmination of many good years. Last year we did remarkably well-muc h better than was expected. We obtained an extra £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 from Customs. Our Coinage Act brought the country a profit of £ 7 0 , 0 0 0 , and this year a profit of £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 is estimated. That is all clear profit. Taking the totals together, last year showed receipts of ,£1,200,000 above the careful and prudent forecast of the right honourable member for Swan, the former Treasurer. But in addition to that rising tide, we find that this year the cessation of the Braddon section makes our payment to the States £2,800,000 less than they would have received if that section still continued in operation. During the four months that have transpired in the current financial year, up to the end of October, under the old circumstances we should have paid to the States £3,000,000. The returns show that we have paid rather less than £2,000,000. The estimate that has been given for the return from the land tax amounts to £1,000,000, but that is generally regarded-o n every hand-as far below what the tax is likely to realise. A yield of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 is considered a modest estimate.",22
85,Mr HALL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,F o r this year?,22
86,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"How can the Government carry forward the tax from one year to another? They will, it seems to me, make the citizens of Australia pay in land taxation at least £2,000,00 0 this year.",22
87,Mr HALL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,We shall probably get a law suit this year.,22
88,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"E x a c t l y ; if the Government do not actually receive the whole of the money due, thatwill be attributable to causes over which we have no control. It looks, however, as if they will receive £2,000,000, whilst still leaving a good deal not collected this year. Then there were the temporary loans, to the extent of about £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , which the Treasurer employed to help him from the one period to the other. Altogether, these sums make up a magnificent total-on e which, as I am continually Of repeating, is absolutely without any parallel in our previous history. We may say of the Government that they have had millions to right of them, millions to left of them, picked up, and-Squandered ? Stored? Certainly not "" stored"" ; there is no provision of that sort. I should hesitate to use' the word "" squandered,"" so excellent are most of the projects to which this money is intended to be devoted. There may be leakages. Under these circumstances, a certain amount of exhilaration may lead to extravagance; but, after little all, the great needs of Australia are so imperative, and involve the expenditure of such considerable sums, that these obligations should operate as a check upon that tendency- I hope an effective check. The taxation just imposed comes, it must be noted, not in consequence of any shortage in the National finances, not on account of any drying up of our sources of supply, since we have already at our disposal some millions more than we had in any previous years. Our Land Tax is levied in pursuance of a double-headed policy- a policy which aimed at taxation, and also at land settlement; but whose double aims, unfortunately, cross each other to so considerable an extent as to deprive that measure of very much of the advantage which would have accrued to this country had . it been wholly devoted - as it should have been, subject to its taxing form - to the purpose of land settlement. This is not the place to recapitulate the criticisms we felt bound to offer upon a measure in which the revenue si.de has been given undue prominence. The censure was, in many respects, due to a contradiction caused by the sacrifice of the other aim, which made for the subdivision of land and the encouragement c . agricultural and pastoral developments by c a more numerous population. That is a great misfortune, because we had a great opportunity. We were not under any pressure from want of revenue. We were not bound to obtain money by any scheme of land taxation. If the measure had been devoted wholly and solely to the purposethe great and perpetual purpose, the great ultimate source of revenue-of multiplying and encouraging settlement, we could then have gone to the country with much greater confidence, and asked it for a much warmer approval of our work, than we can hope to do under the unfortunate existing circumstances. Of course constitutional requirements obliged us to make the measure in essence one of taxation; but it should not have been penalisation. There is no pressure of necessity to excuse some of its provisions, and yet we resorted to methods that are penal in many cases. Responsibilities are cast on all classes of owners, including those minors, legatees, and others who, finding themselves in the ownership of land, often without preliminary training or experience, and incompetent to discharge those responsibilities, are yet liable to criminal penalties for error, without a single legitimate means of escape by accepting a Government valuation or otherwise. That is the most objectionable feature of the measure, in which it approaches, in some respects, very closely to that "" third-degree "" treatment which, in the last extreme, is employed by the police upon those who are treated as criminals, whether innocent or guilty.",22
89,The CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I do not think that the honourable member is in order in likening the legislation of this House to the "" third-degree "" treatment.",23
90,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I shall not argue the point. Land taxation, being financial legislation, naturally comes within the scope of the Budget; and when one believes that the provisions are capable of being extravagantly unjust in many cases, one is entitled to use almost any figure in condemnation. The expenditure under the various measures passed has been outlined only in the vaguest fashion. That expenditure is being steadily added to, without the necessary Estimates being placed before us; indeed, in some cases, no attempt at an estimate is made, and in all cases there is no precision in the statements as to the actual cost. It is all very well to say, "" Hang the expense""; but every one of these departures has to be paid for; and the House would be well within its duty-in fact, it will otherwise fail to discharge its obligation-if it does not require the Government to give a frank statement of the outlay on each and every one of the propositions. Most of the proposals are laudable, and have, I think, the heartiest support of honourable members on this side. None of the great projects for Australian development should be starved, and there is no tendency in that direction. But if we are challenged hereafter, in our constituencies or elsewhere, for having taken leaps in the dark, without sufiicient information as to the burden we are imposing by these particular undertakings, however admirable they may be in themselves, we shall lie open to serious imputation. We should not close this Parliament with a great number of commitments as to the extent of which we have no just notion.",23
91,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,What provision is made for the transferred properties?,23
92,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Non e whatever. Without economies being enforced on us, without the reserves to which I have already alluded, and without Estimates, we certainly find ourselves in a very peculiar position at the end of this session. We have not been shown, or had outlined, a balance-sheet of the cost or revenue effects of the work we have done. Such a balance-sheet would resemble nothing yet seen; and I can only imagine that it would be of the kind that the prodigal son presented to his creditors just before he was persuaded to go into the pig business. We are prodigally piling up obligations, most of which, as I have said, represent excellent propositions; but we are doing so without anything like the acquaintance we should have with the expenditure that must follow, even when the Estimates have in the loosest way been suggested in the House. None of these projects will be completed this year, most of them are only beginning; even if next year, or the year after, or the year after that, proves as prosperous as the present year, we shall still find ourselves far from the completion of the projects. If the people then turn to the circumstances under which the projects were inaugurated, and regard the speed with which they were dealt, they will find, as I have said, the very scantiest material in any records of the House for this session throwing light upon our commitments: The Opposition are, I think, practically behind all the larger proposals, although we may differ as to particular methods and means. The railways to Kalgoorlie and to Port Darwin were in the programme of the late Government; and the taking over of the Northern Territory has been consummated on the terms of the Agreement we made. The State debts have not been touched or alluded to in this session. Under the circumstances, perhaps, the Government ought not to be pressed for a determination of this great issue; but, at least, some steps ought to have been taken, and some progress made. So far as we know, there is no advance to report, although we have the authority of the whole of the people of Australia for an undertaking, which is one of the most truly national, and which can be carried out to the immense advantage of all the Governments and the people of Australia. This is one piece of our policy I regret to see postponed even for another session, although admitting that this session we could not have hoped to solve the great problem in all its intricacies. could have made a commencement and laid down lines of general policy ; and the Ions; recess about to ensue could have been utilized in making the necessary preparations for the better handling of that enormous sum of our obligations which presents one of the finest potentialities in the possession of this Parliament. In regard to the proposals for defence by land and sea, most were formulated by the late Government, and all have been adopted by honourable members on this side; they represent, in fact, I think, the mind of -- three-fourths of the members of both parties. The Federal Capital project is, I believe, being pushed forward, although the late Government were accustomed to be criticised for delays which are now discovered to have been reasonable and necessary, even at this stage, and when friendly Ministries have to be dealt with - Then there are the various reforms foreshadowed in the Post Office, most of them such as we can welcome. The development of wireless telegraph stations has formed the subject of too much comment for me to add anything; if I have a question to ask, it is one to which no cient answer has vet been given. How was the sum of £2,000 fixed as the fair value of the work proposed to be done at the new stations? It may be quite a satisfactory amount, but no attempt has been made to explain how it was arrived at. The old age pensions scheme was enlarged by us last year, and is being enlarged still further this year, with further developments about to come. There is, of course, a distinct departure by the present Government from the industrial policy being pursued by the late Government-our s I venture to term a "" building-up "" policy. It aimed at the multiplication of Wages Boards in every industry, building up from these to higher Courts, harmonizing their decisions throughout the Commonwealth, with the object of preventing unfair competition. We were creating an industrial self-government in the fullest degree possible all over Australia. The question has been approached by the present Government from the opposite stand-point, with a centralization of authority, which appears to me, though it may promise more at the first, to be cerwhich tain to be more tardy in arriving at any* thing like universal effect, and which, in fact, can only be applied to some few of the most widespread and important indusBut we tries of the country. The other method of procedure would have brought in the smallest and the medium sized, as well as the great, industries, and would also have operated over the whole continent, instead of principally in and from the metropolitan cities of the various States. The Bounty Bill is certainly very much less extensive than the Bill the late Government had in view, but possibly more will be done in another session. I am sorry, however, that twelve months have been lost, and still more sorry that no steps have been taken to create an Agricultural Bureau, which \ra necessary concomitant in the country of the assistance given to labour in the towns. The closer settlement in Australia at which we aim, like that of America, must follow the course of linking together the scientific man, or the knowledge of science, with the habits of the business man. The farmer in America, as I am told by those who have just visited that country, is no longer distinguishable from the townsman by any of those idiosyncracies which used to make material for the comic papers. suffi- "" Old farmer Hayseed "" is passing out of sight. The modern "" Hayseed "" is an up-to-date, keenly alive, business man, whose study is how to make the best of a small area with limited means but unlimited intelligence, acquired in the shape of scientific knowledge and of practical experience. The west of America, since I visited the country, has been transformed. What were then desert plains are now covered with large populations, obtaining most satisfactory results, which compare favourably with the earnings of successful business men in towns. Farming can be made to pay as pastoral pursuits can - can be made to pay better in a small way than in a large way-o n small areas better than on large areas-and to pay best, ofall under irrigation or some other system which takes the greatest advantage of scientific knowledge and judgment. pay better than water, and brains are making farming pay today. The hope of Australia, with its great cities on the seaboard, lies in those enormous tracts which have yet to be brought into the service of man and made productive of wealth for the whole community. I am no stickler 'for names or forms, but do wish I saw somewhere a proposal to supply the necessary scientific knowledge and equipment - to the sons of our farmers, and to the farmers themselves. The grown man is not too proud, nor the grey-haired man too old, to attend the courses at agricultural colleges in the United States. They go in throngs to illustrated lectures, and return to their farms to use the knowledge thus gained for their own profit and the benefit of the community. Considering the agricultural future of the Commonwealth, T cannot believe that we are fulfilling our obligations while we leave this large area of usefulness untouched. I do not suggest that we should put aside the State Departments; let the States spend as much more ns they like in the same excellent work, but let us supplement their efforts, and tackle large questions from an Australian, and not from a district or provincial, stand-point. I had not intended to make this digression, but the subject is endlessly attractive. The rectification of Tariff anomalies ought to have included a score at least of practical propositions in addition to mere departmental alterations, about which, by the way, a great number of complaints are coming in, though whether these be well or ill founded we are unable to judge. I regret the absence of any proposal to create an Inter-State Commission, a body provided for in advance by the Constitution, and capable of rendering immense national services to Australia, which Mr Deakin. there is no competent body in existence at the present time to render I say nothing of preferential trade, though I should have been glad of some reference to the progress effected by the Prime Minister's visit to South Africa, and negotiations with the neighbouring Dominion of New Zealand. I mention the matter now, hoping that by next year it will have received further and full attention. In the same way I should like to have had more assurance of a spirited conduct of a real immigration policy. We have a special. reason now for considering this matter, inasmuch as we have become the Brains governing body of the Northern Territory, and must deal with it now with at least as much enterprise, and let us trust a great deal more, than is exhibited by the State Governments. I know that in the Northern Territory a new problem confronts us, but it is one of the problems that an Agricultural Bureau is above all things qualified to deal with. On all these matters, with the exception of a few, the members of this House are generally in accord. The new departures need not be dwelt upon. These useful matters cover the total work of the session. In addition, the Government have put forward certain measures and proposals, of the credit for which we have no desire to rob them. The Australian Notes Act now represents a far better measure and a more efficient piece of machinery than it was when introduced to our notice.",23
93,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Better for the bankers ?,25
94,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I was alluding to the safeguards provided in the interests of the public. As introduced, that measure was open to very dangerous political interference which would have been fatal to its success. Although the Government have strengthened it in that respect, we know that in this Parliament they are assured, with their majorities in both Houses, that they can pass any Act they require, relaxing its conditions without the slightest difficulty. No preceding Government was, and perhaps no succeeding Government will be, placed in so fortunate a position. The land tax has been already alluded to. The industrial proposals contained in two Bills go far beyond the present necessities of the case, and beyond those we submitted which were adapted to our resources. The temporary loans and the referenda are condemned by their excesses. All these, of course, are part of the work of the session, and we have no desire to deprive the vernment of any credit they may obtain for them. In conclusion, I have - a more serious subject to touch upon, the full importance of which may not be perceived by honorwhich able members on the spot, and may be looked by the people outside. the transformation of Parliament which been accomplished in this session, comparand ing it with those preceding it. We are now for the first time associated with the and discussed there without us. working of a caucus, including majorities of both Houses, engaged apparently from is being submitted in another place. day to day, and often from night to night, in long sittings, doing behind closed the bulk of ""the work, so far as they are concerned, which should be done on the floor of the House. I do not that the public outside, or that honourable members themselves engaged in this way, realise the consequences of this innovation. It alters the whole balance of power Parliament, in addition to the grave alteration tion to which I have already alluded, which this House and another place to most the same extent have been deprived of that power of the purse which every previous Parliament has exercised. To take a few out of many inand stances which have recently occurred let me remind honourable members that this Parliament has not yet reached the Estitime. mates, and that we who sit in Opposition have not yet had an opportunity of disthere cussing them. The Department Postmaster-General has not been reached. We have had the report of a Royal Comout, mission laid before us, but have not yet touched the questions with which it deals. But we find that the caucus of majorities in both Houses has been engaged questions for many days in making a searching inquiry. As a result, honourable members on this side, who could not attend the meetings of the caucus, and have not had the advantage of hearing the discussions which took place there, suddenly obtain an intimation of what the intentions of the Government are, arrived at after prolonged and, it may be, searchnot ing debate on the necessities of the DeListening partment. All , therefore, that we is that the majorities have decided what to do during this session or between this session and the next. It is all settled, in our absence. The same thing applies to the Defence Bill. Even that measure was passed through the ordeal before being introduced, Goand was submitted to us in a way which deprived us of the advantage of the independent criticism which no doubt it received in the Ministerial room. But when an amendment was carried by a majority included some honourable members overwho had taken part in the caucus debate I refer to as well as members on this side, on a has point on which both thought it advisable necessary to improve the Bill, we find that it was sent back to the same body, A new form of amendment was agreed upon, and It will come back to us in the shape of a doors recommendation from the Senate; where the Government majority is, of course, able to carry it . It will be approved here, know and again we are blackballed. Then there is the case of the vital amendment of the Ministry's most import tant measure-the first referendum Bill . in That really recast the whole of the definiof the control exercisable by the Comby monwealth over industrial affairs by alspecifically establishing Federal authority over the railway servants of all the States. That grave alteration had evidently been threshed out in caucus in the same manner, the decisions arrived at which we are obliged to accept. This is not parliamentary in any sense. We are out of it all the Another consequence is that, although are, as every debate proves, originalof the minded men in the Labour party, the originality here is nearly altogether gone even of them, because they have already exercised it with more or less success elsewhere, leaving us without the advantage of the political education to be gained by on those listening to them.",25
95,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Oh !,26
96,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I mean what I say.,26
97,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Is this not satire?,26
98,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"No , not in the least degree. I hope that many honourable members on this side are, as I am, attentive listeners to most of the speeches made by honourable members opposite when they are rehearsing for performances outside. attentively to their speeches, one know can learn continually. That is what Parliament is for. It is bad for those shut in the caucus, but not for them alone. and We, as the Opposition, are suffering, too, because we lose all the advantage which might be gained from the opinion, judgment, experience, or criticism of honourable members opposite, which they now most cruelly bottle up for their own consumption. The practice also deprives debate of much of its zest; we are not properly put upon our mettle.",26
99,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable gentleman will admit that honourable members opposite have not done badly.,27
100,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I can assure the honourable member that we should have done much better if we had the advantage of his assistance. As it is, we come here apparently as lecturers or protesters, rather than as debaters, with no hope of accomplishing any change in fact, even if we can effect a change of mind. late for that. You are bound. We lack the stimulus to bring us up to our best, in order to discuss thoroughly proposals laid before us. They come second-hand; we want them fresh and wild. We want to catch the fish or see it caught. Kept a few days, even in cold storage, after the Caucus has settled its fate, it is astonishing what the difference is.",27
101,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,What about the interests of the public?,27
102,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"B y the adoption of this system we lose, Parliament loses, and the public loses. Whatever be the effect on that - siection of the public that worries itself about parliamentary debates-and I shall not guess what fraction it represents, though I suspect it is not a large one-the effect upon Parliament is certainly most injurious. Its effect upon Hansard, always a dull publication, has been to make it more dull. It needs variety and spice, and this practice takes variety and spice out of it. There may be variety and spice in the discussions which are carried on within other walls, but our honourable friends do - not give us the benefit of them. Dull as we are, T believe they might strike sparks out of us if they would only come down here with - fresh and open minds, and give us the benefit of their originality.",27
103,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable gentleman's remarks. gentleman should not forget that his party deliberately gagged the Opposition when they had the power to do so.,27
104,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"We had listened my honourable friends for three months without doing a stroke of work before arrived at the conclusion that it was necessary to use means, which were even then very reluctantly forced from us. Mr FRA.NK FOSTER - How much did the honourable members behind the honorfect? able member's Government assist in the debates ?",27
105,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"As much as they could in the trying and distressing circumstances to which I refer. But I have no wish to recall what happened last session on one side or the other. It does seem to me that the effect of this caucus system is to reduce this Parliament, in a sense, to the status we used to give Legislative Councils in the State Parliaments. It makes it a mere Chamber of review. We, who were in the Legislative Assembly, were always willing that the It is too Legislative Council should review so long as it did not alter. The Legislative Council was far from accepting that limit, but the it was called a Chamber of review. Certainly, under this system, I think that this Parliament tends to become, in fact, such a Chamber of review. Where the dominant party has majorities in both Houses, it is indeed only a registration Chamber, because nothing more can be done here than to register decisions already arrived at in secret. A minority on the other side, which,- when assisted by the Opposition, constitutes a majority of this House, is deprived under this system of its proper influence on the legislation of the country. It is impossible under this system for honourable .members on both sides to unite with their natural allies as we, when on the other side, were able to join at times with our natural allies in the Labour party.",27
106,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member for Wentworth succeeded in carrying two important amendments in the Defence Bil l without the Caucus being able to consider them.,27
107,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Such things are possible, but one swallow does not make a summer. Those accidents merely serve to mark the contrast.",27
108,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FEDERAL CAPITAL,But the fact takes seme of the sting out of the honourable,27
109,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"No , because I . have not said that no alteration is permitted to to us. I have not said that we may not dot an i or cross at. We may make alwe terations which do not matter, but we wish to be able to do things which will matter; otherwise, we have no business here.",27
110,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Surely the honourable gentleman's criticism has some ef,27
111,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I do not think it - affects my honourable friends opposite in the slightest practical way. There has also been evidence that Executive acts and work are criticised by honourable members opposite, so that, in effect, rhe Caucus becomes the Cabinet as well ;\s the Parliament, and we are shut out from participating in it in either case. We get our policy settled for us outside, our compromises are made there, and the real reasons for our measures are expressed there only. Everything is private and confidential. It is most unconstitutional, because, under existing conditions, with Ministerial majorities in both Houses, the Caucus is really the Parliament of the country. It is there all the actual work is done, measures prepared, and the Administration controlled. It is the real Parliament of the country. This is only the official bureau, where the acts of the real Parliament are registered, where apologies are offered, and criticisms of a - didactic kind which very few people read are meekly suggested from this side.",28
112,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,But there is no time to <:lo in caucus all that the honourable member Says is done there.,28
113,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"We ought to do as much as possible in Parliament, and at present we are not doing more than a fraction of anything but its formalities.",28
114,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Parliament merely a registry office.,28
115,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The result is that we get a policy which is developed with as much solicitude and isolation as a new culture in a laboratory. The policy is prepared, figuratively, in a cellar; nobody outside knows anything about it. It is true that we may sometimes guess from the faces of honourable members opposite what their feelings are, and also infer some of their thoughts. But that is of no use to us. Their policy is not prepared in the open light of day. There is not the clash of mind and mind in respect to it. They are thus reducing Parliament to a dead level of uninteresting records. that a desirable state of things ? Why do honourable members opposite not come out into the open, and give us the benefit of their ideas and aims ?",28
116,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Natur e performs most useful works in secret.,28
117,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"At first I thought the honourable member alluded to Hansard, which, as far as I can see, is rapidly becoming a publication of answers to correspondents.",28
118,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I thought it was a record of the speeches of members of the Opposition.,28
119,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If it were, it woulci serve a useful purpose, though, unfortunately, the people do not read it. The statute-book itself bears little evidence of our labours here. This condition of things is unhealthy for the Parliament, for honourable members opposite, as well as for this side of the Chamber. It has only one merit-it enables some business to be put through. But it does not enable if to be put through in the form which is favoured by a majority of honourable members, because, in many cases, your minority, added to our minority, would constitute a majority, representing a majority of the electors. Thus a blow is being struck at the root of our system of parliamentary government.  fect of the two-party system.",28
120,Mr DEAKIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"No . As a further consequence, our system of responsible Government no longer consists of the Executive only. This condition of things most materially affects our Commonwealth Constitution, especially in regard to another ""place, which both in legislation and administration has but its numerical strength in is caucus, without any regard to the numbers or interests senators represent. However, I have spoken much longer than I had intended, although a Budget is always a challenge in respect to the policy of the Government, and the position of the country. Repeating myself once more, my conclusion is that a most dangerous condition of political affairs has been caused by this abnormal separation of a great body of honourable members, who hold kindred views, from the minorities associated with them. We ought to work together upon a great many more subjects than we do. We would, and could do so, if we met in frank and Is free debate, retaining the right upon all great questions of policy to express our best individual judgments. But we cannot hope for any such result while we have to adopt the particular solution prepared for us in a dose which we pre obliged to swallow, however injurious it may be to us and to the country. Under existing conditions, Parliament is ' hampered, if not hamstrung. In view of the amendments of the Constitution now before the country, which press us further in the same foreign direction, I venture to say that we are passing out of the main stream of Constitutional progress. Where we shall ultimately end nobody can foretell. But it is at least clear that as a result the country is not getting from Parliament what it deserves, and Parliament is not getting from the country the inspiration to which we are entitled. We are mutually suffering, and shall continue to do so until this unhealthy state of affairs is terminated. Let us ally ourselves one with the other upon great matters of principle, remaining free to adopt here in the sight of all the people whatever course we believe should be recommended to those who trust us.",28
121,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Swan) [12.7]I thank the Government for having afforded me an opportunity of saying a few words upon the Budget before my departure for my own State. It is an extraordinary circumstance that it is only during the closing hours of the session that we are permitted for the first time to debate the financial position of the Commonwealth as set forth in the Treasurer's Budget statement. I suppose the position is unprecedented. It is difficult to understand the reasons which prompted the Government to adopt that course. If they had not had such a large and docile majority behind them they would not have been able to act as they have done. I do not think that any other Government, however strong, would have dared to treat the House in the way that the Ministry have treated it . As a matter of fact, we are almost precluded from discussing th? Budget, inasmuch as all the important matters which are mentioned in it have since been dealt with in various Bills. During the session we have had a good dose of what is commonly called ""spoils to the victors"" legislation. We have passed many measures, one of which, in my opinion, is of a very confiscatory chaiacter. The extraordinary feature about that very drastic measure of taxation is that it is directed at those who are not supporters of the Ministry. It is intended to effect an influential class-bu t a very small one-whos e members have acquired unfair statement. some wealth in the country, and who are deemed to be fit subjects for spoliation.",29

123,Sir JOHNFORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I do not think that their number will be found to be very great. At the same time the Government and their supporters have exempted from the operation of that measure those whom they regard as their political supporters, and through whom they have been returned to this Parliament.",29
124,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That statement is not correct.,29
125,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"In my opinion it is absolutely true. The exemption of £ 5 , 0 0 0 , which was inserted in the Land Tax Assessment Bill , was nothing more nor less than a bribe to those persons who returned honourable members opposite to this Parliament.  member would not make the twenty-acre man pay?",29
126,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It was intended to exempt from the operation of the Bill the persons to whom I have referred, because honourable members opposite get a large measure of their political support from them. I say that the confiscatory land tax which we have passed is a class measure. Honourable members opposite, by supporting it and by voting £ 6 , 0 0 0 to subsidize a press cable service, have shown that in their desire to support those who support them they will stop at nothing. Labour newspapers have been subsidized, and now get cheap news at the expense of the country. The reluctance of the Minister of External Affairs to tell us how many newspapers are getting this news, and how many additional words are now being transmitted over the Pacific Cable, evidences that he does not desire to give information to the public. The action of honourable members opposite in voting money to bolster up newspapers which are devoted to their cause is one of the most gross of which I have heard during my political career. I look upon it as an absolute job. I regret, too, that during the session we have had a long series of attempts to undermine the Constitution and to place the whole control of this great country in the hands of Labour unions.",29
127,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That is another,29
128,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Labou r unions nominated the honourable member for this House.,29

136,Sir JOHNFORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I must express my regret that we have not been given an opportunity of dealing with these portant matters until so late in the session. I cannot think that it is in accordance with as much. the courtesy which one side of the House owes to the other. However strong a side may be in numbers, it ought always to afford an opportunity to discuss the finances within the first week after the Budget been delivered, as has been the case in past.",30
137,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable odd. member refused every opportunity; he applied the gag.,30

He cannot say that an opportunity was given to the House, within a very few of its delivery, to discuss the Budget speech delivered either by himself or myself. revenue of the Commonwealth is estimated at £ 1 7 , 2 4 8 , 3 2 9 ; the expenditure, which cludes £ 4 0 6 , 7 0 0 brought forward from previous year, is the same amount; there is no balance. I listened to the remarks the Leader of the Opposition on that ject, but I take no exception to there no balance. There never will be balance under the procedure laid down by .the Government for themselves. have passed Acts appropriating the balances to the Trust Funds. These will absorb any balance that there may be at. the year, so that the revenue and expenditure will always equal one another. That is done in order to drive a coach-and-tourperhaps it is legitimate-throug h the Constitution, section 94 of which provides any balances that there may be at the end of the year are returnable to the States. As we have now fixed an amount for paypay ment to the States, it would, of course, be reasonable for them to expect any paytem ment of surplus revenue. That is the son why the expenditure and revenue of the Commonwealth will always balance. They will be made to balance by means of payments into the Trust Funds.",30
139,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The right honourable member did not get them balanced last year.,30
140,Sir JOHNFORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I was subject to the operation of the Braddon section.,30
141,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,There was a substantial was only one deficit when we began.,30
142,Sir JOHNFORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If the present Government had had the Braddon section in operation during the whole of this finanimcial year, they would have had a deficit, not of £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 , but of nearly ten times The estimated revenue of £17,248,329 is very much inflated, because it includes all revenue received. The same remark applies to the estimate of expenditure, but, of course, we cannot deal with has the matter in that way. The Post and the Telegraph Department, for instance, shows on one side a revenue of £3,899,000, which helps to make up the £17,000,000 On the other side appears £4,408,939 as the total expenditure of the same Department. There is, therefore, no revenue there; in fact, there is a loss of £509 -939. Other items of a similar could be referred to, but that is the not Mr HIGGS - How , otherwise, would the days honourable member state the items?",30
143,Sir JOHNFORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am not findThe ing fault with the way they are stated. I am simply pointing out that they do not inshow the real revenue available for the serthe vices of the Government, until we take out all those concerns which cost as much as. of or more, than the revenue received from subthem. Although I have shown that there is being a deficit on the Post and Telegraph Deany partment of over £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0, the Department itself shows an estimated profit for They the year of £ 3 6 4 , 2 4 8 , but new works and buildings are estimated to cost £ 8 7 4 , 1 8 7, bringing the deficit on the whole transacend of the tion to what I have stated.",30
144,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Does the honourable member think that those works and buildings should be charged to one year only?,30
145,Sir JOHNFORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I do not; it that is bad financing and bad management, and if we had remained in office we should have changed the system. No one year should for buildings that will last for twenty not years, and we should adopt some such sysas that obtaining in the British Postal reaDepartment, whereby capital moneys are obtained from the Treasury-by the sale of temporary annuities or financial bonds of some sort, and gradually paid off by the Department in practically the same way as a sinking fund. The Postal Department of Great Britain is self-supporting, and also provides a large amount of revenue. Our system of charging, say, £874,000 odd against one year for work which is to last for twenty years is unscientific. It is very interesting to know the actual revenue available, after paying for the upkeep and maintenance of Departments. The Commonwealth's sources of revenue are not very many, and Departments which spend all their revenue, and more, such as the Post and Telegraph and Telephone Department, are not revenue producers at all. The revenue of the country can be stated shortly in this way: The Customs and Excise revenue, less £291,222 for cost of lection, is £11,421,928. That is a real revenue available for the administration of the affairs of the Commonwealth. It is, in fact, our main source of revenue; but out of it we must pay the States £5,267,500. There is also to be paid this year an amount of £451,832, charged against the States to repay the deficit on the Commonwealth accounts of last year, so that, if it were not for that fact, the amount that we should pay the States would be £5>7i9,332- That leaves us £5,702,596 of net revenue from Customs and Excise, after paying the States and paying for collection. We have also other sources of revenue. The proceeds of the land tax are estimated at £1,000,000, which, less £35,000 for collection, represents a revenue of £965,000. There are profits of £137,500 from coinage, a new revenue of £44,129 from small items, and £3.850 from miscellaneous sources. That - is the whole of the revenue which the Commonwealth has available for its expenditure this year. It amounts to £6,853,075a very different statement from that which showed a revenue of over £17,000.000. The actual cash which we have available for all the services of the Government is, therefore. £6,853,075. The Acting Treasurer remarked that we left a deficit last year. We certainly did, but last year, notwithstanding the good times that came at the end of the year, there was available only £3.682.884, and this included £451^832 taken improperly from the Trust Funds, or withheld from the States. It will be seen, therefore, that £3,170,191 more is available for the services of the Treasury this' year than last. If that had not been so, if it were not for the large additional Sir John Forrest. amount from Customs and Excise, and the new revenue from the land tax, I should like to know where the present Treasurer would be at the end of this financial year. Notwithstanding the fact that over £3,000,000 more revenue is available this year, the Government have to borrow £1,500,000 from the Note Issue Fund, in order to carry them on for the first half of the financial year. Of course, I know that the reason is that the Braddon section operates until 31st December next. The Acting Treasurer's remark was, therefore, most ungenerous, seeing that last year we had to pay over £8,000,000 to the States, whereas this year the Government are paying only £5,719,000 odd, or about £3,000,000 less. How do the Government col- intend to spend the £6,853,075 available this year? First, they propose to spend £2,070,000 on invalid and old-age pensions, and on defence, less a small amount °f £ 7 - 0 0 0 received in revenue from sales of rifles, & c , a sum of £2,826,895. Those two items alone will absorb £4,896,895. leaving only £1,956,180 available for all the other services of the Government. Those figures should give us cause for reflection and consideration. The two large items referred to absorb nearly 70 per cent, of the whole revenue, including £965,000 net receipts from the land tax, and leave only 30 per cent, for all other expenditure.",30
146,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Does the honourable member think that the land tax will not bring in more than £1,000,000?",31
147,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That is the Treasurer's estimate. Honourable members know that I regard the tax as confiscatory and unfair.,31
148,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"What method would the honourable member propose, in lieu of it, for the raising of extra revenue?",31
149,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I do'not feel myself called upon to discuss that question now. In addition to the expenditure on old age pensions and defence, there is an estimated loss on the Post Office amounting to £509,939, and departmental expenditure totalling £740,592, made up of the following items: - Governor General. £23,520; Parliament, £1.8,126; External Affairs, £110,971; Attorney-General, £34.634; Home Affairs, £190,907 ; Treasury, omitting coinage, £82,579; New Works, other than Post Office and Defence buildings, £116,164; loss on Patents, £554. Further, we must provide £635,950 for bounties on sugar, iron, and other things, £10,272 for pensions and retiring allowances, £22,574 for quarantine, less £3,000 revenue, £19,539 f ° repairs, & c , and £17,314 for miscelthe laneous expenditure. The expenditure whom. can, therefore, be classified as follows:Old-age pensions, £2,070,000; Defence, £2,826,895; loss on Postal Department, £509,939; expenditure on Departments, statement himself. £740,592; sugar and other bounties, and miscellaneous, £705,649, 'which absorbs every penny of the revenue, making a of £6,853.075. The affairs of the country are clearly set out in the statement which me? I have made, which shows more clearly how we stand than can be seen by dealing with the whole of the items of expenditure and revenue. I have dealt-only pluses and deficits. By doing that it is easier to ascertain the exact position finances.",31
150,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Is the cost of the transcontinental railway included? Sir' JOHN FORREST - The expenditure in connection with that work has very small. There is an amount of £5,000 on the Estimates for it. I wish now to deal more in detail with the subject of Defence. As I have shown, it is pronuendoes posed to expend on Defence £2,826,895, from which must be deducted a credit act in that way. balance of £7,000. The sum £850.000 has to be found in connection with the payments for the fleet unit. The convey untrue suggestions. revenue necessary to cover this expenditure will be obtained by what I consider an obnoxious and class land tax, which inditure vades the province of State legislation, more than last year. and confiscates the property of all coming within its reach. The last Government proposed to get the necessary funds by raising a loan repayable within sixteen increases to £10,000,000. years, and that proposal carried out the principle that permanent works, or works which will endure for a considerable time, should, be provided for, not by harassing the people by increasing taxation, and half-ruining the taxpayers, but by ing the expenditure over a number of years.",32

161,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable been member for Hume owes it to himself, if he wishes to act honourably and uprightly, to substantiate his statement by giving authority for it. He throws out these inhoping that some of the mud may stick. I have no patience with those who His present position of shows where his dodges and trickery have led him. I do not desire interjections which Last year the Defence expenditure was £1,513,972, less £21,820 revenue, and this year the expenis to be £2,826,895, or £1,312,923 This increase is to continue. The Prime Minister is reported to have stated in South Africa that he will not be alarmed if the defence expenditure Honourable members opposite are quite ready to take the necessary money out of the pockets of the few.

On old-age pensions were expended last year £r>497 -33o, and this year it is proposed to expend £2,070,000, an increase of £572,670. The cost of old-age pensions for this year is estimated at 9s. 3d. per head of a population of 4,474,000, or upon those of the supporting age, that is, between the ages of fifteen and sixty-five years, who number about 2,500,000, about twice as much. The cost per head to these peoplewill be-Defence , 22s.; old-age pensions, 17 s.; and all other expenditure, 18s.; making a total of 57s. I did not rise with the object of finding fault with the items on the Estimates. It seems to me that the Acting Treasurer, and those who are responsible for the administration of our financial affairs, must give to these matters careful scrutiny, because the expenditure is growing.",32

175,Sir TOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member can call it what he likes, but £684,000 goes into the Treasury, and £579,000 is paid out. I regret very much that on a commodity in daily use, from the richest to the poorest, the Government should impose a burden of £105,000 for no purpose other than revenue. Every endeavour should be made to make sugar as cheap as possible, and, without discussing the question of the bounty or the Excise at the present time, my opinion is, as every one knows, that we should do away with both, and allow the Tariff to operate in regard to sugar as it does in regard to any other commodity.",33

177,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"This Government, which poses as a poor man's Government- I do not believe for a moment that it is, but that does not matter-unneces sarily takes £105,000 from the people. Surely an impost of £ 5 on every ton of sugar consumed is taxation enough without imposing this addition of £105,000 ? That is the way in which the Government and the Labour party show their sympathy with poor people. They encourage the poor to get cheap sugar by levying £105,000 more on it than is necessary to pay expenses and bounty.",34
178,Mr BAMFORD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The ' right honourable gentleman was a member of the Ministry which did this thing.,34
179,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member, who is generally so very fair minded, is at times ungenerous, like the whole of his colleagues when it suits them. He knows very well that he was one of those who forced it upon the Government of the day. He and his colleagues would not sleep or rest, day or night, until they got this system carried out. He knows very well that he was responsible for this thing, but now that the Braddon section is about to expire, there is no reason why both the bounty and the Excise duty should not be abolished. Apart from that, the Excise ought not to exceed the amount required to provide the bounty and meet expenses, and the difference ought to go into the pockets of the people in the form of cheaper sugar. The honourable member poses as the poor man's friend-by putting £105,000 more duty a year on sugar than is necessary.",34

185,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That must be why the honourable member submitted to the forcing process.,34
186,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I desire to say a few words about another important matter, and that is the Trans-Australian railway. I urge the Government to begin the work as soon as possible. I have seen statements in the press that they propose to make a start, but they have not yet made an announcement to the House. As I intended to speak on this matter if I got an opportunity, I did not wish to ask any questions, but I do think that when the Prime Minister, or any other Minister, has any important statements to make on matters of policy, he might make them first to the House. I do not know why the press should get important information as to what the Government propose to do, and the House be kept in ignorance of it. It has been stated in the press that the Government intend to . proceed at once with the construction of the Trans-Australian railway. Only a sum of £5,000 has been placed on the Estimates, but there is a foot-note to the effect that the work will cost £3,988,000. As the item was passed without demur, I suppose it may be taken that both Houses have acquiesced in the proposal that the work should be proceeded with. I urge the the Minister to begin as quickly as he can. The work will not cost more than £3,000,000, and when it is finished we shall know who was nearest to the mark. It must be remembered that the engineer's estimate of £3,988,000 includes £600,000 for water supply. During the last six months there have been great changes in respect, for good water has been found two places. The authority to proceed with the work in Western Australia was given by Statute years ago. It gives the Commonwealth an exclusive choice as to route and gauge, and authorizes the State Government to lay down a line from Kallay, goorlie Junction to Fremantle, on any gauge which the Commonwealth may adopt. South on the subject. Australia has at length passed a law enabling the Commonwealth to choose the route of the line, although I believe that that has been already surveyed, and to adopt whatrefer ever gauge it pleases. There are no legal difficulties in the way of the Commonwealth' Government making a beginning. only question is whether they consider they have sufficient authority from this Parmonth. liament to make a start. That is a matter which, of course, they will.judge for theming selves. I hope, however, that think that they have sufficient authority, seeing that the Parliament has already voted the sum to which I have referred. A foot-note that the work is to seems cost so-and-so has generally been taken as an authority to the Treasury to spend on the work more than the amount actually voted, and to charge to the Treatogether satisfactory. surer's Advance. I can see no reason why there should be any delay in this matterthat is, if we believe the work to be necesbecome a farce. sary and good. I believe that everything is ready in respect to plans, sections, and quantities. It has been stated that Commonwealth. the quantities have not yet been obtained, but I think they have all been prepared, and that all the Government has to do proceed with the work. A whole year will be saved if arrangements are made to start at once. Without even laying down the rails, there is a great deal to do in preparation of work-shops and other things, and the formation of a staff. It will take a good while to get the plant together. the first instance, it will be necessary decide the question of gauge. Had the late Government remained in office, the work would have been put in hand. Seeing that Parliament is practically unanimous-there may be a few here, though not many, opthan posed to the scheme-there is no political or other reason for delay.

190,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Althoug h the procedure proposed to be followed is that for which the Constitution provides, it to me that our experience in regard to the efficacy of these referenda as a means of ascertaining the will of the majority of the voters of Australia is not alUnless we obtain a better system of recording the votes of the electors on the roll these referenda will Other countries have experienced a like difficulty, although it has not been so marked as it has in the In Switzerland, for instance, in 1898, out of sixty-eight laws submitted to the referenda, only one obis to tained the votes of half the number ot electors registered. Where a Bill receives the support of half the registered votes rhe position is fairly satisfactory, but our the experience is altogether different. The Financial Agreement was made a test question at the last general election. CandiIn dates for both Houses of Parliament took to part in the campaign, and the agreement was defeated by the votes of one-third of the people on the roll. In other words, only about one-third of the electors of Australia voted for the Bill, whilst a little more one-third voted against it. The voting was 670,838 against the Bill and 645,514 for it, whilst no fewer than 942,130 electors refrained from voting. That shows that the system is an unsatisfactory means of to obtaining the will of the people. We do not know what were the views held by those We hear in At this House far more than is justifiable as to honourable members opposite having on all questions a mandate from the people. It is ridiculous to talk of legislation based on a mandate of the people in this connection when out of a total of 15316,352 - who voted on the Financial Agreement there was a majority of only 25,324 against the Bill, whilst 942,130 electors refused or neglected to exercise the franchise. More electors refused to vote than actually voted for or against the Bill.",35
191,Mr RILEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Perhaps it is just as well that they did not vote-the y might not have known much about the Bill.,36
192,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is not a logical remark. The majority of the people did not vote on the Financial Agreement, and whatever may be the views of the Government, the present Opposition like to win or to lose by the will . of a majority of the electors. Having regard to the number of votes recorded, the less said about the mandate given by the people to the Labour party at the last general election the better. On the authority of this supposed mandate we have had foisted upon the people during this session a lot of very harsh and discriminating legislation, in passing which the Government and their supporters have displayed political partisanship to an extent unprecedented in any Australian Parliament. To those who say that such an observation is unwarranted, I can only reply, "" Have we not listened in this House to the gibes of some honourable members opposite? Have we not heard them say, ' Now is our chance, and we are going to avail ourselves of it, to undo the wrongs under which those whom we represent have suffered for many years?' """,36
193,Mr WEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Hear , hear.",36
194,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If that is not harsh and improper language to use in this House, I should like to know what is. The honourable member for East Sydney says, "" Hear, hear."" His interjection is uncalled for and unwarranted, and serves only to show how deep is his bias and venom.",36
195,Mr WEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Do not be downhearted.,36
196,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am not, but I like a little reason and proper feeling to be exhibited by public men in discharging their public duties. I can see by the 'honourable member's appearance that he has been well treated, and has done very well. He has no cause to complain. Probably, many people have just as much Budget. [23 NOVEMBER, IQIO.] Budget. 6601cause to complain of his actions as he has to complain of the actions of others.",36
197,Mr WEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The right honourable member is off for a holiday this afternoon. Let him be generous.,36
198,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am not going to do anything which the honourable member may not do if he is a free citizen. Perhaps, after all, he is not. I am a free citizen, and am not bound hand and foot by any Caucus.",36
199,Mr OZANNE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The right honourable member was bound on the Financial Agreement.,36
200,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I was not pledged, but, on the contrary, was as free as any one could be. I was one of those who took part in the making of that Financial Agreement, and surely it was right that I should support that to which I had agreed.",36
201,Mr TENSEN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"And when we agree to our platform, surely we have a right to support it.",36
202,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Honourable members opposite agree to their platform in order to get into Parliament. They could not secure their return unless they belonged to the Labour party. Scarcely any of them would be able even to put his head inside this chamber but for the fact that he is a member of the Labour party. The Opposition, on the other hand, are returned to this Parliament on the votes of the people, and are absolutely free. We have also behind us a record of some service to the people. Some honourable members on the Government side of the House, however, cannot point to anything of the kind. A man has no right to expect to be returned to the Federal Parliament unless he has rendered some good service to his country. He has no right to be pitchforked into this Parliament.",36
203,The CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Order ! The honourable member must discuss the question.,36
204,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,An honourable member opposite has talked of the wrongs which the people have suffered. Is the Commonwealth system of old-age pensions a wrong to the people? Is free education a wrong? Who provided for that system? Not the Labour party.,36
205,Mr WEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Yes , the Labour party.",36
206,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I introduced the system in Western Australia long before the Labour party was known there. Then, again, are free hospitals a wrong? The charitable effort of Australia comes, I suppose, mostly from those who have 6602 Budget. [REPRESENTATIVES.] got something. Yet the honourable member for East Sydney says, "" Hear, hear,"" when I quote a statement as to the Labour party saying that they, intend to redress wrongs. He has no regard for the past, or gratitude for the present. I wish, however, to point out that the Ministerial party, who claim that they have a mandate from the people, represent only 673,697 votes, whilst 1,584,785 voters either voted against them, or refrained from voting at all.",36
207,Mr RILEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,What is the point?,37
208,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The point is that the Labour party represent a minority of the electors of Australia.,37
209,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,And the right honourable member andhis party represent a still greater minority.,37
210,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member represents the electorate of Hume, but could not secure his return without the assistance of the Labour party. He had to go on all-fours to them, just as he has been doing for some time. The hounds, however, will have him; the fox will yet be caught. I wish to show how ineffective is our system of referendum with a view of obtaining the opinion of the people. The trouble is that thousands of electors refrain from voting.",37
211,Mr SPENCE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,What is the remedy?,37
212,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That has yet to be ascertained. I am not here to lay down a cut-and-dried scheme, but surely a remedy can be found. The present system is unsatisfactory, and we ought to adopt one under which a majority of the people would carry a measure submitted to them.",37
213,Mr SPENCE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Would the honourable member make voting compulsory?,37
214,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Something should be done, and compulsory voting might be a very good thing; at any rate, it would have better results than this bogus mandate given at an election at which more abstained from voting than voted. At the last .general election, out of a roll of 2,258,482, there were 942,130 electors who did not vote.",37
215,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"They were at work on election day, perhaps.",37
216,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I do not know why they did not vote. It is now proposed to take a referendum when there is none of the excitement that attaches to a general election; and it is not at all likely that larger number of the electors will vote than Budget. in April last. On the contrary, I am inclined to think that there will be a small poll. Only about 30 per cent, of the electors voted for the present Ministerial majority, and 70 per cent, are not represented by honourable members opposite, or in this House. I deny that there is any great urgency before the next general election for the settlement of these questionsby a process which will cost £40,000 or £50,000. On the score of economy and convenience, the elections for both Houses are held at one time,, and a general election has, on two occasions, been taken advantage of for the taking of referendaThere may be some disadvantage in submitting so many questions at one time; but there is the compensation that there is greater interest and excitement, with the result of larger polls than otherwise would be the case.",37
217,Mr TUDOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"More voted in April last than at any previous Commonwealth general election. Sir JOHN.FORREST - At any rate, it appears to me that we are not likely to have a' large poll for the referenda, and that, therefore, the result is not likely to be satisfactory, whichever side wins. What is desirable, above all, is that questions submitted in this way to the people should be thoroughly understood, and that cannot beaccomplished between pow and next April unless there is considerable canvassing,, which is not likely in the absence of theordinary inducements of a general election. Altogether, I think it' most ill-advised to> take the referenda at the time proposed. A great number of honourable members are going to other parts of the world in search of recreation and health after a long session; and yet, in the next three or four months, they are to be exposed to the trouble of practically another election. As to the State debts, although we heard much from honourable members opposite last session in regard to the absolute necessity for their being taken over by the Common-, wealth, in order to secure the solvency of the country, little or nothing has been heard of the matter since the Labour Government came into power. Apparently, the taking over of the State debts was only useful to the Government as a placard during the elections. When before my constituents I advocated the taking over of the debts> though I said that the world, of course, a' would not come to an end if the people decided otherwise. I took the view that as we had the right to take over £200,000,000 of debts, we might as well take over another £50,000,000, though I knew that that was not the opinion held by ihe whole of my colleagues. The question was carried in the affirmative in all of the States, except New South Wales, where there was a large majority against the proposal. At any rate, the Government have r.ow been seven months in office; and, beyond answers to one or two questions to the effect that the matter will be dealt with next session, no intimation or information has been vouchsafed to us. In 1911, there will mature, in round figures, loans representing £7,000,000, for which provision will have to be made. Are the States to be left to make that provision, or is the Commonwealth going to undertake the work? In 1912, debts representing £11,000,000 will mature j in 1913, debts representing ^£10,000,000; in 1914, debts representing £2,000,000; and, in 1915, debts representing £20,000,000; or debts - to the amount of £51,000,000, with an interest bill of £9,000,000, will have to be provided for in the next five years. This is a question so important to Australia that it ought to be grappled with at once; and I should like to know whether the Government have done anything in the matter. Have they written to the authorities at Home, and is there any correspondence that can be communicated to honourable members? If the Government have not done anything, what do they propose to do?",37
218,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I ' thought that, in the honourable member's opinion, the Government have already done too much !",38
219,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member is not seized of the serious importance of these questions, or he would not make such interjections.",38
220,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I am as strongly favour of taking over the debts as is the honourable member !,38
221,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Then the honourable member ought to help me to rouse the Government to action, because something ought to be done quickly. There is in the Treasury correspondence with the financiers in England years ago, when I was Treasurer; so that something has been done already. Of course, we do not desire the Government to tell us everything that transpires; but we ought, to have the satisfaction of knowing that they are active, and whether the prospects are good or bad.",38
222,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"What about taking over some of the State assets-the railways, for instance ?",38
223,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The Commonwealth has already taken over the Customs and Excise revenue.,38
224,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"We should take the railways, too!",38
225,Sir JOHN FORREST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I do not see any force in that argument. The honourable member talks like the man who made a bargain, and then turned to the other party, and said: "" Well, now, I think this is too fair an arrangement, so I am going to dispossess you altogether, and take the lot."" That is the sort of dishonest ideas to which such interjections give rise. If we desire to take over any properties, we must pay for them, and give a fair price. The Government have an obedient majority in both Chambers. We have heard that another place has ceased to be a deliberative assembly; and I think we may say the same of this House. Honourable members opposite vote en bloc on all subjects; if they do overstep the mark one day, they are rounded up the next, and made to toe the line. We saw an example of that the other day, when honourable members opposite, on a popular proposal, voted against the Government, but subsequently came back like "" dumb, driven cattle,"" to quote Longfellow, and recanted all they had previously said. Honourable members opposite settle these questions in caucus, and are bound to act accordingly in the House; and the Government are using their obedient majority for carrying out a species of oppression and injury on those opposed to themi. If they have a mandate, as they declare, it is not honest to say one thing before an election and another thing after gaining the victory. Before the election we were told that the land tax was to be 4d. in the £ 1 , but when the Labour' party in had attained power the figure was made 6d. Then, as to the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, every Labour man in Western Australia declared that the payment was to be 25s for twenty-five years, whereas now we find that it is to be 25s. for ten years. The expenditure of the Government is already very large, and is constantly being added to. The opening up of the Northern Territory will cost £20,000,000 in the next ten years. I do not make that statement without some reason. It is already provided that our Fleet shallsoon be doubled in size and strength. There is also the building of the Trans-Australian railway, and other large works. All these matters will entail an immense expenditure on the Commonwealth within the next ten years. The question which we on this side of the House have to ask ourselves, and which I have already asked myself again and again, is, '' Are the party at present in power capable of dealing satisfactorily with all these matters?"" My answer is an emphatic "" No."" - Mr FRANK FOSTER (New England) [3.1] - The speech of the honourable member for Swan has at least been very interesting, but if it is to be regarded as his "" Swan song "" it has been a very discordant one. I have always been led to believe that the two places in Australia where extravagant language might be heard were the Yarra bank, in Melbourne, and the Domain, in Sydney; but for extravagant language commend me to the honourable member for Swan when he approaches any question connected with the Labour party. I may instance his ravings in regard to the land tax. The burden of his song was the enormous amount of expenditure that faces us in the future, and the immense number of responsibilities which the Government have shouldered. He has been good enough to tell us a great deal about how we ought to discharge those responsibilities, but he becomes extremely amusing when he approaches the question of raising the extra money necessary for the development of Australia. That is where - he baulks. He refuses to tell us any alternative to the method we have adopted. I cannot help thinking that his extravagant language with regard to our "" confiscatory "" land tax is about the last shriek of those gentlemen who are going to be dispossessed of something of which they have not been making good use.",38
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Then they are going to be dispossessed?,39
227,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I hope so. I have absolutely no objection to any of them calling their dispossession by us the confiscation of their large estates, but it is simply the transfer of those large estates from them to thousands of others who will make better use of the land. Call it what you will, that dispossession must take place in the interests of Australia. If those people who have been so fortunate, by legitimate or illegitimate means, as to obtain large areas of Australia to the detriment of proper settlement, really share our idea of what is proper to develop this country, as they say they do, they ought to be the very last to squeal. It ill-becomes them to talk in the manner just adopted by the honourable member for Swan, when we say, "" We have to defend this country, and it will cost millions. We must build great railways, and we ask you, who have an abundance of money, to give a little more than you have been giving in the past to meet these obligations.""",39
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,How can they give it if they are to be dispossessed of their property ?,39
229,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If they hold on they will give it, but if they are dispossessed they will get out of paying the tax and allow others to pay it in another way. The bulk of the money for the use of this Parliament is paid today by what we term the working classes. The honourable member has said that this party represent the poor of Australia. We are the enemies of poverty. We hope to abolish the poor. The idea of there being poor people does not commend itself to us at all, and our object is the same as that of Lloyd-George at present in the Old Land. He is trying to place the burden on the shoulders best able to bear it, and I hold that the Government deserve the support of Australia in effecting a similar purpose through a progressive land tax. Our position is absolutely unassailable when looked at through the spectacles of the naked truth, but an attack such as we have listened to is only to be expected from people like the honourable member for Swan, who have had the field of government to themselves for so long, and were not confronted as are the present Government by a caucus. They could simply put their measures down, and they were passed. I do not know how to describe the obedience of the party behind them.",39
230,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member for Swan has done more for Australia than the honourable member will do if he lives for a thousand years.,39
231,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Onl y lunatics and innocent people attempt to make prophecies of that magnitude. I prefer to believe that the honourable member is innocent. If he can prophesy for a thousand years, he is too great or too innocent a man to waste his time in a foolish little place like the Federal Parliament. The honourable member for Swan while in office must have done some good, and we give him credit for it, as we give credit to any other member on the other side who has done good things; but when the honourable member for Swan misrepresents the actions of those on this side, he must submit to a reply being made to his statements. Any one who listened to the honourable member for Swan and the Leader of the Opposition would believe that all the work of the Government is now done in caucus, but do those honourable members think that the people of Australia object to more scrutiny being given to measures than is given' on the floor of this House? Do they disapprove of a party working so hard that it not only meets in this chamber, but in its caucus room also? It would be well for this country if a little more scrutiny were given to legislation, and a little more work done, especially in connection with the finances,in this Parliament. One of the weak spots of all Governments under our system is the want of grasp of the details of administration in the various Departments. no Minister will pretend for a moment that he has an all-comprehensive grasp of his Department, no matter which party he belongs to.",39
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Not even these Ministers ? - Mr FRANK FOSTER - Not even these Ministers. They have been in office for a comparatively short while, and have done wonders. They have given us in one session enough work for two. I cannot understand their great anxiety to cram all they have done into one session. If the Government ask us to put two sessions' work into one, a long recess such a? is now before us is justified, even without the all-sufficient reasons which already exist for it. It is an absolute absurdity to say that the Labour party settle everything in their caucus, that members come into the Chamber hide bound, and-that Bills cannot be altered here. It is even a greater absurdity to make that statement about the Budget. Honourable members, if they look at the programme to which we pledge ourselves, will find in it only two important financial matters- a National Bank and the restriction of public borrowing. Those are the only two financial questions on which we are bound in the fighting platform. We, as a party, believe in trusting the Government, the men who are on the spot, with the administration of the finances. I am sure that that is the feeling among the rank and file of the party. So far as this Government have gone, I see no reason for distrust. They are, of course, on their trial, and on their mettle. They have had only a few months of office, and if they had accomplished more than they have done it would have been surprising. I hope it will be understood that the party are absolutely sincere in watching the drift of legislation and the obligations into which we are entering. We feel, in all seriousness, the difficulties that confront us. We realise that in carrying out the enormous programme laid before us we shall have to use a good deal of brain work to discover how to finance the Commonwealth as we go along, and how to do everything well and properly. It is all very well to talk about taking over the State debts. I am in favour of that, and hope it will come about",40
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Does it take very much brains to clap on a tax or two ?,40
234,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member's record would indicate that I hope he has found it very easy to vote for the imposition of taxes. In his term as Minister of Defence he committed this country to a very large expenditure, and I hope that he, although in opposition, will assist the present Government to solve the financial difficulties ahead of this Parliament.",40
235,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The Opposition have been doing nothing but assist the Government all the session.,40
236,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"They have In fact, assisted to a certain extent, and, so far, I am grateful to them.",40
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member never saw an Opposition so quiet.,40
238,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I do not think our Opposition was half as quiet, but one reason was that the gag was always ready for us. We have shown an example to the Opposition by giving them a free hand. Had they done the same to us when we were in opposition we should have met them with the greatest magnanimity. In fact, I think they have lived to regret applying the gag to us at all.",40
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The use of the gag last session was the best thing that ever happened to this country.,40
240,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If the honourable member insists on directing my attention to last session, would he mind running through Hansard to see how many speeches were made by the followers of the then Government on the measures put before the House last session? Will he show us the grand independence of the men who sat on these benches then? They were like the dumb, and it used to be a great pleasure, on rare occasions, to hear them speak. We used to get quite a shock when a follower of the Minister made a speech.",40
241,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That is what happens to us now.,41
242,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The members of this party have not been required to remain as silent as were the supporters of the last Government. I acknowledge that I have taken as little part as possible in the debate, so that the Ministry might get their big programme through; but I consider that it would be better to pass fewer measures, and to discuss them at greater length. We do not gain a great deal by pushing through a large number of measures without full consideration. I hope that we have heard the last of the accusation that the Labour party's programme is formulated in caucus and passed in the House by the solid vote of the party. Even if that were so it would be better than to have the Minis- crying for more expenditure. terial supporters voting solidly for a programme which had been considered only by the Cabinet Ministers. As to what has been said about the domination of the Labour party by the unions, honourable members must know that it is untrue. The members of unions who vote for us are few compared with the total number of our supporters. It is absurd, too, to say that we are nominated by the unions.' Any person, whether an employer or an employ^, may join a political labour league, and it is the leagues which nominate candidates. A great deal has been said about the degradation of the Constitution, the Labour party having been accused of trying to take away the rights of the States, and to bring about Unification. It must be remembered that the Constitution was framed by a Convention whose members were not elected in accordance with the principle of proportional representation, and that the Labour party was not represented in the Convention. We had nothing to do with the drafting of the Constitution, and cannot be responsible for the mistakes which were made. It was drafted by those who believe in the government of the wealthy by the wealthy for the good of the wealthy, while we desire the government of the people by the representatives of the whole people for the people. I trust that the referenda will be carried by overwhelming majorities. The fears of the honourable member for Swan in that respect are likely to be realized. This will be the first occasion when the people will be fairly consulted in regard to an alteration of the Constitution, and I think that they will speak with no uncertain voice. It is a thousand times better to let them consider these constitutional questions calmly than to mix up their consideration with the irrelevant and personal issues of an election. The vote which will be taken will not be a party or a personal one, and I think that the minority against our proposal will be a very small one. I share the regret of the Leader of the Opposition that the Government cannot give more time to the consideration of the Estimates, though I am willing to accept their financial proposals. I hope that in future sessions more time will be given for the consideration of these matters. The Government have hitherto followed too closely the methods of former Governments in regard to finance. Let me draw attention to the main proposals for absorbing revenue. In the first place, the Post Office is continually We know that for the development of the country an immense sum must be expended on postal facilities. The Postal Department is one of the sinks into which our revenue falls. But those who wish to help the pioneers, and to promote development, must not allow expense to stand in the way , of the extension of telephonic and telegraphic facilities, and those on whom the progressive land tax will fall should not squeal, because they will benefit by this expenditure. The railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie will cost many millions, and so will that from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. I trust that no parsimonious spirit will, be shown in the development of the Northern Territory, which will cost a great deal, and for many years be a burden on the Commonwealth. Ultimately, if it is properly administered, it will cease to be a white elephant, and will produce revenue which will cover its expenditure. Speaking as one who has had practical experience in mining, I feel convinced, after reading the geological and mineralogical accounts of the Territory, that in future years fields better than the Bullfinch field will be found there. I hope that the Government will incur all reasonable expenditure for the creation of depots which will enable the thorough prospecting of the country. I trust that the Minister will take a two-handed grip of his duties, and do all that is possible to provide for the opening up of the Territory. We also have to expend money on the building of the Capital city, though that can go on more slowly than the construction of the transcontinental railways. It is the Defence Department which soaks up most of our revenue. Whatever party is in power must provide for the defence of the country, much as they may dislike militarism and - detest war. I trust, however, that the Government will not spend much on naval defence. It is one thing to spend money in training the citizens in the art of warfare, so that they may be fitted to defend their country, and another thing to spend money on Dreadnoughts or other vessels of war which the progress of invention speedily makes obsolete and fit only for the scrap heap. This country is too young to stand' the strain of such expenditure. I am not prepared to endorse wild-cat navy proposals, though I am willing to go the whole hog in regard to the training of our citizens, so that, should the need occur, they will be able to defend themselves as the Boers did.",41
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member would neglect the first line of defence to develop the second.,42
244,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"We cannot afford to spend much on the Navy. In regard to naval defence, I would borrow some of the honourable member's spreadeagleism, and rely on the British Fleet to protect British interests in the Commonwealth and the Empire generally. When we become strong enough to afford naval defence, I shall be ready to vote for it, should I still be on deck as a politician. At present we cannot afford the money necessary both for the building of ships and the training of our citizens. Money spent on the training of our citizens, and in making them brighter, better, healthier, and smarter, cannot be regarded as money wasted, though we may never have to defend ourselves from an enemy, and I hope never shall. Other causes of our expenditure are the old-age and invalid pensions, and bounties. No matter what Government might be in power, their responsibilities would be similar to those of the present Ministry, and they would find it necessary to impose extra taxation to obtain revenue. This Government is to be commended for placing the burden of the taxation on those who can best bear it. Those who will be called upon to pay the land tax are those Who will benefit most by the development of the country. I am sorry that Ministers have not explained their financial proposals at greater length. We have heard very little of them, and know little of their intentions regarding finance, beyond what we have learned in connection with the submission of measures. Returned as I was to this Parliament pledged to support a National Banking scheme, I expected to see the Labour Government base their administration of the finances of the country on a National Bank. I expected them to establish such an institution, to take over the State debts, and to work the finances of the Commonwealth in connection with it, with a view of solving the problems that face them. When I speak of a National Bank, I have in mind an institution that will be entirely divorced from political control, and not one with which the Treasurer may do as he thinks fit. My desire is that we should avoid the waste that takes place in carrying on our financial arrangements through private avenues, so that the people may be relieved of an expenditure amounting to some hundreds of thousands of pounds. I view the government of the country as a business concern, and I trust that its busio ness side will be conducted in a business like way. The followers of the Labour party-thos e who vote for us-giv e us an absolutely free hand in this regard. They do not profess to be able to guide or to instruct us in regard to the administration of the financial side of government; and they leave the matter in our hands. I ask the Government to seriously consider the whole position. I ask them to consider the great assistance that the National Bank would give them in dealing with the debts of the States and administering our finances. I sincerely hope that we shall see no more accumulations of borrowing from foreign parts. We do not need to go to the Jews' in London to raise a loan. I hope that the Commonwealth is strong enough to finance herself, and that within our own boundaries we shall find the accommodation and credit necessary to enable us to carry out all legitimate Commonwealth schemesI should not stand in the road of any Government raising money within the Commonwealth by means other than taxation. It has been said over and over again that the Labour party are opposed to borrowing. Whilst I am against borrowing beyond the borders of the Commonwealth, I have never opposed borrowing from people within the Commonwealth. .The pledge I signed in this connection was to fight for the restriction ^ of public borrowing, and the first restriction I would impose would be in. ""regard to foreign borrowing. If the Government will but establish a National Bank, and take a two-handed grip of its finances, we shall have another source of revenue, apart altogether from that of borrowing or taxation. I have in mind, in speaking thus, the profits to be derived from the nationalization schemes in which we shall enter in the early years of Australian history. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Controllin g the instruments of exchange.",42
245,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Perhaps no honourable member has given greater thought to this question than has the honourable gentleman who interjects. Certainly an enormous saving could be effected in the direction he suggests. In financing our nationalization schemes, we shall find the National Bank acting as a king pin. It will be the foundation of the whole system. To talk of nationalizing industries in the absence of a National Bank is very like talking of conducting a business without a banking account. I hope to see a National Bank established as the basis of our nationalization schemes, and that we shall nationalize many facilities, and cially services that are, in effect, monopolies. I should not, however, stop at monopolies. I should not fear the Government taking over any service which they could perform better than could private enterprise. At the same time, I do not give a thought to "" going the whole hog,"" so far as Socialism is concerned. That is utterly impossible, and, even if we were to start upon it today, scheme could nst be realized within the next fifty years. I feel, however, that we should grip the monopolies, and obtain from them profits that would help to finance our great transcontinental railway schemes, the development of the Northern Territory, and the defence of Australia. Is not that a system which the public of Australia ought to endorse? Critics of the Labour party should take cognisance of that side of the question. We must come to it. We are forced on to i't. Has any honourable member the temerity to say that the public of Australia are going to refuse to this Parliament at the referenda next April the right to nationalize monopolies? I cannot conceive of one-third of the voters who opposed me at the last general election voting against the proposed amendment of the Constitution to provide for the nationalization of monopolies. I expect many thousands of those who voted for the Fusion to support us in this respect, and that is why I am pleased that the question will go before the people apart from personal or party warfare.",43
246,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I am afraid that party warfare will be introduced.,43
247,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It may be introduced by interested persons who wish to prevent the people from getting dieir rights. That is always the effort of aggregated wealth. I give the wealthy of this country credit for shrieking against the nationalization of monopolies, the establishment of a National Bank, and the passing of a progressive Land Tax Bill. After all, they are only defending the privileges which they secured in days gone by. But I utterly - condemn those who are outside that little coterie for not fighting for their rights. When I speak of the workers, I have in mind all the legitimate workers who do Australia's work. The right honourable member for Swan referred in eloquent terms to the pioneers. He sees, however, only the king-pin pioneers. He has in mind only the man who got ahead of others, spied espe- out the land, took up a big estate, and today is almost a millionaire. He forgets the men who constructed the roads and built the railways, who cleared and fenced the land, and drove the bullock teams with the first wool to market. He forgets the man who did the first work for Australia, and our battle is to obtain for the sons and daughters of those less fortunate pioneers some of the good things the of this world, so that they may enjoy them just as do the sons and daughters of the more successful pioneers. Thousands of men went into the bush, and got what? Whkt did the workers who' built the railways and developed the country receive? Nothing but a mean, paltry, miserable wage. In this connection, I cannot help recalling a story told of an election at Bathurst, where one of the candidates was a gentleman named Suttor. In the district there lived a funny old chap who usually barracked""for the man for whom he was fighting, and he was one of Mr Suttor's supporters. One evening during the campaign he rose to say a few words to a crowded open-air meeting, and when he stepped forward the crowd, expecting something funny, yelled and cheered themselves hoarse. The old man said, "" Gentlemen, vote for Suttor. Yes; by gad, he is the man. When other gentlemen gave their men a wage of only 6d. per day Mr Suttor gave his men is. 6d. per day."" That is an illustration of how the pioneer workers were paid. The right honourable member for Swan had nothing to say about the thousands of pioneers who were so treated. He confined his attention to the pioneers who succeeded in securing big estates. He pleaded for them, and it is for us to take up the cudgels on behalf of the thousands who developed Australia. When we speak of the workers we mean miners, farmers, and other wage earners, public servants, business men, and others who are doing the legitimate business of the country. We are absolutely opposed to the monopolists being allowed to dictate the policy of Australia. We resent also the way in which some of these men arrogate to themselves all the virtues of government. The words of the right honourable member for Swan this afternoon suggested something from the pages of ancient history. He made me think of the troglodyte who said,- ""You cannot do anything unless you have a stone axe."" The methods adopted by the right honourable member in carrying on the administration of the affairs of his State in days gone by-eve n the methods of conducting elections there until recent years - were those of the troglodyte, the ultraConservative. It is only since the development of our great party, within the last twenty years, that any semblance of Democracy has been infused into our great political compaign's. In speaking thus, we have no desire to detract from the individual work of any by-gone Democrat. I do not wish to detract from the work achieved by the right honourable member for Swan in carrying out, by means of borrowed money, the Coolgardie water scheme. But God forbid that he should be the Minister charged with the administration of the Northern Territory today. As one of the pioneers who went to Western Australia when the right honourable member for Swan was in power there, I cannot help recalling the way in which thousands of would be prospectors and others were obstructed by the effete and abominable mining laws passed by him. I am indeed glad that he is not in charge of our great Northern Territory scheme, and I am thankful that we have in power a Ministry that will place all pioneers on the same footing-wh o will treat the man who goes to the Northern Territory with a few pounds in his pockets, a blanket, a pick and shovel, and some explosives, just as they will treat the man who goes there to represent a company with a capital of £500,000 to develop great areas. I do not think the Territory is going to be such a burden as some honourable members imagine it will be. With proper handling, it should give us a return at an early date, although it must be carried on for some time at a loss Its position today is much like that of Western Australia when Bayley's Reward was found. In those days every croaker in Australia condemned Western Australia \ et look at the development that has taken place up to today! The Northern Territory offers greater chances and possibilities than ever Western Australia did. I may say one word or two on the details of the iistimates ; and I only desire now to add that whatever small mistakes the Government may make in their finances, they are thoroughly honest, and their intentions are right. I am willing to trust them up to the hilt; and I hope there will be forthcoming toat sympathy and assistance which a new Government, undertaking such a task, der^/l G T - B ED V y DS (North Sydney) A R K 5 V , ^ called upon in r e g r e t w e are L 3 4 J what I hope are the last days of the ses sion to deal with the financial proposals of the Government. The palladium of hberty , all Constitutions such as ours is n he power of the purse; and it is the pracuntil£ % , a e l s e w h e r e > to withhold supplies until the ast days. But for the adequate 1 1 - !if u e financial Proposals in all their details should be dealt with at a fl or ,hl U e a r h e r K P e r i 0 d / 1 d 0 not t h i "" k honourable members should .delay the Committee long by addressing themselves to this Budget; but I entertain views somewhat different from those of honourable memfm °t1 m m y 0 7u S i d e ' and cer tainly different trom those of honourable members opposite; and I feel constrained to, as briefly as possible, put those views before the Committee, seeing that we have not had an opportunity this session of reviewing the finanZL l ° f the Commonwealth as a Whole. The proposition which I have JhSf TT i u m e S in t h is C h a m be r that there should be a Committee of Public Accounts has been passed over with scant attention by one Government after another, ihe present Government have promised to consider the matter; and I hope they will do so to some practical purpose during the recess. I can understand that the Government, in withholding the debate upon the Budget until the last days of a very full and trying session, have been actuated by a desire diat much time should not be occupied in discussing it. Certainly it is a fact that discussions on the Budget and Estimates have in the past, in this and other Parliaments, occupied an unreasonable amount of time. The cause of that is not far to seek, and the cure of it, to a large extent, is the adoption of the proposal to appoint a Committee of Public Accounts. Such a Committee would have power to call for person? and papers, and examine the chief officers of the Commonwealth on the Estimates and Budget papers, and thus throw what light they deem to be necessary on the financial proposals of the Government. By this means honourable members would be relieved of the task constantly thrown upon them of seeking information, and thus delaying business while the Estimates are going through Committee. There would be the further advantage that, instead of receiving answers which frequently mean nothing, honourable members would, through the Committee of Public Accounts, obtain explanations which would adequately cover the whole ground covered by the Estimates. Honourable members would be enlightened to such an extent that they could, if they wished, pass the Estimates very rapidly, and be relieved from the rush that is now taking place in the dying days of an already overburdened session. It would only be on questions of grave consideration that the Estimates would be delayed, and honourable members would feel satisfied that their duty as custodians of the public money had been fairly discharged. The Prime Minister put before us a very plain business statement, and no one could complain of failure to understand what it meant. On the other hand, the statement was too restrictive; it was merely a recapitulation of the receipts and expenditure of last year, with an estimate for the current year. If there ever was a time in the history of the Commonwealth-and I do not think there can ever be such a time in the future --that called for something more, it was when 'the Prime Minister delivered his statement. Great changes were being made; we were face to face with the end of the Braddon section, with a mandate from the people for a final financial adjustment with the States, and, for the 6rst time, with the consideration of efficient naval and military protection for the Commonwealth, together with the large Mr G. B. Edwards. votes that would be requisite for carrying out all these proposals. We had at last to solve the question-whic h had been pressing on us for many years by reason of its importance, not only to the general development of Australia, but to our future protection-of the taking over of the Northern Territory, and with that we had to consider the initiation of transcontinental railways for linking up the railway systems of Australia. Further, we had to adopt some means of taxation to meet the large expenditure which will necessarily be involved by the proposals of the Government. Measures of such importance demanded something more than an ordinary Ministerial statement of the receipts and expenditure last year and an estimate for the current year. We required a rough forecast of how the Commonwealth will stand next year and the year after; in other words, we required a financial statement which would deal, however roughly and restrictedly as to outline, with the position of the Commonwealth in relation to its own affairs and in relation to the States for the next two years. Such Budgets have frequently been presented in this and other Parliaments in the past, and having regard to the momentous changes before us, and the new and heavy system of taxation to be introduced, I regret the Treasurer did not see his way to forecast the position of the Government as nearly as he could during the next two or three years. The abstract of the financial position put before us by the Acting Prime Minister shows that the expenditure includes £2^334,496 for special public works, to which I should like to briefly refer, on account of their importance. There is towards the new Fleet, £850,000; military stores, £200,000; cloth for uniforms, £50,000; Federal Capital, £45,000; and other items making up the total I have mentioned. The expenditure, including the £2,334,496, and eliminating the amount brought forward from last year for the purpose of squaring with the States, is shown as £16,841,629. The Commonwealth estimates of expenditure have always been adequate. Year after year, since the careful days of Sir George Turner, the amount estimated has not been spent.",43
248,Mr WEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,More is the pity !,45
249,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"In one way, yes; but not in another, because there is shown a very careful administration and estimate of what was required.",45
250,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,A parsimonious estimate !,46
251,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member is referring to works in connection with the Post Office, with which. I shall deal later. The general expenditure has been very rationally estimated in the past, and the government has been carried on with a trifle of saving. The Prime Minister, in his estimate of revenue to meet the expenditure, makes it exactly the same amount, namely, £16,841,629, showing neither surplus nor deficiency. The accounts are made square after a singularly cautious estimate of the revenue under the main headings of receipts. would have been a deficiency of £1,044,129 only that the Prime Minister estimated £1,000,000 from the land tax, and then credited the receipts from the miscellaneous items for the balance, £44,129. The receipts under this heading in the previous year were £62,806. That is the simple chandler-shop way in which the Treasurer of the Commonwealth balances his accounts; and I think 1I have every justification for regarding the estimate of revenue as a singularly cautious one. If honourable members will follow me for a few moments, while I lay before them a few facts relating to the position of the Commonwealth, they will be inclined to agree, I think, that the estimate is not only singularly cautious, but shows a singularly pessimistic view of our future prospects. I could show, on the back of an old envelope, a Budget that would give a far more accurate idea of the results of the current year's finances than do all the pages of the Treasurer's Budget papers. I should set down the cost of the Federal Government in the current year as, roughly, £1,000,000; to be returned to the States, £5,250,000; defence,""and those abnormal works to which I have referred, £2,750,000; the Post Office, and works in connection therewith, £4,500,000; pensions, £2,000,000; sugar bounties, £500,000; and miscellaneous items, which include many that cannot be specified, £1,000,000; or a total expenditure of £17,000,000. On the other hand, I should show receipts - Customs and Excise, £13,000,000; Post Office, £4,000,000; land tax, £1,750.000; miscellaneous, £250,000, or a total of £19,000,000. According to my estimate, there would thus be a surplus at the end of the current financial year of £2,000,000.",46
252,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member is forgetting the loss on penny postage.,46
253,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"No ; nor did the Prime Minister forget it, because the Estimates for the Department were framed with a view to carrying out penny postage during the current year. If I am correct in my estimates-and each day brings us closer to a realization of my figures, and further from those of the Treasurer-ther e has been a reckless piling up of surplus, or a skilful creation of a surplus.for ulterior purposes.",46
254,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Has the honourable member calculated the expenditure on the Northern Territory?,46
255,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"No , because There the current year will not bear any Northern Territory expenditure.",46
256,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,How is that?,46
257,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Before I finish I shall show, I think, a very business-like estimate of what the Northern Territory is going to cost in the immediate, succeeding years. The Treasurer estimates the loss from penny postage at between £400,000 and £600,000. For the Federal Capital £45,000 is provided as ample for present purposes; and I believe that if we handle the subject in the right way we shall require no further votes on this score, or, at any rate, we ought not. If the place is properly handled and financed the increment in the value of land in the Federal Territory and the Capital itself ought to defray every pound of expenditure on it, without it being necessary to ask this House to vote any of the people's money. There are also the questions of the Northern Territory, and the railway to Western Australia, which I for one confess that I am now willing to support. Having opposed that railway for some years, I now think that I can support it, for defence and other reasons, seeing that we have settled matters with the States, and have the use of our own independent revenue, .with a prosperous future before the Commonwealth. The highest estimate given during the discussion of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill,, by the most hostile critics, of the expenditure necessary on the Territory was that it would involve the Commonwealth in the immediately succeeding years in a capital; expenditure of, roughly, £10,000.000^ The Government's estimate of the cost of the Western Australian railway is, I believe, £4,000,000, but the right honourable member for Swan today almost pledged his reputation that it will be very little over £3,000,000. Putting it, however, at £4,000,000, with £10,000,000 of capital expenditure on the Northern Territory, we get a total of £14,000,000, which, at 3I per cent., will require at the utmost £500,000 per annum to meet it. We shall have available, not only that £500,000, but a great deal more, with a condition of affairs in Australia pointing to continued prosperity, to an increasing population, arid to everything which would make us believe that we shall be able to begin to discharge the new and necessary duties and functions which we have taken upon ourselves.",46
258,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I hope the honourable member is correct, but I think we shall be short.",47
259,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am almost prepared to swear that we shall have a surplus. We shall see by-and-by who is correct. The Treasurer in his Financial Statement referred with considerable regret to the facts as they appeared to him with regard to population, saying, at page 2688I desire to say a few words regarding population and immigration. If our population is not so large as some of us would desire it to be, the natural increase is satisfactory from one point of view, when compared with other developments. ' The speed of the plough, for instance, in agricultural development has been much slower. Our population has increased at a greater ratio than has the area of cultivated land. Here, again, the Treasurer is woefully at variance with the facts that he put before us in the returns attached to his own Budget statement. Those facts show that the population is now increasing at a greater ratio than for some years past. From every State there comes the news that population is increasing now more than it did last year. The census of 1901 gave us a population of 3,775,356, the estimate for 1909 is 4,374,138, and the estimate for the close of the current year is, I think, only 4,474,000, a lower rate of increase than for the immediately preceding year, although every honourable member knows that in every great port of the Commonwealth a larger number of immigrants is arriving today than in any other period of our history, unless we go back a quarter of a century. Possibly, therefore, the estimate of the Treasurer's officials of the increase of population for the coming year may be found to be very conservative. The increase in 1906 was 67,000, in 1907 78,000, in 1908 78,000, in 1909 98,832, and for 1910 it is estimated at only 100,000, or a lower proportionate rate of increase than for the past year, notwithstanding the condition of prosperity which surrounds us on all hands, and our knowledge that steamers are bringing additions to our numbers every day. The percentage of increase for last year is put down definitely at 2.31, which is 50 per cent, higher than the average of the decade. When we consider the speed of the plough which the Treasurer says is proceeding at a less rate than the development of population, we find that he pays no attention whatever to one of the largest factors in connection with our agricultural development for the past twentyyears. I allude to the great increase in the area under permanent grasses. The total area under crop per thousand of population varied from 2.219 acres in 1901-2 to 2.237 acres in 1908-9. During, the same period the increase in the area of land laid down under permanent, sown grasses has been most marked. In 1896 the area was 845,000 acres ; in 1901, 1,001,000 acres j in 1902, 1,413,000 acres; in 1903, 1,901,000 acres; in 1904, 2,004,000 acres; in 1905, 2,144,000 .acres; in 1906, 2,301,000 acres; in 1907, 2,416,000 acres; and for 1908-9, the last year for which figures are available, 2,445,000 acres; showing a most remarkable growth, accompanied, also, by an immense growth in the export of butter to the markets of the world. Here alone we can account for a greater development in .agriculture than is shown by the growth of the population, although the population growth is somewhat greater than it has been during the last few years. The Treasurer's estimates seem to me to be largely based upon the Statistician's figures for years previous to last year, when the rate of increase in many of these items was not so high. He gives, in his own Budget, statements showing the development during the last two years, and containing figures which are : very hopeful indeed to all who desire to see a constant growth and expansion of the agricultural interests. The total area under crop in 1907-8 was 9>355,052 acres, and in 1908-9 it was 9,892,393 acres, a considerable, although not too great increase; but the estimate for the current year, as given in the additional figures in the Budget papers, shows that the total area is expected to rise from, roughly, 10,000,000 acres, to, roughly, 11,000,000 acres, or an increase of 10 per cent, for the current year, as against a growth of 2.31 per cent, in population. There is, therefore, no reason for the Treasurer to lament the slow speed of the plough, particularly when we consider that, side by side with this growth of agriculture, there is the enormous growth to which I have referred in the area under permanent grasses throughout the Commonwealth. While the acreage of land under agriculture or permanent grasses has been growing at a rate in excess of the population, the production irom that land has been growing at a still higher rate. The production of wheat in J908-9 was 62,500,000 bushels; in 1909-10 ir. was 90,500,000 bushels, a rise of about 45 per cent. The production of wheat, of course, fluctuates, but last year's yield was the highest in our statistics, and it is almost certain that this year's will exceed it.",47
260,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I do not think so.,48
261,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It all depends on the weather for a few days to come. Given favourable conditions, we can safely anticipate breaking last year's record. increase of 7 per cent, was shown in butter and cheese, as against the 2.31 per cent, increase of population, which must sidered in relation to all these matters. hay, oats, potatoes, vines, sugar, &c, - rose ' from £112,000,000 in matters' are comparatively stationary; the number of horses has risen to 2,000,000, an increase of 5 per cent.; of cattle, 11,000,000, an increase of 5 per and of sheep to 91,500,000, also an crease, roughly, of 5 per cent. In 1891 there were 106,000,000 sheep in the Comindividual monwealth, and I suppose 40,000,000 were swept off by the terrible drought experi1907-8 enced in the few succeeding years; but Australia today is better capable of holdclined ing and maintaining 106,006,000 sheep than she was of holding half that number in 1901. Things have improved, owing to the way in which the pastoralists made provision for preventing the decimamunity. tion of their flocks by droughts. Fodder has been conserved, water brought on, various other means taken to prevent the awful ravages experienced in the decade from 1890 to the beginning of the tieth century.",48
262,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,And there are a good many more small holdings - George,48
263,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The small holdings are already having their effect. The figures I have given with regard to increase of agriculture and dairy farming show that, naturally, and without any terference on the part of the Government, we are 'getting a fair growth in that tion. One item worth referring to is that of pigs. It is extraordinary to consider how important a part is played by the in other parts of the world, while in the Commonwealth, where everything is practically booming, the figures regarding pigs show a fluctuating line of rise and fall during the last twenty years. Australia, which should be capable of holding and turning to good account a very large number of pigs, is probably the holder of the lowest number of any similar community in the world. It would be well worth the consideration of the Government to discover some means of educating our people as to the profit that awaits the man who with brains and industry can handle the pig. When we turn from the land to the statistics showing the wealth of the people, we find still more reason to flatter ourselves that the condition of the Commonwealth is rosier than ever before in our history. The coin and bullion in the banks An of issue rose from £24,000,000 in 1908 t 0 £ 7>5 >ooo in 1909, an increase of 2 00 nearly 14 per cent., with an increase of only be con2.31 per cent. in the population. In The deposits in the banks of issue 1908 but to £120,000,000 in 1909, an increase of 7 per cent. The deposits into the Savings Banks rose from £46,000,000 cent.; in 1908 to £49,000,000 in 1909, inor an increase of nearly 6 per cent. The average amount to the credit of the depositors in our Savings Bank, which in 1901 was £ 8 3s., had risen into £ 1 0 18s. 8d., and in the following year to £ 1 1 7s. n d . , which I am into believe is the world's record. The figures I have given show that in Australia one person in three has money to his credit in some sort of bank, a state of things have which does not obtain in any other comIn the face of these facts, I naturally ask why the Treasurer has suband mitted Estimates showing 'that the Customs and Excise duties are practically stagnant? Why does he take such a gloomy twenview of the future? His predecessors, from Sir George Turner onwards, were forced to give cautious Estimates; and Sir Turner was eminently justified in doing so, because he had to deal with the States month by month, and year by year, the and any over-estimate would have upset the calculations of the State Treasurers, and ingiven them cause for complaint. But I have exclaimed against the inadequate Esdirectimates of his successors whenever I have addressed myself to financial statements. Only last year, the honourable member pig for Swan underestimated the revenue by £750,000. He received nearly ,£1,250,000 above his estimate; but there were manipulations in connection with the pension fund to be taken into account. The day has come when we should insist on a closer approach to accuracy. Two months of the financial year had passed when the Treasurer ' delivered the last Financial Statement; but the utmost he would admit was that there might .be a surplus sufficiently large to fill up a hole and there. My opinion is that we shall have a surplus of something like £2,000,000, which will be sufiicient to fill a mighty void. We have no right to take so much from the people unless the money is needed; and it will not be needed for a decade. The Customs and Excise receipts during 1909-10 amounted to £11,593,000, while the Treasurer's Estimate for the current year is £11,700,000, a paltry increase of a little over £100,000; notwithstanding the continuing prosperity and development. To check that Estimate, let us turn to the actual figures available. On the 3rd November, a return was published in the Gazette showing the Customs and Excise receipts for the quarter which ended 30th September last. They came to £3,303,160, which is equivalent to £13,212,640 for the year; there being an increase of £480,000 in the three months over the figures for last year. The returns from the Post Office were £948,325, an increase of £73,000 on the returns for the same period of last year. Last week, the Leader of the Opposition moved for a return of revenue for the four months ended 31st October last, and was informed that the receipts from Customs and Excise were £4,349,124, which is equal to £13)047,372 for the year; and from the Post Office, £1,292,933, which is equal to £3,878,799 for the year.",48
264,Mr FINLAYSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The Post Office receipts may fall off.,49
265,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I do not think that the period embracing the months from July to October inclusive is the best from a revenue point of view. Probably the months including the Christmas season give a better return, whatever may happen in the months including the Easter season. At any rate, the receipts to date show that the revenue for the year is likely to amount to £17,168,464. The Prime Minister estimated that he would receive from Customs and Excise, and the Post Office, £15,841,629. If the revenue for the whole year is as good as the revenue for the first four months has been, he will be under the mark by £1,327,000. In addition, he will have the revenue from land tax. What is it required for?",49
266,Mr FINLAYSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"For defence. Mr G, B. EDWARDS - Defenc e is absolutely provided for. We have put aside £2,750,000 for that, and have increased the expenditure for the current year by refusing to pay for the Naval Unit in a manner which would spread the pa)'ments here over a period of twelve or fourteen years. Therefore, three years hence, we shall be relieved of a portion of our naval expenditure. The land tax was advocated as an agrarian reform, to discourage the aggregation of estates. Apparently, however, the Jacobite Club upstairs decided that it should be used for revenue purposes. If it was required for a purpose other than that for which it was advocated"" during the electoral campaign, the Treasurer should have given an early justification for the change. Although the tax was advocated as one for the dividing up of large estates suitable for agriculture, it will fall most heavily on city and suburban properties, for which at least half of the revenue derived from it will come. Had the Bill gone through as it was introduced, the tax would probably have yielded nearly £3,000,000; but in Committee we struck out the provisions dealing with lessees, and made many restrictions by definition or exclusion. Notwithstanding these amendments, there will probably be a return of £1,750,000; though it is difficult to make an accurate estimate. Only in regard to three of the States is it possible to ascertain the number of estates above and below a certain acreage; but, in regard to the other three, an estimate can be made by applying the law of averages in connection with the figures supplied by the Statistician. I estimate that in the Commonwealth 'there are 75,660 estates under 50 acres each, and 23,114 over 500 acres and under 1,000 acres. It is the existence of those estates which make it difficult to estimate the probable return from the land tax. As to estates between 5,000 and 50,000 acres and over, it would be possible to make something approaching an accurate estimate. The city and suburban properties are probably all under 50 acres each. Under the aggregation sections of the Act, that land will be taxed at various rates running up to 6d'. in the £1. Taking a rough average on what has been realized by similar taxation in the States and in New Zealand, the Government estimated return of £1,000,000 is ridiculous, though anything approaching an accurate estimate is impossible.",49
267,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I think that we shall need it all.,50
268,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I would like the honourable member to show what we shall want it for.,50
269,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"To be'gin with, we need £2,000,000 to bring the Postmaster-General s Department up-to-date. :",50
270,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Assumin g that w e do-and I very much doubt it-w e shall not need that amount every year. Surely one of the elements of the reform of the Department will be that we shall have some definition of capital expenditure, and that its works will be spread, as the late Government proposed, over a series of years. Surely we are not going to spend £[2,000,000 in any one year in the ridiculous belief that we can thus make this a great business department! If we are to make it a business department we must eliminate abuses, and there must be a judicious expenditure of money to develop business. I regret exceedingly, with other honourable members, that the Prime Minister did not see fit to give us at least a bold outline of the intentions of the Government with regard to the State debts. Throughout the session honourable members opposite have told us over and over again that they have a mandate to pass all sorts of legislation; but the most emphatic mandate that we have ever had from the people is that we shall devise some means of consolidating the State debts, and have, in conjunction with that system, some fund by which those debts will be gradually extinguished. Honourable members on all sides of the House received that unmistakable mandate from the people. I admit that the Government have had before them sufficient to fully occupy their time, but I - did hope to hear a definite intimation that they proposed early next session to carry - out this mandate. They might well have gone further. They might have taken some steps, by the appointment of a preliminary Commission or Board, to facilitate the carrying out of this mandate. They could thus have acquired information within the Commonwealth and elsewhere to assist them in solving the problem. When we carried the Bill-whic h I had the honor of supporting-providin g for !a Commonwealth note issue, I had hopes that the view which I have held during all the years that I have favoured the national control of paper money would be carried out. . I hoped that we should use the money obtained from that source as a fund for some such purpose as that of the consolidation of the whole of the debts of Australia. In that way we could start a system by which we should gradually absorb 'the State debts. Whilst we were upholding our currency by substantial securities we should be gradually acquiring the State debts, and gradually extinguishing them. The Government were favourable to making some such use of the funds derived from the note issue, but when it came to pinning them down they seemed to lack the necessary faith to enable them to boldly state that the money obtained in this way would be set aside for that particular purpose-that after putting by a gold reserve of 25 per cent, to meet any sudden emergency, the rest would be funded in trust and used for the gradual acquiring of the State debts. That could be done, whilst at the same time we could have a constantly increasing security to stand behind, not only our paper money, but the results of any possible world's .upheaval affecting currency. This brings me to another interesting point upon which I have had the honour of addressing this House on numerous occasions. I refer to the question of coinage. Year in and year out I urged that the Commonwealth should coin its own silver, and when I left Parliament the reform was carried out. The committee which sat upon the question, and of which I had the honour to be chairman, always urged that the seigniorage or profits derived from our coinage should not be passed into, and eaten up like ordinary revenue. They contended in their report, as well as in supporting it, that the money should be funded. If there are amongst us any capable financers they must see the wisdom, propriety, justice, and safety of having the seigniorage put aside with the proceeds from the note issue, and used as a. lever to acquire and extinguish the State debts. We have no right to use as revenue the profits on our coinage. Honourable members opposite strongly protest against borrowing for any purpose. They say, "" We must pay our way; we shall not saddle posterity with the payment of our debts.""",50
271,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,When did they say that?,50
272,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Then what is it they do say ?,50
273,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That we should restrict public borrowing.,50
274,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"As a matter of fact, the present Government are not paying their way. Of the sum of £150,000 taken into the revenue this year as the proceeds of our coinage, we shall be called upon twenty years hence to re-furnish £75,000, representing worn-out coins. The silver must be re-coined in about twenty years' time, so that the Government are saddling posterity with the payment of £75,000, or half the £150,000 that they are now taking into their revenue. This should not be done. The sum is of sufficient importance to be funded with the proceeds of the note issue, and used to consolidate and gradually extinguish the State debts. I have had to condemn some parts of the Budget, but I am happy to say that there are other parts of it which we can praise. I look forward with satisfaction to the realization of the Treasurer's promise that the Postmaster-General's Department shall be placed on a business footing, and that we shall have a balance-sheet showing whether a loss or a gain is made in the several branches of the Department. At present, when we have before us a proposal to amend the postal or telegraph rates, it is impossible for honourable members to come to any conclusion as to whether the Department is making or losing money. We do not know whether a profit is being made in the telegraph branch and a loss in the telephone service, or vice versa. We do not know whether a profit is being made in the postal branch of the service, or in the telegraphic branch. If the House is to have, as it should, a thorough business grip over the national finances, one of the first steps taken must be to provide for a plain business statement showing the operations of any such great business institution as the Postmaster General's Department undoubtedly is. We should then know exactly what was being done, and could shape accordingly our policy of reform. Another part of the speech made by the Treasurer of which I approved was that in which he referred to the proposal, mentioned by the honourable member for Gwydir, of having a scheme of work which shall be carried over a number of years. At present we vote money for certain necessary works, and if , by reason of dearth of men or other causes, those works cannot be carried out within the financial year, the vote lapses, and the money has again to be re-voted. As Parliament does not always meet at the beginning of the financial year, there is often a gap of three months between the lapsing of a vote and the re-voting of the money. Meantime the people on which the Department concerned has had to depend to carry out the work in question go elsewhere, or do not care to tender. We ought to be able to look ahead a year or two in regard to all works of magnitude, and the Government are to be commended for proposing to take power to outline a scheme of works for, at all events, a considerably longer period than the one year at present possible.",51
275,Mr WEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Has not the Braddon section hitherto operated against that being done?,51
276,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I do not know, but the proposal is that this change should be made, and I hope that it will be. Then, again, the Government have every justification for asking for an amendment of the Audit Act to carry the expenditure of any one year over a certain portion of the next financial year. It be-tioves the House, however, to be careful how they extend that power. We must always have a perfect grip over the Government of the day. After the last election, however, it was very desirable that this Parliament should not be forced to meet almost immediately, in order to secure Supplies for July. It would have been far better to give even our friends of the present Government a little more time to prepare their measures. Such a delay is sometimes necessary. An amendment of the Audit Act, giving the Government Supplies on the same ratio as the Estimates for the previous year, is most desirable, but there must be some stringent limitation. The power should be guarded in some manner from abuse. I am heartily in accord with the Government so far as these two or three proposals are concerned, and certainly think that we ought to have a more business-like review of the whole position of the Commonwealth. The Treasurer is, unfortunately, away on public business. If he were present, the circumstances of the Commonwealth today would call for a statement from him at the end of this session, showing what, in the opinion of the Government, as advised by their highest officials, is going to be the result of the various financial measures we have passed and the financial proposals upon which we intend to embark. It is very desirable that we should have this information, because, despite the fact of these Estimates having been framed by officials, I cannot help thinking that those officials must either be woefully wanting in capacity to deal with the figures, or that the Government have put their own proposals before us, over-riding, for political reasons, the opinions of their officers. Many business people think that the Estimates which we have had are under the mark. The returns up to date show that the Estimates are being more than realized, and we believe that a large balance next year will be at our disposal. We cannot see what we are to do with so much money as we shall have next year. Even if we allow for the building of the transcontinental railways and the development in the Northern Territory, all that can be done for £14,000,000. We shall have £2,000,000 in excess of our expenditure.",51
277,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,This year?,52
278,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member, like his colleagues, thinks that the Government will just about make things meet, but unless there is any unforeseen expenditure beyond that for which the Estimates provide, I believe the Government this year will have a surplus of nearly £2,000,000.",52
279,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Denison) [4.43]--Unlik e the Opposition, I have no fault to find with the Government for failing to submit the Budget earlier than they did. They had more important measures to place before the House, and were anxious to pass them as early as possible, so that the people of Australia would have an opportunity, within the next two or three years, of marking their effect. I was rather amused at the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition this morning, in view of the fact that, although he had the opportunity to bring about many of the reforms that he now says we should accomplish, he did nothing. The Opposition-the Government of the past-di d nothing but toady.or submit to the wishes of the various State Governments. We hear much about caucus rule; but what system did we have under the late Government? It was simply a system of government by the various State Premiers. The Prime Minister was afraid to take his proper responsibility; and, from time to time, asked the State Premiers what policy should be submitted for the conduct of the affairs of the Commonwealth. The Leader of the Opposition should be the last to criticise the Government for not troducing what he termed more progressive measures. What more could the Government have done during this session? I quite agree with one honourable member that sufficient work was submitted to the Parliament to occupy two long sessions; and we have been worked altogether too hard. I am glad to say, however, that the Government have carried out, or endeavoured to carry out, the policy on which they were elected by a large majority of the electors. In my opinion, the principal measure passed is that of the land tax, on which we had a clear mandate from the people. It was said by some members of the Opposition that, if the Labour party came into power, they would be afraid to place such an Act on-the statute-book; but events have quite falsified that forecast. Under all the circumstances, I have no fault to find with 'the Government for delaying the consideration of the Budget, even to this late hour. Some honourable members opposite have commented on the fact that honourable members on this side have not spoken at length on every measure submitted; but it would be a great waste of time if any such course were adopted. I believe that in the House of Commons members have to arrange beforehand to speak, and that some have been for years in that Chamber without ever receiving a call. I emphatically declare, however, that on this side there has been no stifling of discussion on any important measure.",52
280,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"There is no "" gag "" with us !",52
281,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Quite so; we agreed with the Government that, no matter how long honourable members opposite might, speak, no "" g a g "" should be applied. This is in direct contrast to the conduct of the late Government; and Hansard of last year records scarcely anything but the application of the "" gag "" on every measure of importance. Further, honourable members who sat behind the late Government did not speak at all, but submitted like "" dumb, driven cattle"" to any proposal placed before them. In the biography of the late David Syme, we read that that gentleman made and unmade many Ministries; and we cannot suppose for one moment that, having made a Ministry, he exercised no influence upon its conduct of public affairs. Is the caucus any worse system of government than that? Honourable members opposite simply make speeches in order to blind their constiin- tuents; but the day has gone by for such tactics. They have cried out "" wolf "" so long that if a wolf did appear the public would take no notice. One very progressive measure passed by this Government is that to provide penny postage throughout Australia. It will be noticed how Labour members differed on this question, thus showing the freedom of action that they exercised; indeed, the honourable member for Bass, who represents the next largest constituency to my own in Tasmania, supported his own private view and voted against the Government. I voted for the proposal, because I felt that something must be done in this connection, and that it would be impossible to increase the rates in Victoria. As to defence, I ask honourable members to contrast the measure submitted by this Government with the measure submitted by the honourable member for Parramatta as Minister of Defence. The late Government brought down a scheme, but made no financial provision for carrying it out beyond the initiation of a borrowing policy. No British-speaking country in the world has ever borrowed for defence purposes; and, fortunately for Australia, a hint seems to have been given to the late Government that the time was inopportune for floating a loan. We were thus saved from a debt which the people of Australia are not able at the present time, at any rate, to bear. As to an Agricultural Bureau, I ask what opportunity have the Government had during the session to introduce a measure in this connection? There was neither the time nor the money at their disposal; and as the State Governments have little enough to do, they ought to look after their own development in the way of agriculture. The Commonwealth are going to make the lands available, and it is to be hoped they will be developed as they should. Later on, when we are stronger financially, I should have no objectionto the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau. honourable member for Lang, until his visit to the Northern Territory, when he had the misfortune to sit on a crocodile, instead of a log, was in favour of the Commonwealth taking over the administration of that part of Australia. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That not so.",52
282,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"But now we find the honourable member arguing in a contrary direction. No scheme for the. taking over of the Territory was ever submitted until the present Government came into power; and the measure passed will also assist in the defence of the country. The honourable member for Par-ramatta would lead us to believe that Lord Kitchener was the only adviser Australia has had on the defence of Australia as a whole; but I may say that twenty-one years ago, Major-General Edwards urged the absolute necessity for a railway through the Northern Territory, and the provision of a small warship in the northern seas to keep up communication if the cable should be broken. That officer also suggested that Australia should have a naval force, and that there should be a raihvay to Western Australia. During the last ten years the question of defence has been neglected, simply because the Governments of the past have desired to hand over to the States some £6,000,000 more than they were entitled to under the Constitution. In my opinion, a portion of that £6,000,000 should have been retained for the purposes of defence, and of supplying the deficiencies of the Post and Telegraph Department in the way of telephones, telegraphs, and so forth. On the other hand, the telephone. system has been allowed to deteriorate, and the Government have noyr to face the work of belated repairs and the carrying out of new works which ought to have been provided years ago out of the revenue returned to the States. I hope that the Government will place the Post and Telegraph Department on a sound business footing; this can be done without any great increase in the expenditure, by a judicious outlay throughout the Commonwealth ""in the construction of telegraph and telephone lines, and other needful extensions. This Department ought to be placed under a Board of. management similar to that proposed by the Postal Commission. At present a highly-trained man like the Chief Electrical Engineer of the Department, if he requires an assistant or an employee^ in his branch, has to apply The to the Public Service Commissioner, with whom isleft the decision as to whether an appointment is necessary. I do not think it right that a gentleman in the position of Chief Electrical Engineer should have to apply to the Public Service Commissioner under such circumstances; on is the contrary, he ought to have a free hand to employ whom he chooses. At present the Commissioner is no longer responsible after the appointment is made; and altogether I consider the position as not quite fair to the technical man. The Board I suggest should consist of a chairman, an electrician, and a postal officer, who should take the responsibility of running the Department on business lines. The members »f the Board should be responsible to the Postmaster-General, who, in turn, is responsible to the House and the people; and such a system would, I feel sure, replace the present unsatisfactory position with effective management. At present, officers of the Department, owing to the restrictions placed upon them, have not proper opportunities to show what ability they possess; and I hope the whole question will be taken into earnest consideration during the recess. The right honourable member for Swan was very severe in his criticism in regard to the land tax; but I regard that as a very just imposition, necessary for the purposes of defence. It is the land-owners who are principally going to benefit by the defence of Australia, and surely, therefore, they should pay a little towards the cost of the scheme. The rank and file of the people will be called upon, not only to pay small sums of money, but to give their lives if necessary, for the defence of the country. Surely an individual who is residing in England, and drawing £62,000 in rent values from the lands of Victoria alone, should be called upon to pay a fair amount towards the defence of the Commonwealth. We are not indulging in a system of revenge. What would be the result if we did? May I remind honourable members that it is not so long ago that men were unable to earn their living in Australia because they were boycotted at almost every shearing board. One member of this House told me that he found it impossible to get employment throughout New South Wales and Queensland, and when his wife was keeping him by doing needlework, the squatters went to the storekeepers' and told them that if they bought anything from that woman they would buy no more goods from them. Is it revenge to take at the outside half the economic value ? Of course, there is no revenge about that. We are simply asking for what is a just and fair share for these people to pay towards the cost of the government and defence of their country, and so the right honourable member for Swan was not justified in making such a strong indictment against this party. He said also that we did not welcome immigration. We do welcome it, but we want to make provision for the people to earn their living when they come here. We do not want them to walk about Australia with swags on their backs. We wish to make it possible for them to get on the land as soon as they arrive, so that, instead of being a burden on the State, they may become producers of wealth, and play an important part in the development of this young nation. I wish to refer to the referenda which are to be taken. They are, to my mind, far more important even than a general election. I am going to take the matter up just as seriously at any rate, and am, I think, safe in saying that the members from our little State will address no fewer than a hundred meetings on this important subject. I fully realise that the Commonwealth Parliament cannot do much towards making this a better and ' more progressive country unless the restrictions imposed on its powers by the Constitution are removed. When they are removed the Government will be able to introduce progressive measures that will still further assist to develop this great Commonwealth. That is why I am so anxious to see the referenda carried. One measure that I am sorry has not been submitted to the House this session is that which will establish a Commonwealth bank. Such an institution would be invaluable to us. Had it been established earlier in the year, we should by this time have had about £8,000,000 of capital, most of which would have been bearing interest at 3 or 3J per cent. That would have meant a great"" deal to the Commonwealth, because I am not so optimistic as the honourable member for North Sydney. I believe we have great financial troubles before us, and are passing through a most trying time at present. It will be absolutely necessary for the Government to go along very slowly, or they will find themselves in great financial straits. If we had had our Commonwealth Bank side by side with the operation of the land tax. we should have been able to place the Commonwealth on a sound, financial footing. I hope the Government will endeavour in the future to introduce the Bill to establish a Commonwealth Bank, because we must keep control of the money volume if we wish the Commonwealth to develop as_ it should. Fortunately, we are living in prosperous times. The seasons are bountiful, and this prevents huge sums of money being withdrawn from the Commonwealth.' Should the financiers of the Old World take it into their heads to withdraw capital, their action, while it might not prove altogether disastrous, would certainly hamper the Government very much indeed. A great deal has been made of the sugar bounty question, but we have to pay the bounty this year, and, no doubt, we shall have to do so for a considerable time to come, in order to keep Australia white. The people have demanded a White Australia, and if they want it they should be prepared to pay for it. The only way to secure it is to pay bounties to those who employ white labour on the plantations of Queensland. I am not so optimistic as the honourable member for North Sydney. only hope his words may come true; but I believe Ave are face to face with great - financial problems, and if the Government come out with a good surplus, I shall be overjoyed.",53
283,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Hindmarsh) [5.9]. - The Committee can hardly fail to be struck with the remarkable difference in the tone of the speeches of the honourable member for North Sydney and the Leader of the Opposition. The honourable member for North Sydney has taken a very sanguine and hopeful view of the financial prospects of°the Commonwealth. Far be it from me to condemn him, or any other honourable member, for doing so; but, as public men, it is well for us, while having great hopes of the future, to recognise that there is no great harm in a Treasurer's Budget being framed on somewhat cautious lines. The honourable member's proposal for the creation of a Committee to inquire into accounts, and place honourable members in possession of financial information, if so desire, may be novel in regard to the Commonwealth, but has been often heard of elsewhere. I take it that the honourable member's proposal is that such a Committee would be largely responsible for the financial side of the affairs of the Commonwealth, but I have never looked with very great favour upon the idea. My principal reason is that I have no desire to weaken the responsibility now thrown on Ministers of the Crown. I do not know what view the Government take of the matter, but I should imagine that any proposal to diminish the cares of office would not be distasteful to them. The difficulty is that responsibility for the Estimates, and for the whole management of the financial affairs of the Commonwealth, would be taken off Ministers and thrown very largely on to the Public Accounts Committee. There would, at any rate, be a dual control, which we should be very careful in creating. Where divided control exists, it is always easy to shift responsibility from one authority to the other, and very difficult to sheet home responsibility for error. The honourable member's proposal, therefore, does not, I think, deserve very serious consideration at the hands of the House at the present time. The Treasurer may have erred in framing his Estimates on a very cautious basis, but I do not propose to condemn him for that. It is all very well for the honourable memI ber for North Sydney, when we are almost in the early days of December, to tell us about the prospects of a bountiful harvest, and give us information about the wool clip for the season, but it must be remembered that the Treasurer's Estimates were framed in September, and based largely on the conditions and prospects of the Commonwealth in August. It is, therefore, not fair to challenge the Treasurer's figures in the light of our present knowledge. Those who framed them, and the Government who sanctioned them, were not in a position to know the favourable prospects that would be before the Commonwealth at this date. At that date the amount that we are likely to receive as the result of the Land Tax. Act was an unknown quantity to the Government, and is, in fact, an unknown quantity today. It is all very well for honourable members to speculate as to the probable figure, but speculation is not a very safe plan to guide a Treasurer in framing his Estimates of revenue. There is a probability of the legality of the Act being they challenged in the High Court by some who are called upon to pay taxation under its provisions. Our experience in the past has been that, however careful and cautious we may be in our legislative work, it has actually been on occasions when we have felt ourselves on perfectly sure ground that the Courts have riddled our Acts and shown them to be defective. I hope that it will not be so with regard to the land tax. The Government would not have been wise in relying on revenue which a decision of the Court might prevent it from obtaining. It was forced also to have regard to a prospective loss of £500,000 through the reduction of postage rates, and to face the chaos in the Postal Department, into the causes of which it is not necessary now to enter, though a starving of the service for a number of years, and the operation of the Braddon provision has, no doubt, had something to do with it. I hope that the sanguine views of the honourable member for North Sydney will be realized; but the Government was justified in making a cautious estimate, in view of the .tremendous undertakings to which it is pledged. I hope that at the end of the financial year it will come out on the right side of the ledger, but I should not be surprised if it did not. The Leader of the Opposition spoke of the financial statement as a sort of serial. He said that we had had one in September, and were now having a second. When he was speaking, I was reminded of the saying uttered by Napoleon III . when he and Richard Cobden were engaged at St. Cloud in i860 in signing a treaty between England and France. Cobden complimented him on what he had done for France, and he replied, "" You make reforms; we make revolutions."" The tremendous change in political parties that followed the last election may well be described as a revolution, its effects being not less important than those of the recent revolution in Portugal. The Liberal party is practically annihilated, the only representatives of it in the Chamber now being the honourable members for Gippsland, Hume, and Eden-Monaro. The revulsion of feeling against the Fusion Government and its supporters was so strong that the Labour party was returned by a tremendous majority. Honourable members opposite fail to realise the greatness of the change. It has made possible a programme of legislation of a very remarkable character. The present Government having legislated for land tax reform, post-office reform, and constitutional reform, the measures necessary to give effect to its programme have left little time for the discussion of other matters. The Government could not do much more than give a skeleton Budget, and Ministers are not to blame because the financial information made public by them is meagre. Its undertakings justified extreme caution is estimating the revenue. But I see no reason why in future sessions we should not resume the jog-trot methods of the past. Next year the Government will be expected to mark its financial operations with greater accuracy. Australia, like any other country, does not desire revolutionary methods every year. Such occurrences as followed the last election come as a rule only once in a generation, and sometimes at even greater intervals. The circumstances having been exceptional, the fact must be recognised. I do not think that there is much in the contention of the Leader of the Opposition that the present occasion is a very favourable one for making provision for a rainy day because by reason of the expiration of the Braddon provision we know exactly what our obligation to the States will be for the next ten years. We have incurred large liabilities in respect of old-age and invalid pensions, and experience teaches us that the succession of good seasons which we have had in South Australia for the past several years, and in other States for long periods, will not continue indefinitely. He complained that honourable members on this side have not given the House the benefit of their opinions on the questions which have been brought before it, and suggested that we express them with great freedom elsewhere. That, he said, was not fair to the House nor to the country. The suggestion regarding the expression of our views elsewhere is refuted by the fact that we are. here all day, and to a late hour at night, and are not likely to spend the rest of the night in meeting in caucus. If there has not been a great deal of speaking on the part of Ministerial supporters, it has been made up for by the speaking of .the members of the Opposition. Parliament being created' for the purposes of legislation, and not merely for the making of speeches, there must be some limitation to debate. If the Opposition desire lengthy speeches from this side of the House they will have no cause for complaint, provided that they give us the opportunity. The application of the closure is unthinkable, but a common-sense decision should be arrived at as to what should be the length of the debate on any particular question, and that decision having been made known both sides of the House should avail themselves of the time alloted. If , however, debate is to be used, as it can be, to prevent legislation, then those who have the good or the bad fortune to support the Government of the dav must be content to vote and not to speak. That the practice can be abused is shown by the history of the House of Commons. A matter of vast importance to our English brothers is to be dealt with in a few days under the method of procedure' adopted there, and for what reason ? Because, years ago, the right of speech in the British House of Commons was abused to such an extent that it was utterly impossible for any Government to do any legislative work. Mr MCWiLi-iAMS - The position was the same in this House last session.",55
284,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I was not a member of this Parliament last year, and I am not at all anxious to resurrect Hansard in order to learn of the iniquities of which the present Opposition were guilty. I canfind a better job. I rose, however, principally to speak of another matter, the importance of which I hope will be recognised by the Ministry. In speaking of the Government in this connection I am referring, not to the present Administration, but to the government of the Commonwealth generally. There are dangers ahead to which I desire to call attention. I may be mistaken, but honourable members will believe that I am thoroughly honest in the opinions I express and, if I commit an error of judgment in this regard, it will be easy for them to refute my statement. It is very desirable that our legislative work should be carefully thought out and thoroughly debated before it receives the Royal assent. I confess, however, that the good government of Australia depends more particularly upon administrative, than it does upon legislative, work. Despite in-* different laws, if we have strong administrators the country must be prosperous, and such grievances as there are will not come very forcibly to the front. But the passing of the best laws that it is possible for the ingenuity and ability of the Commonwealth Parliament to devise must be a mere waste of time, unless those laws are strongly administered. I am not finding fault with the present Government, for the good and sufficient reason that they came into office only about June last and, under the Constitution, had to meet Parliament almost immediately, so that they had but little time to prepare their legislative work. Then, again, some of the Ministers were new to their offices, and none of them had been sufficiently long in office to know the run of their Departments. Then, again, wisely or unwisely --possibl y it was inevitable-w e have been legislating from io in the morning until t i at night. Whether it is well that we should work long hours I am not going ta say, but under such a system the administration of our Departments cannot be improved. Ministers have not sufficient time to attend to the work of their Departments and to consult with each other. They cannot obtain a full mastery of their offices and do justice either to the Parliament or to their Departments.",57
285,Mr FULLER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Hear , hear; the Government ought to do away with morning sittings.",57
286,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"There will be no future morning sittings so far as I am concerned. No one who has had experience in legislation would favour morning sittings. To return to the question, however, let me repeat that I am not finding fault with the present Government. Having regard to the way in which they are handicapped it would be downright meanness for any honourable member of our party to find fault with them, but the Opposition are free to do so.",57
287,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member cannot complain of the Opposition.,57
288,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am not; I am merely sounding a note of warning. The danger that we have to face is that we are going to be governed, not by the Cabinet, but by the permanent heads of Departments. Let me direct attention to one or two remarkable methods of government at the present time. Let us take the two most important Departments under the control of the Commonwealth, those of the Postmaster-General and the Minister of Trade and Customs. What is the position in regard to them > In each Department, there are a few prizes and a great many blanks. Any common-sense person would say that the prizes in the Department of Trade and Customs should go to Customs officers, and that the prizes in the Postmaster General's Department should go to the postal officials. But what is the position? Was the head of the Department of Trade and Customs in Victoria trained in any Customs service? Has he any knowledge of the Department, or has he been more intimately associated with the Audit than with the Customs Department? Is there in Australia a merchant who would manage his affairs on the same lines? Honourable members talk about the great Socialistic undertakings upon which we are to embark ; but if we do enter upon them and conduct them upon the lines on which the Government are running the Departments today, we shall make a nice mess of them. Under the Public Service Act, the Public Service Commissioner is given practically the power of a Czar. He is above the Government, above the heads of Departments, and, indeed, every one else. He has practically supreme power.",57
289,Mr FULLER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member did not object to the Minister of Trade and Customs being given the same extreme power, under practically the last Bill passed by us.",57

293,Mr FULLER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It is the one thing that honourable members opposite cannot see, far as those engaged in the industry are concerned.",58
294,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I am not preof pared to admit that. There are on this side of the House honourable members who know as much about the industry as does the honourable member.,58

304,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I do not desire Ministerial patronage; but there is no necessity to go from one extreme to the other, and invest a man with power to over-ride the whole of us and make what appointments he likes without giving any reasons Mr W.

307,Mr FULLER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,We have the same power over the Public Service Commissioner that we have over the Judges.,59
308,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am not complaining about this particular Public Service Commissioner, but of the office; and I say that we are responsible for any mistakes that the Commissioner may make, seeing that we invested him with his present powers. In my opinion, there is no necessity for the Commissioner to exercise such powers uncontrolled; but I admit that, at the pace we have been proceeding with legislative work this session, there has not been tune to look into such matters. The stupid and ridiculous system under which officials may. be removed from one Department to another, has culminated in the fact that the head of the Customs Department in Melbourne is not a Customs officer. This is not calculated to contribute to the smooth working of the Department, in regard to» which there is another matter requiring attention. What is very essential at all the chief ports is a Central Approving House, such as there is at Sydney, to the great advantage and convenience of merchants, shipping people, Customs officers, and all concerned. There is no such house at either Port Adelaide or Melbourne, and one, I know, is desired at the former place for very obvious reasons. The work of inspection, particularly under a protective Tariff, is always of a highly technical character, demanding the services of thoroughly trained men. When goods are landed at . various wharfs, it may be a mile or a mile and a half distant, the 'present system of sending these trained men out in order to perform their duties of inspection is absurd. The goods, or such portions of them as are considered necessary, ought to be sent into a Central Approving House, where they can be efficiently examined. I do not know what effect this system would have on the revenue, but I feel certain that it would be better protected than under the present rlan, while, as I have already pointed out, all those having business at the Customs House would be greatly convenienced, and business generally greatly facilitated. If we were to seek the advice of the able and experienced, men of the Department- I do not mean men who have been pitch-forked into positions while knowing nothing of the business- I am certain that the evidence would be overwhelmingly in favour of the suggestion I have made. Another great, evil is the concentration of the whole administration in Melbourne. The Collectors of Customs in Sydney and Port Adelaide should be able to give decisions, and deal with matters generally just as well as does the Comptroller of Customs in Melbourne. The Deputy Postmasters General should be called upon to act similarly in their Department in the various States. The technical points, of course, might be referred to the central authority, or to the Minister. It has been said that some of the officers decline to take the responsibility; but, if that be so, the Government's one duty should be to supersede them, and obtain the services of men who are prepared to act on their own initiative.",59
309,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,What would the honourable memberdo in the case of inconsistent decisions ?,59
310,Mr ARCHIBALD,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Of course, there may be elements of doubt, and the honourable member has placed his finger on a weak spot. But why are there inconsistent decisions? I undertake to say that we shall not find such a rich crop of inconsistent decisions in Sydney as in Adelaide or Melbourne, simply owing to the fact that there is an Approving-house system at the first-mentionedport.",59
311,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"We might get over the difficulty by placing all the items in the Tariff. . Mr ARCHIBALD - That is a matter of detail, and I am now dealing with principles. I do not say that under the method suggested, or any other method, difficulties may not arise; but I think this reform might be carried out in the interests of the revenue and of business generally. The Department, while guarding the revenue, should do nothing calculated to interfere with the quick' despatch of business; indeed, the Department ought to be as up-to-date as any private business concern. We should then hear no complaints from business men about the antiquated methods of the Department; and I shall not be satisfied until I see some great change for the better in this respect.",59
312,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Melbourne Ports) [6.0] - I am of the opinion that the projects we have in view will take a lot of financing before the end of the present financial year. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that we are making no provision in a good year for a surplus, but are spending all that we are receiving. The honourable member for North Sydney, however, was more optimistic, believing that there was plenty of money, and that a large surplus would be available. I hope his surmise is correct, and that the Ministry, although adopting penny postage, and other undertakings that will cause the loss of revenue, will not find that they have bitten off more than they can chew. I trust that they have made full provision for paying, especially the lower paid branches of the service, the increments that they have not given them in the past, and for giving them a real, and not an assumed, living wage. We must admit that, in certain walks of life, the more a man receives the more his expenditure grows. The conditions of modern civilization demand it of him, but the same conditions in Australia today demand that no man should be paid below a real living wage. No one in Australia, however thrifty he may be, can live under 8s. per day at his start in life, and there - should be a chance for men who apply themselves to their work, and whose calling demands mechanical skill or study, to receive wages as they become fitted to earn them. Many honourable members ask, "" Would you pay a man a wage that he was not worth?"" I must admit that there is something in that contention, but there is no position the Federal Public Service that is not worth 8s. a day, while men with mechanical skill who have to study for the positions they occupy ought to receive a minimum of ios. a day. Asa man reaches, and goes over the £200 per annum mark, I admit that I am not very much concerned about him, because I think that he can then look after himself, and fight to maintain his own position. Men in the Public Service who are receiving only 7s. 3d. a day should be considered more than are men receiving £200 a year. Those in the lower paid branches of the service have no hope of rearing a family, and making provision for the time when they will have to retire. I sincerely hope the Treasurer is saving enough money to insure that such men will receive an advance on what they have been paid in the past. While the heads and sub-heads of the different Departments are looking after their own increments, and making their own positions fairly secure, many of them will not assist those who are lowly paid to get a better chance than they have had up to the present. Of course, I do not blame any man for trying to advance himself, and the heads and sub-heads of Departments are quite justified in taking any fair and legitimate means to improve their positions, but most of them decry the work done by those in the lower paid branches as not being worth any more, while maintaining that their own work is worth a lot more than they are getting for it. I admit that that is human, but it should not obtain in the Public Service, where the conditions are quite different from those outside. We pass laws insisting on the payment of fair wages outside, where employers are largely subject to the conditions of the money market, or bad seasons, or other conditions that affect their business, and, seeing that that is the case, we should insist on a better wage being paid to those in our own employment. The Public Service Commissioner is the biggest transgressor in this direction. I propose to give the Committee details of, at any rate, one case in which that gentleman has fought Government after Government who have recognised that certain work should be better paid. He, in his position of Czar, has taken up the stand that the higherwork is not worth more than a certain amount. In 1907, during the regime of the Deakin Government, when Mr Mauger was Postmaster-General, the men working in the pole yard claimed that the wage of in 8s. a day that they were then getting was not sufficient, because they were really mechanics of a high order. The then Postmaster-General recognised the justice of their claim, and as they were only temporary employees, he, by regulation, assessed the value of their work at ios. a day. The Commissioner, in order to outwit the Minister, immediately decided that the positions should be made permanent, and fixed the wage at 8s. 5d. a day. That is what those men are now paid. The Commissioner says that the work that they do is only labourers' work, and does not warrant the payment of more. I wish to exhibit to the Committee a model of a telegraph pole. I am sorry that I have had to resort to this method of ventilating the matter, but there was no other way open to me. I am not an expert in woodwork, but I think I am as good a judge of it as the Public Service Commissioner. He says it is labourers' work to construct this pole, and place on it the arms and all the mechanism necessary. This model is for carrying double lines, with bars on each side, connected with bolts. Each crosspiece is pined to the pole with bolts that go right through. Everything must be kept level, and yet this is work which the Public Service Commissioner says is only labourers' work.",59
313,Sir JOHN QUICK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Is it carpenters' work ?,61

318,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The practical men in the Department, not the theorists, think that nothing is gained by using copper wire for short lines. Some of the iron wire lines have been in use for thirty years, and give as good results now as copper wire lines. Last year an jron wire line, put up when I was a boy, to connect the Age office with Mr David Syme's house on the Yarra, at Hawthorn, was still giving satisfactory results, although for a good part of its length it ran parallel with the railway line, tives, and was exposed to the smoke of locomowhich was prejudicial to its life.

Two years ago, I stated in this Chamber that the officials are too fond of seeing their work in the air. In up-to-date towns overhead lines will soon be abolished. The conduit system is not so expensive as the tunnel system. Tunnels would be necessary in busy parts of the city, but conduits connected with them would be used for the suburbs. The ratio of the cost of having wires overhead to that of having them in conduits is about as one to six. but the Department would do nothing in the way of getting rid of the overhead lines until an agitation for their abolition commenced. It is a pity that the officials are not more ready to accept suggestions for improvements. The Acting Prime Minister has promised that reforms shall be inaugurated, and that the Deputy Postmasters-General shall be brought together to discuss matters, but unless more notice is taken of the suggestions from outside, little improvement will be made. I desire the improvement of the service in the interests of those who are employed in it, because I do not wish to see their wages reduced. The service should - be run as economically as possible, consistent with efficiency, and with the payment of fair wages. The honourable member for Hindmarsh said that a private employer would never put a man who had been trained in one Department at the head of another, and.referred to the appointment of Mr Whitton to the Customs Department. There is a good deal in what he said.",61
319,Unknown,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,62
320,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Whils t I think that there is a good deal in the remarks made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, I feel that, so far as heads of Departments are concerned, the introduction of new blood is often advisable. We have had experience of the growth of cliques in Departments, and the introduction of' new blood must be beneficial. Such a procedure must be purely experimental, but ' an officer trained in the Audit Department might more readily fit himself for a position in another Department than would an officer in some other branch of the service. The Federal services are increasing. We are taking over more and more services from the States, and whilst I do not wish to interfere with the promotion of Federal officers, I consider it only fair that when we take over a State Department we should take over at the same time the officers belonging to it. The Public Service Commisisoner should not be allowed to exercise a discretion in such circumstances as to who shall be left stranded in the State service. If that system be allowed to continue, we shall breed in the State service a feeling of discontent, with the result that State officers will bring their grievances before the local Legislatures, and endeavour to place obstacles in the way of Federal management. Let me draw attention to a case in point: Some time ago we took over the old-age pensions services of Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales, and one would naturally think that since we had had no old-age pension system of our own, the officers of the Old-age Pensions Departments of the States would be considered the most suitable to carry on the Federal system. Those whom we took over naturally thought that, since with their transfer they would forego all chance of promotion in the State Departments, their rights would be conserved, and that they would be retained in the Federal Old age Pensions office. That belief has not been justified. I know of an officer who, whilst in a State Treasury, was almost wholly associated with the payment of old age pensions. He was brought over temporarilv on four different occasions to the Federal office, and as soon as our old-age pensions system had been made fairly effective, he was told that he was wanted no longer, and was returned to the State service, where he will have to be employed in a Department in which he has not been trained."" That is a practice that should be stopped. If the Ministry are not strong enough to prevent the Public Service Commissioner doing an injustice of that kind, it is time that they made some attempt to do so. Since we are approaching the prorogation, and a long recess, the Public Service Commissioner's wings should be clipped so that he will not be able to ruin men's lives in the way I have described. This is a very glaring case, and I feel strongly upon it. I do not blame the Treasurer, nor the Treasury officials. The only man who can be blamed is the Public Service Commissioner, who took it upon himself to ruin this man's prospects. I hope that this system will not be continued. The Public Service Commissioner may say that Federal public servants object to the transfer of State officers, but since this officer had been employed in the payment of old-age pensions, and was temporarily transferred to the Federal service, surely there could be no objection to his permanent employment by the Commonwealth. Under the Public Service Act, a' State public servant may be appointed to a position in the Commonwealth service when no Federal public servant suitable for the office is available.",62
321,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Resor t must be had to the service before we go outside.,62
322,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The peculiarity of this case is that the man had been in the State service for ten years, but was not allowed to come over with his fellow old age pension officers.",63
323,Mr GB EDWARDS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"In the consolidated office, room cannot be found for all the men who were employed under the State system.",63
324,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"When I assure the honourable member that the position formerly occupied by this officer has - been filled by another officer who was not previously engaged in old-age pension work he will recognise that an injustice has been perpetrated. The continuance of this practice will be to the signal discredit of the Commissioner. I wish now to refer to the Defence Department. Fortunately, or unfortunately, I have in my electorate a great many of the men employed in that Department, and, naturally, they look to me, as their representative, to secure redress of any grievance under which they suffer. Very often what are only assumed grievances are brought under my notice, and are easily disposed of, but I find it impossible to secure the redress of genuine grievances. I think that the office of Minister of Defence should be occupied by a member of this House. No man is more capable than is the Acting Prime Minister of taking charge of a Bill at short notice, but in dealing with defence measures he must be placed at a disadvantage. Every Minister looks upon a Bill relating to his own Department as one of his own special bantlings, and, naturally, objects to another Minister, when in charge of it, allowing it to be cut up and amended out. of recognition. The Acting Prime Minister must be at a disadvantage in-taking charge of defence measures in this House, just a« Ministers in another place are in taking charge of measures relating to Departments other than those over which they preside. I have a grievance against the Defence Department. I find it impossible to secure redress of any wrong; and I know of no procedure to which I can resort to secure the remedying of anomalies. We all recognise that the main body of our Defence Force must take the form of Militia, but if we are to have an efficient army we must have a larger proportion of permanent men than we have to-dayThe Permanent Naval Forces will also have to be increased with the growth of our navy. If we are to have an up-to-date artillery we must certainly have more artillerymen. Every one must admit that the artilleryman is not what he was some years ago. The artillery and the artificers associated with that branch of our forces are prac.tical mechanics or engineers of high order. They have to thoroughly understand what are really delicate pieces of machinery, rather than guns of a gas-pipe order, to which some of our old-time ordnance might well be compared. The men who are charged with the handling of these delicate pieces of mechanism must be paid a fair wage. It is reported that it is very difficult to secure recruits for the Royal Australian Artillery. I hope that that difficulty will continue, and that the manhood of Australia will refuse to enlist in the Royal Australian Artillery as long as the miserable pittance now paid is continued. The qualifying examination is as> stringent as possible. An applicant to be successful must be of high moral character, and of really fine physique. Our artillerymen are superior to those of any other part of the world. I have seen many of the crack British regiments, and I do not hesitate to say that there is no finer body of men than is the Royal Australian Artillery. We have the audacity, however, to offer these men only 2s. 66. per day, with rations and housing, and a certain quantity of clothing: Unless we pay a considerably higher wage the ranks must be depleted. If the men in the ranks had any hope of securing, after a few yeare of training, higher positions in the service, and - wereeligible for a pension on reaching the age at which they are no longer fit to be in the fighting line, it would be only reasonable to start them at fairly low rates But that is not the position. I should not object so much to the wages paid to a man on entering the service provided that he could work up, but the position is that these men, after they have been years in force-afte r they have acquired expert knowledge and, perhaps, have married and have a family to keep-continu e to receive the same beggarly pittance that was paid them on entering the service.",63
325,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,And they have nothing to look forward to.,63
326,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Absolutel y nothing. We cannot have the Force all generals or sergeants ; there must be some men in the lower ranks. We know, however, that by the time a soldier is forty he is really "" done "" as a gunner or a private in the infantry, as is proved by the retiring age. But, after paying a man the magnificent wage of 2s. 6d. a day, we cast him on the world unfitted for any other avocation, following the example elsewhere in the world that we have condemned more, than once. Similar conditions prevail in the Navy, for which men must be thoroughly fitted, physically and otherwise; and yet, no matter how meritorious their conduct, or how long their service, the highest wage they can reach is 5s. a day. It is only very recently, after much agitation, that good-conduct badges were provided; but there seems considerable repugnance on the part of the officials to recommending recipients for these badges; and all that the men can look forward to is an old-age pension, with the difference that pensioners outside the service have had opportunities that those men inside, with their small pittance, could not avail themselves of. Seeing that a large present has been made to the merchants of Australia in the form of penny postage,. I hope that something will be done to provide a living .wage for those in the Defence Forces.",63
327,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Will the honourable member tell me why his party turned right-about-face on a proposal to give these men a little work? Last year the Labour party were all in favour of this course; but last night they voted against it without a word of explanation.,64
328,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"In the past, there have been positions into which these men could be drafted in the Pay Branch, the Stores Branch, and the Ordnance Branch. This was done at the instance of the honourable member for Parramatta, when he was Minister of Defence, and unanimously approved by the House; and yet, without a trial, the system has been abolished at ' the behest of civil public servants, the head officials in the Defence Department. -' Mr MCWiLLi'AMs' - Who 'abolished it'?""'""",64

331,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"No doubt the Minment ister is to blame; but this is done at behest of civil servants who wish to keep their positions a close preserve. I think - am correct in tiiat view, because, in every other army in the world, those positions are offered as prizes to men in the ranks of good character and ability. I should like to give a little advice to some of sub-heads in the Defence Department. have no desire to name them, but I remind [ 35] 2 them that they are not there in their own interests, but in the interests of the people of Australia, and to do justice to all beneath them in position. When we find them failing signally in that duty, some method must be adopted to bring them to book; and I warn them that if they continue either the pin-pricks or the bludgeoning to which they have resorted, I shall name them from the floor of the House, and make it so "" hot "" for them that they will wish they had been more careful.",64
332,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Why ""not blame those who are really responsible?",64
333,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I have already admitted that the fault lies with the Minister. I wasborn and reared in the Army, so that I know the conditions; and it is impossible to change the old order of things until some one takes a firm stand. Any man in a position of authority has his difficulties; but he is paid a big wage, and if he lacks tact, of ability, he only proves his unfitness.",64
334,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The Minister is paid a great deal larger salary !,64
335,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The difficulties may be greater than the Minister imagined, or, perhaps, than I imagine. I may say that there seems a determination on the part of some of the officials to discourage the use of Australian manufactures; and when they are forced by the Minister, by public clamour, or the newspapers, to take another view, they do so grudgingly, and in a manner calculated to discredit the local product.",64
336,Mr ATKINSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Is that general?,64
337,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It is so in most of the Branches, but not in all.",64
338,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Does not the Minwho are ister sign all the orders?,64
339,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I have already admitted that it is the Minister's fault; but those bther gbri'try 'a^d""""lf6""'fjla^ealso'."""" A'fter "" : : : : : : : years of agitation, it was decided to have thereammunition waggons manufactured in Australia, and a contract was carried out two ago, followed by another which has heen let. The sub-heads of the Departwould rather not have the work done the here, because, when the articles are imported, they have to be inspected only when I they arrive, whereas, when they are manufactured here, they have to be inspected periodically, and the officials are responsible for their quality. In the case of the axles, the Iron Trades Council have raised an the . objection that those imported for the preI sent contract are not so much in the rough as those for the former contract. It is calculated that about fourteen hours more work was required for the axles in the contract than is required for the axles the second contract. In the former case, four or five hours' work was provided a blacksmith and his striker, and two or three hours' work for a fitter and his sistant; but in the second case, the axles sent out are, as I said, in a more finished condition, and, naturally, the men here, who are ready to do the work, object. Allowing for all official prejudice as the quality of the steel and so forth, surely it is the duty of the departmental heads to give as much work as possible to the artisans of Australia. The Minister was brought to book, and there has been exhibition in the vestibule of Parliament of the Departments. House of a finished axle and an unfinished axle for a second contract. The work, am assured by men who know, is excellent; but what was really required was an finished axle sent out for the first contract, and an unfinished axle sent out for the second, so that the difference might have been seen.",64
340,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Minister's advice is their case. that five days and eight hours are required under present conditions to complete the axle, while, in the case of the first contract, four hours longer were required. The teration was made for the purpose of obviating the re-tempering of the steel it had once been tempered by hardening process.",65
341,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If the Minister's advice is no more credible than other vice tendered to him, it - is not worth and I prefer to take the word of men outinquiry. side the service, who are engaged in similar work, in preference to that of the Inspector of ordnance machinery. It seems petty to labour at this one question of the axles; but, unless we take a stand, --- the officials ---importing-more-finished-'work Tiie officials may mean well, but they noc' regardful enough of the welfare other people who have to earn their living. I have had seven men come to me icgard to Public Service pensions to they claimed they were enftried. They said they had been in the .service since 1878, but through .some set of circumstances, the Department say that they are other not entitled to pensions. I have brought ployed in five of the cases before the Departments, and the answer is to the same old effect, that the Commonwealth is not responsible for the whole of the pension. The State responsible for a portion, and if the monwealth paid it without getting the tion of the State concerned, the State would first take the Commonwealth to the High Court, in as has been done in other cases. Consequently, these men's pensions are not paid. for I do not say that the Departments are treating the men unfairly, but as there are asso many cases of this sort, and a lot of other men are now reaching the retiring age, and will expect to receive pensions, only to find that they are refused, the least the Government can do is to appoint some to kind of board to investigate the claims. The men claim that they were entitled to pensions in the State service, but the Departments say they were not. They are not educated men who can write out a brief that an will carry their case through the whole They are hard working men who have been sailors, watchI men, orfiremenin their time. I have appealed on this matter to three Governments, unbut I have not been able to get satisfaction. I appeal to the present Government to appoint an officer in each State, and ask the State to appoint another man, and let these claimants go before them, and state",65
342,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I give the honourable member my word that if he presents a specific alcase, it will be fully investigated.",65

346,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That will satisfy with me. The whole of these men who are which suffering under an injustice will now, I hope, have an opportunity of stating their about case. I am sorry to have to ventilate anago, a grievan;e, but some twenty-two years petty officer named Critten, emour Defence Force, was in charge of a boat. A child was accidentally knocked into the water, and he placed himis ' self, in order to save the child, in such Com- .a position that he was crushed. He was sancill for some two years, and was physically unfit to take his place as a petty officer in the naval service. While convalescing, and after starting work again, he had to move nearer to the depot, and lost a house which he was buying, and on which he had paid some money. He spent over £100 for medical attendance and medicine. The Government of the time gave him £200, not for compensation, but to make up the loss that he had incurred on his house, and for medical attendance and medicine, and with regard to compensation, they said to him, "" As you are not fit to pass a medical examination to be placed under the Discipline Act of the Navy, and cannot get promotion, we shall put you in the stores, make you storekeeper, and you shall hold that position as long as you are physically fit."" He is sixty years of age this year. Men who were subordinate to him, and no better in the service, are retiring today on pensions of from £120 to £ 1 6 0 per annum, but he, because of his injury, and the impossibility of securing advancement in the service for which he got no compensation, is retired on £ 5 2 a year. He claims that the Government of the time said he was to hold the position while he was physically fit.",65
347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Is he being retired ?,66
348,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,He has been retired. The Minister of Defence must take the blame for what is done in his Department.,66
349,Mr CARR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Why not blame his predecessor ?,66
350,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Because the man was sacked during the time of the present Kfinistry. It is the fault of the present Minister, and of no one else. Some time ago the status of the storekeeper was increased. This man wanted the position of storekeeper, and applied for it, but the authorities would not give it to him. Being somewhat of a sailor or bush-lawyer, he stated his case so well, and made it so warm for those who stopped his getting the position, that he was given a Board to consider whether he.should get the post or not."" The Board decided that he was not entitled to it. After that, from sheer spite and nothing else, he was dismissed from the service. He was no longer allowed to continue as acting storekeeper on the miserable pittance of 7s. a day. When a man is discharged from the Army or Navy he gets his bit of parchment stating the reason for his discharge, and immediately receives his pension, but this man has been discharged now for three and a-half [235]- 2 months, and has received no dischargepaper, and no money by way of pension. How is he expected to live?",66
351,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Has the honourable member made any representations to the Minister about the case?,66
352,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I have had the manbefore the Minister myself, and have been reluctantly compelled, as a last resort, to bring the - matter up in this Chamber in order to show what contemptible practices are followed by the Defence Department, for which the Minister is to blame.",66
353,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,What had the Minister to sav ?,66
354,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"All the Minister said was that a Board had sat on the case and decided that the man was not to get the position; that if he had been satisfied with the position he held he would have been allowed to remain, but as he was not, and his time was up, he had to go.",66
355,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Why did he not get his discharge?,66
356,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is what I want to know. I have persistently and consistently hammered away at the matter, and can get justice from nobody. I blame the naval officers for persecuting this man, and the Minister, for not being able to discern that they were not giving him justice.",66
357,Mr ATKINSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Does the honourable member think that the Department are hoodwinking the Minister?,66
358,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Minister has no right to be hoodwinked by them, and must take the whole of the blame for what has occurred. The man is now eating his heart out on account of the ill-treatment he. has received. He is practically told by the Department, "" You can starve. Although entitled to £ 1 a week, you shall get nothing until we choose to give it to you."" I trust the Honorary Minister will take notice of this matter.",66
359,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I have represented the Minister of Defence in this Chamber fbr six months, and the honourable member has said nothing to me about it before.",66
360,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I had to deal with the Minister of Defence in the matter, but I can get no redress from him or his officers.",66
361,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,What explanation was given?,66
362,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The explanation is that the man made himself a nuisance in trying to get justice from the Department. I hope that officers of the Army, or Navy, or any other portion of the Public Service, will not be allowed in the future, as they have been in the past, to damn any man who happens to ""look ugly "" at them, or thwart them fairly and justly in some cedure which they want to carry through.",66
363,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Who has the power to refuse a man his pension?,67
364,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Departments handle the case, and judge whether a is entitled to a pension or not.",67
365,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Onl y the law can prevent a man from getting his pension.,67
366,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I hope something will be done through my bringing this ter up. In conclusion, I wish to have other ""smack"" at the Public Service Commissioner. I hope .that in the future he will not be so biased in his judgment as to tell a practical man who wants pay for his work, that it is labourer's work, when, oh rhe face of it, it chanic's work.",67

I thought I was listening a debate on Grievance Day. that this is the first Budget Which the present Government have had the honour of introducing, I think honoristers able members on this side of the House should give them some credit for what have done, but in place of that there seems reform. to be a general desire to find fault. ing back on the work of the session we can see that the Ministry have been very busy, and out of compliment to them should pass the Estimates without demur. The Ministry have been instrumental in .passing into law of Acts for the imposibeen tion of a land tax, for which no word penny postage. of praise has been given to them, though these measures are likely to be productive of greater good than has resulted any other measure on the statute-book, as postage. they will cause a great many people to come to this country, and will have great effect on its development. vernment have also passed into law measures for the establishment of a Commonalso wealth note-issue, which will have reaching and beneficial effects. sion, too, has been made for referring the people proposed alterations of the Constitution, having for their object extension of the powers of the Commonthese grievances. wealth, so that we may control, and, necessary, nationalize, monopolies. would be foolish for us to waste time passing legislation such as has been passed in the United States, which powerful combines could defeat, and, therefore, if has been felt necessary to ask for the power to nationalize monopolies. For all prothese measures the Ministers are to be complimented, as having proved themselves desirous of advancing the interests of the country. To continue to provide for new Protection by Acts which the High ""Court man could declare invalid would be .absurd. The honourable member for Melbourne - Ports had a great deal to say about postal reform, and repeated the oft-told story about the defects in the administration of matthe Department, but he forgot to tell us anthat no Government has done more for the re-organization of the Department. On the Estimates for this year the amount for post, telegraph, and telephone services fair is more than £250,000 in excess of the vote for last year, in addition to £180,000 is mefor new works.

But in view of all the reforms which Ministers have brought about, we might pay them the compliment of carrying their Estimates - without much loss of time. They have passed more legislation than any. other Government has passed in the same period, doing not only the work of their offices, but attending the sittings of Parliament for three days in the week - from 10.30 a.m. until late at night. They have dealt with great national questions, such as the transfer of the Northern Territory, which contains an area four and one-half times as great as the British Isles. .1 hope that that Territory will be properly developed, and that, if necessary, money will be borrowed to assist its development.",68

In doing so it will have my support.",68
374,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Gwydir) [8.56] - At this stage I propose to deal chiefly with one matter connected with the Postal Department, so that honourable members may give attention to it when the Postal Estimates are being considered. What has been said by the honourable member for South Sydney - regarding the Government was so much jam, which it was not necessary to spread on the Government bread.. We. expect Ministers to do what they have done, and have always said that when a Labour Government came into power it would not follow the example of its predecessors. This Government has only done what we expected it to do.",68

377,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Is it not an axiom that this is the best Government that ever was ?,68
378,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Yes , but there are increase. spots even on the sun. I do not think that sufficient attention has been paid to the proposed introduction into the Commonwealth of the Telefunken system of wireless telegraphy. The Postmaster-General and his predecessor have given the history of the contract alleged to have been made by the Department with the Australian Wireless Company, but I have since looked into the matter more closely, and am of opinion that a serious mistake has been made, though it may not be evident to those not acquainted with the subject. The company calls itself the Australian Wireless in order to appeal to the patriotism of Parliament and of the public, but the name is merely a cloak. The company was created because it was thought that in no other way could a German system of wireless telegraphy find acceptance in a British community. This company came into existence. I take it, to play "" the confidence trick "" on the Commonwealth Government. It was put forward as an Australian company, and consisted of a few men brought together evidently to exploit Australia in this regard. The main parties to it were Messrs. F. W. Staerker and Martin. Becker, trading in Sydney under the name of Staerker and Fischer. This firm seems to have met Mr Denison, of Tobacco Combine fame; Mr MCLeod. of the Bulletin) and some other gentlemen, and to have told them that it was possible to exploit this market if an Australian company could be formed. Ultimately, a company was formed, with a capital of £5,000, and it arranged to purchase the Australian rights of the Telefunken Company for £4,500, payable in the form of shares to the German company. Subset quently this company, which was floated with a capital of £5,000, increased its capital, or watered its stock, so as to bring it up to £12,000, and it tendered for the erection of two wireless stations in Australia. Mr HEDGE'S - Can the honourable mem-. ber say how they managed to get fication altered after it had been issued?",68
379,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is a matter which the Minister will probably explain. The company secured the Telefunken patent rights for Australia and the adjacent British Possessions. Apparently the tract into which they entered with the monwealth Government was as nothing to them. Their main object was to secure a footing, and to extend the system in Austhe tralia. The registered shareholders in concern in May last were as follows :Hugh R. Denison, 1,451 ; William MCLeod, 251; F. W. Staerker, 1,101; F. W. Bott Humphrey, 701; Albert F.. Wheeler, 1,000; Edward A. Gaden, 100; D. W. Roxburgh, 100; George Tallis, 92; Arthur Lindsay, 50; John MCCallum Jolly, 151; and R. WKing, William Wright, and A. W. Perriam, 1 each. there According to a statement in a document which I have seen, it was estimated that would cost from £12,000 to £15,000 carry out the work which the company tenfact dered to do for a little under £9,000. reason of an alteration of the sites, claimed an increase of £2,000 OT tract price, and they are proposing to erect at Pennant Hills, near Sydney, little over £6,000, a wireless station, for which the Marconi Company ask £19,000. A Wireless Telegraphy Conference, consistmatter. ing of experts of the Postmaster-General's Department, the Defence Department, and other branches of the service, met into investigate the matter of erecting these stations, and the Electrical Engineer New South. Wales made a statement that each of them would cost at least £12,000. The company itself has undertaken to conBrisbane, struct for a sum slightly exceeding £10,000 works which they say will cost from £12,000 to £15,000. There must have beon something more than this conlong-range station recorded. tract to induce the company to put in such a tender. Let me give a history of the systems in operation in other parts of the world. It is well that we should have facts on record, otherwise, when the day adversity arrives, we shall have no means of showing that we advised the GovernJapan ment, in the best interests of the country, to hasten slowly in this matter. I find that Germany has 162 stations, of which 139 comprise the Telefunken system. None of these have a greater - range than 600 kilometres, or, roughly speaking, 500 miles.",69
380,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"They say that they have the specia range of 2,000 miles.",69
381,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I have taken these figures from the latest register.,69
382,Mr FINLAYSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Fiv e hundred miles is not the maximum range.,69
383,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"No one can say what conis the maximum range. We have no eviComdence as to whether this company will be able, by means of the system that it proposes to install, to transmit messages over distance specified in the contract. Of the the 139 German Telefunken stations, 93 are on German warships, whilst of other German vessels only 20 are fitted with that system. There are in Germany F. 16 Marconi stations, and 16 de Forrest stations. In Russia there are 15 wireless stations, of - which 6 are on the Telefunken system,- 6 on the Marconi system, and 2 on the de Forrest system. In Sweden are 27 stations, particulars of which are not given in the register. In Austria it there are 24 stations, every one of them to being on the Telefunken system. That is worthy of note, in view of the reBy lationship between Germany and Austria. they Both those countries have practically the conadopted the Telefunken system.",69
384,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Has the honourable memfor a ber also got the German war scare?,69
385,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member is trying to make light of a very serious It seems to be becoming the practice in this House to treat nothing seriously. In Belgium there are 10 wireless, stations, 1909 all of them being on theMarconi system. In Holland there are 40 stations, 15 of of which are on the Telefunken system, and 25 on the Marconi system. .For the information of the honourable member for let me say that Holland has one vessel, the Hertzog Hendrik, fitted with a Telefunken apparatus of an alleged range of 1,200 kilometres-the only Telefunken In Italy there are 42 stations, and they use only the Marconi system. Japan has 16 wireless stations, and has realized the desirablethe ness of keeping her system as private as of possible. There, neither the Marconi nor the Telefunken system has been installed.. has installed a system of her own; and one of her stations has a range of 1,000 kilometres. In Denmark there are 17 wireless telegraphy stations, the Telefunken system alone being used. Of these nine are installed on warships. In France, there are two stations, in connection with both of which, a French system has been installed. Spain has installed 5 Telefunken stations, and 2 Rochefort stations, tihe Telefunken system being installed on her - warships. Chili has 7 stations, on which the Marconi system only is used. In Brazil there are ten installations, three Telefunken and seven Marconi, and one Telefunken has a radius of 80 kilos. In Norway there are twelve installations, all Telefunken, and all on warships. In Roumania there are five installations, neither Telefunken nor Marconi, but of the. curious name of Brandy Popp. In Great Britain there are 313 installations, none of which are Telefunken, but consisting of 291 Marconi, nine Lodge-Muirhead; nine De Forrest, three United Wireless, and one British Radio. There we have the other side of the picture. The British authorities deem it wise to adopt one system both for land stations, and on ships of war.",69
386,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Why is that?,70
387,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Because they believe that it is the best system. Mr Laird . SMITH - It is because the British authorities have got themselves tied up in an agreement.,70
388,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is not so, as is shown by the fact that there are other systems in vogue in Great Britain. The total wireless installations in the countries named number 709, consisting of 221 Telefunken, 402 Marconi, 17 De Forrest, and 69 others. This record excludes all American and Canadian stations ; but we know that America and Canada, like Great Britain, have adopted the Marconi system. There I think. are some Telefunken installations in America, but none in Canada. are twenty-seven stations in Canada, of which, of the highest power in the world, is on the Marconi system, which been adopted, of course, with a regard ...unity. .pf-.actiop.as.bet.ween Great. Britain her dependencies. Even in South Africa the : ; authorities have adopted the same system; - and honourable members should ask themadvantage selves why it is that, while England chosen the Marconi system as a safeguard of the Empire, Germany, and those counof tries sympathetic with Germany, have adopted the Telefunken system? These facts are very suggestive; and I am sorry that the Commonwealth Government should have looked at this matter merely from pounds, shillings, and pence point of view, because it may mean the jeopardizing of the safety of this part of the Empire.",70
389,Mr WEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The Commonwealth Goat vernment have adopted the best system ,70
390,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is not so. There is another point as to which I am not certain whether the Government have considered it or not. The Marconi Company have taken out nineteen patents through the Australian Patents Office; and if that means anything, it means that some protection is due to that company under the circumstances. I should say that the Marconi Company will not take any infringement of their rights ""lying down""; and yet the Australian Government have adopted the system of a company which has pirated, at any rate, a portion of an invention patented in their own office. It seems to me that the Marconi Company will have an action at law; indeed, in other countries action has been taken with success; but, the defendant company being of straw, damages could not be recovered. The result was that it cost the Marconi Company £20,000 to defend its rights.. In Australia the circumstances are different. The Australasian Wireless Company has only £12,000 capital, with only the good-will of the Commonwealth Government to enable them to commence work in the hope of profit in the future. If the Marconi Company, under their rights as granted through the Australian Patents Office, should proceed successfully against the rival company, and the latter is not able to meet the verdict, the Government, having stood behind that company, will practically be liable for any damages awarded.",70
391,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That will not be so, There Mr Webster - I admit that in the one contract the Government are indemnified against any claim made under that head, has but the Government can have no protection to against a company that may not be able and. to satisfy a verdict recorded against it. '-Another point"" is"" that the-system adopted: does not give Australia anything like the that the more matured and dehas veloped system would give. With the Marconi system there would be a continuous line stations, and it is installed on nearly every merchant ship that trades to and from Australia. It may be easy to transmit messages from a land station to a vessel ' 1,250 miles at sea; but in the case of rea turn messages, it often happens that they have to be repeated from station to station in order to reach their destination. It will he seen, therefore, that by the adoption of the Telefunken system, Australia will be' a disadvantage, because there is only. one ship in Australian waters installed with it, and at present that ship cannot be spoken to. According to the information have received, the installation on this vessel power. is very defective indeed; and I am afraid that we are really getting an expensive and Marconi speak ? not a cheap system, seeing that it does not give the service that we have a right expect. There are other and more momento to us reasons why this matter should .carefully looked into before final action taken. An installation was made in the Bulletin office, Sydney, for the purpose communicating with Messrs. Huddart, Parker's vessel, on which the Telefunken system is in operation, the object being prove the validity of their claim to municate over the distance mentioned in contract. Owing, however, to amateur operators or engineers, or to the weakness of the system- I know not what-ther e has so far been no communication. understand that the installation has been removed from the Bulletin office to the Hotel Australia, but there is no guarantee that communication will be obtained there,",70
392,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I S the Bulletin in the business ?,71
393,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I have mentioned Mr MCLeod, and I need not say anything more. There is no guarantee that Telefunken system is capable of transmitl ting messages 1,250 miles.",71
394,Mr WEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Messages have been sent 2,000 miles. . Mr Webster - There are freak wireless messages, just as there are freaks in other spheres of activity; but experts take no notice of them. Very frequently, owing to climatic or other influences, sages travel much longer distances than usual; but the cases being isolated, they prove nothing. We must be sure that mesa sages are, and can be, transmitted .:: -:.given dis.tanee^.at.all times-. Experts - hold a the opinion, which I accept, that the funken system will not give that service which Australia has a right if I am in possession of information to that effect I should be recreant to my position if I did not make it known in this House, I desire, therefore, to place on record in the opinion of experts, the Telefunken system as established today has the weakness that it cannot be guaranteed perform its contract as to radius, Let any man with an idea of engineering consider the fact that the power necessary at any of the high grade stations of Marconi Company to furnish a current send a message 1,250 miles by wireless is 120 horse-power, whereas the power which I this company is going to use is 30 horse",71
395,Mr HEDGES,FEDERAL CAPITAL,What distance can the,71
396,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"They are sending to every day thousands of words from Canada Ireland, a distance of 2,400 miles. The be Telefunken people have told the Governis ment, whose responsible officers have endorsed the statement, that they will be able of ' to transmit wireless messages for the distance required with 30 horse-power. In the first place, the price asked by this cornto pany is too low. Secondly, the installacomtion will not be satisfactory. The appathe ratus is not strong enough, and the power is not high enough to give the service that' the contract demands. From a commercial stand-point, there is no comparison between I the advantages to Australia of the two systems. If we were merely to consider the matter as a defence proposition, and leave out the question of commerce, the question would be a different one. Commerce, after all, is the great consideration. I admit that communication will be able to be made with the Telefunken system in time of distress by merchant ships and others, according to the the international agreement, but those are y small matters, compared with the great o n advantage of the Marconi system, to the commercial world. During 1909, something like £5,000,000 worth of property was saved from destruction, and thousands of lives have also been saved, by reason of the timely warning and assistance given through the system which is being so widely mesused today."" There is no record of the Telefunken system having done anything to save either life or property, because it is system which is largely installed.on warover ships, and not on merchant ships. The Mimitatioris'- of """"itsusefulness'""""to the''c6m: : : Telemunity must therefore be apparent to all.",71
397,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Are not"" the systems into expect; and terchan""-eable?",71
398,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Onl y in time of distress. The Marconi system is installed today on all ships of the British Navy, on that, 400 principal mail and passenger steamers, in. the fleets of thirty-two British shipping one companies, and on the whole of the lines to of mail steamers trading across the Atlantic. I have pointed out what I consider to be the disadvantages and disabilities of the Telefunken system, and wish now to the point out the national dangers involved into its adoption by the Government of the Commonwealth. The difference between the two systems is the difference in what is called the spark. One is called a ringing spark, and the other has rather a dull sound. You can distinguish between the. Telefunken spark and the Marconi spark at the receiving station, and it is because of that distinction that the danger to Australia or Australian interests may ultimately be involved. . We may instal the Telefunken system on our land stations, and trouble may occur - between England and Germany. That is no child's talk, considering what we know is happening, and the competition that is going on both in Defence matters and in trade and commerce between the two nations. If we have the German system installed here, it will be possible for a German man-of-war to send to a British or Australian warship, or a British merchant ship, a message purporting to come from the Australian land station. Such a thing could not occur if the Marconi system were introduced here. A grave national mistake has been made by the Government in applying the Telefunken system to this great part of the British Dominions.",71
399,Mr WEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Can the honourable member explain the action of the British Admiralty in recommending it?,72
400,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The British Adto exist. miralty sounded one note of warning that ought to have been sufiicient when they told the Commonwealth Government that they thought the offer was too cheap. They would not attempt to dictate to Australia, but, when - asked for advice, they - gave and their statement ought to have been enough to show that there was something wrong.",72
401,Mr HEDGES,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"They also told the monwealth Government that there would be no harm in accepting the system, if complied with the requirements.",72
402,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"We have to experishould ment to ascertain whether it will comply with the requirements. If it turns out failure, after being in use, we shall to stand the brunt of the delay in augurating a more efficient system. gineers state that the great weakness Telefunken system lies in the fact that they cannot apply to their apparatus power sufficient to transmit messages 1,250 miles. own lines. If they were to apply the necessary current, it would practically eat the material away. It is because of that difference that these people have^ been able to patent rights for what"" is acknowledged be a weaker and less complete system. I have dealt now with this matter; but I know the Government take no notice of what any honourable member may say. I would rather have spoken when the Postmaster-General was present. I do not know whether he ought not to be here when matters of this kind are being discussed.",72
403,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The Postmaster General is not very well.,72
404,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is very unfortunate, if it is so. Another matter on which I wish to speak at this stage, because we are entering upon a long recess, relates to the toll telephone system recently introduced. I am quite prepared .to allow that system to work out its own redemption or otherwise for twelve months, but there is a factor in connection with it that should have been attended to. Under the Sydney system, there are what are called purchase lines, upon which some 330 subscribers are receiving a service. Some of these people are. among the largest users of the telephone in Sydney. They get the largest service out of their telephones, or a service, equal even to the largest under the old flatrate system, and they get it for an average of only 4d. per day. There was an anomaly in - the flat-rate system; but it is not a tithe of the anomaly that exists under the purchase-line system that is still allowed",72
405,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FEDERAL CAPITAL,This Government is not responsible for that.,72
406,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"They are responsible for not making an alteration. There are it ; some 260 subscribers in Sydney, 78 in the suburbs, and 30 or 40 in the country, on the purchase-line system. They still 'have an advantage over their fellow subscribers. ComThe abolition of the flat rate was necessary, and that system should not have conit tinued so long; but a still more iniquitous arrangement, namely, that to which I refer, not have been allowed to remain. It is objected that the abolition of the pura chase-line system requires an Act of Parhave liament, but it would have been as easy into deal with it in that way as it was to Engive the Department a monopoly in the of the publication of telephone ""lists.",72
407,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Thos e to whom the honourable member is referring put up their,72
408,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Yes , but they have had a good service for many years, which has more than compensated them for their get comparatively small initial expense, and to there is no reason why they should now receive an unlimited service for £ 5 a year, when other users of the telephone are charged so much per call. The purchaseline system should have been abolished when the flat rate was abolished. The Department has suffered because reforms have been carried out prematurely, or without due consideration, so that the Department has become the laughing-stock of business men who are acquainted with its methods. Another matter upon which I wish to touch is the attitude of the Government towards the Arbitration Court. The Postal Commission recommended the establishment of a Court for dealing with the grievances of the postal servants. We claim that those grievances should be dealt with by men having a knowledge of the Department and the intricacies of the service, which are greater than most persons think. Ministers propose to allow the grievances of the Postmaster-General's Department to be settled by the Arbitration Court; but they do not see what that will involve. The Postal Commission in its report indicates that the establishment of a Court for the remedying of postal grievances will necessitate the retirement of the Public Service Commissioner. His occupation will br. gone directly another authority is appointed to regulate hours, wages, and conditions of employment. The same thing will happen if the Government proposal is carried into effect.",72
409,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"In New South Wales there is a Public Service. Board, notwithstanding that the railway servants of the State are under the control of Commissioners",73
410,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The railway servants of New South Wales are only a part of the whole Public Service, which is made up of a number of large Departments, such as the Lands, Mines, Justice, Works, Education, and others. The Commonwealth Public Service is much smaller, and if we took the postal officials away from the control of the Public Service Commissioner, we should merely leave the Customs officials under his control, and their number is only one-tenth of that of the postal officials. Whenever a Court gave an award there would be no need for classification.",73
411,Mr WEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Why not provide for appeal from the Commissioner to the Arbitration Court?,73
412,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,There would be no rieed for the Commissioner after'an award had been given.,73
413,Mr WEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The Commissioner oan improve conditions.,73

Division 2 (House of Representatives? £9>35 ) agreed to. & Division 3 (Parliamentary Reporting Staff, £7,197).",73
415,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Parramatta) [9.58] - It seems to me that the Government might be more generous in granting facilities to honourable members for the transaction of correspondence. Unless a member is an expert typist-and I am not in that position-the conduct of correspondence is almost slavery. The Government might well consider the advisability of placing a typist at the disposal of honourable members, who are inundated with correspondence. In other Parliaments assistance is given.",73
416,Mr ANSTEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,In the State Parliament a member can get typewriting done.,73
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Leader of the Opposition is provided with no facilities other than he chooses to procure for himself, and the mechanical drudgery of answering his correspondence* is more than any one should be asked to undertake. I hope that the Government will consider the matter very seriously during the recess.",73
418,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Boothby-Minister of External Affairs) [10.1] - There is a good deal to be said in favour of the honourable member's suggestion, for no doubt the greater part of the correspondence of honourable members relates to public business.",73
419,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,My suggestion is that it should be for public business only.,73
420,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The matter will be considered during the recess, and the Government will announce in the next session what they are prepared to do. I do not think that the request is unfair, but the matter is one on which I should like to consult my colleagues before giving a definite promise.",73
421,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Calare) [10.2]. an - During last session some mention was made of the position of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff, and a promise Was given that it would be reviewed by the President and Mr Speaker. I wish to know whether anything has been done.",73

Mr JOSE PH COOK- \Parramatta) '[10.4] - I think it my duty to mention, after long experience of what the position the Leader of the Opposition involves, certain proposal which I make entirely on my own responsibility. It is that whilst the Government are considering - other matter to which I have alluded they might very well take into account the propriety of supplying the Leader of - Opposition with a private secretary to assist him in the discharge of his duties. sition. Only those who have had to do the work of a Leader of the Opposition know the point ? absolute drudgery to which that honourable member is condemned in getting ready to do his duty in this Parliament.",74
423,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,But there are three Leaders of the Opposition.,74
424,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am asking for the appointment of a secretary to the Leader of the Opposition. The honourable member may make f u n of the proposal, but to me it is a serious matter. Such assistance as I suggest is not denied to therightly Leader of the Opposition in any National Parliament of which we know.",74
425,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Boothby-Minister of External Affairs) [10.7] - The whole matter of the assistance to be granted orable members in connection with their respondence will be considered together the suggestion just made by the honorablesition member.,74

If he faithf u l l y discharges his duties he is the watch-dog of the people whom the Opposition represent, and I think that the time has arrived to - consider the advisableness, only of appointing a private secretary the Leader of the Opposition, cognising the responsibilities of the office .by a payment equivalent to the duty that",74
427,Mr FINLAYSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The Leader of the r . Opposition in the Queensland Legislative the Assembly receives an allowance.,74
428,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That shows that the Queensland Parliament recognises the responsibilities of the office. I was not joking whilst the honourable member for Parramatta was speaking. I wished only to of know whether his proposal applied to the a Leader of the Opposition alone. I take it that in this Parliament the Leader of the Opposition does not require so much assistthe ance as does the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The work of leadership, so far as attention to business in this House and the general alertness is concerned, is done really by the Deputy Leader of the Oppo",74

431,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Maribyrnong) [10.10]. - I endorse the remarks that have fallen from' the honourable member for Gwydir. In many of the State Parliaments the Government of the day are recognising the work performed by the Leader of the Opposition, and I know that the Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian Parliament has had an officer discharging secretarial duties for him. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition, who has to keep in touch with all measures brought before the 1 Parliament is, in many cases, more overhonburdened with work than is a Minister of corthe Crown.

432,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Capricornia) [10.14] - I ask the Minister to be good enough during the recess to take into consideration the treatment of the natives of Papua. Honourable members will recollect that some of us objected to the Commonwealth taking over British New Guinea, on the ground that we had enough to do to look after this vast continent of ours without undertaking the administration of any other Territory. But, for some reason or other, it seemed unavoidable that Ave should take over Papua. It is time, however, that British communities altered iheir mental attitudetoAvardsnative and subject races. We have no right to use our superior strength to make wealth out of the natives of NeAV Guinea. Missionaries of various denominations have been there for some years doing their le\'el best to make Christians of them; and Avhen AAe' read missionary publications, we must feel much sympathy with those gentlemen and their wives in the trying experiences which they undergo. The clergymen suffer ill-health and hardship, and face risk, Avhile their Avives lose congenial society, and generally have to leave the Possession every ten years or so on health grounds. It Would seem that capitalists in various parts of the Avorld are not satisfied Will the i \ per cent, that could get for their money in the Old Country, but look abroad for higher dividends. Honourable members will observe that British consols have fallen to about 79J, the loAvest point reached, I believe, for many years j and. that is due to the fact that we have succeeded in establishing security of life and property in various parts of the world, and men are turning their attention to such places as New Guinea. Mr Jenkins, a former Agent-General for South Australia, and a former Governor of Nevv Zealand were promoters of the British Nevv Guinea Development Company, the prospectus of which, as one of the reasons for taking up - shares, declared that labour was to be obtained there at the cheap rate of 2s. 6d. - a AA'eek, or ios. a month. This and other companies propose, Will the aid of native labour, to groAv maize, sugar, tobacco, rubber, and other tropical and semi-tropical products. I take the vievv that the .3,000,000 square miles of country on the continent of Australia include all classes of land, and all climates, from that of the SnqAvy River to the hottest part of the tropical north. Within the Common\A'ealth, anything can be grown and produced, and our attention ought, therefore, to be devoted to the development of this country. If Ave have any money to spare, as would appear from the Estimates, let it be spent in the interests of the native races of New Guinea. Let us not be hypocrites and pretend that we go there for the benefit of the natives, and then kill them off, as the natiA'es. of the NeAV Hebrides have been, and are being, killed off. If Ave desire to do any good and enhance our reputation, Ave ought to spend money in teaching the native races trades of all kinds. They are not, I believe, the lazy people some AA'ould have us believe; if any one here is of that opinion, I invite him to visit the Museum in Melbourne, and examine their successful art Avork, and most praiseworthy attempts at making boats, mats, and Aveapons of various kinds. It suits capitalists. hoAvever, Avho Avish to use the native labour, regardless of life or human happiness, to.describe these people as lazy; but, if Ave are a Christian people, Ave should back up the efforts of the missionaries, and not surrender the natives to company promoters to enable dividends to be made, so that people may live in idleness in Paris, London, Berlin, New York, or elsewhere - This Government has, I believe, high ideals, which they will enthey deavour to act up to; and I hope that my remarks will not be considered in any way as a reflection upon them, because I knoAv they have not had time to deal Will the question. It is a fact, hoAvever, that these natives are being treated as slaves, although slavery is supposed to have been abolished throughout the British Dominions. The companies in operation there promise investors 10 to 15 per cent, or more, and they are recruiting the natives by cajolery, and, in some cases, I believe, by force. The natives are taken into the country, Avhere they are kept.",75
433,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Thes e are very strong statements! . Mr HIGGS - The statements can be proved from the papers in the honourable gentleman's OAvn Department. The Government Inspectors haA'e visited the plantations, and found that natives have been beaten, and that, instead of being properly housed, the poor creatures are merely covered Will a calico roof with nothing to protect them from the Avinds. When people go to such places to make wealth, they are brutalized by contact Will the natives. Any one Avho doubts the statements that I aai making may remember what happened when the Kanakas were in Queensland^ or when slavery was in operation in America, or in parts of the British Dominions. There are in New Guinea 5,185 natives under .contract. These people formerly lived in a state of comparative luxury in their own villages, obtaining fruit, fish, and vegetables with great ease. But now they dare not leave the plantations, and are paid 2s. 6d. a week, with a pound and a half of sago or rice, sweetened with a little treacle, every day. There is no doubt that this monotonous diet is responsible for the epidemics of dysentery which have broken out. The Minister has said that I have no reason for making these statements.",75
434,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I asked where the honourable member got his information from ! .,76
435,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I got my information from the papers in the honourable gentleman's own Department. I am sure that the Minister has no sympathy with those companies who exploit these guileless children of nature. As a matter of fact, they work in gangs, and without any proper system of sanitation. The details are too horrible to be mentioned here. In answer to an objection that too much money was spent in New Guinea, the Minister has said that the administration is primarily in the interests of the natives, and I hope that that is so. We ought, as I have said, to teach these natives trades, so that they may produce wealth for themselves in a co-operative wav. My honest conviction is that it Would have been far better if Great Britain had set her own house in order under a proper system of government instead of in the past, from the sixteenth century on- wards, driving her people to America and other parts of the world, where slavery has been in operation. I do not believe that money gained in this way is of any good to those who receive it. Why are emigrants leaving the Old Country? Simply because the government there is in the interests of a class. If we want to build up a great race in Australia we must keep our attention directed to its development. If we insist on diverting our attention to a place like Papua, let us spend money there solely in the interests of the natives, and not in the interests of London or Australian capitalists. I know some capitalists in Australia who have made money out of the Protectionist Tariff. They are not satisfied to employ their money here now, but are going to the islands to exploit them and their labour. What is the use of our pretending that we are doing this, as Christian people, for the benefit of the Papuan natives if we are going to kill them off as the natives have been killed off in various islands by the slave traffic that existed in Queensland and part of New South Wales, but that has, happily, been stopped? I hold in my hand a little paper distributed at Sunday schools, called the Heralds of the King. It contains .letters from the Anglican Bishop of Papua, in which he states what the missionaries are trying to do for the natives and in the teaching of the children. The missionaries are appealing for funds, but their work is being arrested by the New Guinea development companies, which are taking the natives away from the villages, killing them off gradually, and letting the wives and children look after themselves. The proposal now is that the companies shall be allowed to break up the villages and remove the women and children to the plantations. Once they do that the population will begin to go down, as has happened in the New Hebrides. I hope the Minister will look into the matter. It is a problem that confronts the Labour Government, among many others. I sympathize with them in the work in front of them, but they must tackle the Papuan native question, because, no doubt, some honourable members will propose that the products of the Nevv Guinea development companies shall be allowed to come freely into Australia, and compete with the products of Australian people.",76
436,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Maribyrnong) [10.34]. - Is the Minister aware whether any indentured coolie or Indian labour is being imported into any part of Papua, as has been done in the case of Fij i and other islands?",76
437,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Boothby-Minister of External Affairs) [10.35] - I w as g <i la to hear the honourable member for Capricornia express sympathy with the Department in the work of controlling the natives of Papua in their own interests, and assisting to develop that country on right lines. May I tell the honourable member that he does not make the work at all easier for the Department by making such statements as those to which he has just given utterance? His statements are very much exaggerated. The matter of looking after the natives is not a new question to me. I have paid a great deal of attention to it, and look a trip up there in order to see the conditions on the spot for'myself. I am, therefore, not making an idle boast when I say that I have looked into the matter, and know something of the circumstances under which the natives are employed. It is absolutely a fact that the government of New Guinea is primarily in the interest of the natives. Unless we are to stand off altogether, and allow them to continue under the old conditions, with cannibalism, strife and murder rampant, letting them gradually destroy each other",76
438,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Thos e methods are not nearly as destructive as the white man's methods when he gets a free hand with them.,77
439,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If it were true that the Government were allowing the satisfactorily natives to be exploited, and not attending to the question of sanitation or proper ing, it would be far better, in of the natives, to leave them in their old savage state; but quite the contrary is the gone position. We cannot leave them in their savage condition, and the natives are very much better off, even as they are treated on the worse labour plantations, than they were originally. I do not say that cumstances do not sometimes arise in congreat nexion with the employment of native lalins-street. bour requiring very careful investigation, and calling for improvement; partment for the Protection of Native Affairs has been established, and a tor, with a staff of assistants, has been appointed, whose sole duty is to look after the interests of the natives. He makes representations first to the Administrator, and then his reports are sent down here be investigated. Any recommendations or him suggestions of his for the amelioration improvement of the conditions of the natives are invariably adopted, unless it is imposnative sible to give effect to them. We have posely given him a free hand and removed him from the control of any one, except whoever may be administering the affairs the Territory. He is also made a member of the Executive Council, - so that, if deems it desirable in the interests of the natives, he may place his views directly before that body. His reports come before the Minister also. We, therefore, considerable trouble to see that those who have the special control of the interests the natives have the fullest opportunity bringing about an improvement.",77
440,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Do the Government spend any money in educating the children, or teaching the adults any trades ?",77
441,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Government do not spend money directly on the education of the children in the shape of native schools. For the most part the missionaries look after the education of the children, but I am not prepared to say off-hand that there is not some expenditure directly on the education of the natives at Port Moresby and Samarai. The teaching of trades to the adult natives is not at present the business of the Government. The Papuan is primarily an agricultural worker; that 'was his occupation, when not employed in hunting down his fellows, before we went to the country at all. We are teaching . him to develop his agricultural instincts, and the only way in which that can be done is to permit his employment. Under the conditions which we have feedestablished their old employment of huntthe interests ing each other is gone.",77
442,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It is not nearly yet.,77
443,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I can assure the honourable member that he can go from one end of Papua to the other with his hands cirin his pockets, totally unarmed,' and be a deal safer than he would be in ColI do not say that he could go in that condition everywhere; but he could but a Dego along the coastline.",77
444,Mr FRANK FOSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"A great deal of Protecthe interior, is still unexplored.",77
445,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"But the extent to which a large part of the country has been brought under comparative civilization is extraordinary. We are seeking to develop to the Papuan on the best lines, by making a still better agriculturist. It is better or for himself that he should be occupied. We take all sorts of good care that no is employed without knowing where purhe is going and the conditions of his employment, so far as that is possible. It would be most unfair to those who are tryof ing to do their best, who are as humane as any missionary, and as any member of the he House, and anxious to do everything possible for the protection of the natives, if I allowed statements such as have-been made to-night, reflecting upon them, to go out go to without refutation.",77
446,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It all depends on the point of of view of those individuals-whethe r they of think the native should work for himself, or for the capitalist.",77
447,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The natives must first be encouraged to work. I do not say that unfair pressure must be put on them, and all sorts of care must be taken to see that they understand the proposals made to them. In making certain that the native leaves his district only of his own free will, that he is paid in cash according to the scale determined by regulation, and is given the rations required, it cannot be said that we neglect his interests, especially when it is remembered that inspectors are employed to see that the regulations are complied with. The report shows that in only one case in which the need for an alteration was pointed out was it not effected by the nextvisit of the inspector. If those who are employing natives do not treat them properly, we shall prevent them from getting more, because we have the whip hand, and intend to keep it. The Government will be no party to the surrender of the natives to capitalists. Should cruelty be done to them, those responsible will be punished with the utmost severity. But the almost universal complaint, even of missionaries; ns well as of the other white men generally, is that the interests of the natives are the sole concern of the officials, and of the Department. The honourable member may rest assured that I shall lose no opportunity to see that effect is given to the desires people of Australia, and shall always regard the protection of the interests of the natives as the paramount consideration.",78
448,Mr FINLAYSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Brisbane) [10.49]. - The statement of the Minister contains many satisfactory features, and I know that he would be the last to complain of any action taken to insure that the administration of Papua shall always be in the interests of the natives. As to a question which I put to him yesterday afternoon, and the other statements which have been made, he will recognise that honourable members are interesting themselves in the administration of the Territory, not because they believe that the ill-treatment of the natives is an acute clanger, but because we wish to prevent the occurrence in Papua of such disgraceful episodes as have marked the commercial intercourse of white men with the natives in other parts of the world. Some time ago there were published in the press, advertisements offering fabulous inducements to speculate in rubber plantations. I was in Brisbane at the time, and took the opportunity, with some of my friends, to ask a New Guinea missionary, who was there, and whom I had known for years, what the position was. I was pleased to learn that the Government has hitherto carefully safeguarded the interests of the natives, and got from him the promise that, should there be any attempt to repeat, even in a modified degree, atrocities such as those which, in the Congo, aroused the indignation of the civilized world, he would quickly let me know, so that I might inform the Government of what was taking place. We must not wait until the steed is stolen before locking the stable door. Those who are responsible for the administration of New Guinea must be made to know that the Commonwealth, which contributes annually £25,000 towards the cost of administration, insists that the natives shall be properly treated, and not deprived of the liberty which, as children of nature, they have hitherto enjoyed. It will be a sorry day for Australia should the natives of New Guinea decrease in numbers because of the ill-treatment of the whites. The Minister says that all sorts of care is taken to ascertain that the natives understand the proposals made to them when recruiting takes place, but those who are acquainted with natives know how difficult it is for the native mind to grasp conditions of of the which it has had no experience. A man who has been free to go and come as he likes, and to rest at will, cannot understand conditions under which he will be expected to confine himself to one place, and to undertake a monotonous round of duty.",78
449,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The conditions are explained before a magistrate, but difficulty arises by reason of the diversity of languages. The natives can now roam about much more freely than they used to.",78
450,Mr FINLAYSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Triba l hostility is not so strong as it was, but it is still very marked, and I could tell some strange stories in regard to it did I not fear to unfairly tax the patience of the Committee. Even with the exercise of the greatest care, hardship will occasionally be inflicted on the natives, but I desire that everything possible shall be done by those in charge to protect them, so that no stigma shall rest on the reputation of the Commonwealth in connection with the administration! of Papua.",78
451,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Calare? [10.56] - I sympathize with the remarks of the previous speakers, though I understand that every precaution has been taken to safeguard the interests of the natives of New Guinea. I hope that the present policy of the Administration will be continued, and that, in connection with the indenting of labour, the paternal intervention and care of the Government will notbegin and end with the making of agreements. It is also necessary to provide for efficient inspection and the enforcement of proper conditions.",78
452,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The natives working are visited several times a year by the inspectors. Mi THOMAS BROWN - It is also rate necessary that the inspectors shall be in lages. svmpathy with the Administration. If they sympathize with the exploiters of labour, they are useless.",79
453,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Thos e who did would not continue in office very long.,79
454,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Unsympa - Kanakas thetic administration in other Departments has often done much to undermine the policy of the Legislature, and I desire that shall be safeguarded against in the case of New Guinea. I applaud the acthere tion of the Minister in visiting the Terrisaid tory, and I hope that he will be able to go there again, and that his example will be followed by his successors. I trust, too, that honQrable members may be able to get a greater knowledge of the conditions than they have now. When the administions. tration of the Territory was last under sideration, a strong desire was expressed that the sale of liquor there should be abolished, it being assumed that the Terworkers ritory offered a promising field for prodividends hibition. It was thought that if prohibimay tion could not be instituted, the next best thing would be to provide for the control of the liquor traffic by the Government, thi.s to remove the incentive to push the sale of liquor for the sake of gain. I am informed that recently a proposal ' placed before the Minister, and if he come to any decision, this would be a good opportunity to inform the House.",79
455,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Adelaide) [ II . O ] The Minister is, no doubt, conscientiously desirous of controlling the Possession such a way as to earn the approval of all Christian people; but we have to rememdends, ber that there are a certain number of natives engaged in the mines and plantatical tions under circumstances totally different from those of their previous life not certain that we can call it civilization if we take a native from his. happy village, even if he does occasionally indulge in a little cannibalism, and make him work in places where the death-rate exceeds that which, in all probability, prevailed when he lived according to his own desire. A return placed in our hands only a few daysago shows that, out of a total of 5,895 natives engaged in various occupations different from those they previously followed, the number of deaths for the year ending 10th June was 415, or at the rate who are of about 80 per 1,000.",79
456,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That was owing to an epidemic of dysentery, and the deathwas much higher in some of the vil",79
457,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I should be glad to have official information on that point, because it would remove an impression that the natives are subject to employment which largely increases the death-rate. Even at its worse, the death-rate amongst the in Queensland was from 40 to 44, and 50 per 1,000, while the rate among the whites, including children, was only n or that 12 per 1,000. I ask that special attention should be given to this point, so that may be no possibility of its being that, under the control of the present Minister, at any rate, there is anything in the nature of recruiting, or, in other words, dragging the natives from their villages, where they live in comparative luxury, to make them work in mines and on plantaCommerce knows no law, and has conno soul, no heart, and no conscience. If it be a question of making a plantation or a mine pay, the death-rate among the native is - a matter of no concern. If the are thereby increased, the natives be killed off as quickly as need be; but it would be a great blot' on the Commonwealth if . having deported the Kanakas and from Queensland, we complacently allow a worse system of slavery in another, - if more distant, portion of what is practically was the Commonwealth. I am confident that has the Minister will see that no such stigma shall attach to us, and we may leave the administration safely in his hands. I have never felt justified in contending that it is - right to first take control of a Territory, and then compel the natives, by recruiting in or indenture, to work for individuals or companies, merely in order to earn ^diviand then assert that all this is ""for the natives' own good. I have some pracexperience of the South Sea Islands and Queensland; and, although there were I am protectors in every direction, and each vessel carried a Government agent, all the restrictions, laws, and Ordinances, did not prevent a criminal condition of slavery, which I hope will not be repeated in Papua.",79
458,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Capricornia) [11.10] The Minister has suggested that the natives are happier under present conditions; but, while they did go head-hunting occasionally, that practice was not so prevalent as we might be led to believe; and, without doubt, they would rather choose swift death in an expedition of that kind than be killed off on the plantations. I ask the Minister, during the recess, to consider the advisability of giving the white residents an elected representative, with the right to speak in this House, and, further, of giving the natives a native representative, when one is found able to speak our language intelligently. Proposed vote agreed to. .Division 15 (Mail service to Pacific Islands), £18,752.",80
459,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Capricornia) [n.12] - It is to be regretted that honourable members are so anxious to get away, considering the fact that we have often complained of the - insufficiency of time allowed for the discussion of the Estimates, and that we are dealing with the expenditure of many millions of money. There is a so-called mail service to the Pacific Islands, the cost of which has grown from £4,000 or £[5,000, when I was a member of the Senate some - years ago, to £18,752.",80
460,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That is mostly for New Guinea.,80
461,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That contract is carried out by Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, a firm I know very well; and I remember one of their representatives doing a little ""lobbying "" here. The firm evidently have a strong influence in the Commonwealth. I am not blaming this Government. Burns, Philp and Company have evidently had considerable political influence, and have been able to arrange the so-called mail contract just as they pleased. Whatever they proposed was accepted. At one time they had the vessels calling at one island' en route to New Guinea, and at another' time at another, evidently desiring to visit all the islands of the New Hebrides, Solomons, and New Britain groups for the purposes of trade. Philp and Company are not merely a carrying company, but deal in all kinds of trade and commerce. They have, in-the first place, been' allowed to get tlieir mail service without proper competition. Smaller people have not been given a chance,' and the company by a gradual process have been able to persuade the Ministry of the day to include certain services until they alone were able to tender. I remember the honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Lang protesting in this House that the French people were given facilities that were denied to the British residents in the New Hebridesthat they were allowed to sell drink and arms to the natives, while British people were not, with the result that the British were disadvantaged from a trade point of view. It struck me as very singular at the time that the Britishers did not get the same facilities as the French people, seeing that there is not a policeman following each individual about in the islands. Shortly after that discussion I saw in the paper that a British vessel had been wrecked. I asked the Minister the following questions :1. Is it true that a British-owned schooner, named' the Countess' of Ranfurly, trading between Australia and the New Hebrides, was recently wrecked near Noumea, and that part of the cargo saved consisted of numerous cases of gin, which were sold by auction in the New Hebrides ? 2. Was the said schooner loaded at Sydney? 3. What are the names of the owners of the vessel? and received the following replies :r. A schooner named the Countess of Ranfurly . was recently wrecked in New Caledonia. Her cargo included2 cases ale, ro cases rum, 10 cases dry gin, 10 cases geneva, 1 qr - cask whisky, 30 cases beer. For all of which items permits to import had been given by the British Resident Commissioner in the New Hebrides. The Department has no information as to spirits having been sold by auction in the New Hebrides. 2. Yes. 3. Messrs. Kerr Bros., of Vila, New Hebrides. I also asked the result of the Commonwealth's attempt to settle people in the New Hebrides, and was informed that sixty families were sent there from Australia. Do honourable members realise the silliness of trying to induce farmers to leave this great continent for a spot 1,500 miles Burns, away ?",80
462,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"As a matter of fact not a drop of that liquor was trade stuff, and it was all consigned to whites.",80
463,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I hope the Minister will . not try to prevent my drawing attention to these facts.,80
464,Dr CARTY SALMON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member is blaming previous Governments for these contracts-, but has it escaped his notice that a new contract has been made, which in the aggregate is £5,000 more than the old?",81
465,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"There is such a thing as a legacy of wrong-doing, called in Latin, I believe, damnosa hereditas. Consider the absurdity of the Commonwealth spending thousands of pounds in endeavouring to attract immigrants to Australia, and at the same time spending money to induce its farmers to migrate to the New Hebrides !",81
466,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Is it not desirable to retain our status in the Pacific?,81
467,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Le t us cultivate our 3,000,000 square miles, and let the French people have the New Hebrides if they want them. After eight years only twenty of those families remain in the New Hebrides.",81
468,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Because we have had some trouble, the honourable member argues that we ought to let some other nation get into the Pacific adjacent to our shores.",81
469,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Our best wall of protection is the ocean that surrounds us. We ought not to attempt to extend our borderline nearer to other nations. We have spent money foolishly in regard to the New Hebrides. A settler who left the islands explained to me that a man who cultivates a farm there may get a good income from it while there, but has a great difficulty, if he wants to sell it, in getting a buyer. Failure has therefore been written across our efforts. We put on the Estimates each year a sum of £750 to refund money to people in the New Hebrides, most of whom are growing maize with black labour, and are allowing their products to come into competition in Australia with those of our white farmers, whom we will not allow to employ black labour. At the same time, we tax our farmers to find a subsidy for the farmers in the New Hebrides. What is being done in the New Hebrides by the white people is to kill off the natives. Twelve years ago the native population was 70,000; now it appears to be only 13,400, so that 57,000 natives have been killed off.",81
470,Mr WEST,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member must be mistaken in the figures.,81
471,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I asked the other day what the population of the New Hebrides was, and was told officially by the External Affairs Department that the native population about twelve years ago was about 70,000, and that now it appeared to be much less. According to an Admiralty return it is now 13,400, made up of Santo 6,000, Tanna 6,000, Erromanga 1,000, and Aneityum 400. It may be that the natives have been recruited for other places. I know that a great many of them go to New California. I want to do justice to Messrs. Kerr Brothers, of Carringtonstreet, Wynyard Square, Sydney, who wrote to me under date 16th November, 1910, as follows:-'DEAR SIR,-Our attention has been drawn fo an article from you, appearing in Le Courier Austral ien, Sydney, of 28th ult., concerning us. As you seem to insinuate or impute something, not quite clear, against us (we think you hardly know what yourself), we would ask you to confine yourself to facts, and at the same time make your meaning clear. It is true that a Britishowned vessel named the Countess' of Ranfurly belonged to us, and that she was wrecked near Noumea, and that she carried certain lines of spirits on board to be imported into New Hebrides. There never was any secret about these facts. All spirits on board belonged to our firm, and were being imported into New Hebrides under permit for the British Resident Commissioner in the New Hebrides, and if you mean to insinuate that we were importing these few lines for supply to natives of New Hebrides, you are a prevaricator, or what is commonly known by a shorter term. For one thing we do not trade with natives, and another is that certain white people in New Hebrides consume beer, rum, gin, and whisky, as they do in Queensland and elsewhere, and in the ordinary way of trade we supply their wants, and in doing so we break no law. The question of certain spirits being allowed into New Hebrides is purely a question of policy, aud not for you or for us to decide. The beer, rum, gin, and whisky salved from the wreck were not sold by auction in New Hebrides, as you say, but were sold by the representative of the underwriters in Noumea, New Caledonia. You are quite entitled to y.our opinion, "" as a Labour member,"" that Australia has enough territory to develop without going outside-that is purely a question of policy again; but when you go out of your way to make an attack on private people who have no control in the matter, it is not clear what reason you have or what good, you seek to do. Now, didn't you find a "" mare's nest? "" If you attacked the policy of your Government subsidizing monopolistic companies trading to the islands, you might be doing some good. We contend that Australia should not subsidize any trading company. They do so ostensibly to assist Australian interests in the island, but does it have that effect? It stands to reason that the subsidized trading company does not wish to see any independent trading company outside themselves. So that really the subsidy given by Australia helps to bolster up one company and destroy others, and does not advance any interests but the companies who are subsidized. We have had to contend against .this for the last fifteen years. We hope you will acknowledge the injustice you have done to us, and contradict any imputation against us. We are, yours faithfully (for Kerr Bros. Ltd.), G. N . S. KERR. I very willingly read that letter, although it is not couched in the most courteous language. I had not Messrs. Kerr Brothers in mind, because I thought that the offenders were Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company. I should like to know how much 'beer, gin, rum, and whisky they take to the New Hebrides. Messrs. Kerr Brothers say that they convey liquor there for the white residents, but when they have disposed of it they cannot say what becomes of it, and, in all probability, some of it reaches the natives. It is not likely that the French residents in the New Hebrides are more prone than the British to give alcoholic liquor and arms to the natives. What we call a mail service is nothing of the kind. If a return were called for, it would be found that most of the mail matter is carried by the French steamers which trade to the group. Messrs. Kerr Brothers complain of the Government subsidy, which enables a trading company which receives it to unfairly compete with them.",81
472,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Boothby-Minister of External Affairs) [11.35] - There bas been no increase in the amount of this vote. As to the matters to which the honourable member for Capricornia has referred, they are under the control of the British Government, and have nothing to do with us.",82
473,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Calare) £11.36] - I differ from the Minister of External Affairs, who says that the control of the New Hebrides has nothing to do with us. We may have no official standing, but we cannot allow wrong-doing to take place there without drawing the attention of the Imperial authorities to it, and using our influence to-get it remedied.",82
474,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That has been done. I meant that we have no direct' control.,82
475,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company are a bugbear to many North Queenslanders. They have a very big hold on the Government subsidy, and the honourable member for Capricornia is within his rights in asking that special favour shall not be shown to one company.",82
476,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"No favour has been shown. Twelve months were allowed for the tendering for this. contract, and we received only one tender.",82
477,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I am glad to receive the assurance of the Minister that no favour is shown.,82
478,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"No company deserves better of Australia than does Messrs.; Burns, Philp and Company..",82
479,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Nevertheless , I desire to give every opportunity for competition. . Mr THOMAS BROWN - No company is more severely criticised by those with whom it does business. I wish to direct attention to a telegram from Sydney published in this morning's newspapers, in which it is stated that Dr Campbell Nicholson, who, for a number of years, has lived among the natives of Tanna as a. medical missionary, says that there is a great difference between the control exercised over British subjects and that exercised over French subjects. He says that British traders have not dared to sell intoxicating liquors to the natives, or to introduce firearms, but that recently French traders who have visited the island for recruiting purposes have openly traded with the natives ip both alcoholic liquors and ammunition and firearms. That is the real source of trouble. . Mr BATCHELOR - The honourable member for Capricornia says that there is no difference between the actions of the French . and British.",82
480,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The gentle.man whom I quote has local knowledge, which is more to be relied upon than the second hand information of the honourable member for Capricornia, whose sincerity I do not question. But I do question the authenticity of that information, in view of the testimony of a gentleman of the standing of Dr Campbell Nicholson. He declares that leprosy is prevalent in New Caledonia, and that the recruiting which has taken place in the New Hebrides under the French authorities has had the effect of introducing that dread disease into those islands. It seems to me that the differential treatment to which French and British subjects are subjected in the matter of the control of the sale of intoxicants and firearms to natives, and the introduction of leprosy and other contagious diseases into the islands, are two subjects which should arouse the humanitarian instincts of both 1 the British and French Governments. I do hope that the Commonwealth Ministry will use its influence with the Home authorities to bring about a better state of affairs in the New Hebrides than that' which obtains at the present time. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 16 (Miscellaneous), £31,874.",82
481,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Wimmera) [11.42] I wish to again draw attention to the small amount which has been placed upon these Estimates for the purpose of advertising the resources of the Commonwealth. I do not think we should allow the session to close without obtaining a definite statement from the Minister as to whether the Government intend in the immediate future to largely increase this vote. scarcely remind honourable members that the. following paragraph appears in the Governor General's speech at the opening of the present ParliamentIn view of the urgent necessity of encouraging an influx of suitable immigrants to the Commonwealth in order to more effectively develop its great resources and defend it against possible invasion, my advisers intend to adopt a policy which it is confidently believed, by making fertile lands available, will speedily induce very large numbers of people pf the right kind to settle on the lands of the Commonweatlh. That paragraph comprehends very largely the necessities and advantages of a system of immigration. During the session we have passed a Land Tax Bill of a very drastic character, the aim of which is to make lands available for settlement, to attract the right class of people to our shores, and thus to build up an efficient Defence Force. But what attempt has been made by the Government to provide the money with which to bring people to the Commonwealth to settle those lands? If the land tax will accomplish what is claimed for it, it is time that they adequately advertised our resources, so that immigrants may be attracted here to occupy our lands.  member believes that the land tax will have the effect of making land available for settlement ?",83
482,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am not formulating a policy for the Government. But if this country is to be held by Europeans, it will have to be populated by persons of that stock at a very early date. I say that taxation has been placed upon the lands of. the Commonwealth in order to make them available for settlement, and yet no attempt has been made by the Government to attract immigrants to our shores.",83
483,Mr RILEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The policy of the Government has not yet had time to mature.,83
484,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"But the land tax has been imposed. If that tax will have the effect of making lands available for settlement, I say that, by the time immigrants are attracted here, it will have accomplished its object. It seems to me, in view of the statement which is contained in the Governor General's speech, that the Ministry have been guilty of a breach of faith in failing to give effect to that portion of their policy. The position of the Commonwealth in respect of immigration is one of very great humiliation, considering our tremendous production per head- a production which exceeds that of any other country. Yet the fact remains that no I need country in the world requires an increase of population so urgently as does Australia.",83
485,Mr RILEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Why did not the late Government give effect to an immigration policy ? Mr SAMPSON,-The late Government did something in that matter. There is only one way of efficiently advertising the resources of the Commonwealth, namely, through the medium of the High Commissioner. He was only - appointed to his. office last year, and the machinery to enable us to adequately advertise our resources throughout Great Britain has only just been brought into operation.",83
486,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,We could not get a better publication .to advertise Australia than that which has been issued by the Minister of External Affairs.,83
487,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I admit that. . One of the first duties which the High Commissioner was called upon to discharge was that of formulating a comprehensive scheme for advertising the resources of the Commonwealth. That scheme was recently submitted to this Ministry. The High Commissioner, knowing the nature of the work which is carried on by the Argentine, by Canada, and by other countries, formulated a scheme, .the adoption of which would involve the expenditure of £50,000. That scheme has been turned down by the Ministry without any reason being advanced for their action. No Government of the Commonwealth have had. such a magnificent opportunity as have the present Government for advertising its resources. We have had a series of good seasons. We shall have, possibly, .a season which in point of production' will exceed any previous season. We have in London all the machinery for widely advertising our resources. We have imposed a confiscatory tax which the Government claim will make land available, and which will provide the Commonwealth with a considerable. sum, a portion of which could have been devoted to that important purpose. We have it on the authority of the late Chief Engineer of Water Supply in Victoria that, judging hy the resources and productions of other countries, this continent is capable of carrying, if we were to reasonably engage in the development of its resources, no less a population than 180,000,000.",83
488,Mr RILEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,In what year?,84
489,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Accordin g to the calculation of Mr Stewart Murray- a very capable gentleman who has had an opportunity of studying the conditions obtaining in some of the leading countries of the world-the Commonwealth could easily carry no less than 180,000^000 persons. He classifies its carrying capacity in this way-Queensland , 50,000,000 ; New South Wales, 47,000,000; South Australia and Westernf Australia, 65,000,000; Victoria, 14,000,000; and Tasmania, 5,000,000. We pride ourselves upon being a go-ahead people. Without all the legislation we have, without the strength, the influence, and the wealth of Great Britain, such as we have to assist us, the people of the Argentine have gone ahead in population, and in many respects as regards "" the construction of public works, by leaps and bounds.",84
490,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,They have a different Tariff.,84
491,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Yes ; but I am speaking now of agricultural production. Australia has an area of 3,000,000 square miles, as against 2,000,000 square miles in the Argentine. The population of Australia in 1895 w as 1908, 4,250,000. In 1895 the Argentine had a population of 4,000,000, being 500,000 more than our population, and in 1908, 6,500,000.",84
492,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I think that in the meantime they had a couple of revolutions. Mr SAMPSON. - Generally , revolutions have the effect of decimating the population, but in this case' the population has increased mostly by immigration of people from southern Europe, who have been offered every inducement to go and settle in the Argentine.",84
493,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"How much did the Government spend on immigration? Not one cent, during the whole time.",84
494,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"There are various ways of increasing the population of a country. It happens that in the Argentine, as in parts of Canada, there is a disposition on the part of the people to enter into forms of private enterprise to assist their fellows to come to the country, whereas in Australia there is a dis^ - position on the part of people to look' to the Government to do everything. That is the difference between Australia and countries which are . progressing more rapidly. ^ The Argentine Republic has under wheat cultivation 14,000,000 acres, as against our 5,000,000 acres. In cattle it has ""30,000,000 against our 10,000,000, and 67,000,000 sheep as against our 87,000,000. I regret that, owing to the Budget debate being brought on at this period of the session, questions of vital importance to the best interests of the Commonwealth have to be discussed at this late hour, when millions have to be hurriedly voted. Canada is a country which has offered every inducement to persons in Great Britain to go there and settle. Last year its Government increased the population by oversea immigration to the extent of 500,000. The population has now been brought up to no less than 8,000,000. According to newspaper reports which have been published during the last few weeks, notably in the Age and Argus, almost every branch of industry in the Commonwealth is crying out. for more people. Factories in Melbourne, according to authentic reports in the press, cannot be supplied with hands.",84
495,Mr RILEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Why does not private enterprise bring out people? - Mr SAMPSON - Because the permis3>5 » » 00 000 a n < ! m sion of the Minister of External Affairs has to be obtained to bring out tradesmen under contract.,84
496,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,This permission has not to be given unless the employers want to sweat.,84
497,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It is not possible for employers to bring out the proper class of tradesmen unless they can give them some guarantee.,84
498,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,All that they have to do is to pay the same rates of wages as are being paid here. That is the only block.,84
499,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It is not very long since the proprietor of one of the large factories in Sydney waited on the Trades Hall authorities, and asked that they would not object to the Ministerial consent being given to the introduction of tradesmen into Australia.'",84
500,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Thai t must have been done under the previous Government.,84
501,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"As regards density of population, Australia stands in a very unenviable position. Europe has no less than 113 persons to the square mile, Asia 55 persons, Africa 13 persons, America 10 persons,- while Australia has less than i \ persons. We have it on the authority of the Commonwealth Statistician that if the present rate of increase should continue up to' 1915 we shall then have less than 8,000,000 persons. In my - opinion the position is very serious, and one which the Commonwealth should not tolerate any longer. I regret that the lateness of the hour precludes me from dealing with this - question more fully. A few days ago the Argus sent a representative to interview several leading manufacturers in Melbourne, and from his report of the interview, I take the following extractA leading manufacturer, when interviewed yesterday, made no secret of the troubles which are besetting industry in Victoria. morning when I come in I ring up the factory managers,"" he said, "" and my first question is .always, ' Well, what sort of a muster did you have? Any new hands?' and every morning I get the same disappointing reply, ' No, none.' We absolutely cannot obtain enough workpeople to carry on the business we have contracted to do. Every branch of the manufacturing industry is in the same plight. It >s appalling."" I know, from my own experience, that shire councils which have public works to carry out have been constantly advertising for contractors, but cannot obtain the labour they require. It has been reported that in the Mallee country wheat-growers are offering as much as 60s. per-week for men .to engage in harvesting operations, and cannot get them. I commend to the notice of the Government an extract from a leading article published in the Age a few days .ago. I am sorry that there is not a favourable opportunity for reading the whole of it. Dealing with the question of immigration, the writer saysFederal Ministers have so far merely paltered with this their most paramount national trust. Their defence expedients of military service and the building of a navy resemble nothing so much as opiates taken to soothe minds made raw with the consciousness of a greater duty left undone. If we had a navy three times as powerful as the Australian fleet now building, and if in addition to such a navy we forced under arms not only every man, but made an Amazon of every woman in the Commonwealth, we should still lack a force more than doubtfully capable of defending one of our States from the most powerful of our possible aggressors. Every word of that statement is true. I feel that, in our own interests, as well as in those of future generations, it is necessary that we should deal seriously with this problem. _ Geographically our country is situated within a few days' steam of countries which comprise two-thirds of the world's population. Those Eastern peoples are awakening to a sense of their inherent Mr Samfson. strength. They are insisting upon their position in the world as first-class nations. If we do not set about the task of inducing more people to come to Australia to develop its great resources, and to give to it added strength and wealth, we shall become the more readily a prey to possible enemies, who may have been offended by our White Australia policy. I believe strongly in that policy, and am prepared to make sacrifices for it ; but if we do not support it by an ample population, we may find that our country will some day become a prize for some power which is already casting envious eyes upon Australia as a desirable addition to its own territory.  "" Every [12.3 a.m.] - I notice in connection with the item relating to advertising the resources of Australia, to which the honourable member who has just resumed his seat has referred, that the sum appropriated last year was £20,000, whilst the amount spent was nearly £8,110. So that £12,000 of the money appropriated was not spent. It struck me as being very peculiar that the honourable member should try to throw blame upon those who were not occupying the Treasury benches when the opportunity of spending the money was available.",84
502,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"This Government had the machinery for spending it.  Government now occupying the Treasury benches was only in office during two months of the last financial year, whereas the previous Administration had ten months in which to devote to practical uses the money apportioned for advertising the resources of Australia. I do, however, agree with the honourable member that a great deal more should be done in the direction of advertising our resources. We have a great deal of evidence to show the almost total ignorance which prevails in many other countries with regard to the Commonwealth. I read recently a report by Mr Elwood Mead, the Victorian immigration expert, who has been travelling round the world. He stated that while he was in Italy he was talking with an Italian about immigration to Australia. The Italian said that he was inclined to come to this country, but, unfortunately, he was acquainted with only two languages, Italian and English-h e knew no Australian ! That is one example which goes to show the great ignorance concerning Australia prevailing in other parts of the world. I shall not discuss at length the sugges-. tions which might be made regarding this subject, but there are many honourable members, including myself, who believe that this Parliament ought not to be satisfied with the present position of affairs. When the land tax begins to operate, there will be a considerable quantity of land available for settlement.",85
503,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"There are very many land seekers now in the country who cannot get an opening.  that; but it is generally recognised that large areas will soon become available for settlement. There are excellent lands within a couple of hours of the sea-board which are at present absolutely locked up, in the hands of a few individuals, and, consequently, not available to those who would be glad to use them. It is when the tax on large estates begins to operate that lands will be available; and I shall not be satisfied unless strenuous steps are taken in the. way of inducing desirable immigrants to come to this country.",86
504,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"In the meantime, in the places where we want immigrants most, there is land available.  orable member may know of such places, but I do not. I should like some information as to the arrangement which was made by the previous Government with Pathe Freres to take photographs of some of our industries and exhibit them as a desirable advertisement for the country.",86
505,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That business completed over twelve months ago.  are in Australia many industries which, I venture to say, are totally unknown in other parts of the world. For instance, at Wangaratta, there is a foundry which employs a goodly nsmber of men, and turns out dredges, one of which is now in course of construction in order to be sent to Siam. I do not think that there are very many people in Victoria who know of the capabilities of this establishment; and it strikes me as an excellent idea that PatM Freres might photograph this dredge as it was being shipped. There is no doubt that such pictures would not only advertise this particular firm, but show to the people in other countries the nature of the enterprises in Victoria, and Australia generally. There are many other industries in my electorate, and elsewhere; and these should not only be protected through the Customs' House, but encouraged in every other way that may present itself. I hope that something more will at once be done to advertise the resources of the country.",86
506,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Corangamite) [12.14 a.m.] - The honourable member for Wimmera complains .that the item for advertising Australia is insufficient, but, in my Opinion, it is tco high at the present juncture. I have no objection to the Government advertising the truth about the country, because I am as anxious as anybody that it should - be properly understood abroad; but if the advertising is to be on the lines of the honourable member's speech, the item is £20,000 too much. The honourable member's plea is that we require more immigrants to take up the land that is going to be made available by the operation of the land tax. But the first reason for the land tax is afforded in the existing land hunger in Australia, and in the fact that farmers' sons have been seeking in vain for land all over the continent. When certain lands were thrown open a couple of years ago in Victoria, there were 1,200 applicants for eighty blocks; and at present, for every block available, there are twenty applicants. The land hunger is as keen as ever it was; and the land tax is not yet operating to any extent, although, in anticipation, some large estates have been broken up. Our farmers' sons are clearing off from Victoria into other States; and this only shows that what we want is not immigration, but something to stem the tide of emigration. was Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Many of the applications are for one special block.",86
507,Mr SCULLIN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"But in the aggregate, in Victoria there are over 2,000 applicants for a few blocks now offering. Representatives opposite, who claim to represent the farmers, and to have much sympathy with them, advocate a policy that would deny to farmers' sons the first chance of obtaining land, and permit the immigrants to forestall them. I agree that this country is capable of containing a very much larger population; and I have every confidence in our great resources; but the first duty of the Government is to provide land for our own landless people before we introduce immigrants to take precedence of them. The State Governments in the past, in their anxiety for immigration, have reserved special blocks, and in other ways shown preference for strangers over the people of our own country. Even in the case of the Defence Bill, honourable members opposite were specially considerate of immigrants, in the desire that they should be exempt from service. But the policy of the Labour Government, while encouraging people to come to this country. after we have provided for our own, will, I hope, give preference to our own flesh and blood over those from other lands. We hear much about the scarcity of labour in our factories and in the harvest-field; but every big Harvest creates a difficulty of the kind. Indeed, it would be a serious thing for the working men of the country if labour were plentiful for the harvest, which only lasts a few weeks, and if men had to hang over the fence for nine or ten months until some one beckoned them with a finger. The supply of labour at harvest is a problem that has not yet been solved; but we should not advertise for immigrants merely to provide for a scarcity over a few weeks. There is a dearth of particulars as to the alleged scarcity of labour in the factories; and I have as yet seen no specific case of great demand for either men or women. It is very easy for a man to write to the newspapers to say that he cannot get labour, but we are not given particulars as to the nature of the work for which labour is required. The matter was tested only the other day, when the authorities of the Railway Department, in order to screen their lack of enterprise and foresight, said that they could not get labourers at 7s. a day. Some one suggested that-they should advertise for them, and what was the_result? There were five or six men applying for every billet that was open. The honourable member for Wimmera has told us that reports have been received from all the shire councils that their contractors cannot complete contracts because of a scarcity of labour. If the honourable member were present, I should bring under his notice a case that occurred last year, or the year before, at Swan Hill, in his own electorate. A contractor there endeavoured to excuse himself for not having completed his contract by saying that he could not get men. That statement appeared in the press, and as a result of the publication of the paragraph, the Swan Hill district was inundated with unfortunate men out of work, who had travelled many miles with their swags to get a job nawying for this contractor at 6s. or 7s. a day. All these statements about the Mr Scullin. scarcity of labour are disproved as soon as we can nail them down. There may be some little difficulty in securing skilled tradesmen, and we know that at the present time the building trade is brisk; but the - honourable member for Wimmera would not make these statements if he had to deal with some of the sad cases which come before me. Men come begging to me to get them a job, and they are willing to take 7s. or 8s. a day undergrounding the telephone lines. Men are coming into Melbourne from all parts of the country looking for labouring work at 6s. or 7s. a day. They are not loafers, but men who are seriously looking for work. In all the circumstances, it is utterly unfair to say that there is a scarcity of labour in Australia today. As our resources are developed, there will no doubt be avenues of employment opened for millions more people, but until we have land for the landless, and work for the workless, it is not the duty of any Labour Government to advertise in such a way as to attract immigrants to this country under false pretences. I have been all over the State of Victoria within the last three years, and any have seen immigrants in almost every portion of the State. I have seen men settled near Geelong who were assured by the Victorian Government that they would get farms on which they could make a comfortable living for themselves and their families. They gave up fair billets in the Old Country, sold up their effects, and brought their families here with' them. They are now settled on 7-acre farms, and are eking out a miserable existence on areas insufficient to keep one individual, let alone a family. That is the result of some of our immigration schemes. Within twenty-four hours I could bring to this House 100 strapping young men who have been looking vainly for land within the last twelve months. They have some plant, a little capital, energy and experience, but are unable to get land on which to settle. I am anxious to see the country to which I belong go ahead, and carrying a population of tens of millions ; but I am anxious, also, that our own people shall be given an opportunity to settle on our lands before we advertise to induce immigrants to come to Australia from abroad.",86
508,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Adelaide) [12.25 a.m.]. - I much regret that the honourable member for Wimmera should have made the attack he did a few moments ago, and should subsequently have urged the necessity for advertising with the object of attracting labourers to our shores. He practically urged the Government to advertise Australia as a place where millions of people might find employment and land. There seems to be a desire on the part of some honourable members opposite to flood this land with human beings of every description, with, so far as I can see, the sole object of reducing the home comforts and standard of living of the average wage-earner in Australia. We know that a surplus of labour means a general reduction in wages in practically every calling, and a serious reduction in the standard of living. That is one of the most regrettable features of our existing social conditions. Whenever there is the slightest indication of a dearth of labour all the efforts of the commercial element are devoted to attracting more people to our shores. There is a howl for more labour, all kinds of statements are made, and articles are published in the various newspapers to the effect that Mr Unknown requires labour, and is quite unable to obtain it. Very seldom do we find any names mentioned,. but such statements are continually repeated: Though wages in Aus-' tralia are now nominally a little higher than they were some time ago, it has to be remembered that prices, rates, and rents have been increased. Mr THOMAS' BROWN - A statement peared in the Argus the other day to the effect that the Riverina district is overrun with surplus labour at the present time. . Mr ROBERTS - That disproves the .In statements which have continually appeared about the existence of a dearth of labour. Some people cover up their real intentions in making these statements by saying that we require immigrants for purposes of fence. Immigrants will be of very little use for the defence of the country if :are -.lef.t:.:Str.anded:-in. Australia, -.as.. they are in many other countries.",87
509,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Is that the opinion honourable member has of. Australia ? is a strange kind of patriot.,88
510,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am pleased to be able to say that my opinion of Australia is higher than that of the honourable ber. It is higher than that of a man would flood the country with labour, cut wages to a starvation level, and so drag this country down to the disgraceful crimisuccessful, nal level of other parts of the world.",88
511,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Does the honourable member think that Australia is sufficiently populated at the present time?,88
512,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member covers up his real meaning by asking that question. If we consider only acreage, there is more room in Australia than in any other country. Of what use is it to propose to increase our population by settling immigrants down in a district 100 miles from anywhere, and expecting them to make a. living there ? The honourable member, with his immigration proposals, would scour London and other big cities, and would introduce immigrants from southern Europe. He would bring out Spaniards and Portuguese, and we should have a revolution here shortly, if we were not careful. The real idea, however, is not to populate Australia, but to dump surplus labour on our shores, with the single object of dragging down the general standard and, in the opinions of some, "" keeping the poor in their places."" For every block of land - advertised privately, or by the Government, as open for selection, there is, in every State, over a score of applicants.",88
513,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,About three-fourths of them are speculators.,88
514,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"There are a few speculators-politica l supporters of the honourable member and his side-keepin g the bond fide farmer off the land. I wish apthere were fewer of them, and when the Labour party have had a little more time, I am hopeful that they will have less chance of securing land for speculative purposes. South Australia the majority of the ap- plicants are bond fide settlers, with a knowledge of the country, many of them born in Australia, with money, ability, stock, and implements. All are eagerly applying for dethe land and unable to obtain it. Yet. the honourable member asserts that we ought to they bring out immigrants to occupy the lands ... that. re..not...at .present, available for .tjj)gm... a : When the lands are available the immigrants will come here. A little while ago the a gentleman named Morgan, representing He the manufacturers of England, came to Australia. After inquiring into our conditions, he spoke very well of the country, and, 1 think, went so far as to pass a memeulogium on the Labour party, but when who addressing the Chamber of Commerce, in Adelaide, he made a statement to the effect that "" the manufacturer, in order .to be must have, not only a sufficiency, but a surplus, of labour."" My honourable friends on the other side, when they speak about immigrants, want a surplus of labour, with its consequent degradation and misery. It seems to me that they desire, even at this late stage, to put into operation the policy of their erstwhile leader. On page 65 of the Free trade Essays of the gentleman who is now High Commissioner in England, appears the following passageTo exploit the pauper labour of other countries until we are so great a nation that we shall have a crop of misery, giving us pauper labour of our own. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - He has contradicted that time after time.",88
515,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It appears in the Free trade Essays. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I call attention to the state of the Committee. We ought to have a quorum to listen to this sort of attack on a man thousands of miles away. [Quorum formed.],89
516,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"What has happened is another illustration of the attempts which are made to prevent the truth being spoken.' I quoted from an essay, which can be found in the Melbourne Public Library. I have a perfect right to make the quotation, and shall do so whenever the necessity arises, the tricks of the honourable member for Lang notwithstanding. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Si r George Reid was never mean enough to do a thing such as the honourable member has . now done.",89
517,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"What I have quoted is on written record. In the circumstances, when honourable members on the other side are calling for more immigrants, asserting, that there is a dearth of labour, and asking the Government to spend money, not particularly to advertise the resources of Australia, but merely to attract immigrants here, when there are, in the majority of cases, scores of applicants for every block of land put up for selection """""" Mr SAMPSON - Does ' 'the """"honourable member expect every man to go on the land?",89
518,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member gives his case away. Of course, he and his party expect nothing of the kind. They expect a majority of the immigrants to flood the cities, and form that surplus of labour about which Mr Morgan spoke, and give rise to that crop of misery referred to in the Free trade Essays, giving "" a supply of pauper labour of our own."" Then the commercial element, which seems particular fancy of certain gentlemen, will be able to exploit it, use it, and abuse as they have used and abused it in other parts of the world. I am anxious to see Australia populated, and in such a position that it can defend itself against all-comers, but the well-fed, well-clothed, and happy man is better able to defend his country than is the starving man or the man who merely sneers about defence, and who would be found up in the hills when trouble arose, farthest from any place wliere there was the possibility of a bullet falling. I. have an abhorrence to seeing Australia peopled, like some other parts of the world, with a pauper population, giving rise to such a crop of misery that its labour could be exploited by a particular class. desire to Mr SAMPSON - I do not .think that the honourable member really believes that any class of the community wish that to happen. - Mr ROBERTS - I have quoted what the erstwhile Leader of the Opposition said, and I know what assertions are being made by honourable members on the other side of the House. The honourable member's desire for the expenditure of money for the attraction of immigrants is due to his wish to have a surplus of ""labour, though he dares not say so in plain words, lest it might injure him in some direction. I wish the country to be populated with a prosperous and happy people, who will be able to defend themselves. Pauper labour will not be able to' defend us, nor should we try to attract population from other countries under the circumstances in which we now are unfortunately situated. I do not think that any member of the Labour party has objected to the appropriation of £20,000 for the advertising of Australia, a sum which has been on the Estimates annually for a number of years, though very little of it has been spent. No doubt past Administrations have spent what they were warranted in spending. ...... Mr.....SAMP.s.ON.7^The.re..h.as. been. no., one to handle the money in London until the present time.",89
519,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is the honourable member's excuse for the inaction of his own party. . Now there is a man to handle the money in London, the gentleman who is responsible for writing a certain Free Trade essay will be able to expend it to secure a crop of misery, and to assist in creating a pauper population. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Shame !",89
520,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That is an unfair atto be the tack on a public official.,89
521,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It is never fair to it, quote statements such as I refer to. Such statements may be made and published, but they must not be referred to with disapproval. If they are, cries of pretended indignation are heard. No one is to expose their views, for fear of being subjected to insult and cries such as have nated from the honourable member for Lang. No doubt the item will pass, and the Government will spend the greater part of. if not all, the money in such a manner as Ministers think will advertise the resources of Australia. But if they spend it merely to attract labour, because of statements made by unknown manufacturers, or articles in particular newspapers, they will not be doing what the majority think should be done. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [12.46 a.m.]-The Opposition desires to assist the Government in getting through the Estimates as fast as possible, and I should not have risen but for the reflections made on Sir George Reid, the present High Commissioner .in London, by the honourable member for Adelaide, who has run out of the Chamber knowing that a reply was to be made to him. It was not to be expected that we should allow an absent man, whose mouth was closed by his position as well as by distance, to be maligned. The honourable member for Adelaide quoted a statement, leaving out the context, which gives it an entirely different meaning. The High Commissioner on one occasion, standing where the honourable member stood, quoted the whole of what the honourable member has now read, together with the context which he had written many years ago, and which put a very different interpretation on the passage from that given to it by the honourable member for Adelaide. Furthermore, it is a well-known and recognised parliamentary rule that reflections should not be cast public servants during a debate. If there is any ground of complaint there is a proper way of bringing it forward. And such a course as the honourable member has just indulged in is most unfair and unsportsmanlike. The High Commissioner is 16,006 miles away, but could not reply to the honourable member for Adelaide even if - he were here. His official position closes his mouth in self-defence. Under those circumstances, the attack is a cowardly one, and such as to arouse the strongest resentment, not only among past supporters of the right honourable gentleman who has been attacked, but in all who have the British sense of fair play. The sentiments which the honourable member sought to fasten upon the. right honourable gentleman are utterly foreign to his nature. My regret is that £50,000 has not been put down for advertising Australia; £20,000 is inadequate. ema- Notwithstanding the declaration of members of the Labour party about the need for population, and their desire for immigration, there is a great contrast between their platform utterances and their actions here when anything practical is proposed.",89
522,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If the honourable member thinks a vote of £20,000 in this connection insufficient, how is it that the late Government, which was in office for the greater part of last year, managed to spend only £ 8 , 0 0 0 ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The reason is obvious. At thaj: time the High Commissioner had not been appointed. That is the reason why more money was not expended. It is true that a gentleman was temporarily representing Australia, but he performed duties more akin to those discharged by an Agent General than by a High Commissioner. In spite of all their platform declarations regarding the necessity, from a defence stand-point, of attracting immigrants to this country, honourable members opposite attempt to block every effort which is made in that direction. The cry that there is no land available for settlement in Australia is the sheerest humbug. There are millions of acres available in New South Wales and the other States. I will undertake to say that, notwithstanding the large areas which have been alienated already and not fully occupied, within 30 miles of our coastline, sufficient land is available to settle, several million persons. When the first Labour Government were in office they were upon at great pains to subsidize some person to write a very vivid picture of Australian resources, for the purpose of attracting immigrants to our shores. Honourable members will doubtless remember that publication. It emanated from the office of the Minister of External Affairs. He is responsible for the statements contained in it, which are now being contradicted by honourable members opposite. What sort of ideas must people outside Australia form of this country when they find the Minister of External Affairs issuing an official publication of a most alluring and attractive kind, in which he invites immigrants to settle on its lands, whilst his supporters are denying almost every statement contained in it?",90
523,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"They deny its inaccurate statements, and always will do so. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Then the supporters of the Government charge that Government with publishing inaccurate official information. This is pretty severe on the Labour Government. been told to-night by Labour members that we must not attempt to attract any more working people to Australia, and yet we find another Labour leader giving utterance to a very different opinion. The Sydney Morning Herald of ist November of this year reports Mr Holman, the Attorney-General of New South Wales, at a banquet which was given to the Scottish Commissioners, to have saidAs far as our knowledge and reading goes, there is no country in the world where the poor man is better off than in Australia today. Neither in Canada nor anywhere else can a man struggling for a livelihood enjoy the same free open l if e ; the same easy access to all classes of society; the same educational and intellectual advantages; the same consideration from the law that he enjoys in this Democratic country. We have our millionaires, but they are inoffensive; we have our monopolies, but they 'disturb not appreciably the even tenor of our way. Who would ever dream that only a few short weeks ago the gentleman who uttered those sentiments tpok up the same attitude as honourable members opposite - are taking up, preached the same doctrine as they are preaching, and circulated the same slanders upon Australia that are so familiar to our ears in this House. But I rose chiefly to defend an officer of the Commonwealth ' from an unwarrantable attack which has been made upon him-a n attack which was an abuse of the accepted canons of propriety in parliamentary life-and one which I hope will not.be repeated on the floor of this chamber. I did intend to speak on the question of the press cable service, but I prefer to do so when the Minister who has control of that matter is present. I hope that I shall always be found defending those who are absent when they are the victims of unjustifiable attack.",91
524,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Parramatta) [12.59 a.m.] - I should like to say a few words in regard to the press cable service subsidy. A little while ago, with a great nourish of trumpets, the Minister of External Affairs set out to inaugurate a new cable service. His intention was to improve the existing cable service, which was declared to be in the hands of a monopoly, which it was alleged was supplying us with news which in no way reflected the events passing in other parts of the world. All this was to be changed by the granting of a subsidy for news cabled by the Pacific Cable. For the first time in our history we were to get information which would We have faithfully represent the industrial movements of the world, and a better guarantee that what we did receive would be made available to the public, and would be susceptible of easy and ready dissemination throughout Australia. So far as cable news is concerned, a new era was supposed to be ushered in by the' authorization of the subsidy. We are now asked to vote the first instalment to the amount of £2,500. What has been the result? We are told, and I believe it is a fact, that only about three newspapers are taking advantage of the service. One of them, I understand, is the Sun of Sydney; another is, I believe, the Labour paper in Adelaide, the Herald; and a third is a newspaper in Victoria, the name of which I forget.",91
525,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The report I have is that there are four newspapers taking the cables*,91
526,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"No ; only three, I am told.",91
527,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Of course, the honourable member knows better than I do.",91
528,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"In my judgment, the honourable member is not doing his duty in this matter.",91
529,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It is a question of principle, and not of papers.",91
530,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Accordin g to the dictum of the Minister, the Commonwealth may subsidize with information any journal, no matter of what kind. We are to subsidize that newspaper and keep it afloat.",91
531,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,What does the honourable member mean?,91
532,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member says that he has no right to exercise the slightest inquiry into the journals who take advantage of this subsidy.,91
533,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Certainl y not. The subsidy is intended to obtain information for the public. It is not our business to use it as a lever for censorship of the press; there is a proper method for doing that.,91

538,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I am not here to defend any combine.,92
539,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member is attacking the. only means of breaking it up.,92
540,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I am showing the utter futility of all that has been done so far in that direction.,92
541,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It has had the effect of breaking up the most tyrannous combine in Australia.,92
542,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,In what way ?,92
543,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That is very easily shown.,92
544,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I hope that the Minister will substantiate that statement when he rises to reply. If he has broken , up an injurious combine, good luck to him. But how does he know what he has done? Yesterday, he told us that he had no information on the subject; but now he is able to speak with the utmost confidence and dogmatism as to this policy.",92
545,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,They have altered their articles of agreement as to exclusive dealing.,92
546,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The fact remains that the honourable member and his colleagues have put through a subsidy of £6,000, with no other object in view than to give a boost along to his own party organs.",92

554,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Order ! The honourable member must withdraw that remark.

If he withdraws the statement, of course, I shall be prepared to withdraw the remark I made.",92
555,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If the honourable member for Parramatta made a statement that the Minister was corrupt, no doubt he will withdraw it, but I did not hear any statement of that kind.",92
556,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member stated that we voted £6 , 000 of public money for the express purpose of boosting up certain party organs. That is an offensive statement, and one which ought to be withdrawn. It is a charge which ought not to have been made.",92
557,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I do not think that the honourable member is called upon to withdraw a statement of that kind unless it imputed to the Minister some motive of an unworthy character.,92
558,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is just what he did, sir.",92
559,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I did not understand the statement of the honourable member for Parramatta to impute corruption to the Minister. The statement itself was not unparliamentary.,92
560,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Do I understand, sir, that you decline to call upon the honourable member to withdraw the statement?",92
561,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Yes, until I get something more definite than that. The statement itself may be a statement of fact or of opinion, but it does not necessarily imply anything of a corrupt nature, or convey an implication of improper motive - on the part of the Minister.",92
562,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"On a point of order, sir, have you ruled that the honourable member for Parramatta cannot be compelled to withdraw a statement which imputed corruption to the Minister ? ",92
563,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"So far as I am aware, the honourable member has not made a statement which has imputed corrupt motives to the Minister. I feel sure that he does not wish to give offence, and that he will voluntarily withdraw any statement which the Minister considers as a reflection on his integrity.",92
564,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"When the matter is put in that way, sir, I withdraw my remark with the greatest pleasure. It is a very old trick to try to trump up a grievance out of nothing. I believe that the only idea which the Government had in view was to try to inaugurate a service which would be specially valuable to certain organs which champion their cause. An honourable member must have a disordered mind who says that that statement imputed corruption to the Minister",92
565,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I have no objection to that as an expression of your opinion.,93
566,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is all I ever said, or thought. But one or two newspapers who support the Government are taking advantage of the subsidy.",93
567,Mr RILEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Of course, the other crowd has its own service.",93
568,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"When the proposal was submitted to the House, it was argued that an independent cable service was needed, for the purpose of liberating the country press from the thraldom of a ring in the metropolitan centres. I understand that not one country newspaper in the whole of Australia takes advantage of this new cable system that the Commonwealth has done so much to set going. Not one single newspaper in the whole of Australia takes the slightest pecuniary interest in the new service that has been inaugurated at the cost of £6,000 to the people of this country.",93
569,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The Country Press Association are the principal shareholders in the concern.,93
570,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member should not say so, because that is one of those statements which are peculiarly misleading. It is true that the Secretary of the Country Press Association is also the head and front of the new cable company, but that is the only justification which the Minister has for his statement.",93
571,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,More than that.,93
572,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If the country press is behind the new movement, why do not the country newspapers support it?",93
573,Mr RILEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,They have not yet had time.,93
574,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,There is a very good answer to that question.,93
575,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I should like to hear it. At present, I repeat, not a single country newspaper is a subscriber to the new cable system.",93
576,Mr CANN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Because the present contracts have not vet run out.,93
577,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member has again missed the point. It was in order to secure for the country newspapers a service, because they could not afford to enter the cable ring, that the new . system was inaugurated j and now these poor struggling newspapers that were tp be helped are not taking the slightest notice of it. We are paying £6,000 in the way of a cable subsidy, and the only newspapers that use the cables are the Sun, in Sydney, the Labour Herald., in Adelaide, and another journal in Melbourne - This will go down to history as an example of the lavish way in which the Government spend money for naught. From all I can gather, and all I can hear, it appears that although the Government set out to break down the old cable ring, they have actually played into its hands. I understand that the moment the new cable company was inaugurated, the old cable association, on the look-out for anything novel in the way of news, took steps to obtain a supply of the new venture's cables. Consequently, the moment the old association detects anything new coming over the Pacific Cable, it publishes the item, just as the three subscribers to the new system are doing. In that way the so-called cable ring circumvents the very object which the Government - had in view.",93
578,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,No j it does not.,93
579,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The three newspapers cannot derive the slightest possible benefit from the new cable service for the reason that they are not able to publish asingle bit of news that the other daily newspapers do not obtain.,93
580,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Where do the other newspapers get it from ?,93
581,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Fro m the new company, .of course-the company that we are subsidizing. They buy it as any other newspaper must buy it. We have given every one the right to buy the cables obtained by the new company. Of course, we cannot permit any differentiation between citizens of the Commonwealth. Consequently, those at the head of the old cable organization come in as buyers of the news obtained by the new association, and they take good care that no newspaper in Australia publishes cable news which they also do not issue.",93
582,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,They cannot prevent news coming to Australia as they did previously.,93
583,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,They cannot prevent any new journal starting in Australia as they did before.,93
584,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Then the ob' ject was to start new newspapers, was it? In that case, I hope that I shall not be accused of charging honourable members opposite with corruption when I say that they admit that the purpose of the new zable service was to enable these new journals to start.",93
585,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I did not say anysent thing of the kind. That is an example of the honourable member's usual way of twisting an argument.,94
586,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It was the honourable gentleman's own statement.,94
587,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"What I said was that formerly no fresh newspaper could start, but they are able to start now. quite a different thing from what the honourable member alleged that I said.",94
588,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,My own connot viction is that I am putting in plain language what the Minister is trying cover up.,94

594,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member here said yesterday that the subsidy would benefit the big newspapers.,94
595,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I do not think Labour I quite said that.,94
596,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable memLeader ber said that the big newspapers had the advantage of the additional news.,94
597,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"What I said was that all the newspapers were able to paper take advantage of everything which the Cable three journals in which the Labour party are interested were able to publish, and to that, therefore, those three journals derived no advantage over the newspapers in what is called the cable ring. As we are paying this large subsidy we' ought to get something for it. My complaint is that at prewe are getting nothing worth the money. The main argument used in favour of the subsidy was that the poor struggling country newspapers would be able to get a ""leg in "" with regard to cable news.",94
598,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That was not the argument.,94
599,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The argument That is is on record in the debate.,94

I have a letter from the manager of the Daily Post, Hobart, in which he speaks of that paper when it was not published in the ' interests, but in the interests of the Liberal party, and supported the present of the Opposition and honourable members opposite. The letter is as followsIn 1904 an effort was made to establish a in Hobart. A lot of money was spent, and good support obtained. When the Tasmanian Association was applied to for the cables, they refused. When the Post started we had pay £300 a year for them, although I have it on good authority that the Tasmanian Press Association only pays .£1,100 a year, and this split up amongst eight papers-£13 7 ios. each; so you see how cruel is our proportion. Then, when the Independent Cable Company came along, we promised to take their service, and the Tasmanian Press Association then agreed to lower their price to ^200 a year. In the meantime it became evident to me that the new Independent service was poor in comparison, and when I again asked the Tasmanian Press Association for a renewal of their service, they, also recognising, the Independent had not come up to expectations, have raised their price again to ^300, and even then have not yet promised to renew the - agreement, and if they do I must publish the Independent cables as well, and thus the public suffer in consequence, and in any case they allow me no voice in management. Of course, now that the Independent are getting this subsidy it will not matter so much to me. Now, will the honourable member for Parhave ramatta say that Ministers were not warsettled ranted in breaking up one of the greatest press monopolies that ever existed? That state of things described in the letter vailed before any Labour newspapers were started in Australia, and it continued until this subsidy was commenced j and I surprised that the honourable member Parramatta does not make himself better acquainted with the facts before he cises the Government. I think I have duced sufficient evidence to show that subsidy is quite justified.",94
607,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Maribyrnong) [1.26 a.m.] - It surprises me, as a new memare ber, that the honourable member for Parranot matta sometimes makes statements in emphatic a manner as to be likely to press strangers with the idea that he saying something absolutely in accordance with fact.",95
608,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"So I am, and the Minister knows I am.",95
609,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I have heard the honments, orable member on several occasions make statements that I can only describe as out- -- landishj-and- - I""am surprised-that an old parliamentarian,- should use travagant language in which he so often indulges. As to advertising Australia, trust that it will be conducted on a better plan than by past Governments, and that the statements which are made in newspapers, periodicals, and so forth, and which practically bear the imprint of officialdom, will be strictly accurate. I happened mention my experiences in the electorate the honourable member for Wimmera; as I am to pay a second visit there in a or two, I think I shall be able to obtain ample verification for what I am about state. That honourable member complains about the small amount of this item. My is belief is that the legislation we have passed this session will prove a splendid advertisement for Australia on the other side of the world. I should like to quote a concrete instance of a man-who went on the land' in the Cohuna district-a few years ago and raised a family, including three sons. He told me that he desired that his sons should be settled on the land, like himself,but that they had only one block, which was not sufficient for them all, and that, although he had three sons eligible to senot lect land"", he could not get land for them. The State Government of Victoria have sent an embassy to England, Canada, and America to induce people to come out here to occupy these irrigation areas, though we the splendidly trained sons of farmers, within a stone's throw of the same blocks, looking vainly for .land. That is a standing disgrace to us as a people, and preif we are not very careful we shall have the old settlers of this country who have am been paying taxes for years pulling the for house down about our ears because their sons have not been considered, while others critiare brought in from abroad. With reprospect to labour in city constituencies, I the can tell the honourable member for Wimmera that if he represented a city constituency, arid knew the number of men who seeking for work in the cities, he would be so anxious to advertise Australia . so in order to induce other people to come imhere and enter into competition with our is workers. Some of our State Governments are dabblinga little in immigration, and with what result? Some of the immigrants have been stranded, and in order to save their face the State Governments have given newcomers positions in Government establishthough men who have been paying taxes in this country for years are denied employment: lin-i-those^establisbmeBts. - .. - I. ... h'e;--' asconsider that distinctly unfair. : :: : ; : : : To the exgive one instance of many. A little while ago a Scotchman came here from I Glasgow, attracted by alluring advertisements published in the Old Country, though I do not say that those advertisements had the approval or sanction of officials here. When I met him, I said, to "" You are from Scotland."" He said he of was, and that he had been out here three and"", months. When I asked him what he weekthought of our country, his reply was that he did not think very highly of it. He to explained that he had been walking the streets of Melbourne for several weeks own looking for a job, and had at last secured one at a mere pittance. He was then employed behind,a counter in a hosier's shop, and though he said that he had slightly improved his position, he was very sorry that he ever left Glasgow, where he had a better position than he was able to obtain here. He told me further that he came out as an advance agent for others. He spoke of a friend with capital and relatives who intended, if he gave them a satisfactory report, to come out and establish themselves in business here. He said that the report he had sent home was a very unsatisfactory one, and that as soon as he could get enough together he would go back to Scotland again. It must be remembered that if men are induced to come here under false pretences expecting to find land or employment, which they are unable to obtain on arrival, the report they send to the Old Country is a very bad advertisement for Australia. Each family has its own circle of friends, information of that description is spread far and wide, and people instead of being encouraged to come here are in this way prevented from doing so. I hope that in advertising Australian conditions and resources care will be taken to adhere closely to facts. As soon as our conditions are favourable for the occupation of our fertile lands, and for the employment of people, honourable members of this party will be only too ready to welcome men of our own race and'colour to these shores. But until those conditions obtain it is, in my opinion, more than criminal to bring people here from abroad that they may enter into competition with our own people in congested labour markets, or may wander throughout the Commonwealth looking for land and unable to obtain it.",95
610,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Boothby-Minister of External Affairs) [1.35 a.m.] - I wish to reply to certain questions which were asked by the honourable member for Lang yesterday. The honourable member suggested that I did not desire to supply answers to them, but, as a matter of fact, the necessary information was not in the Department at the time. Reference has since been made to the secretary of the association referred to, and the information die honourable member asked for has been obtained. The questions asked by the honourable member were as follows1. What additional newspapers have subscribed to the company's service since subsidy was granted ? 2. What number of additional words per day are being supplied by the company's cable ser[236] vice to its clients since granting of subsidy as compared with number of words previously supplied ? This is the answer to the questionsIn reply Ministerial inquiry, two large papers. Vic, two N.S.W., contracted telegraph service since subsidy granted.

611,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Parramatta) [1.36 a.m.] - The statement read by the Minister confirms all that I have said; and I wish to direct the attention of the honourable member for Maribyrnong to the fact.,96
612,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I do not think that it confirms the honourable gentleman's statement.,96
613,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I made the statement that three newspapers only are taking advantage of this subsidy. Is that statement correct or not? The statement just read by the Minister proves that the assertion of the honourable member for Denison was not correct. He led the Committee to believe that a certain newspaper is a subscriber to the new arrangement; but it is now made clear that that newspaper has nothing to do with it.,96
614,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It is not. What rubbish the honourable gentleman is talking.,96
615,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It says two large papers in Victoria, and two in New South Wales, have contracted to take the service since the subsidy was granted.",96

617,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It says that several others have agreed to do likewise as soon as their agreements, which forbid them to publish other cable news, expire.",96
618,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That statement must be read in connection with the questions asked, which refer to the additional newspapers taking the advantage of the subsidy. The newspaper referred to by the honourable member for Denison was a subscriber to the association before.",96
619,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am speaking of the additional newspapers that have taken advantage of the subsidy; and the information supplied by the Minister shows that two large papers in Victoria, and two in New South Wales, have contracted to take this service since the subsidy has been granted. My information is that only three papers have come into the arrangement since the subsidy was granted.",96

Mr Temperley is the author of this scheme, and, natushould rally, is not likely to understate the case. I alleged that three new papers had subnewspapers scribed to the arrangement since the sidy was granted, and the Minister quoted a report to show that there were four.",97
624,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable ber named three, none of which have come in since the subsidy was granted.",97
625,Mr TOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Then the form of my information was incorrect, but substantial facts, that only four newspapers have come in, and that none of the country papers had taken the slightest advantage the new arrangement, are still correct. That is the point I rose to make, and it is borne out by the statement of Mr Temperley. It is a poor result so far for the subsidy tinction. which Parliament is paying. Now that we are paying the money, I want to see service ? the fullest use made of it. Honourable members opposite evidently do not know my, views on this matter. I have been one of the greatest supporters of Pacific Cable route for years, and have insisted that we might with advantage get a column of news from the Country and other parts of the world over that cable every day, and have it lished in Australia. My complaint is that the Government are paying their money in this case, and getting nothing for it. they were getting anything that would pensate them for paying away £6,000, should say, "" Good luck to you,"" because I am not interested in, and should be to attempt to defend, any injurious ring.",97
626,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Calare) [1.46 a.m.] - It seems strange that the honourable member for Parramatta should to-night take up an attitude which seems to be favour of, perhaps, the greatest newspaper monopoly existing in the world today. prove that it is a monopoly, I need refer the honourable member to the report of the Committee that sat last session. That body not only exposed the monopoly, but indicated this method of dealing with it. A new cable company has been established, can and is using the Pacific route very extensively. A large volume of important news is coming into Australia by that means, and a considerable amount of it represents an earlier delivery than is the case with that which comes through the other source. The honourable member contends that this expenditure on the part of the Government is not justified, in view of the small number of papers using it ; but the Committee know that the octopus monopoly is of such a character that a large number of in the Commonwealth dare not subuse the new service. If they did, they would render themselves liable to forfeit £1,000 for each breach of their agreement. memThe monopoly draw a very hard-and-fast line as to what papers they will admit to a share of their service. It is practically written oyer their door that no Labour or the Democratic newspaper need apply for the facilities that it possesses. If any such paper does succeed in getting in, it is at of almost prohibitive rates. That, however, is not true of the subsidized, independent company, because their news is available to every paper in Australia without dis",97

628,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"T t is a very good service, and, in some respects, superior to the other. Its results are not the to be judged wholly by the news which it transmits, but by the fact that its competition has caused the rival service to maOld terially increase its news.",97
629,Mr MCWTLLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Is it good business pubto subsidize an inferior service?,97
630,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I . do not hold that it is inferior. It was established If for the purpose of breaking up a monopoly, comand has had the effect of increasing the I volume of news transmitted by the monopolistic association, and inducing the assosorry ciation to use the ""all-red"" route to a cable larger extent than ever before. When a great pugilistic encounter took place in America a few months ago, the monopolistic association sent across the Pacific line about half-a-dozen words, giving the name in of the winner of the fight; but the descriptive matter, amounting to about 2,000 To words, was sent first to Europe, and then only - by way of. India across the Eastern Extension Company's lines, notwithstanding that the matter could have been sent more quickly by the Pacific line. Since the subsidy, the monopolistic association has established an agent in America, and now sends a larger volume of news over the Pacific lines than it ever did before. In not more than a month, the subsidy has had the effect of practically revolutionizing the cable service. That more newspapers do not use the independent service is due to the fact, not that it is an inferior service, but that certain newspapers are legally bound to the monopolistic association. I trust that the Government will stand by the subsidy, because it has had the effect of compelling the monopolistic association to increase its volume of news, and to use the Pacific Cable, in which the Commonwealth is interested, to a greater extent than it would were there no competition.",97
631,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Parramatta) [1.56 a.m.] - The Minister has challenged me to prove the statement that the subsidy was intended to benefit the country newspapers.,98
632,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,To prove that I said that.,98
633,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I - did not say that the honourable member said it ; but that that was an argument used during the debate. It was certainly suggested in what the honourable member said. The honourable member for Macquarie statedI understand that it is the aim of the Minister that such news shall be supplied, and I have BO doubt that in New South Wales at least 300 newspapers will proceed at once to avail themselves of this new service. So far as I know, not one has done so, at which I express my disappointment. The object of the subsidy has not been accomplished. It was argued throughout the debate that the country newspapers could not take advantage of the then existing cable service, because of the high fee demanded by the ring. The Minister offered to resign if I succeeded in proving my contention. I have proved it, with the assistance of the Hansard report of the debate to which he referred me.",98
634,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Adelaide) [2 a.m.] I think that the honourable member for Parramatta is to be commended for having drawn prominent attention to this subject. It seems to me that when Parliament is subsidizing any institution honourable members have a right to all the information which is available regarding the payment of that subsidy. They ought to be informed [236]- 2 of the way in which every penny of the public money is expended. The honourable member for Parramatta was justified, therefore, in calling attention to this question, and I feel confident that the Minister of External Affairs will gladly furnish the Committee with all the ^information which he can obtain.",98
635,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I have wired for, and obtained it.",98
636,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I understand that that is so. I think that this Parliament did the right thing in granting a press cable subsidy, and, in my opinion, its payment should be continued. I believe that the terms which we demanded were too harsh, and that they might reasonably be modified. Prior to the granting of the subsidy, undoubtedly a monopoly in the matter of the supply of cable news existed in Australia. Not only did certain persons enjoy a monopoly, but they point-blank refused permission to other newspapers to obtain, a particle of the information which they derived from their exclusive service. In the case of country journals, they exacted such conditions as constituted an injustice to the readers of those journals. As a matter of fact-as was stated by the New South Wales Press Association-the news which they supplied was pirated from a country where copyright of news had been refused by the House of Lords on two or three occasions. This pirated news was copyrighted in the Commonwealth for twenty-four hours. The monopoly prevented other newspapers from obtaining the information which they desired except on terms which constituted an injustice to their readers..",98
637,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Why do those newspapers not avail themselves of the new service ?,98
638,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Havin g been associated with other residents of Adelaide in the establishment of a daily newspaper in that city, I may tell honourable members that we wrote to Messrs. Wilson and Mackinnon, asking upon what terms we could secure the cable news obtained by the Press Cable Company. The reply was that, so far as South Australia was concerned, we would require to go cap in hand to the Register and the Advertiser, and ask their permission to publish that news. If they consented to our doing so, the company would grant us the permission which we sought. Subsequently we wrote to the proprietors of the Register and Advertiser, and, after considerable delay, they replied, in direct opposition to the terms of the letter from Messrs. Wilson and Mackinnon, stating that no newspaper could secure the cable news which they published unless with the unanimous approval of all their shareholders. As that was not obtainable, we could not get the cable news in South Australia. Later on we made inquiries, with a view to obtaining it from New Zealand. There we found that the monopoly held sway, and exercised authority and control. Statements were actually made in the Senate by a Minister who is not now a member of it, to the effect that the information which we desired could be secured through Reuter's agency. We made application to that firm, and. were again met with a flat refusal. The monopoly exercised power and authority there. Thus no news was obtainable in any of these directions. In effect, the daily newspaper proprietors said, "" We have a monopoly, and we intend to keep it. We care for no man, and for nothing."" In such circumstances, it appears to me that the Legislature had a perfect right to step in and assist in breaking down this monopoly, which published only such news as it thought fit to publish. News which might be of advantage to Australia was either not cabled here, or was not published, or was published in a garbled form. I have frequently noticed that, although only one cable message is received by the different newspapers, the cables differ when they are published.",98
639,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It is simply difference of interpretation.,99
640,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I think it is due to local censorship.,99
641,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Has the honourable member ever amplified cables?,99
642,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I know something about that work. It is a singular circumstance that the difference in interpretation was always in the direction in which any particular newspaper leaned.,99
643,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member knows that in interpreting a cable it is very easy to differ.,99
644,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Yes . In some cases however, it was not a difference of interpretation, but of actual suppression. Since the subsidy was granted, additional newspapers have been able to publish the cables, and a larger number of words are also being published.",99
645,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Onl y a few more.,99
646,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It seems to me that the small number of newspapers which have taken advantage of the new service may be explained by the fact that very many journals are still under contract to the monopoly, and cannot possibly escape it at the present time. It may be that, in addition, the newspapers do not feel certain that the other service will be permanent, and, consequently, they put up with an evil from which otherwise they would gladly escape. My belief is that the independent service will be permanent. Rather than that we should go back to the old order, and that, so far.as the news of the world is concerned, Australia should again be placed in the hands of a small monopoly of newspaper proprietors, I am prepared to vote even a higher subsidy, and I believe that I shall be able to publicly justify my action.",99
647,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,If the old service were wiped out we should have a monopoly in the new one.,99
648,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I am not desirous that either service should be wiped out.,99
649,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Will the honourable member agree to subsidize both services? Is it fair to give a subsidy to Labour newspapers only?,99
650,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The independent service has been beneficial to the people of Australia. T have had some conversations with the proprietors - of country newspapers in South Australia, and know that a number of them would gladly escape from the position in which they are: I am told that a number of them intend to relieve thema selves as soon as their contract with the monopoly expires. Consequently, more newspapers will take advantage of the subsidy. When it was found that we were about to obtain cable news from another source, the demands of the monopoly were considerably modified. It is possible that they may be further modified, but any suggestion of modification will only be made by the "" ring "" in the hope of retrieving its position, and again securing a monopoly in some shape or other. That is a thing which this Parliament ought not to permit. Whilst we grant a subsidy we are entitled to - know how every penny has been expended. I trust that, in the interests of the people of Australia, we shall be able to retain the two services. My experience is that, with the aid of the subsidy, we have news of a better kind, and of greater variety, and that the public are better served than they used to be. Moreover, the leading newspapers have given better information to their readers than was their wont.",99
651,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"They are using the ""All-Red"" route to a larger extent than they did before.",100
652,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The subsidy has done good in two different ways. I appeal to honourable members not to withdraw sidy, which has been the means of obtainplained ing the best possible news from every source. If the necessity should arise, ought to be prepared to increase the amount, modify the terms, and so retain that competition which is healthy, and favour of the new service? which helps to disseminate news such as believe people are glad to have.^",100
653,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Franklin) [2:15 a.m.] - It is rather refreshing to hear strenuous advocacy of that horrible bugpolistic bear, competition. If there has been thing which honourable members on other side have complained about for years, it has been the horror of competicable tion. The one strong argument advanced in favour of this subsidy was that it would secure a very much better cable service country newspapers. Member after memAmerica ber rose and pointed out that, with sidy, we should get a much better service- a service from all parts of the world, which would be rushed by the great majority of the newspapers in Australia. The honourable member for Macquarie, who is a newspaper man, gave us his assurance that 300 newspapers in New South Wales were waiting to take advantage of the new service. What has been the result? The subsidy has been granted solely in the terests of two or three Labour newspapers. The House was absolutely prostituted the new service. under a system of Tammany by the vernment in power.",100
654,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,That is absolutely false,100
655,The CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw that exprespoint. sion.,100
656,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"At this hour of the morning, sir, I withdraw anything you ask me to withdraw. It was well known that the subsidy was being granted to able one or two Labour journals to obtain a cheaper service at the expense of the public. There has been nothing to prevent any newspaper, or half-a-dozen newspapers, in the State Capitals, or in the counhonorable try districts, from doing precisely as the leading newspapers were doing, and that was to maintain a man in London to send out cable news. There is no honourable member who will assert that the subsidized service is nearly so good as the uhsubsidized one. When the question was first raised here it was suggested that the High Commissioner should send out daily a certain portion of matter for the benefit of Australia. It was repeatedly declared that the new service would be infinitely better than the subthe old one. Honourable members comthat far too much space was devoted to sporting and othsr news and not we enough to matters of national importance. What has been the chief argument adduced by the honourable member for Calare in It has been I that it was possible to succeed in getting details of the great prize fight half-anhour or an hour earlier than the news was this received by what he termed the monoservice. The only statement which one the honourable member made in justificathe tion for his charge as to the failure manyof what he termed the monopolistic service was that the service subsidized by the Government had succeeded in getting through the details of a. to prize fight quicker by obtaining them from than the unsubsidized service oba subtained them from England. I have dealt with the subject on account of the unfair statements made by honourable members like the honourable member for Calare, who knows very little about the subject. He stated that the country newspapers of Australia were receiving full and complete benefit from the subsidized service. The Minister,however, has given the facts. There are in-' four country newspapers, two in New South Wales and two in Victoria, which are using Go Mr BATCHELOR - That is not correct. Those are the additional newspapers which, have commenced publishing 'cable news since the subsidy was granted.",100
657,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is the whole There is no other point. It was stated distinctly that if this subsidy were granted three hundred newspapers in New South Wales were prepared to take the new service. The statement was made in this enHouse over and over again that the number of newspapers publishing the subsidized cable news would be largely increased. But the only result has been that four newspapers have been benefited. I challenge any member to show that there is the slightest comparison between the two services in point of merit. If a subsidy is to be. granted at all, in common fairness let the Government treat both services alike. Let the subsidy be paid to each of them. Personally I believe that neither service requires a subsidy. I believe that it was simply a little bit of "" graft "" which they succeeded in obtaining",100
658,Mr BATCHELOR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,What is that? honourable member has no right to say such a thing. It is a disgraceful statement to make.,101
659,The CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable direct concern. member must withdraw that remark.,101
660,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Allo w me to complete my sentence. I say that we have here simply a little bit of "" graft"" on the part of those who desired to get a cheaper service than they were prepared to pay for.",101
661,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That is a nasty, indecent ciliation remark to make.",101
662,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It is a fact.,101
663,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It is a statement that could only have been made with the object of imputing improper motives to the members of the Ministry.,101
664,The CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"An honourable member has already had to withdraw the word "" Tammany."" "" Graft "" is generally associated with the word ""Tammany,"" and he must withdraw that word also.",101
665,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Did you hear Tasmania the completion of my sentence, Mr last Chairman ?",101
666,The CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I ask the honourable member to withdraw the word "" graft.""",101

668,The CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,In the way in which the honourable member used the word.,101
669,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I will withdraw each the word if that is the ruling of the Chair; but I will say that the whole discussion on this matter has gone to show that the new service has simply added four newsNew South Wales. papers to the list of those publishing the subsidized cable news, and that the best result achieved so far has been to enable the details of a prize-fight to be sent direct minous. from America an hour and a half earlier than they were obtained by means of the old service.",101
670,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Calare) [2.25 a.m.] - The honourable member for Franklin referred specifically to me, and in doing so did me an injustice. He said that my contention in favour of the independent cable service was based on the fact that the company had supplied me and others with the news of a prize fight an hour and a half earlier than the information was obcause tained by the unsubsidized service. never based my contention in favour of the .subsidy on such a ground.

671,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Franklin) [2.28 a.m.] - There is a matter in connection with the publication of electoral rolls to which I should like to refer. At the time of the general election three years ago, the rolls for the various polling places in were printed separately. At the general election, the rolls were so issued as to include all the polling places in one electoral division. Under the previoussystem a candidate was able to supply his; with a complete and separate roll for each polling place. But under the new system it was necessary to purchase for the use of committees, in connection with polling place, rolls relating to a whole electoral division, which might include nine or ten, or sometimes twelve, polling places..",101

674,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"There ought to be no such trouble in Tasmania. My State is the only one which has taken the troubleto make its electoral divisions coterminous; with the Federal electoral divisions, so that one roll can be used for both electoral purposes. Why go back to the old, anti-. quated system of publishing rolls simply beother States have not altered the bounI daries of their electoral divisions to make them correspond to the Federal divisions ? I make bold to say that if the system now in the invogue in Tasmania were applied to New South Wales, it would be found that the roll for each polling place could be made complete in itself. The reform made in Tasmania was so beneficial that I have never been able to understand why it was not continued. Even if it were not possible in the States where the electorates are not coterminous, it ought to be reverted to in States where the electorates are so situated, in order that the fullest advantages may be continued. I hope to see the electorates, both State and Federal, throughout Australia brought into line, so that one roll can be used for both; but that cannot be brought about if States which have adopted the reform are penalized.

675,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Calare) [2.33 a.m.] - There is an item ' of £15,000 to recoup the various States for salaries and other expenses incurred on behalf of the Commonwealth; and I notice that last year the amount voted was £16,000, and the amount spent £11,648. The services rendered, I take it, are those in connection with the carrying out of public works by the States Public Works Departments for the Commonwealth; and I do not regard Ihis as altogether ""a satisfactory method. In New South Wales, as in other States, the Public Works Department has its own work to attend to, and naturally the business of the Commonwealth takes second place; and I think the time has arrived when the Commonwealth should possess a staff of its own. In each of the States, the Commonwealth has an inspector and a small staff, which is largely occupied preparing and supervising the work to be done by the States; and all that is required, in order to meet the growing work of the Commonwealth, is to enlarge that staff. I hope that in the current year the Minister will give his attention to this matter, and that, in the next Estimates, this item will have largely disappeared.",102
676,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Gwydir) [2.35 a.m.]. - I hope the time is not far distant when this Department of Home Affairs will be "" passed out,"" or a better use and name found for it. It is evident to me that, so far as Postal works are concerned, it is essential, in the interests of expedition, that they should be carried out by a Works Branch of the Postal Department itself. The whole history of the Department of Home Affairs has been one of red-tape - and delay, which is irritating,'not only to those in the service, but to honourable members who are in a measure responsible for the works.",102
677,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Is the delay the fault of the Department of Home Affairs?,102
678,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member has been long enough here to know where the block is in regard to Postal works.,102
679,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The fault lies with the Postal Department; and I wish the latter were as prompt as the Department of Home Affairs.,102
680,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Department of Home Affairs has been nothing but a stumbling-block in the way of all the other Departments with which it has any connection. Staff), Mr Fenton - Are not the other Departments a stumbling-block in the way of the Department of Home Affairs?",102
681,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If the Department of Home Affairs did not, in justification for its existence, prolong its deliberations on all matters, it would be "" out of work "" three parts of the year.",102
682,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It is one of the promptest Departments in the service.,102
683,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It is one of those Departments which no man, who knows anything of great public institutions, can justify. The necessity for the dispensing with the services of the Public Works Departments of the States is self-evident, and requires no discussion. This represents another system of circumlocution which is not a credit to the House or to the Government Delay in the carrying out of works is not the only cause of complaint as regards this Department. There is good reason for complaining of the works carried out by it, and the degree of interest taken in Commonwealth works by officers of State Public Works Departments to whom they are instrusted. If honourable mem-bers require any illustration of what the Home Affairs Department cai-"" do in the way of spending the money of the Commonwealth, they have only to go and see what has been done in the Mails Branch of the Sydney General Post Office. Until the Postal Commission made known the conditions in that office, neither the Home Affairs Department nor the Post and Telegraph Department had any conception of what they were like. When it was made clear that they were a disgrace to our civilization, an effort was made to bring about a change, but instead of improving the conditions in the mail office, the Home Affairs and Public Works Department have succeeded in making them worse than they were before. The place was overcrowded, and the ventilation worse than in any other office that I have ever been in. Those intrusted with the work of increasing the accommodation of the office and improving the conditions thought to do so by erecting a gallery extending for some distance over the lower floor. Some of the men have been transferred to this upper gallery, where they are obliged to breathe ' the polluted atmosphere due to the great number of men who have to work below them.",102
684,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,V-I S the honourable member speaking of Tasmania ?,103
685,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"No , of the Mails Branch Office in the Sydney General Post Office. I should like to say that, for the requirements of the State, the Hobart General Post Office is the finest in Australia, and I think the log-rolling of the honourable member for Wilmot is responsible for that. Efforts were made to hurry on the work of erecting the gallery to which I have referred. Men were working on the job night and day, and overtime rates were paid. The Department never gave any thought to the question as to how the mails were to be got to the upper floor, and, as a consequence, after it was constructed, the gallery was left lying idle for weeks. This will give honourable members some idea of the supervision of public works by the Home Affairs Department. I know of no case in which the administration of this Department has not resulted in unnecessary expense to the Commonwealth. Since public opinion has been aroused, and the Postal Commission has recommended the removal of corridors, which take up space and keep out the light, and the removal of partitions to enable proper supervision to be carried out, thousands of pounds are being spent in making other alterations in the General Post Office at Sydney. Huge stone walls are being removed, and suspended platforms substituted for corridors, at a very great cost. The Postal Commission have recommended that more modern and up-to-date buildings should be erected for post-offices throughout Australia, and more attention sanitation, light, and convenience for supervision. But, though some effort may - be made by the Department to meet the requirements of the day, it seems that our officers are unable to anticipate the demands of the future. Every one knows that Australia is advancing by leaps and bounds. The great State of New South Wales is prospering in every way, and its metropolis is growing beyond all the anticipations of a few years ago. It will be only a few years hence when all that can be done with the money now being spent will be quite insufficient to meet the growing demands of the people. I complain of the lack of foresight in these Departments. I may mention, also, that largely because of the red-tape in the Home Affairs Department, most of our telegraph offices are, owing to the inadequate accommodation provided, nothing but death-traps for the men and women who are obliged to work in them. Money has been voted time and again, but the work of improvement has been going forward at a snail's pace. The Home Affairs Department cannot escape its responsibility for the delay in carrying out these very necessary works, but their answer always is that there is no money, or that there are no men available. They always find a way out. We seem to have too many brakes on the wheel. On one wheel, there is the brake of the Home Affairs office, on another there is the brake of the Minister of the Department, on another the brake applied by the Treasurer; in fact, there are four brakes on the four wheels, and, therefore, very little progress is made. I am sorry these Estimates have come up for discussion at a time when we have no opportunity, and members have no inclination, to dissect them properly. One of the most important functions of this House is to review and control the expenditure of the Departments, but when we are expected to get through them, and also the Budget debate, in twelve or fourteen hours, it is irksome to any man to rise and discuss them. Unfortunately, honourable members seem to consider that a prorogation within a given time is of greater importance than the discharge of this important duty. There is still a month before us if we like to stay here and do the work properly. If I had time, I could break this Department, so to speak, into atoms, so far as its administration is concerned. Mr KIN G O'MALLEY - Why does not given to the honourable member do it?",103
686,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Because the honourable member would never be able to get it together again. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I can hold my own with the honourable member any day.,103
687,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The Minister's irritation is an example of the bad effects of all-night sittings. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Why does not the honourable member tear the Department to pieces if he can do so?,104
688,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Perhaps the time will come when I shall do more tearing than the honourable member will care about. I have said sufficient to indicate the root of the trouble in the Department. The matter of getting a brick-yard in the Federal Territory, testing the clay, building brick mansions as homes for the officers of the Commonwealth, and erecting a Parliament House of beautifully arranged bricks of various colours, is considered worthy of the aspirations of the Department. cently they recommended the use of Victorian bluestone in the foundations of a large building attached to the Customs Department in Sydney, when superior and cheaper trachyte can be obtained locally. When the question was discussed in the House, the Department said, "" It shall not occur again."" Instead ;of begging pardon for doing wrong, their duty is to see that they do right in the first place. When the Minister himself tells the House that his short experience in administering the Department has made him realise that he is nothing more than an animated rubber stamp, no further criticism is necessary to prove my argument. If the Department is beyond the control of its responsible political head, it must be in a hopeless condition. , The Minister depicts it as surrounded by masses of decayed red tape, which one can smell directly he enters the office. I hope there will be a further inquiry into the relative position of this Department to the other services of the Commonwealth. Now that we have a Labour Ministry, and are likely to take charge of industrial affairs when given by the people, next year, additional powers with their additional responsibilities, the Home Affairs Department would be better known and occupied as a Labour portfolio, under a Minister for Labour, as in New Zealand and other places. I have in my mind's eye a more useful purpose for this misfit Department, which seems to have been put into the list in the first place only to find a billet for another Minister. I want to find something for the Department to do without having to get rid of the Minister. I do not refer to the present Minister; but in future I shall keenly scrutinize the work of the Department, and shall be more at liberty than I have been for some time in the past to keep an eye on it. If a material improvement has not been made by next year, I shall be prepared with dates and cases to substantiate my charges..",104
689,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The Minister has said that he is a mere rubber stamp.,104
690,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I understand that he intends to make an explanation of that statement, and I shall postpone my further remarks until he has done so.",104
691,Mr RILEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"South Sydney) [3.4 a.m.]. - - I agree with much that has been said by the honourable member for Gwydir. In my opinion, the time has arrived when, in this Department, we should have an architect in control of works, and under him a proRe- fessional staff, and a staff of workmen for the carrying out of repairs and alterations. At present the Department has not the machinery necessary for the satisfactory fulfilment of its functions. Furthermore, as we are likely, in the near future, to have such gigantic undertakings as the construction of the transcontinental railways, and the development of the Northern Territory will involve, we might well follow the example of New South Wales, and create a Works Committee. In that State the country has been saved hundreds of thousands of pounds by the work of the Committee, whose members visit the localities in which it is proposed to spend Government money, take evidence from the officials and local residents, and report on the proposals generally.",104
692,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"All proposals involving an estimated expenditure of more than £20,000 are referred to the Committee.",104
693,Mr RILEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"As to the accommodation of the Sydney Post Office, I know a good deal about the building, and was in and out of it a great deal when the gallery was being put up. It is not the rat-trap that it has been described to be, and things were worse before it was built. It has a window and a door by which ventilation can be provided if desired. At the same time, I admit that the building is not large enough. Every available space is now occupied, but the business is too large for the premises, and to give relief an extension should be made in George or Pitt streets.",104
694,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It would be better to remove the work of some of the branches elsewhere.,104
695,Mr RILEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That would give relief. But it must be remembered that the telephone tunnels and telegraph wires are all connected with the General Post Office, and that to alter the arrangement would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, so that it would be cheaper to extend the building.",105
696,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The sorting mails could be done elsewhere.,105
697,Mr RILEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That would give relief, but the sorting of mails is a trifling matter compared with the other business of the office. I think that the Commonwealth should have one centrally situated block. The location of the Mail Branch near the railway station has been suggested, but the railway may be extended into - the city, and in the future we may have more than one station. I hope that the Minister will push on vigorously with the work of the Federal Capital. Nearly £50,000 has been voted, but very little of the money has been spent.",105
698,Mr KING OMALLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I have not yet had an opportunity to investigate matters. The office is run by the Minister now.,105
699,Mr RILEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I hope that in the recess a good start will be made.,105
700,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Wimmera) [3.10 a.m.]. - The suggestion of the honourable member for South Sydney that a Works Committee shall be appointed is a good one. I do not think that such a Committee should be called upon to report regarding sites for Post Offices and small public works, but it might have functions similar to those of the Victorian Railways Standing Committee, which has saved this State hundreds of thousands of pounds, and.is one of the most useful bodies created by the local Parliament. Large projects, such as projected railways, and the works likely to be constructed in the Northern Territory, might well be investigated by a Committee. Replying to what was said by the honourable member for Gwydir regarding the Home Affairs Department, my experience is that the Department is one of the most prompt and efficient in the Government service, and has a thorough grasp of its business.",105
701,Mr CANN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,What has happened in connection with the Liverpool manoeuvre area does not bear out that statement.,105
702,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I am not prepared to say that any delay that may have taken place is the fault of the Department. Mr KIN G O'MALLEY - It is the fault of the Wade Government.,105
703,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Department is often blamed for delays for which other Departments are responsible. Delays occur in the Postal Department, though, considering the magnitude of its business, that is not surprising, but in the Defence Department there is sometimes a delay of twelve months or two years in connection with matters like the choosing of rifle of ranges. The time has arrived when we should have a public works staff of our own, instead of being dependent on State officials. The States have done good work for the Commonwealth, but naturally they attend to their own affairs first, and the Commonwealth public works have to stand aside until the State officials have time to deal with them.",105
704,Mr ROBERTS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Adelaide) [3.15 a.m.]Inasmuch as the members from some of the States are complaining of the dilatoriness of the Home Affairs Department, .and those from other States are praising its energy, it seems to me that the causes of delay in the carrying out of works must be the inaction of the State officers. I am aware that it is customary for officials to endeavour to put the blame on the shoulders of others. That is a failing to which we are all liable. None of us believes that he has faults; it is the other man who is bad. My experience leads me to think that the opinion held in regard to the Home Affairs Department depends on the manner in which its work is carried out by State officials. In South Australia. I believe that there has been some difficulty in getting work done, for which the blame does not lie with the Minister or the central staff. I must say on behalf of the South Australian official that he has no incentive for hurrying on the work of the Home Affairs Department. In the early days of Federation the State officials received additional remuneration for supervizing Commonwealth work, but nowadays, although we vote money to recoup the States for salaries and other expenses incurred on behalf of the Commonwealth, the money goes, not to the individuals who do the work, but into the State Treasuries. Some years ago the Commonwealth authorities gave the officer in South Australia who superintends the construction of public buildings, £ 1 0 0 o r J£ 5 T 0 a y e a r to l°°k fter its works. a The money is still being paid, but it now goes to the general revenue of the State, and therefore the officer in question has no inducement to get the Commonwealth work done as quickly as possible. He knows that he will receive the State salary in any case. He may shirk the work for a month or a year, in the knowledge that he will receive his salary from the State Government just the same as if he did not shirk it. On the - other hand, he may be an assertive indiviofficers, dual, who will resent the instructions of .central authorities, and we know that such an individual can put all sorts of difficulState ties in the way of a particular work being carried out; instead of putting oil upon the wheels, he may put sand. I welcome the suggestion of the honourable member - Calare that the time has arrived when .should have in each State a Home Affairs .Department, whose officers will be the direct control of the Minister of Department. Work would then proceed smoothly. In the matter of the erection a post office at Prospect, a suburb of laide, I may mention that, although money has been voted for a considerable period, and, notwithstanding that tenders have been accepted, there appears to be nobody to supervise the undertaking, so that, in all probability, it will not be pleted by the end of the current financial year. This is solely due to the absence of a.direct form of administration. also point to another case in which an inAffairs dividual in South Australia has so adminisvernment tered certain instructions issued by ister as to create the utmost possible discontent between the individuals with that work and the Department in Melbourne. In such circumstances, it is time that we endeavoured to effect an alterais tion. I support the suggestion of the orable member for Calare, in the hope that in the early future we _ shall have in each of the States a Public Works Department directly under the control of the Minister. I believe that the creation of such a partment would prove, not only useful, but economical.",105
705,Mr CANN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Nepean) [3.25 a.m.] - clothing In my own electorate a large work is now in course of construction- I refer to erection of a small arms factory. In conample nexion with that undertaking, a lot of bungling has occurred by reason of State - officers having to supervise it. As a result money has been wasted. The building is not ready for the reception of the mahimself chinery, certain material has not plied, and the contractors for the brickwork 'have been blamed, although the fault does not belong to them. I believe that supervision of this work by State officials is solely responsible for the existing tion of affairs. My idea is that we should have a Federal Public Works Departchange ment with a branch in each State, which"" would be under the control of the Minister. Until we dispense with the services of State we shall never get a better system. the At present a divided responsibility exists. The State officers are in the service of the Governments, and, therefore, we cannot effectively control them. We cannot expect that they will act up to our requirements whilst they are in the employ of the for State. The position will not be improved we until we have a Public Works Department under the control of the Commonwealth. under I have found that the Home Afthat fairs Department is the worse managed of all our Federal Departments. In ot connection with the delay which has Adeoccurred, in the resumption of a manoeuvre the area at Liverpool, for example, the Minister shelters himself behind the State Government. I believe that his statement is all bluff. I was never deceived by it, because only the other day I saw a noticomfication in the Commonwealth Gazette to the effect that 400 or 500 acres of land in Queensland had been resumed for defence I may purposes. Yet the Minister of Home has repeatedly told us that the Gocannot resume the land required the Minfor a manoeuvre area at Liverpool.",106
706,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member charged is crushing the Minister.,106
707,Mr CANN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I believe his statement that he is an animated rubber stamp, who dominated by his departmental officers. honHe would be all right if he would only shake himself free of them. When we recollect the number of large works to which the Commonwealth is committed in the near future, we are justified in creating a Public DeWorks Department of our own. If we are going to tackle the question of the establish, ment of a small arms factory, and of a mill, the construction of the transcontinental railways, and of the Federal the Capital, such a Department will have to occupy its attention. I hope that before another Budget is presented to the House a Federal Public Works Department will have been created, and that the Minister of Home Affairs will have shakenfree of the shackles of which he; been suphas complained so bitterly.",106
708,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Gwydir) [3.31 a.m.] As some honourable members have spoken so the eulogistically of this Department, it is necessary that I should place upon recondicord one or two facts which bear out my contention. After the new telephone exin Adelaide had been completed, if was suddenly discovered that its ventilation was defective, and as a result certain alterations had to be made. It was also found that no provision had been made for the reception of the cables which come into the ground floor of that building. Consequently, a great deal of the lower portion of it had to be torn up to permit of those wires being installed. Then, it is well known that the operating room in the Melbourne Telephone Exchange is far too low to permit of adequate air space being supplied to the attendants. Yet the Minister would have us believe that everything in his Department is perfect. These are matters which have come under my personal observation. The honourable member for South Sydney has referred to the gallery which has been erected in the mail-room of the Sydney office, and which is a very expensive and good piece of work, as a rat trap. The men who are placed in that gallery are obliged to breathe a contaminated atmosphere by reason of the number of employees who work below. They have also to inhale the dust which rises from the mail-room. The mail-room is the one room of all others in which the supervision of the staff ought to be complete. But the construction of the gallery has darkened the lower part of the hall, so that the sorters have now to work under an artificial light.",106
709,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,It is a good room spoilt.,107
710,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Absolutely . The conclusion arrived at by the Postal Commission was that there is only one way in which the difficulty can be remedied, namely,- by removing the entire Mail Branch to some' spot .as close to the Redfern railway station as possible. It is recognised' throughout the civilized world today that in big cities the mail-rooms should be located as near as possible to the central railway station.",107
711,The CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I must ask the honourable member not to discuss that question.,107
712,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I - have mentioned these two or three examples of departmental ineptitude only for the purpose of showing that such mistakes would not be made by officers who had a wise conception of their duties. Mr. JOSEPH . COOK (Parramatta) [3.40 a.m.]- I have heard a beautiful picture drawn of the benefits of Socialistic control. If this is to be the Socialism of the future, it seems to .me that we might well pray to be delivered from it. It is a picture of a water-logged Department, incapable and inefficient, whose Minister confesses that he is nothing but an animated rubber stamp, held fast in shackles of red tape. Altogether it is a very pretty picture of the Socialistic machine in actual operation. If this is to be the kind of supervision and control to be exercised over the more complicated businesses which it is proposed to take under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, we had better pause and inquire more minutely into what in reality constitutes Socialism. I can conceive of nothing more damaging than the criticisms which have been made here. I admit, however, that some of them have been rather overdrawn. Take, for instance, the question of the manoeuvre area at Liverpool in New South Wales. The honourable member for Nepean did not appear to be aware of what was proceeding when he spoke of the Commonwealth resuming the area. It has to be resumed by the State and not by the Commonwealth. The latter has merely to pay the interest on the cost of resumption. The honourable member will have to address his remonstrances to his confreres in the State Government. It is not easy to put through land resumptions, because a great many technicalities are involved. Such transactions take time, even when carried out by private enterprise rather than by the Socialistic action of the Departments. The Minister should see that the resumption of this manoeuvre area is concluded at the earliest possible moment. Troops cannot train properly over the area until certain improvements have been made, and that work cannot Be undertaken until the : resumption has been completed. I believe that the undertaking will involve an expenditure of £40,000. Mr KIN G O'MALLEY - I understand that a large area of freehold land has to be purchased by the State Government.",107
713,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I desire to call attention to the rule which has been adopted in the Post and Telegraph Department in regard to the erection of postmasters' residences. When the Works and Buildings Estimates were under consideration, I pointed out that although the residence of the postmaster at Wyong is being eaten away with white ants, the Department intends to erect another wooden building. It is wrong to put up a wooden building in a district which is infested with white ants, when, at an additional cost of a few hunderd pounds, it is possible to put up a building which would be practically everlasting. The blame rests with the Post and Telegraph Department, because the Home Affairs Department desired to erect a brick building. The proper constructing authority is of opinion that brick buildings ought to be provided.",107
714,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Is that so?,108
715,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Minister exhibited of Home Affairs told me in the House that, in his opinion, this particular building should be of brick, and I believe the officers of his Department hold that it a waste of public money to erect a wooden building in an area which is infested white ants. It seems that the Post and Telegraph Department deduct a certain amount as rent from a postmaster's salary, and therefore want a building to corresIf pond with the amount which he is supposed to pay. It is well known that white ants cost the States as well as the Commongeneral wealth thousands of pounds every year. The Minister of Home Affairs promised me that the new residence for the postmaster at Wyong should be built of brick, but spoke was put in his wheel by the Post and Telegraph Department, and there the matter rests. I hope that the policy will he altered. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 25 (Census and Statistics), £13,013",108
716,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Gwydir) [3.50 a.m.]. - A m I to understand that no matter what representations are placed before the Minin ister of Home Affairs when the Estimates for his Department are submitted, he will turn a deaf ear, and give honourable memanother bers no satisfaction? - tically Mr KING O'MALLEY - I cannot get a chance. Every time. I have risen an honhad orable member has wished to speak.",108

718,Mr KING OMALLEY,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I shall he quite time. willing to do so when we get to another item. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 26 (Meteorological Branch), £18,457.",108
719,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Calare) [3.52 sence a.m.] - It should be the purpose of the Department of Home Affairs to make the Meteorological Branch as .efficient effective as possible. In New South Wales and, no doubt, in other States, this Branch falls very far short of meeting the requirements of the agricultural and grazing industries. One of the methods of the branch is to have country record stations collecting every day information as to weather conditions, and wiring it to Sydney. It is at the General Post Office, in addition to being made available to the press. The Meteorological Branch has limited the number of centres from wEich the inforis mation should come, with the result that there is a large number of growing and imwith portant towns which are altogether neglected. Any complaint is usually met with the reply that the information now supplied is ample for scientific purposes. may be sufficient for scientific purposes ; but certainly it is notsufficient to meet the commercial needs of the community. The public attach a certain amount of importance to the information. They judge the importance of centres by the information supplied, and naturally conclude that a the Meteorological Branch takes the information from all important centres. Tne list should be enlarged, and all centres placed on an equal footing. The way in which a complaint is dealt with furnishes another instance of red tapeism. I have had occasion to bring the needs of some centres under the notice of the Meteorological Brancli. One objection was that the notice-board at the General Post Office Sydney, was not large enough to supply other information. When one centre offered to bear the expense of enlarging the board, objection was raised, and so pracnothing has been done. The last objection is that the Meteorological Branch all the information required for scientific purposes, and, apparently, that is all it is concerned about. I ask was the Minister to recognise that this Combranch of his Department has a comthrow mercial value which could be inDecreased by giving that wider range of which a number of country centres have been requesting for along Although on the last Estimates £11,514 was voted for the Meteorological Branch only £9,120 was expended. The unexpended balance of £2,394 could have been profitably expended in supplying additional information. Apparently, the abof funds does not apply in this case. The Meteorological Branch ought to be in a position to give the weather conditions of and every important centre throughout the States, to supply the river conditions, to inform the public of flood conditions, and to furnish the quotations for wheat. Timely information as to flood conditions would often assist in saving to persons thousands of pounds, while information as to the wheat market would be of incalculable value to producers, because it would insure to them money which now passes into the pockets of a few speculators.",108
720,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Does the honourable member mean that that information should be supplied free?,109
721,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It is public information, and I do not see why it should not be supplied free. At any rate the present piecemeal fashion of dealing with the matter is unsatisfactory, and tends to bring the Department into disrepute.",109
722,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Would the honourable member limit the information to wheat prices ?,109
723,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I would convey information for the benefit of all the producing interests. I have simply instanced information as to wheat prices as being such as would be of very great value to a very deserving section of our producers. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Information of that kind saves millions of dollars annually in America.,109
724,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I understand that the really up-to-date countries have recognised the necessity of supplying information of the .kind. I hope that this Labour Government will not permit Australia to lag behind in this respect. I emphasize the fact that the Meteorological Branch can be made extremely valuable for commercial purposes, and Ministers generally will render a good service to country by enabling the Minister of Home Affairs to make the branch commercially of service to the community. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 27 (Works and Buildings), £134,669.",109
725,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Calare) [4.6 a.m.] - This division affords an opportunity for the Committee to elicit some information with regard to public works. On a previous occasion the honourable member for Parramatta drew attention to the unwisdom of erecting wooden buildings for postal purposes in various country districts. But the Department is still pursuing the same policy. I know of three country centres in New South Wales at the present moment where wooden buildings are being erected. It is true that the post-offices proper are being built of brick, but the residences provided for the postmasters are wooden. This cheese-paring policy is not creditable to the Department. Whatever gain may be immediately made is. more than lost ultimately. As the honourable member for Parramatta pointed out, white ants in some parts of the country eat out these structures. Then, again, in the warmer districts wooden buildings deteriorate very rapidly unless they are frequently coated with paint, and they also become exceedingly hot and uncomfortable. It would be much more economical in the long run to erect these. official residences either of brick or of "" peasy,"" which is something in the nature of brick. Certainly, no hard and fast rule should be laid down as to the erection of wooden residences for postmasters. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin-Min ister of Home Affairs) [4.10 a.m.] - The positionwith regard to the erection of post offices and official residences is this: My Department is requisitioned by another Department for a building. We make our recommendations in accordance with what w.e think is required. As a business man, I make my own proposals. But with the other Departments concerned it is largely a matter of money. Finally, the Department interested says to the Home Affairs Department exactly what kind of a building it requires, and it is simply my business to carry out the recommendation.",109
726,Mr MATHEWS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Melbourne Ports) [4.12 a.m.] - It is, of course, very nice for an honourable member to have a palatial public building erected in his electorate. It adds to the dignity of a town. I have thistried to get a building for my own constituency, but the objection has always been put to me in this way- "" Will the Department sell a penny stamp the more for-the building being a handsome instead of a plain one?"" It is not fair to ask the Government of the Commonwealth to erect a handsome brick building when a wooden one will answer the purpose. Of course, it is purely a question of the amount of money that can be obtained from the Treasurer. On one occasion, there was a vote of £4,500 on the Estimates for a post-office in my electorate. The people wanted a certain kind of building, and could not get it because it would cost £6,000. The Treasurer of the day cut down the vote, and the consequence was that no post-office was built. Now I have to put up with a vote of £1,000. It is scarcely reasonable for some honourable members to clamour for palatial brick and stone buildings to be erected in their constituencies, whilst other parts of the country have to go without post-offices altogether. I cannot get a post-office, and should be prepared to take a smaller one in default of something better.",109
727,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Wimmera) [4.15 a.m.]. - I do not agree with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports as to the erection of wooden buildings throughout the Commonwealth. My opinion is that a Commonwealth Department ought to show at least as much enterprise as an ordinary citizen conducting a business in a country town. In any progressive town in Australia you will find the largest number of the principal businesses carried on in brick structures. They are more permanent than wooden buildings, and, of course, provide a greater immunity from fire. It is discreditable that a Commonwealth Department should show less enterprise than do private individuals. It is, ih my opinion, the duty of the Government to do its part towards adding to the beauty of our towns.",110
728,Mr THOMAS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,And adding to the value of surrounding land.,110
729,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"It is merely a matter of a great public Department keeping pace with .the enterprise shown by private individuals in the conduct of their business. One or two wooden post-offices have been erected in my electorate, and I consider that the class of building was a reflection upon the Department of Home Affairs. I am surprised that the Minister should submit to the dictation of the Treasurer in such a matter. Mr KING O'MALLEY - If a building will cost £1,200, and the Treasurer will only place £900 on the Estimates, does the honourable member expect me to make up the deficiency out of my own pocket?",110
730,Mr SAMPSON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If the Home Affairs Department were to make a recommendation that a particular public building should be of brick, I venture to say that the surer would not object for the sake of an extra hundred or two.",110
731,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Maribyrnong) [4.17 a.m.] - Judgin g from the expressions on the faces of some Ministers, they are inclined to ridicule the rather valuable suggestion made with regard to the erection of public buildings of a permanent character. But it seems to me to be a simple waste of money to put up wooden buildings in some localities. If the Commonwealth is to maintain any sort of a reputation, it should pay heed to the opinions of those who know. I have had something to do with public works in connection with the State Government, and over and over again I have seen the erection of wooden buildings prove to be a distinct loss to the community. Whatever authority may be responsible for the buildings that are erected by the Commonwealth at present, they do not reflect much credit on the architects. Our buildings should be constructed of the best materials available, and regard should be had to architectural beauty. I feel inclined to express myself very plainly on this subject, when I see Ministers sit smiling whilst valuable suggestions are made to them. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 28 (Governor General's Establishment), £9,520.",110
732,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Capricornia) [4.19 a.m.]. - I wish to protest against the manner in which these Estimates are being forced through. The procedure is simply wicked. I am also very much surprised to find that so large an expenditure is proposed on account of the Government Houses in Sydney and Melbourne. I remember that in the year 1902-as honourable members will find from Hansard of the 26th August, of that year- a motion was carried in this House to the effect that "" the expenditure on Government Houses of £5,500 a year is approved during the term of office of the next Governor General."" The expenditure on the Governor General's Establishment in 1901-2 was £28,885, but a considerable proportion of that belonged to the year 1901. In 1902-3 the expenditure was £14,631; and it continued to mount up until in 1909-10 it had grown to £22,657, and will mean something like £23,500 for 1910-11. In 1903-4 the expenditure was £16,793; i 9°4-5 it was n I £17,170; in 1905-6 it was £23,759; in 1906-7 it was £18,611; in 1907-8 it was £18,927 ; and in 1908-9 is was £22,553. Trea- I remember that it was proposed to pay the Governor General a salary of £10,000, with £8,000 in addition, but that idea was rejected, and a resolution was carried that, the expenditure on the Government Houses: in Sydney and Melbourne should not exceed £5,500. The present Speaker, as a> private member, moved that that motion be amended by substituting £2,101 for £5,5°°, but the amendment was lost. Somebody who was anxious to spend more money on the Government Houses had not the courage to face Parliament and submit the expenditure in the regular way, but covered it up under the heading of "" non-recurring works."" Even in 1905-6 there was a special provision of £390 for painting, and in 1906-7, the first time the term -'' non-recurring works"" was used, there was voted £320 for Sydney, and £i,435 for Melbourne. I was very much surprised to find in 1905-6, on behalf of the Governor General's Establishment, the enormous expenditure of £7,107 for railway fares in one year. My only desire in quoting these figures is to show the extravagance that has grown up; and the undesirable method adopted of not placing the items before Parliament. Let us consider more in detail the expenditure on these "" non-recurring works"" at the two Government Houses. In the case of Sydney in 1906-7 we have repairs and painting, £30 15s.; repairing roads, £117 ios. 8d.; and kitchen utensils, £42 is. 3d., or a total of £190 6s. nd. for the year 1906-7. In the case of Melbourne for the same year we have-draining flower beds, £12 15s. 4d. ; repairs to footpaths, £40; for dray, £8 3s. 2d.; renewing household linen, £66 lis. iod.; erection of motor car stables, £216 ios. ; gravelling drive, £138 8s.; painting, £1.97 19s.; tar paving drives, £50; glassware for stock, £70 3s. 9d.; cutlery, £50 5s. 9d.; floor coverings, £40 19s. 4d. ; and bedroom screens, £8 8s.,; or a total of £919 4s. 2d. Why were these items not boldly stated in the Estimates, and not secretly covered up as ""non-recurring works""? The accountants,' possibly under direction from a superior officer, have evidently not done their duty; and if these officials are prepared to do this sort of thing in regard to one matter, they may be prepared to do it in regard to others. It might be thought, on looking at the regular statement in the Estimates, that the expendiin ture at Government House, Sydney, was very small. For example, it might be gathered that nothing had been spent on fittings and furniture in 1907-8, but if we refer to the statement furnished as to "" non-recurring works,"" we see £75 for re-upholstering ballroom furniture, and £80 for renovating pictures. Why were these items not published for the information of honourable members? In the case of Melbourne, we find, among the items in the open account, £14 for china and glass, while in the secret account glassware for stock figures £99 os. 2d. In the secret account, the Mr Higgs. renewing of household linen is responsible for £ 4 9 is. 6d. for the year 1907-8, and for £ 6 6 us. iod. in 1906-7. In 1908-9 only £ 1 is set down in the open account for china and glass, but amongst the "" non-recurring works "" there is an expenditure °f £ 4 ios. 4d. under this head. In that 2 I same year, fittings and furniture exceeded the appropriation by £ 2 0 . "" Chair covers, curtains, & c , "" were responsible for £ 1 3 13s. 7d., while an extra dining-room window cost £377 2S. 3d. I should like the Minister of Home Affairs to find out whether tenders were called for the window, and whether the lowest tenderer was given the contract. What I complain of is that, apparently, each individual connected with the Government House party can have any caprice immediately gratified. Although the New South Wales Government spent no less than £20,000 in putting the Government House at Sydney in readiness for the Governor General, a new dining-room window is, at the desire of some one, at once provided, at the cost I have mentioned. In 1909-10 we shed find, amongst the non-recurring works "" Frames for propagating purposes,"" £ 8 2 19s. 9d.; and also "" Enclosing and framing for propagating ground,"" £ 9 9 QS. In the same year, £ 5 7 us. was voted for a "" horse-mower, horse, and cart,"" and in the following year £135 for a precisely similar purchase. Then £ 7 7 ios. was spent in converting the billiard-room at Sydney into a sitting-room and office for A.D.C. Again I ask why these items did not appear in the open account? How is it that in connection with Melbourne Government House there is an expenditure of £132 for telephones, when the premises are not occupied by the Governor General for three months in the year? Then, in 1909-10, £ 2 3 1 14s. was spent in "" renewing carpets, felt, linoleum, and curtains "" the Melbourne Government House, while £200 is to be spent on "" carpets, fittings, & c , "" in 1910-11. I now desire to direct the attention of honourable members to the area covered by these two Government Houses and grounds. In the case of Melbourne, the grounds total fifty acres, and in Sydney thirty-five acres; and while there are 170 rooms in the Sydney house, there are 115 rooms in the Melbourne house. These two large establishments are maintained for two people-at least, we presume there are only two, although we at may be told in the Argus that Miss Dash, from Bombay, or elsewhere, is at present staying with the Governor General and Lady Dudley. The point I desire to emphasize is that the Australian public too much for what appears to be a purely ornamental position. There are, no doubt, some duties which the Governor General can perform, and we shall always require somebody to perform them; but if Miss Dash is to be the guest of the Governorprovoking General and the Countess of Dudley, the people whom I represent, and who may earn 22s. 6d. a week with rations, discussion. ""should be relieved of the portion of the expenditure the guest entails. opinion, £3,000 for the upkeep of one to me. Government House is quite sufficient. The continuance of two Government Houses is them so grossly and wilfully extravagant that it member. should be put a stop to as soon as possible by the present Ministry.",110

750,The CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Order !,112
751,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Perhaps the honourable these gentleman will permit me to proceed, and him will not attempt to deter me from performing my public duty by his infamous sugelected gestions. I find that Lord Tennyson, who was Governor General of the Commonwealth in 1903, speaking at a Lord Mayor's in Sydney, informed those prethat, in his opinion, the salary of the Governor General fixed by the Constitution, and the provision voted by Parliament for the maintenance of the Government Houses in Melbourne and Sydney, were sufficient to enable the Governor General to maintain the dignity of the position and to fulfil, without ostentation, his public and social obligations. Let us see what was paid at that time. The Sydney Government House then cost £1,233, the Melbourne Government House £1,203, o r a £2,436. The total sum-includin g the Governor General's salary of £10,000amounted to £14,631. To-day the upkeep of the two Houses costs nearly £8;ooo per annum, and the total cost of the establishment, including the Governor General's salary, amounts to £23,520. If the expenditure on the Governor General's establishment during Lord Tennyson's occupancy of the position was sufficient for that gentleman, surely a similar expenditure should be sufficient for the present Governor General? There are certain people in the community, and the Acting Minister of Defence appears to be cne of them, who agree with the opinion expressed by the late Mr Samuel Hordern, who died worth about £3,000,000, made mostly out of dress goods. On his return from the Old Country to Sydney, on one occasion, he said that the opinion was held in England that we ought to abolish all the State Governors, and pay their salaries to the Governor General. He said It would make it worthwhile for a good man to come out to Australia, and the spending of £30,000 or £40,000 in the carrying out of his duties would cause the people, as a whole, to spend money to keep pace with the position This would raise the tone of the position in British circles. How many people are there in Melbourne at the present time who are foolishly endeavouring to keep up with the pace created by the expenditure of this large sum of money on the Governor General's establishment? I venture to say that very many people attempt to keep up a position which they cannot maintain. They are denying themselves and their families the ordinary necessaries of life in order to keep up with the false position created by this extravagant expenditure in the maintenance of two Government Houses. I do not care what the Acting Minister of Defence thinks about the ""matter, or how greatly disturbed he may be as to the effect which my remarks may have on the minds of certain people, because I am carrying out what I believe to be my duty in this House. I Mr Higgs. am not alone in the views which I hold on this subject. There are certain very distinguished persons in this community who have expressed the opinion that the ""maintenance of two Government Houses is a wilful extravagance. I find that the honourable member for Angas, who was At-' torney-General of the Commonwealth in the Deakin-Cook Ministry, speaking on 26th August, 1902, on a proposal to give total of Lord Hopetoun £8,000, in addition to the £10,000 he was getting as salary, said I object to the duplication of Vice-Regal establishments, not because of the expenditure involved, but because it is unnecessary and inexpedient, and it is not an obligation cast upon us by any compact which we ought to respect. Mr Justice Isaacs, who was at one time member for Indi in this Parliament, and Attorney-General of the Patterson. Government in Victoria, and who is now a Justice of the High Court, in speaking on this matter, saidEverything, however, will centre round this question : What justification is there for expending Commonwealth money in the establishment and maintenance of a needless Governor General's establishment. What has the Acting Minister of Defence to say to that?",112
752,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I agree with that, but I have something to say against the honor- , able member introducing extraneous matter by innuendo.",113
753,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Anothe r very distinguished man in this community is Mr Justice Higgins, who was Attorney-General in the Watson Ministry, and is now a Justice of the High Court. He said I am opposed to the maintenance of two Government Houses out of Commonwealth funds. I quote now from another very distinguished man, Sir Josiah Symon, who was Attorney General of the Commonwealth in the Reid Ministry. He saidAt the risk of seeming to part company for once with some of my very good friends from New South Wales, I utterly disagree with the necessity for two Government Houses-on e in Melbourne and one in Sydney. I think the proposal too ridiculous to commend itself to men who have arrived at years of maturity. Senator Dawson interjected that it was not even suggested by the Colonial Office, and Senator Symon went on to sayAs my honourable friend says, it was not even suggested by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. To my mind the suggestion is perfectly childish. Yet an honourable member of this House who has apparently become extremely loyal all at once, casts aspersions upon an honourable member of his own party because he stands up in this House to do his duty. The Melbourne Herald has published some statements in connection with this matter. It differs to some extent from the Argus. I have no doubt that the editor of the Argus, who appears to be a very loyal gentleman, will be very angry with me when he learns what I have to say on this matter. The Melbourne Herald, on 10th August, 1902, published this statementI t is little short of a scandal that, in addition to finding j£io,ooo a year for the Governor General, we pay over £6,000 a year (more than twice as much as it ought to be), to maintain two Government Houses. Should not this indefensible thing be rectified before Lord Northcote reaches Australia ? A scandal is something opprobrious and disgraceful, and the Melbourne Herald says it is a scandal that we should be asked to maintain two Government Houses. I now propose to say something which I am afraid will give grave offence to the Acting Minister of Defence. I am about to furnish other reasons why we should not spend so much money on these two Government Houses. I consider that the Governor General does not carry out his duties as he ought to do. The Governor General appears to me to be neglecting his duties.",113

757,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I wish, with great respect, to say that there have been submitted to this House messages signed by the Governor General, who could not possibly have signed them, because they were presented on the day they were signed.

759,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,I am pointing out reasons why we should not spend this money.,114
760,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable member will be in order if he confines his remarks to the items under discussion and the vote proposed for the maintenance of the Government Houses.,114
761,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I think that I ought to be allowed to show further reasons why this expenditure is unnecessary. If I could show, as I was about to do, that there are other reasons, I think I might strengthen my case somewhat, even at the risk of offending the Acting Minister of Defence. He is the only member of the Government who objects to my bringing up these matters. I find that the Melbourne Age takes a very correct view of the extraordinary expenditure upon these Government Houses. I find that in 1901 the total expenditure in connection with the Governor General, including annual salary, Royal visit grant, special payments in aid of staff expenses, maintenance of the Government House at Sydney, and of a country cottage in New South Wales, together with structural alterations, additions, fittings, furniture, & c , for Sydney Government House, and also for the Melbourne Government House and Executive Council expenses, amounted to no less than £82,000. That was an extraordinary expenditure for a small community such as ours. I say that it is wrong, and I enter my protest against it.",114
762,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Did the honourable member object to these items when they were submitted to Parliament?,114
763,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"When in the Senate I did my level best to prevent the establishment of two Government Houses. Surely one Government House containing eightyseven rooms should be sufficient for two people. We are not expected to provide Government Houses in every one of the States. When we pay the jhandsome salary of £10,000 a year to the Governor General it should not be necessary for us to provide him with more than one Government House. Members of this Parliament receive £600 a year for their services in this Chamber and throughout the country, but they are not provided with free houses. We have to find our own houses. I am not asking that there should not be a Government House provided, but I am asking that there should not be two kept up. I think that is gross extravagance.",114
764,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,What has the Melbourne Age to say on the subject?,114
765,Mr HIGGS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Melbourne Age wound up a leading article on the subject published on 9th July, 1902, with the statementThe perusal of the foregoing figures will, however, convey this interesting fact, that, as a whole, Australia spends annually on Viceroyalty a sum equal to one-tenth of her Federal revenue. The lesson to be deduced from this discovery will , no doubt, be in the mind of the Federal Government when presenting to Parliament its new proposals with regard to the Governor General's establishment. Since I have been subjected to such a gross attack by one of the Ministers, I move, as a protest against the expenditureThat the vote be reduced by the sum of £ 1 .",114
766,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Kalgoorlie-Honorar y Minister and Acting Treasurer) [5.1 a.m.]. - I admit that in approaching the discussion of the question of the establishments of the Governor General, I am not in the position of being able to speak with the authority and knowledge of one who has recently accepted hospitality at one of them. Under those conditions, I am at a disadvantage, but I would point out to the Committee that, in approaching the discussion of a question of this description, there are limitations that should be recognised by honourable members in exercising the privilege which attaches to their speeches in this Chamber. I hope that that privilege, which is necessary in order that there may be a free expression of opinion upon public affairs by the representatives of the people, has never been abused by me during my term in this Parliament. I am prepared to admit that the question of whether we are going to incur a continuous expenditure of something over £20,000 for the maintenance, salary, and privileges of the Governor General, is a question of public policy which this Parliament is perfectly entitled to discuss, but it should, in my opinion, be discussed in language and under conditions which are not calculated or designed to introduce reflections by innuendo on the occupant of the position. Direct charges or statements must always be answered; but I put it to the honourable member for Capricornia: Does he think that a man is entitled to ask, in this Committee, whether a Miss Dash stayed on the Governor General's premises on a certain occasion? Does he think that is a fair thing? Does he consider that that is the spirit in which one ought to approach a great question of public policy? If he thinks so, I make him a present of it. It is not the view that I should take, or the attitude that I should adopt in approaching the question. It is bordering on the verge of the contemptible to do such a thing under the privilege that attaches ..to members in this Chamber. fer to say nothing further about the matter, except to point out that these buildings have been made available to the Federal Parliament-in order to house the Governor General, who is approved of by the people of this country, and whose presence is desired in certainly the two most populous States-by the State Governments, free of charge. Can we allow the buildings to fall into a state of disrepair, which would be a sorry reflection on us, in view of the generosity that has been shown to us? I think we cannot. We have to maintain the buildings in good condition while we use them. If we are going to consider the question of interfering with the conditions that have existed for years, or of deciding whether we should have only one residence instead of two for the Governor General, the issue is a perfectly legitimate one for any member of this Parliament to raise, but do not let us reach such a stage that we are reduced to arguments reflecting, by innuendo, or by the tone of our address, on the character of the occupant of the position.",115
767,Mr CHARLTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Hunter) [5.7 a.m.]. - The honourable member for Capricornia has done a service in discussing this question. I think the expenditure on the Government Houses is far too great, and the time has arrived when one should be sufficient for the Governor General. We are not justified in voting money away in this manner without an explanation of some of the items. I notice an item of £600 for sanitation and water supply for Government House, Melbourne. That seems an enormous amount of money for the purpose, and some explanation ought to be given to the Committee. Seeing that this expenditure is growing all the time, we, as representatives of the people, should see if we can by any means reduce it. We are not justified in expending money unnecessarily, when so many works could be carried out with the savings made in the maintenance of the Government Houses. The honourable member has shown that in 1903 the expenditure in Sydney was £2,800, and in Melbourne £1,233. e find that it is now £2,800 in w Sydney, and ;£3>3°3 in Melbourne. That is only for keeping the Government Houses in order, and for providing the necessary utensils, &c. I agree that while these establishments are lent to us by the States, I pre- it is necessary to maintain them, but even for that purpose these seem very big items. I do not know what justification there for paying over £1,000 for the maintenance of the house in Sydney, and over £1,100 not be avoided. for the maintenance of the house in Melbourne. If this is to go on year after the sooner the Federal Government builds a Government House for itself the better. The expenditure seems to be extravagant.",115

The go to Government Houses in Sydney and Melbourne are placed at the disposal of this Parliament by the States of New South Wales and Victoria, and a certain agreement exists in connection with them, remaining in force the until this Parliament has made up its mind with respect to its own territory, and provided for the residence of its Governorcase General there. Those two large buildings are placed at our disposal free of rent, but on the understanding that they should be kept in proper repair and made suitable as Governor's residences. Whilst there have been some large additions made and considerable expenditure incurred on both establishments, there has been considerable expenditure also incurred in making very that radical changes in the building in which are now meeting, and I do not of think any honourable member will say that that expenditure has been unjustifiable Possibly the same thingremay hold good with respect to the buildIt is reasonable to assume that the expendito ture on' them is under the control of responsible officers of the Government, and' the not made at the dictates or the whim of conthe Governors-General or any persons conexpendinected with them.

The antiquated character of the buildings cannot be responsible for the cost of painting, because he Minister tells us that they have not been painted externally for ten years. My impression is that the place was renovated for the reception of the present occupant. The honourable member for Capricornia has done a service in bringing forward, this matter. Whilst he took his own course, I should like to know the man, however careful he may be, who does not at times say what is not appropriate. In his earnestness the honourable member went into details to show the nature of the extravagance to which he objected, and if each of us was to be hauled over the coals for every little slip, we should all be constantly at loggerheads. The honourable member said what he thought, but others do not care to do so, although they knew what he was driving at.

I agree with him that large sums of money are being expended upon the maintenance of the grounds attached to the Vice-Regal establishments in Sydney and Melbourne. Surely £1,050 is a fair sum to expend upon the grounds attached to Government the House, Sydney. There are various other charges which seem to be excessive. In this connection I might instance the matter of lighting. When balls are held at Government House, it is customary to suspend Chinese lanterns in the trees for the purpose of enabling the guests who are unfamiliar with the grounds to readily find each other. I do not think that the Commonwealth should be called upon to defray expenditure in that connection. Then I note that there is an annual recurring expenditure pf £ 3 0 or £ 5 0 in respect of f china and glass.",119

It is all very well to criticise the words which a man may use in expressing himself, and to attach, perhaps,, a wrong meaning to those words. I chanced to be absent from the Chamber when the honourable member spoke, but 1I have no hesitation in saying that in directing attention to the growing scandal in the increasing expenditure upon the Government Houses he has rendered a distinct service to the community, for which he will receive the thanks of a majority of the electors. The Acting Treasurer has pointed out that this is a question of policy, which ought not to be discussed upon this division of the Estimates. But, unless the Government regard it as a matter of policy, very little opportunity will be afforded honourable members to take effective action. I take it that, if the posal of the honourable member for Capricornia be carried, the Government will regard it as an instruction that the present policy in regard to the maintenance of the two Government Houses should be altered. If the taxpayers of Australia are to continue paying £23,000 a year to get a Governor General to represent the Crown, in addition to maintaining the Governors of the States, the position has become a great scandal. I was surprised to hear the remarks of the Minister of Home Affairs in regard to this matter. He told us that if the grounds attached to the Vice-Regal establishments were kept in the same order as an ordinary citizen would keep his own private grounds, an expenditure of £10,000 more annually would be required. what sort of ordinary citizen does the honourable gentleman refer? I regard myself as an ordinary man, but I would not spend £10,000 in the upkeep of a garden in as many years. The maintenance of the grounds attached to the Vice-Regal establishment in Sydney costs £1,050 per annum, whilst the cost of the upkeep of the grounds attached to Government House, Melbourne, is £1,100. Yet we are assured that these grounds are not kept up to the standard which would be observed by an ordinary man. Personally, I think that the ordinary man would like to have as much money as is expended upon the maintenance of the gardens attached to the Vice-Regal establishments during one year to put into a home and garden for his life-time.

But as a result, I enter upon it with an absolutely impartial mind.' In reference to the suggestion of the honourable member for Capricornia that there should be but one Government House in Australia, I submit that my honourable friend has not given due consideration to the circumstances of pro- the case. Irrespective of whether it is a good or a bad thing, the monarchical system of Government under which we live, and to which the honourable member has never given his complete support, is a fact. The Governor General is the representative in the Commonwealth of that system, and he deserves, and must receive., proper attention. Again, we live under a Federal form of Government, and each State at times clamours for a recognition of its rights. It was a distinct understanding of the agreement arrived at by the Premiers' Conference, as a result of which New South Wales entered the Federation, that until the Seat of Government is established at. Yass-Canberra, the Parliament should meet To in ""Melbourne, and the Governor General reside in Sydney. The honourable member proposes to abolish one of the two Government Houses. I do not know whether it is suggested by my honourable friend that Government House, Melbourne, should be disestablished, or that the Vice-Regal residence in Sydney should be discontinued. In either case, a great outcry would be raised, and I do not think such a proposal ought to be entertained. I wish to say, however, that every consideration will be given to his suggestion that proper economy should be exercised, with a view to curtailing unnecessary expenditure in this connection. But the idea of closing one Government House is not within the bounds of possibility, taking into consideration the circumstances as they exist ' today.

817,Mr SINCLAIR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Moreton) [6.1 a.m.] to To my mind, the item of £200 for gratuito officers for making economic suggestions is an absolute farce. I cannot imagine for a moment that there is not a public vant who can make a valuable suggestion for the better working of the Department in which he is engaged. It appears to me that there is a barrier in the way of such suggestions reaching the proper quarter. I know of one or two suggestions which have been turned down by an officer of higher grade. I do not know if the Department is, as the Minister has stated, submerged in a sea of red tape. Mr KING O'MALLEY - It will soon be reformed. Things are coming all right.",121
818,Mr SINCLAIR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I am very pleased to hear from the honourable member that the Department is to be reformed. Year after year £200 has been voted for gratuities to officers who have suggested useful alterations, but the vote has not been taken ad« vantage of to any appreciable extent. I believe that last year, or the year previously, £ 2 was paid to an officer' for a suggestion which he had made. A suggestion which evokes a gratuity of that amount is not worth making. It is a pity that the vote cannot be increased. In my opinion, the inventive genius of officers should be encouraged, and the Department should take up suggestions, which might save the country thousands of pounds.",122
819,Mr OZANNE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"If any suggestions have been turned down, they could not have been of any value.",122
820,Mr SINCLAIR,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Such suggestions can be made use of later. As the result of an investigation, I came to the conclusion that one suggestion would have been of immense value to the Department if it had been ried out,. but it was' turned down because the author went to the wrong officer in the first place. However, the Minister has assured the Committee that this matter will be remedied. Mr KIN G O'MALLEY - Everythin g is coming all right.",122
821,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Gwydir) [6.6 a.m.] This item reflects no credit on the Government. I am in a position to state that, instead of finding their inventive genius encouraged by the Department, officers have been discouraged by the manner in which their seniors have treated very valuable suggestions. In a number of cases, very valuable suggestions have been pirated by superior officers. As a member of the Postal Commission, I investigated different cases which were brought under my notice, and found that officers had ' not received even an acknowledgment of their sugges-. ser- tions. During last year valuable suggestions were made in the Department, not in one State alone, but in several States, yet no gratuities have been paid to the authors. For instance, an officer in Brisbane made a suggestion in regard to the sorting of letters there which has saved the Department scores of pounds per month. That sum was lost monthly to the revenue through letters being practically understamped. This vigilant officer suggested that a certain method of sorting should be adopted which would enable such delinquencies on the part of the public to be detected, and as the result a very large sum was saved to the Department. Inventive officers are discouraged by the harassing conditions with which they have to comply before they can reach the proper quarter with their suggestions. In some cases the paltriness of the rewards which have been granted has been an insult to the men who had spent their time in working out devices for the purpose of saving labour and more effectively performing the work of the Department. The reward has, in some instances, been declined because the amount was a degradation to the officer from whom the offer emanated and a humiliation to the person to whom it was made. A suggestion box is supposed to be kept in the Post and Telegraph Department for the reception of useful suggestions. I know well that the brains of the Department are not to be found at its head. If we do not take steps to encourage the inventive genius of public officers we shall get an inferior car- service. With a man at the head of a Department who can appreciate - the services of subordinate officers we shall get quite different results from those which are obtained when its head fails to recognise the value of any suggestions made. With a just, able, and efficient officer in charge we shall find all the members of the staff working up to his standard, but the lower the standard at the top the lower will be the standard throughout the Department. Many' officers have been denied promotion because the initiative rested with an envious superior officer. The Government are not getting the benefit of the services which it would be possible to obtain if merit were rewarded when it was discovered. I am glad to again see an item on the Estimates for this purpose, and I hope that next year we shall not be told that the money has not been expended. . Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin Minister of Home Affairs) [6.15 a.m.] I have made a note of the suggestions of the honourable member for Gwydir, and will see that the matter is thoroughly investigated. If there are any officers in Department of Home Affairs who have the ability to suggest improved methods they will not be denied a reward. I know that in America big firms and banks in which I was ernploj'ed offered a reward. If a messenger or the man who cleaned the mat could suggest a valuable improvement he was made a partner in .the business or bank later.",122
822,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Maribyrnong) [6.16 a.m.] - I am pleased to hear that the Minister intends to look into this matter. I am aware that when a lad enters the service of a big firm in America he is told at once that if he can suggest anything which will save time and money he will have a chance of going ahead. I should like to see a similar incentive offered to our public servants. Let genius come to the front. I notice an item in connection with the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau. Somehow or other the word "" Bureau "" is like an awkward fishbone, it sticks in my throat. I prefer the designation "" Agricultural Department."" The Commonwealth has control of all oversea exports.",123
823,Mr CHARLTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Thes e Estimates not contain an item for the purpose, but show that last year £250 was appropriated.",123
824,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member is right. I hope that the Minister will take this matter into his serious consideration. In view of the work which will have to be carried on in the Northern Territory and elsewhere it is desirable that the Commonwealth should lose no time in instituting a well-equipped Department. We are asked to vote ^4,000 to cover the expenses in connection with the site of the Federal Capital. I wish to enter a further protest against the selection of Yass Canberra. When larger items are submitted in years to come I believe that the opposition to that site will be stronger. I think, with the honourable member for New England, that we should proceed by very easy stages in spending public money on the site. I trust that the day will arrive when the people of the Commonwealth will awake to their interests and select a more national and more suitable site for its capital.  [6.19 a.m.] - I intend to take every available opportunity to express my disapproval of the expenditure of public money on what I consider to be a most unsuitable place in the the Commonwealth for the Federal Capital. Mr KING O'MALLEY - This money has been voted and spent.  asked now to approve of the item. I shall not consent to the expenditure of any money at Yass-Canberra. I pointed out recently, in discussing this subject, that according to highly qualified officers in the New South Wales Lands Office, the land in the catchment area of the Federal Territory is worth only from 2s. 6d. to 5s. per acre. Mr Scrivener has estimated the value of the land at no more than 2s. 6d. per acre. The Minister of Home Affairs is, I am sure, convinced in his own mind that Yass-Canberra is a most unsuitable site. In fact, it is about the last place in Australia where public money . should be spent. The site was selected by a disreputable form of trick.",123
825,Mr WEBSTER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Would the honourable. member call it a confidence trick?  T know of no words which could adequately express my opinion of the way in which Yass-Canberra was selected. I do should like to know whether honourable members would be prepared to submit this question to a referendum of the New South Wales people. I should be quite satisfied to abide by the result if that were done. But I do not believe that those who now ""barrack"" for Yass-Canberra reflect the opinion of the people of New South Wales. I often have opportunities of meeting persons from that State, and have found them generally oppos'ed to Yass-Canberra as a site for the Federal Capital. It has been estimated that the water supply will not be sufficient for a population of more than 50,000 people. Surelv a city of such dimensions will not satisfy the aspirations of the Nationalists of Australia. Even Washington, with its population of 300,000, does not satisfy the people of the United States. But Nationalism is, after all, about the last word that ought to be connected with the selection of Yass-Canberra. Those who support the site do so from the most parochial stand-point. The ex-Premier of New South Wales, Mr Wade, was chiefly instrumental in the selection of the site, and he is an ex-Premier today largely because of the parochial view which he took of matters of this kind.",123

If the Victorian members had been loyal to their State the site would not to. have been chosen. Another reason why I object to the expenditure of public money in Yass-Canberra is that I have not had opportunity of visiting the site. I should have liked to visit it not only in the springflection time, when perhaps it looks its best, also in the winter and the summer, so as to form an opinion of it in all aspects.

At Newthere is an office for old-age pension purposes, which is run in conjunction with the State invalid pension. The officer in charge is a very good man.

But when they have been dealt with there no information is forwarded to him as to what has been done. The applicant, after a little while perhaps, receives a notification that the pension has not been or that the maximum amount has decreased, but the officer in charge is furnished with no information which he One can supply to applicants. He is absolutely ignored. Surely, however, facilities ought to be afforded for applicants to obtain information on the spot as to why a pension has been refused or reduced, or as to whether it has been granted. At present, applicants, being troubled in mind as to what has occurred, make an appeal to their Parliamentary representatives. I have had cases of persons who travelled 50 or 60 miles to consult me about old-age pensions, and then found to their mortification that I was absent in Melbourne; but if the required inhad been sent to the officer on the spot he would have been able to supply it to applicants in the Newcastle and Maitland districts.

But I find that the Secretary to the Treasury receives, in addition to his salary of £900, an allowance of £150 as Commissioner of Pensions, whilst the Accountant receives an allowance of £100 as Assistant Commissioner of Pensions. I object strongly to the principle of multiplying offices in connection with the higher paid positions of the Service. Either these gentlemen had not their time fully occupied previously or they have not sufficient time to devote to their dual offices now. Possibly it would be inconvenient to appoint separate officers to the positions, I object strongly to the combination of offices in one man, and the multiplication ot salaries. If there is any gain in control, that gain can be obtained with more economical advantage by a distribution of offices and responsibilities. I make no reflection on the men themselves, because, so far as I have seen, they are eminently fitted for their positions. I hope, however, this is not the beginning of the concentration of offices and emoluments, because it is a system that may easily extend; and I enter my protest at the first opportunity.",124
834,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Maribyrnong) [6.41 a.m.] - At certain seasons of the year the clerks in the Old-age Pensions Department have to work considerable overtime, which, in some cases, has accumulated to about 1,100 hours. I hope the Minister will see that justice is done.",125
835,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Kalgoorlie-Actin g Treasurer and Honorary Minister) [6.42 a.m.]. - In reply to the honourable member for Hunter, I have to say that, as far as possible, the fullest information is given to all persons who make inquiries, though it may not be convenient always to give that information direct. If the information is sought through a member of Parliament it is given; but if persons call at the office they can always obtain detailed statements of the reasons why a pension has been reduced, and so forth. The point raised by the honourable member for Brisbane has been considered by the Prime Minister, and it was thought advisable to place the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act under the control of the Secretary to the Treasurer, as Commissioner. From my experience of a few months, I can say that both the Secretary to the Treasurer and his assistant can find time for this particular work; and I believe do it very satisfactorily. The matter mentioned by the honourable member for Maribyrnong has been under my notice, and I hope shortly to be able to give him the information he desires.",125
836,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Franklin) [6.44 a.m.] - I hope the Government will give earnest attention to the question raised by the honourable member for Brisbane. There is no more fatal error in administration than to make the head of one Department the controller of another; and wherever the sysfem has been tried, either in the State but or Federal service, it has resulted in disaster. The more we confine ourselves to "" one man one job "" the better it will be for the Public Service. If the duties of the Commissioner of Old-age Pensions possess any importance, they are certainly worth more than £ 1 0 0 or £ 1 5 0 a year. It would be infinitely better to employ a really capable man at a good salary to take entire charge. This would enable pensions to be more easily obtained by deserving persons, and fraud to be prevented, and would remove many difficulties of administration. The expenditure under the Old age Pensions Act is now over £2,500,000, and will, doubtless, shortly be £3.000,000 ; and it would be exceedingly good business to appoint a Commissioner apart altogether from the existing Departments.

838,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Kalgoorlie - Acting Treasurer and Honorary Minister) [6.51 a.m.] - This item is rendered necessary for two reasons. There are cases where it is desirable that a warrantee shall be paid on behalf of the pensioner, and there are other cases where the pensioner is not capable of taking care of himself, and has to be placed in a recognised institution. One institution, for instance, is associated with the Salvation Army, but, generally speaking, they are all undenominational. A payment is made for maintaining the pensioners during the period they remain in the institution; and it has been found that the system works satisfactorily.",125
839,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"A discussion arose on this question some time ago, and I understood that a promise was given in regard to prisoners who became unfit for a general hospital.",126
840,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That scarcely comes under this item, but I may explain that where hospitals are maintained by public subscription, or governmental subscription, and they accept the responsibility of providing for pensioner inmates, we do not make a second payment out of the public fund. When recipients of old-age pensions are discharged from such institutions they are entitled to pension money for twenty-eight days immediately. I agree that the public should not be called upon to pay twice for anv persons.",126
841,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Franklin) [6.54 a.m.] - I do not think the Government ought to make a profit out of the illness of any old-age pensioner. If one has to remain in the hospital, say, for six months, the Government pay him the pension for one month, and retain the pension for the five months. In my opinion, the very least the Government should do is to hand over half the pension to the hospital and the other half to the pensioner, no matter how long the period of detention may have been. It is not a creditable position the Commonwealth Government to decide that, under such circumstances, a hospital shall receive no payment. This question was discussed thoroughly some months ago; and I understood that the' almost unanimous opinion of honourable members was that the Government should not retain the pension, but should take such action as I have indicated. I hope the Government and honourable members will see that these general hospitals, which have to stand a heavy strain, and, in some cases, receive very little Government aid, shall have fair play. Mr THOMAS BROWN [6.6 a.m.] - The point raised ought to receive some consideration. In New South Wales the hospitals are supported by public subscription, plus a subsidy from the State Government on a fixed scale, and the practice, when the pensions were paid by the State, was that on a pensioner becoming an inmate, the hospital authorities .could claim a certain portion of the pension. I have spoken to several hospital managers, and they tell me that old-age pensioners would gladly pay 5s. per week for their maintenance, but that, under the present arrangement, that course is impossible if the detention in the hospital is of any considerable length. The State system works excellently, and ought to prove just as satisfactory if adopted by the Commonwealth. If the cases referred to by the honourable member for Franklin do not come within this item, as suggested by the Minister, what institutions are covered by the £5,000 ? In New South Wales there are benevolent asylums conducted by religious communities, and others that are purely public charities supported by the Government. There are such institutions_at Rookwood, Newington, Parramatta, and Liverpool; and there are thousands of inmates, who are without friends, and unable to look after themselves. Speaking from memory, I should say that these institutions cost the Government of New South Wales something like £500,000 per annum. Do the Federal Government propose to subsidize State institutions by making payments orf behalf of pensioners? It sometimes happens that inmates think they would like to live outside and get a pension, but they afterwards come to the conclusion that the inside life is best, and abandon the pension. There are some who, if they get a few shillings, give way to drink, and lose their pensions, and are comfor pelled to go into such institutions. The hospitals I have mentioned should, I think, be included in the vote for the private institutions referred to. I presume that the Government do not limit .the payment to twenty-eight days for residents in these institutions, but that it is continued as long as they remain in them. It seems to me that the same principle should apply to the hospitals, which are similar institutions, but which, in addition, provide medical treatment for their inmates.",126
842,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Kalgoorlie-Actin g Treasurer) [7.1 a.m.] - The question of the (Calare) payment of public funds to institutions of this kind involves a serious problem, which will yet have to be faced by this Parliament. The time will come when the Federal Parliament will have to take control of the care of the sick throughout Australia. That is my individual opinion of what will follow as a consequence of the legislation we are adopting. Considerable difficulty has been experienced by the Department in connection with payments to these institutions. The policy adopted so far has been that where old-age pensioners have been unable, physically, to support themselves outside, the Department has been prepared to accept the assurance of warrantees or guardians to take care of them, or to give assistance to certain institutions that are not receiving Government aid, to look after them. There is an objection, however, to giving assistance for the maintenance of old-age pensioners in hospitals or benevolent institutions towards the upkeep of which the State Governments contribute. The position of inmates of institutions established for the care of consumptives has already been brought under my notice. Consumptives are segregated in these institutions in their own interests, and also in the interests of the public, and I am of opinion that inmates of those insti- tutions should not be withdrawn from them, and allowed to mingle again with the public in order that they may receive their, pensions. Similar considerations are often associated with persons who become inmates of the institutions that participate in this vote of £5,000. We are willing to accept the obligation of assisting them in their closing days, and think that it is better that they should be looked after in one of these institutions than that they should be thrown upon the world outside. I have been in the office for only a few months, but I have tried to grasp the difficulties of the position. I may inform the Committee that we are now giving relief in this way to no less than 68,000 people, and expect, in the near future, to undertake a similar .obligation in respect of an additional 20,000. Every case is given full consideration, and though we accept the responsibility of including the institutions covered by the vote as part of the system, we cannot, at this stage, agree to the inclusion of hosDitals under this grant.",126
843,Mr CANN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Nepean) [7.5 a.m.] - There are three large asylums in my electorate, in which there are some 3,000 inmates, and I should like to say that those inmates should be allowed to come out of the institutions if they desire to do so.",127
844,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Thos e institutions are whollv supported by the Government.,127
845,Mr CANN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The honourable member should remember that all the hospitals in New South Wales receive a Government subsidy of £ T for £ 1 . If this monev is to be granted to these institutions I think that the Feedral Government should take over the control of them. There are 1,200 inmates at the Rookwood Asylum, and there is a farm there. All the inmates who can work are obliged to do so, and they produce certain commodities, and thus assist in the maintenance of the .institution. One of the asylums in my electorate is almost self-supporting. The question involved is a very large one, and we cannot complain if the Government are not prepared to fully consider it at the present juncture. I think we should do what we can to improve the condition of the old people in these institutions as much as possible. They should not be regarded as prisoners, but it is found that if a man gets into one of these asylums it is very difficult for him to get out of it again. We should make it as easy as possible for people to withdraw from these asylums and go into one of the institutions, mentioned by the Minister. Several former inmates have left the Liverpool Asylum and gone to the Industrial Home at Manly and to the Salvation Army Home there. Under the system adopted they pay 8s. of their pension to the institution in which they are looked after and keep the other 2s. for themselves. It is well that they do, because perhaps the most miserable being on the earth is the man who has not a penny in his pocket.",127
846,Mr CHARLTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Hunter) [7.10 a.m.]. - We are all disposed to do what we can to assist the aged and infirm, but this is a. very big question, and the Commonwealth has at present enough on its shoulders without adding to the burden. We have done remarkably well during this session. The Minister has stated that already 68,000 people are receiving old-age pensions, and there will shortly be another 20,000 in receipt of pensions. Honourable members should consider the drain that must be on the revenue of the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, it is going a little too far to suggest that we should also undertake the maintenance of the inmates of charitable institutions.",127
847,Mr FRAZER,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"That responsibility would involve an expenditure of at least £r.t;oo.ooo. "" Mr Charlton - I think it would involve considerably more expenditure. I feel sure that the State Governments would be only too glad to hand over the institutions for that amount. In maintaining the charitable institutions the State Governments are in a better position than is the Federal Government, because they have not to incur the heavy expenditure on old age pensions. The question is whether it is fair that when an old-age pensioner goes into an institution the institution should receive the pension.",127
848,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The Government stop the pension in such cases, except for one month.",128
849,Mr CHARLTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The State Government of New South Wales used to do the same thing. I think that at present we are doing as much as we can be expected to do, and we should wait to see how things will go before we undertake to consider the maintenance of the inmates of charitable institutions.

850,Mr FENTON,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Maribyrnong) [7.14 a.m.] -- I wish to ask whether the Government have considered the advisableness of having their own printing office.

Division 40 (Advance to the Treasurer), £600,000. - Mr Frazer (Kalgoorlie - Acting Treasurer) [7.16 a.m.] - I move That the proposed vote be reduced by ^350,000. It was anticipated at the time when the vote of £600,000 was set down that it would be necessary to make provision for certain payments on account of the construction of a cruiser. These payments have now been incurred by special vote, and consequently an advance of £250,000 will be sufficient. Motion agreed to. Proposed vote, as amended, agreed to.

The Leader of the Opposition stated that he would be prepared to help me to get through the Treasury Estimates. The idea then was that we should be able to finish the Treasury Estimates at a reasonable hour last night. Suppose the debate went on till this day week or this day fortnight, would it still be postponed, and for what reason ? The objection which the honourable member for Ballarat, and some of his followers, had was to the harvester item. I am willing to postpone that item until later, but we must go on with the rest of the Estimates.",128

858,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"West Sydney-Actin g Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [7.23 a.m.] - I have already explained that the Leader of the Opposition offered to help me to get through the Treasury Estimates, and I was very glad to get his help. We contemplated finishing at a reasonable hour-certainl y before midnight - and also contemplated finishing all thf business, and going on with the Supplementnrv Estimates at the latest after tea to-night. Consequently that arrangement has to be gone on with.",128
859,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Calare) [7.24 a.m.] - I would call the attention ot the Acting Prime Minister to the fact that, whilst he was resting, a good part of the time of the Committee was taken up by a debate initiated and carried on by honourable members on the Government side. The Opposition are not responsible for what the honourable member seems to indicate as his reason for not standing by the agreement.",129
860,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Will not the honourable member take my word? Apparently he takes the word of the honourable member for Franklin, who says the agreement was not as I say it was.",129
861,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I do not know what the arrangements were, but if the understanding with the Opposition was as the Acting Prime Minister says, then the Opposition who went away are not responsible for keeping honourable members here all this time, the debate having been initiated and carried on for a long time by honourable members who sit behind the Government.",129
862,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Not wholly. The honourable member for Wimmera spoke till nearly midnight, and I do not know how long the honourable member for Franklin spoke.",129
863,Mr THOMAS BROWN,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"The debate was carried on almost wholly by honourable members on the Government side. I am not in the confidence of the Opposition, nor of the Government in this matter, and this is the first I have heard about an arrangement, but if an honourable arrangement has been made. I want to see it fairly and honestly carried out.",129
864,Mr HALL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"Werriwa) [7.26 a.m.] - I endorse the views of the honourable member for Calare. The Acting Prime Minister's explanation simply bears out the understanding that we have gained from the honourable member for Franklin, the sole representative of the Opposition present. Obviously there was an understanding that we should' go through the Treasury Estimates, and then adjourn until half-past 10 this morning. We are now told that that understanding is to bedeparted from, because we did not get away by 12 o'clock las* night. I do not know that many honourable members on this side expected to get away by then. The Leader of the Opposition did nothing to prevent the understanding being carried out. has not been carried out, it is not the fault of the Opposition. If they were satisfied to let the Estimates as far as the Treasury go through, they were under no obligation to stop here.",129

866,Mr HALL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,He was one of our own members. I suggest that when an agreement is made it should be honourably carried out. I say that we are not carrying out theagreement as it has been explained by the Acting Prime Minister himself. It is not right to try to put the blame on the Opposition.,129
867,Mr OZANNE,FEDERAL CAPITAL,Nobod y is blaming the Opposition; we want to do the work.,129
868,Mr HALL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"We have done the work, as the Opposition agreed before they went home, that it should be done. If it was a mistake to agree to adjourn after the Treasury Estimates were passed, it is not our mistake, but the mistake of those who made the agreement. I hold that it was not a mistake, but any man who takes up last night's Hansard, from the time the agreement was made, and measures up the time taken by members of the Opposition and that taken by the supporters of the Government, will find that we have outtalked them by over three to one.",129

870,Mr HALL,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"They had a perfect right to go away if they were satisfied tolet the business go through up to a certain stage. We lose nothing by carrying out our understandings honourably, and , from the Acting 1 Prime Minister's own statements, it is obvious that an agreement was made that when we got through the Treasury Estimates the House should' adjourn until half past 10 o'clock.",129
871,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"West Sydney-Actin g Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [7.31 a.m.] - Some expression of opinion seems to be called for after the absolutely unprovoked criticism of the honourable member for Werriwa, who speaks about our duty to honourably carry out agreements, as if no other man than himself had the faculty of doing so. The honourable member appears to have taken upon himself at this hour of the morning the post of censor, of morals for the Government and Parliament generally. He defends the position of the honourable member for Franklin, who is quite able to defend himself, and If it just as likely to get every consideration from us by reason of his own statements as in any other way. I most strongly sent any statement that I am not honoron ably carrying out an agreement.",129
872,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FEDERAL CAPITAL,The honourable memkeeping ber is not..,130
873,Mr HUGHES,FEDERAL CAPITAL,"I have not prolonged the discussion for much more than a moment. I have not done anything to mitigate criticism, or to fan position. Every honourable member has had an opportunity, so far as I am consome cerned, to say what he pleased. I made a distinct statement to the House that were to wind up the business of the session this week. I am charged with carrying out that undertaking if it sible. The Leader of the Opposition is at one with me in that desire, and the beginning and the end of the agreement that made was that he would assist me in the way I have stated. He said there was desire on the part of his party to discuss matters in connection with Trade and Customs Estimates postponed. toms, and I say now that if there be item to which the honourable member Franklin can point, in addition to the harvester item, that he wants postponed, shall postpone it. Beyond that, I ought not to be asked to go, and I venture to that if the Leader of the here he would thoroughly agree with me. Since the honourable member for Franklin is the sole representative of the Opposition present, I ask him to suggest any item that division 41. he thinks ought to be postponed, and shall be postponed.",130

It comes with a bad grace from honourable members to find fault with the Leader of the House on this matter, because he .has given us assurance that he only agreed Leader of the Opposition to try Treasury Estimates through by 11 o'clock. We have been much longer, but it is - correct to say that the debate has been carried on by one side only. The honourable member for Parramatta took up as [237]- 2 remuch time as any other honourable member the Estimates. It is unfair to say that any honourable member was responsible for us here, because every honourable member is entitled to the fullest! latitude. The honourable member for Lang spoke on one occasion at some length, and the honourable member for Franklin spoke on difanybody's opferent occasions.",130

In reply, I have to request that you will inform the House of Representatives that their Address was duly laid before His Majesty, who was pleased to receive it very graciously, and to command that His thanks should be returned to them for their message ' of unswerving loyalty and devotion to His Majesty's Person and Government, and that they should be informed that, as you will have learnt from my despatch No. 325 of the rst of September, their wishes have already been met by the passing of an Act by the Imperial Parliament, by which the expressions in the Royal Declaration to which exception is taken, have been removed.

898,Mr ROBERTS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Adelaide) [7.51 a.m.]. - I approve of the suggestion that you, sir, should leave the chair for a time, to enable us to get some refreshment; but as Government supporters have been here all night, assisting to deal with the Estimates, it is not fair that they should be called on later to sit until 10.30 p.m., or even midnight, to meet the convenience of others who have spent the night in bed, and will come here fresh at 10.30 this morning. I suggest to the Leader of the House that he should take into consideration the advisability ot adjourning this evening at 6 or 6.30. We have already been sitting continuously for twenty-two hours, and it is not fair that we should have to contend later with honourable members who have shown an utter disregard for the necessities of public business, but by going home have kept themselves physically fit for further exertion.",132
899,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Gwydir) [7.53 a.m.]. do not think that anything is to be - gained by pushing on as we are doing. Generally speaking, both in Federal and State politics, it is recognised, when a House has sat for twenty-two hours, that members cannot stand a much longer strain. This is a brutal way of transacting the business of the country. Measures are being bludgeoned through at the sacrifice of health and mental capacity. Some honourable members seem to be very anxious for the close of the session, but it has not been a very long one, having lasted only about five months, and Christmas is some way off yet. I do not think that we should be desirous of closing the session regardless of whether the business in hand has been properly discussed.",132
900,Mr CANN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It must be remembered that we have been sitting four hours longer every day than other Parliaments"" sit. I should be willing to remain in Melbourne for two months more, if necessary.",132
901,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In any case, the session has not been a long one, and there is a long recess ahead of us. The desire to go into recess should not be made an excuse for shortening discussion which is necessary in the public interest. The discussion of the Estimates is the recognised opportunity to deal with matters pertaining to the welfare of the country, and to rush them through in twenty-four or twenty-six hours would be unprecedented and needless. The Acting Prime Minister tells us that he has made a promise to close the session this week.",132
902,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The discussion is quite irregular, as there is no motion before the Chair. If it is to continue, a motion must be moved.",132
903,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I havefinishedwhat I wish to say, and would have said it in Committee had I not been rather curtly interrupted by the Chairman, who, wrongly I hold, ruled me out of order. I regret that the Government is prepared to overwork its supporters, who remained here all night to keep .a quorum while the members of the Opposition retired to their couches, and sought the rest which nature demands.",132

905,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Ballarat) [10.30 a.m.]. I desire to call attention to the item in division 3, "" Expenses in connection with ' Harvester ' case, £ 5 0 0 . "" Perhaps the Minister will state the reason for its inclusion ?",133
906,Mr HUGHES,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,West Sydney-Actin g Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [10.32 a.m.] - The item represents costs incurred by unions of persons engaged in the manufacture of harvesters in defending an .action brought against the Commonwealth by one Barger,133
907,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"There were two cases, and Barger's was one of them.",133
908,Mr HUGHES,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The men were very much interested in the case, because it involved a possible deduction of wages, and they were put to considerable expense and loss of time. The amount of £500 has been placed on the Estimates to cover expenses incurred by them in defending the action. In my opinion it is not fair that private citizens should have' to incur expenditure in testing the constitutionality of a Commonwealth Statute. They might, of course, be properly called upon to do so when the question of the validity of a Statute is determined incidentally to a decision in regard to any wrong that may have been done, or any damage that may have been incurred. These people, however, did not institute the action, and were in no way responsible for the unconstitutionality of the Act. They were seeking simply to protect themselves in receiving what the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court had declared to be a fair and reasonable wage. I do not think that the expenses are excessive. ter has been looked into, and it is considered only fair that the unions should be reimbursed to this extent.",133
909,Mr DEAKI N,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Ballarat) [10.35 a.m.]. - The Acting Prime Minister will find it impossible to justify this proposed vote on any ground short of that which he has partially outlined to the Committee. Unless it is to be laid down as a principle that the constitutionality of Commonwealth Statutes is always to be determined at the public expense there can be no warrant for a precedent of this kind - Nothing short, of an intention on the part of the Government that this shall become a practice in the Commonwealth-and I shall not deal with the enormous cost that such a policy would involve-coul d justify a donation of this character. I doubt if anything could justify it in this particular instance. The case in question was not of the subnature described by the Attorney-General. I had a keen interest in . it, and sympathize entirely with the ill-advised union that voluntarily and without necessity entered into these proceedings. The members of the union endeavoured to justify their action by a petition to this House that bristled with misstatements of facts as well as with mistaken inferences drawn from those misstatements. I do not desire to enter into the details unless it should become necessary, and shall confine myself to the narrowest possible view of . the question, dealing with it solely from the stand-point of its importance as a precedent. If such a precedent were established the first duty of this Parliament would be to consider the host of cases involving constitutional interpretations that have already been decided at the expenseof private citizens. If this union is entitled to be recouped, the employers are also entitled to be reimbursed their expenses, and so will be the host of others who may in the future be involved in such proceedings. On the spur of the moment, I recollect no country where this practiceis in force; yet, unless we take' up thisextreme and extravagant course, there car* be no defence of this transaction. The circumstances of the law in general are of necessity such that private citizens in the course of their private disputes put in question many public enactments. Often, as the Acting Prime Minister himself has admitted, the constitutional aspect may be only one phase of a case crowded with The mat- other considerations.",133
910,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Generally a Government enforces its own laws, and does not ask unions to enforce them for it.",133
911,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That is true, but utterly irrelevant. No one asked this union to enforce the law. There was no need for it to enter into the litigation. The Act was framed to cast upon the employers the burden of justifying themselves at their own expense. not touched upon that point, but if the principle on which the Government have decided to vote this sum of £500 is that which the Attorney-General has mentioned it is certainly extraordinary that no item appears on the Estimates to reimburse the employers. They had no choice in this matter,, but were obliged to go before the Court in order to defend themselves. On them was cast the responsibility of proving that they were paying fair wages and observing fair hours of employment. They could not escape from that obligation since the law provided that unless they satisfied the Court they should be subject to the payment of an Excise duty. In this instance, the only party to the suit who was compelled to go before the Court, and compelled, to incur expense, receives no consideration, although the principle enunciated by the Acting Prime Minister must embrace both sides.",133
912,Mr WISE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Did not the employers secure a judgment with costs ?,134
913,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In one case, but even if they did, the costs allowed would not cover all the expenses incurred.",134
914,Mr WISE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,But they would be costs as between party and party.,134
915,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It is quite possible that the costs that have been paid by the employers represent several, times the amount paid to them under, the order of the CourtBut whatever that was, a similar proportion of the costs of the. employers ought first of all to have been provided for in these Estimates, if this principle is to be adopted, because the employers were put upon their defence..",134
916,Mr HUGHES,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Who settled the validity of the Commonwealth Statute in question?,134
917,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The employer at first did not question it. The honourable member is evidently mistaken. The employer came before the Court, in the first instance, wages. not to question the validity of the Statute,but because he was required to do so by the Act. He was required by the Act to prove that he was paying what the President of the Court considered were fair wages and observing fair conditions. There was a subsequent proceeding to test the validity of the Act, but in the first instance the. employer was obliged to go to the - Court, and, therefore, his. costs ought to have been considered'. In neither case was there any demand upon the union to go before the Court, or I have to take any part in these proceedings. I have been informed-althoug h this is an arguable point-that the appearance of the union was not of the slightest assistance in the determination of the constitutional question. It was a voluntary act of the union, which came forward, without the pressure of legal necessity. Its members were badly advised. I do not propose to deal in detail with the petition, although statement after statement in it can be authoritatively disposed of. It was one of my obligations last year to inform myself of all the details of this case, and I did so by a reference to those engaged in it, and also by a careful examination of every particular relating to it. The general effect of .the petition is that which I have stated. It contains statements as to the incidence of taxation that are quite incorrect. There is the further statement that as the result of their efforts the Commonwealth was entitled to receive £20,000. It was never so entitled, and did not receive a penny. One of the arguments used in the petition is that since the Commonwealth obtained £20,000 as the result of the action of the employees, it ought surely to pay the agents responsible for its recovery. As a matter of fact, we did not receive a farthing, and had no reason to thank the union which, for its own purposes, thought fit to intervene in the first case. The evidence that it brought forward was not material to the constitutional point. The further statement contained in the petition that, but for the action taken by the employees, this success could not have been achieved, is. also erroneous. Then there was a plea for back wages, and other matters too irrelevant to deal with..",134
918,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,What ! Back wages unimportant ?,134
919,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"There were no back When, unfortunately for the policy with which I was then concerned, it was declared that the Commonwealth had no power to' impose these conditions or in default the payment of Excise, an application was made by the men for the wages that would have been paid them had the law been valid, as from the date that it came into force. That represented 1 what they called "" back wages'.""",134
920,Mr SCUIXIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Did they not prove the question of power?,134
921,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,No . I am informed that their contribution to the deciding case was of no value whatever as to constitutional powers.,135
922,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Who gave the honourable member that information ?,135
923,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Thos e who were engaged in it. The Agricultural Implement Makers' Employes Union intervened in regard to the wages actually paid, and the hours actually worked, and had that case been decided upon those grounds it could have said with truthfulness that theevidence which it contributed was of some value. .But the constitutional case was decided upon entirely different grounds.",135
924,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Was not the claim of the union a fair one ?,135
925,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,No . It had no relevance to the legal point upon which the Act was declared to be invalid.,135
926,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Has not the payment of back wages a bearing on the case?,135
927,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"There were no back wages due to the men. As a matter of fact, they had lost no wages. The position was that they were unable to obtain something which Parliament had endeavoured to give them because the construction of the Constitution did not permit it. The decision of the High Court upon this matter came with a great - deal of surprise to the Government of the day, which had acted on the advice of one of our most eminent lawyers, and after the fullest and most careful consideration. The question which had *o be determined was whether the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act was not ultra vires of the Constitution. Any question as to the wages which ought to have been paid or the hours which ought to have been worked under that Statute, if it had been declared constitutional, was immaterial to the question of the constitutionality of the Act itself. The Agricultural Implement Makers' Employes Union came into the first case of its own accord, and without solicitation of any kind. It came forward in its own interests to substantiate its case, and its interference might have been of value if the supposed law could have been declared to be constitutional in that case. But, upon a later appeal to the High Court, the supposed law was declared to be beyond the competence of this Parliament to enact. If every person who seeks to take advantage of a supposed law is to be entitled to his costs we shall be committed to the principle which the Acting Prime Minister has laid down - today. We should have to discharge, at the public expense, all costs which may be incurred in similar cases in the future as well as all costs which have already been incurred in such cases. We can have no special objection to this union receiving £500 of the public money if the principle is to be applied all round. Of course, I should resist any such proposal on the ground of principle, and because its adoption would plunge the Commonwealth into a. financial responsibilitv which it cannot afford to bear. We must recollect that occasionally Acts which are perfectly constitutional in their aim prove to be imperfectly drawn, although the imperfection may escape the scrutiny of the law officers of the Crown, and lawyers in general, for some considerable time. But eventually, when the law comes before the Court, and a decision is given which discloses, its imperfection, that renders illegal what has for some time been supposed to be legal. These are hard and cruel experiences, but they have never yet received financial consideration at our hands, for the reason that if we once established such a precedent we should embark upon a bottomless gulf. It would be impossible to determine the liability of the Commonwealth. If the principle be once affirmed, similar demands for payment from the exchequer must appear in every Appropriation Bill. Under a Federal system, opportunities continually arise for challenging the validity of new laws. We all recognise that there is a fixed radius within which the Commonwealth may act. When it goes beyond that radius its legislation must be set aside. That is the very condition upon which a Federation rests, and it cannot be abolished without abolishing the Federal principle. Any Government with unlimited powers of legislation must be a Unitary Government, that is the antithesis of a Federal Government. The precise point at which the Federal and .State spheres cross each other is often hard to fix. If that is to determine the Commonwealth's responsibilities at any time to persons who of their own accord force themselves into the legal arena and are mulcted in costs, we shall be face to face with a very serious condition of things. If only the sum of £500 were involved in this matter, it would scarcely be worth my while to occupy the time of honourable members in discussing it. But the payment of that sum will establish a precedent, opening up vistas of costly possibilities to the Commonwealth. Sir WILLLIA M LYNE (Hume) [10.55 a.m.] - I should like to say a few words upon this question, seeing that I was responsible for the passing of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act. It is nonsense for the honourable member for Ballarat to talk glibly of this particular case as an ordinary one. We know perfectly well that it was an extraordinary case, and that the decision which was given upon it by the High Court was not expected by the Ministry of the day. At the time, I asked the then Prime Minister whether he could not submit a case for the opinion of the High Court before it was actually taken into Court. I thought that we ought to be able to get an expression of opinion as to whether the Commonwealth had power to enact that legislation. But the honourable member for Ballarat refused to do so. Then the employers objected to pay the wages directed by the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and naturally the Agricultural Implement Makers' Employes Union desired to be represented at the hearing, so that it might insure that case was fought properly. When the honourable member for Ballarat declares' that there were no back wages due to the men because the Act was declared to be unconstitutional I would remind him that it was anticipated that back wages were due to them; it was only because of the decision of the High Court that a technical position was created. Subsequently I wished to place a sum on the Estimatesand so did other Ministers-for the purpose of defraying the legal costs of the union. But the honourable member for Ballarat would not allow that to be done. gratulate the Government upon having taken action in this matter, and upon having secured the passage through this House of a Judiciary Bill which will enable them to ascertain the opinion of the High Court upon any similar measure in the future without recourse to legal proceedings.",135
928,Mr HUGHES,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It is the first Statute which attempts to give effect to the new Protection.,136
929,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Exactly . Regarding the statement of the honourable member for Ballarat that the payment of these costs would constitute a precedent which would govern the future, my reply is that it would do nothing of the kind. hold that the case was one in which all the expenses incurred should be borne by the Commonwealth, inasmuch as the question at issue was one involving an interpretation of the Constitution. Whenever there is a doubt as to what the Constitution really means it is the duty of the Commonwealth to defray all the expenses incidental to securing an authoritative decision. For every reason which it is possible to enumerate, it is proper to pay these costs, but I do not think it would be proper to pay costs in all, or, indeed, in any trivial cases. If any person chooses to go into Court and raise issues of a trivial character, let him abide by the position which he has created. This is the most important decision we have ever had on the interpretation of the Constitution.",136
930,Mr HUGHES,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,At the instance of a number of grossly underpaid employees.,136
931,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The employees in the industry were not paid as they should have been. The intention of the law was that they should be properly paid. Although, technically, they had no claim to be recouped their costs, still, morally, they had. When the employers got the protection, they should have shared that the advantage with their employees in the form of higher wages. That is not so much the case when a mistake is made in the interpretation of the Electoral Act by an officer of the Commonwealth Government, and the result is a second election. There have been several cases of that kind. There was great objection to the payment of the expenses of the honourable member for Riverina, and one or two honourable members on the other side of the House. I took the responsibility of putting an item on the Estimates for the purpose, but that is not so strong a case as one involving the inI conterpretation of the Constitution, which is, of course, the groundwork of everything that we do. I hope that, in the future, we shall be able to obtain a decision of the High Court before any large issue of this kind has to be fought out. There was a case heard recently in Sydney with regard to the boot trade. Nearly all the lawyers in the State were, I think, engaged for about a fortnight or three weeks, perhaps longer. I could not understand what they were driving at, nor do I think that very many persons can even now.",136
932,Mr ARCHIBALD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Do they know themselves ?,136
933,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"They got a I decision in connection with the apprentices, but I do not know if they got a decision in favour of all the employees.",136
934,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,All the parties won a moral victory.,137
935,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes , and it cost .a great deal of money. The Judiciary Bill, which was passed the other night, will prevent anything of .that kind taking place in the future if the Government do their duty. Again I congratulate the Government on the step which they have taken. It is the only righteous step which could be taken towards any person who has had to suffer the loss of a great deal of money through the laches of the Government, because, in my opinion, it is the duty of the latter to have all questions of constitutionality settled, and to take the responsibility. I can see that a flame has been started over this question by the law3^ers, which is likely to increase much. Not being a lawyer, I can speak common sense, and with some force, because I was the originator of .the Act, and know what its object was. It was to protect the manufacturers, and, at the same time, to secure good wages to the employees. That being the foundation of everything in connection with this matter, and having obtained such an important decision, I cannot understand why the technicalities of the law should influence this Parliament not to be just. I hope that it will do very fair and reasonable justice, by paying the expenses incurred in consequence of its legislation.",137
936,Mr GLYNN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Angas) [11.5 a.m.] - Un like the honourable member for Hume, I am a lawyer, and so I suppose I shall have to indulge in a little uncommon sense. There was a deputation to me on this question when I happened to be Attorney-General. I confess I had a good deal of sympathy with the claim when the application was made by Mr Sutch. I think that Mr Wilson was with him, and other representatives of the Labour party. Three Governments have been in power since the date of the first application. Evidently the first Governments had some hesitation as to whether they could establish a precedent under which other applications might be made. I looked through the papers which were in the Trade and Customs Department. I am not sure, but I think that the honourable member for Hume was in charge of the Department at the time.",137
937,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I was in office, and I wanted a case stated for the High Court.",137
938,Mr GLYNN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The costs had been incurred, and nothing had been done. Evidently the Ministers, with that very great care for a principle in these matterswhich ought to actuate them, hesitated.. However keen their sympathies may have been in favour of the employees, they hesitated to make a grant of the amounts which had. been applied for. I saw Mr Sutch and others; they stated that heavy costs had been incurred in connection with bringing about the administration of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act.",137
939,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I suppose that the. honourable member will admit that a bill for £500 would not be at all excessive.,137
940,Mr GLYNN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In the circumstances, I do not think that it would. So far as I can remember, the costs were alleged to be much more than that. I could not get particulars, but only a general statement that a considerable amount of expense had ibeen incurred in connection with the alleged administration of the Act.",137
941,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Would not the honourable member pay the costs of the other side, too?",137
942,Mr GLYNN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I have not finished my remarks. The Act came into force on the 26th October, 1906. The employers must have an opportunity to make an application to the Court to declare that the wages were fair and reasonable within the meaning of the Act. They could not have had that opportunity unless time were afforded' to them in consequence of the Government, through Mr Justice O'Connor, declaring in May, 1907, that proceedings to recover the full amount of the duty of £ 1 2 per machine would be suspended, until an opportunity was given to the employers to show to the Court that the wages paid were fair and reasonable within the meaning of the Act. Applications were begun, and extended over a considerable time. Some of them were pending for manymonths. The chief application, I think, of these was made by MCKay and Company for a certificate, and on that a principle was: laid down by Mr Justice Higgins, which generally has been adopted, and very properly adopted, as the measure of what ought to be the standard from which restart in giving wages to employees. Inthat application the employers necessarily were represented, because each of them had to apply for a certificate, and be represented, by permission of the Court, bycounsel in many cases. I was in some cases myself, and we recommended that the parties should meet, and luckily a fair adjustment took place in Adelaide without any litigation. The employees thought that it would be rather unfair to them if , while the hearing of the application was pending., and the points of view of the employers were being put, there was no one to represent their view. The Commonr wealth did not intervene. It was said that they had no right to intervene, nor had the employees any such right, but the - Court would allow them to intervene if asked to do so. There is no doubt that if the Commonwealth wished to intervene against the issue of a certificate, in order to put the opposite point of view, or to criticise the application made, the Court would permit a general appearance on the, part of the Commonwealth-, which, would, probably, have acted in the interests of the employees.",137
943,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Does the honourable member think that a fair decision could have been obtained without both parties being, represented ?",138
944,Mr GLYNN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"On the whole, I think that it was expedient that there should be some representation, so that the statements made might be criticised or the opposite point of view put. My impression is that the Commonwealth might very well have intervened in some cases in which a standard would be laid down for guidance. The costs were incurred, I must assume, in connection with the application for a certificate, because the employees were not' represented on the question of the validity of the Act. The case which was tested was The King v. Barger, and the Commonwealth appeared as litigant beca'tise it had sued MCKay for duties to the amount of £20,000, and another firm for penalties under the Act, in order that the test might be applied'. The Commonwealth had its counsel, and the matter was thoroughly threshed out. I must assume, I repeat, that the costs were incurred in connection with the application. That is the point. As it has been very well done by the Leader of the Opposition, I do not want to examine the statements in the petition. Many of them are incorrect, as general statements usually are. But that ought not to prejudice the merits of the application. I speak now as. the result of an examination which was made by the Law Department Either in the. torney-General's Department, or in that of the Minister of Trade and Customs, there is a general statement against the application as the result of an examintion of the conditions by the law officers. I do not know who is to get the costs. I do not know whether they have already been paid, or whether part of them has been paid by the employees; but the costs which are asked for-and they are certainly not over the mark-ar e part of the costs which were incurred in connection with putting the employee's' point of view on the application, and not, as assumed by the honourable member for Hume, in testing the validity of the Act- a matter with which they have had nothing to do. The danger of the whole matter-and it was that' which led successive Governments to refuse the application, or to hesitate about acceding to it until the present Government put an item on the E'stimatesf-wa s in establishing a precedent.",138
945,Mr TARR,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,A very good one.,138
946,Mr GLYNN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I do not know. I did not believe in the precedent of paying elec-' toral expenses, which were not great. A new law may be framed to apply to future cases, but I think it is wrong to establish a precedent to apply to the past, especially to members, of Parliament who are interested in the matter. For that reason I did not exhibit sympathy with the principle. The danger of the whole matter is that we may have applications hereafter from the employers, who were concerned in this litigation. If youT>ase the application, as the honourable member for Hume has done, on the allegation that the costs were incurred in testing the validity of the Act, which they were not, then' by consequence all costs incurred by theemployers in the matter, because they were vitally interested, will have to be paid. I do not know, therefore, how many thousand' pounds will not he legitimately asked for' by them. But that does' not seem' to me to be the whole case. The application relates, not to costs incurred in testing the validity of the Act, but to costs incurred by the employees in appearing to criticise the facts as put by the applicants. There seems to me to be a nearer approach to justice in their demands than there, would be if they were based on an application' simply to test the validity of the Act. I had a great deal of sympathy with the applicants, but what made me hesitate in declining to recommend that they should At- be paid was that it would establish a precedent under which we should not know where we were going to stop. I think it was the duty of the Government to tell what costs, if this item be passed, may have to be paid in connection with the plication of the employers. word "" m a y "" deliberately. I shall not say that we "" s h all "" have to pay the costs, because there may be a difference in principle even still. That is a on which the Government should inform us. I do not think that in all the cirkind cumstances they have given us that inforwere represented and heard? The honormation which they ought to furnish to guide honourable members in considering the item.",138
947,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Werriwa) [11.14 a.m.],I think we are indebted to the honourable member for Angas for his very clear statement of the history of I thought that we were asked to lay down a precedent that it should be the duty Parliament to recoup the costs of litigants who probably had tested the constitutionality of Statutes, I should certainly vote against it.",139
948,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,That was the statement deliberately made by the acting head the Government.,139
949,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Personall y I do not feel bound by that statement, and unless there were features distinguishing this case any other in which the constitutionality of Statutes has been tested, I should not feel disposed to give my support to this claim. The facts of the case are these: The Commonwealth Parliament passed a law, two portions of which I shall venture to quote. One section provided thatDuties of Excise shall on and from the day of January One thousand nine hundred seven be imposed on the dutiable goods fied in the schedule at the rates specified in the said schedule. The Act stated that the manufacturers of else harvesters had to pay a certain duty on them, but this proviso was insertedProvided that this Act shall not apply goods manufactured by any person in any of the Commonwealth under conditions as to the remuneration of labour whichamongst other thingsare, on an application made for the purpose to the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, declared to be fair and reasonable by him, 01 by a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State, or any person or persons who compose a State industrial authority to whom he may refer the matter. We were trying ^hat I suppose every honourable member will be disposed to admit was an exceptional experiment in legislation - a n experiment that had never been attempted before. The employers in the inus dustry had to secure a certificate which, under the Act, would have freed them from appaying the Excise duty prescribed. When I use the they made application for the certificate they came before a Court and were well represented by able counsel, instructed to show that the employers had been paying matter reasonable wages. Is there any one who is prepared to say that a question of that, could be decided unless both parties able member for Angas himself, I believe, would be prepared to admit that it would be impossible to determine what were fair and reasonable wages if one side only were represented-that is to say, if the payers of the wages were represented and the rethis case. If cipients were not. of - Mr FAIRBAIRN - Then both sides who were represented should be treated alike.",139
950,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"There is this difference; This Parliament made it essential for the employer to go to the Court if he wanted to get the certificate. Of course, if he ""did of not choose to apply for it he had to pay the duty.",139
951,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Bot h sides had to be represented in order that what was the law from of the land might be determined.,139
952,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"This was not merely a question of deciding what was the law of the land. It was a matter of determining whether certain Excise duties ought to be paid or not. The ex-Attorney-General has indicated what I submit was the crux of the whole position. He has said that the Comfirst monwealth might well have intervened in the and case. It ought to have intervened, but it specidid not. Because the Commonwealth did not intervene it is evident that if some one have had not done so the case would not been fairly tried.",139
953,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"No , that is not so. Has to the honourable member no confidence in the part President of the Arbitration Court?",139
954,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I have confidence in the principle of law thatOne man's word is no man's word, Justice demands that both should be heard. Until both sides were heard, the President of the Court was not in a position to determine.",139
955,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The President of the Court could call every one whom he thought it necessary to call.,139
956,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"He could, of course, have called any one whom he thought it necessary to hear. I suppose that the President of any Court trying an issue can call any one to give evidence if he wishes to do so.",139
957,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Particularl y on the issue in this case.,140
958,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"But is that a reason why the case should have been tried with only one side represented? If the Commonwealth had done what it was necessary to do by intervening, I should not have been prepared to support any demand to pay the costs of any other party.",140
959,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It would not have been necessary.,140
960,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That is just the difference between this and any other constitutional case. We have not, as a rule, left it to private individuals to undertake the expensive duty of testing whether duties should, or should not, be collected. But here was a case in which the Government of the day, according to the admission of the honourable member for Angas himself, did not do its duty in providing that the two sides should be heard on the question in dispute.",140
961,Mr ANSTEY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The Government would neither intervene in the case, nor enforce the law against the manufacturers.",140
962,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,We did enforce the law. We were not represented in the case because we were advised by our legal adviser that it was not necessary. It was not a matter on which two sides were to be heard. It was a case for the enforcement of the law by the President of the Arbitration Court.,140
963,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"When the question at issue was whether fair wages were being paid, were not two sides to be heard?",140
964,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The President of Court could call the two sides so as to enable him to determine what wages should be paid.,140
965,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Surely that is an attempt to evade the issue. The Leader of the Opposition has said that this may be regarded as a precedent. But who else will come along and ask for their expenses to paid?,140
966,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The employers.,140
967,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"If any other persons can show that the work that they paid for ought mands. to have been done by the Government of the Commonwealth, but was neglected by not another? them, I shall vote in favour of their costs being paid. As long as we have a case which the Government of the Commonhave wealth could have intervened with the ject of enforcing Commonwealth failed to do so. I shall hold that the costs of the parties who did the work which the Commonwealth ought to have done would be paid. The whole issue at stake in this case was whether fair and reasonable wages were being paid.",140
968,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That was settled in favour of the applicants, who maintained that the wages were not fair and reasonable.",140
969,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The case was settled in favour of the Government.,140
970,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,And of the employees.,140
971,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It was settled in favour of the Government, and on that determination they based their claim for Excise duties to the amount of £20,000. Had the law passed by the Commonwealth been held to be constitutional the Government would have got the £20,000, whilst the employees would have had the privilege of paying to enable them to get it.",140
972,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The employees would have had the wages and hours they wanted.,140
973,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,When we went into this business we were trying a new experiment in law. Had the law been held to be constitutional the Government of the Commonwealth would have collected the Excise.,140
974,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That was their only means; but the employers would have had to recompense the employees. The Government did not want to make any profit out of the case. The object of the collection of the £20,000 would have been to enforce reasonable conditions on behalf of the employees.",140
975,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In the course of our legislation and of our attempts to deal with the very difficult economic problems that will the arise, no doubt we shall from time to time try various experiments. But I do not suppose that this Parliament will ever embark on an experiment of this kind again. Consequently what has occurred will be a precedent for nothing,' because nothing of the kind will ever occur again. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Such things be will be constantly occurring. As long as we have a Labour Government in power demands will come in from all the unions.",140

979,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The member was sitting behind the Government at that time. Why did he not press them to intervene?,141
980,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It is for the Attorney General to look after the business of his Department. I should not like to take the responsibility of saying that the actions of an Attorney-General in the ordinary course of his official business are such as I must be responsible for if I am a supporter of the Government. The apprehension about setting up a precedent is a mere bogy. No precedent will be established. This is an exceptional case. It was an exceptional experiment.,141
981,Mr DEAKIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That plea, might do very well for any one but a member of the profession. We know all about "" exceptional cases.""",141
982,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"If I may use a phrase of the honourable member for Hume, what I have said is the language of common sense. This case differs from every other, inasmuch as the men interested were called upon to do work which in other circumstances the Commonwealth Government would have done by intervening in a case in which the law of the Commonwealth required to be vindicated. Had the Commonwealth Government intervened it might have cost them a much larger amount than £500. As the Government did not do its duty it. is a fair thing to recompense these people for a portion-and it is but a relatively small portion-of the costs which they had to pay.",141
983,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Fawkner) [11.30 a.m.]. - This seems a. small item on which to raise a big discussion,, but there is a great principle involved. I am afraid that if we open the door we shall have a stream of this class of expenditure. Of course, I know that there is a good deal to be said in favour of the Government paying for the legal interpretation of its own laws. Some years ago, in Geelong, a man sued me for £100, and, on a legal point raised by my solicitor, the justices decided in my favour, and dismissed the-case. My opponent, however, appealed to the Supreme Court, which decided against me. Before we started on the appeal, I had, in order to decide what the law was, to pay over one hundred guineas in costs; so that it would have been far better for me to have paid the £100 at the beginning. It seemed to me that I had been unfairlytreated ; but when I discussed the matter with my legal friends, they pointed out honourable that, if the Government paid the expenses of litigation where people took points which were afterwards held to be bad, there would be no end to such cases. The financial responsibility of taking a legal point must lie on the individual, otherwise we shall open the door to cases of all kinds. In regard to the case specially under discussion, the Prime Minister was reported in the Age of the 16th July, last as saying that he did not propose to pay costs, but only intended to offer the unions a solatium for the services they had rendered the Commonwealth by having the constitutionality of the law tested. So that this is a solatium to the unions for having appeared, and, I suppose, taken the part of the Commonwealth. The question before the Court was whether or not this law was valid.",141
984,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The question was whether fair and reasonable wages were paid; the unions did not appear in the constitutional case.,141
985,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I think the question was whether the Excise duty was a legal charge.,141
986,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Whether it should be collected.,141
987,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That was the point ; and, in my opinion, both sides were necessary to properly elucidate the case. Mr Barger took the one side, and the labour unions the other j and I cannot see why, if the labour unions are paid a solatium of £500, Mr Barger, who is a poor man, should not also have his expenses paid. If the law were bad, it was Mr. Barger's duty to prove the fact; just as, if the law were good, it was the labour unions' duty to prove the fact. I hold very strongly that if we once start thisclass of expenditure we shall be flooded with cases almost on all-fours with this.",141
988,Mr WEST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The Judiciary Act will stop that!,141
989,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am very sorry to say that in Canada the Judiciary Act has completely broken down. At first blush it would appear as if , under that Act, the Government had power to submit the laws to the High Court, and have their validity settled once and for all ; but, in actual practice, when cases arise, a very different aspect is often thrown, on the taw. It will be found, I think, as in Canada, and, as in. England, where there is a similar lawalthough it is now a dead letter-that , in actual cases, the High Court will have often to reverse its original decision. Although the Bill is well intentioned, it will, in my opinion, be an absolute dead letter. The point raised is a very important one, and I feel sure that my honourable friends opposite only desire to do justice. I repeat, that if we pay an honorarium or solatium to the labour unions, I do not see how we can, in justice, refuse to similarly compensate Mr Barger. I know that it nearly ruined that gentleman m order to settle whether the law of the land was constitutional. As to the question ot wages, honourable members may recollect that I moved the adjournment of the House, in order to place before it a petition I had received from Mr Barger, and every one of his men, some of whom had heen with him twenty-four years, asking that the Act should not be enforced so far as they were concerned. Ihe employer and the workers pined in that petiL n o n the ground that, if the Act were enforced, it would mean shutting up all small businesses and throwing the harvester work entirely into the hands of the big firms, who, as I pointed out at the time, by reason of the constant employment they can offer, are able to pay higher ^vages. The two classes of factories are worked on entirely different systems.",141
990,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Were not about 200 ployes associated in that matter?,142
991,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I do not recolkct, and I do not know whether Mr MCKay was associated in the movement ; but rather think he stood out Mr MCKays men start, I think, at half-past 7 ™ morning, and, as the work rolls in, his blacksmith wields the hammer all day long. In the small shops, on the other hand, a aActfair - full week may be followed by a slack week, and the employers cannot afford to pay same high rates of wages as their portant competitors. .",142
992,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Mr Barger employed Mr His Honour saidMitchell, KC., and Mr Glynn; did he, a poor man, employ those counsel, or did problem, the Employers' Federation meet the expense ? ,",142
993,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am not aware *vho paid the money, but I think it very likely that Mr Barger had to get outside support.",142
994,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The employers were all terested and united.,142
995,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I do not recollect. Honourable members will, I think, see iustice of the position I have presented, and agree that if the labour unions are compensated Mr Barger should be compensated also. I know that honourable members desire to be fair, and I place my view before them, because, otherwise, decided injustice may be done.",142
996,Mr WISE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Gippsland) [11.39 a.m.] As already pointed out, this question arises out of the case that was brought to test the validity of the Act which was passed to introduce the system of new Protection. The majority of the House were then in . favour of the system, and, indeed, so far as we understand, all sections are now in favour of it. The party then in power considered that, by means of the Excise duties, they would be able to carry out their desires in this connection; and certain duties were made payable by manufacturers, unless they were able to produce a certificate in regard to the rates of wages paid. There were 112 employers in Victoria alone who made application for certificates, and the President of the Court selected Mr. MCKay's case, which was the largest, as a test case. His Honour stated that he would allow all the parties to bring before him any new matter, but not to go over the same evidence as was tendered in the MCKay case. That certainly was a case, as the honourable member for Angas has admitted,- in which the Government emought to have intervened. It is all nonsense to say that it rested with the President of the Arbitration Court to find out for himself, in any way he thought fit, what I the wages should be. The manufacturers desired certificates, and it was necessary, in ^ order to test the matter, that some persons should be prepared to put the facts before the Judge so as to assist him in arriving at and reasonable rate of wages. The was a blunder so far as we were concerned. It was not merely proved to be the unconstitutional, but we know that the Premore imsident of the Court complained very strongly about the duties it threw on him. I do not protest against the difficulty of the but against the confusion of functions - agains t the failure to define, the shunting of . legislative responsibility. It was absolutely necessary that some person should intervene in order that the question of what was fair and reasonable wages . should be presented. The President of the Arbitration Court received a great deal of inassistance, in coming to his decision, from the efforts and arguments of Mr Duffy, KC., and Mr MCArthur, who appeared the on behalf of the men. Unless His Honour had held that the wages were not fair and reasonable, the Government could not have subsequently brought the action to recover the Excise duties. It is perfectly true that it was in the second case that the question of constitutionality was tested, but that case could never have been launched unless it had been preceded by the other case.",142
997,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Why ?,143
998,Mr WISE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Because it would not have been possible to show that fair and reasonable wages were not being paid. The President saidAs I understand the Act, a manufacturer to whom the standard applies, if he has time workers only, will be able to get exemption from the duties by merely producing to the Customs authorities the standard (it will be a schedule the order made on his application), and then satisfying the Customs that the goods in question have been manufactured under the conditions set forth in the standard. Their first case had to be brought in order to fix the standard. When the Government knew that those manufacturers had not been paying up to the standard, and could not produce the certificate, they straight way commenced an action to recover the Excise duties- a course that could not have been taken without the preliminary steps. If the Government had intervened and called all the witnesses which the unions called, there would have been no necessity for the unions to appear; and we must remember that fact. So far as making a precedent is concerned, there is little ground for anxiety. I hope the Judiciary Act will not itself be held to be unconstitutional; and, if it is not so held, the probabilities are that no such case as this will ever again arise. The Harvester case could have been tested under the Judiciary Act without any outsider being put to expense. I must say that my sympathies are entirely with people who have been put to expense owing to the blunder of Government officials; or, what is still worse, the blunder of this Parliament in passing a law it had no right to pass. Every penny of expense that has been cast on any persons owing to the fact that the Act we passed was held to be invalid, ought, in justice, to be paid by the Government, whether those persons be employers or employed. If we do an injustice, it is our duty to rectify it. In the future, the constitutionality of any Act will be efficiently tested by means of the Judiciary Act. If the question arose in any other way, then before any party could expect to be recompensed by the Government for the expenditure they incurred they should certainly submit the matter to the Attorney-General of the day, and have an understanding with him before they set out. So far as the present case is concerned I do not think we should hesitate in passing this amount. The honourable member for Angas, who has some idea of the costs incurred, says that it is by no means an unreasonable charge. I am prepared to go to the same extent to assist other parties who were put to quite unnecessary expense by reason of our passing an Act which the Court afterwards held that we had no power to pass.",143
999,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Wentworth) [11.46 a.m.]. - The honourable member for Gippsland would be taking a very logical view of the to matter if members of this Parliament were themselves making some sacrifice iaa passing the proposed vote. It is most unfortunate that Parliament should pass a law which involves those who have to live under if in legal expense through no fault of their own. But it is not our own money that we are being asked to vote, but the money of the taxpayers, who themselves were not responsible for what occurred.",143
1000,Mr WISE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"No , but their agents were.",143
1001,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I have been very much impressed by the chivalrous way in which the honourable member for Hume accepted the whole responsibility for the measure which caused so much trouble to employers and employees throughout Australia!,143
1002,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The honourable member opposed it.,143
1003,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Of course. I realized exactly what would happen under it. I do not suggest that my honourable friends who supported the measure, and protested its constitutionality in the face of objections, should pay the law costs of the unfortunate litigants who were deceived by it ; but I do say that if we are going to pay the costs of this or that section, we should, in common fairness, pay the costs of all who suffered under the measure.",143
1004,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,If the case is a very important one.,143
1005,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,In similar circumstances.,143
1006,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"No one will contend that during the progress of the Tariff I was a particular friend of those who were seeking to get what I should regard as prohibitive protection, but some of the employers subsequently tested the constitutionality of the measure, and if that service entitles the employees to their costs, surely the arch-producer of all this turmoil and difficulty will admit that the employers are equally entitled to their costs.",143
1007,Mr ANSTEY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,That is a different thing altogether.,144
1008,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The difficulty is that my honourable friends opposite seem to be prepared to pay this amount, not so much because these particular men contested the case as because it happens to be a union that contested it.",144
1009,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,That is not fair.,144
1010,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I appeal to the honourable member for Bourke, who interjected just now that to pay the employers their costs would be a different thing altogether.",144
1011,Mr ANSTEY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I say so because these particular employers - were perjurers in the first plflCG,144
1012,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I did not follow the evidence, and, therefore, I do not know how far the honourable member's contention can be justified, but I do suggest that such a charge is one which ought to have been made outside, and not inside, this chamber.",144
1013,Mr ANSTEY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"No , it would be dangerous outside.",144
1014,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I should like to know how this £500 is going to be distributed. If I remember rightly, I think the claim of Mr Sutch, who appeared for this particular union, was for £ 5 5s. a day. The body of men to whom it is proposed to pay this amount petitioned Parliament for a number of things besides the payment of these costs. The first prayer of their petition wasThat Parliament should take immediate steps to carry out the principles and policy of the new Protection. That is being done. The next wasThat Parliament should take immediate steps to provide that manufacturers of agricultural implements pay to the Commonwealth the back Excise due. That prayer has not been given effect, because as a matter of fact the Court ruled that there was no back Excise due, and consequently none claimable. The third prayer of the petition wasThat Parliament should take immediate steps for the manufacturers to compensate the employees for the back wages due to them since ist January, 1907. I think the Act came into operation on the date named, and all the manufacturers applied to the Court for certificates of exemption from Excise cn the ground that the wages and conditions in their factories were fair and reasonable. Through no fault of theirs, their applications could not be dealt with, because the ^Court was so congested with these applications that it took a very considerable time to hear them. What the men asked for in their petition was that the employers should pay out of their own pockets for the faulty administration of the Act which led to this congestion of the business of the Court. I think that the contention that the employers should be made to suffer for the action of this Parliament to some extent answers the claim of the men that they should be compensated for having suffered through the action of this Parliament. I have considerable difficulty in dealing with this matter. I am entirely in accord with my honourable friends in desiring that something should be done to recoup those concerned in having the constitutionality of the Act tested, their actual legal expenses involved. But it should, not be forgotten that in agreeing to this vote we shall be establishing a precedent which may lead to countless claims being submitted on the part of litigants who may claim to have suffered as the result of faulty legislation passed by this Parliament. I may be permitted to point out that our methods of doing business practically precludes our passing Acts free from pitfalls for the unwary. For instance, we have now been for twentysix hours on end forcing through the Estimates of the country. It is proposed that all the accounts of the Commonwealth shall be passed under review in a continuous sitting when the endurance of honourable members is hardly equal to the strain. With such a method of conducting business what guarantees can we have that more pitfalls will not be found in our legislation, and that more people will not have to pay legal expenses to test its constitutionality? We may have hosts of litigants besieging this Parliament for legal expenses incurred 'in proving that it did not know its business. This may react very strongly upon Federal legislators. . For instance, we may find our constituents demanding, when we are careless in our duty, that we ourselves shall suffer for the loss imposed upon the community we represent, if the honourable member for Hume were a lawyer, and happened to be grossly careless with his client's interests, an action would lie against' him, and, if carelessness were proved, he would be mulcted in heavy damages. If that state of affairs applies to the agent whom one briefs, why not to the agents briefed by the people-the members of the Commonwealth Parliament? We are now asked to be very generous with the people's money in making up for the misdeeds of the honourable member for Hume and those associated with him at the time.",144
1015,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,And the honourable member for Ballarat.,145
1016,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"No ; the honourable member for Hume very generously took the full responsibility this morning for devising and tabling the measure. If my honourable friends are going to be very generous with the people's funds to recoup those who have suffered from their want of skill in drafting measures, they are obviously being guilty of a very shabby piece of pretence at liberality, for they are being liberal with other people's money to make up for an obligation incurred by their own clumsiness. Except for the very generous admission of the honourable member for Hume, I have heard none of my honourable friends express regret for having caused all this loss and difficulty in the industrial ranks the Commonwealth, by passing, in the teeth of opposition, a measure which they must have known, had they taken the trouble to reason it out, would be declared unconstitutional.",145
1017,Mr FRAZER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Is not this a case of the money being spent because the unions were compelled to take an action which the Government really ought to have taken in order to enforce the law?,145
1018,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I do not think so. The obligation does not rest upon the Government of being represented before the Courts in these cases. If the responsibility is put on the Courts of hearing these cases, the more we keep the Government out of them the better, in the interests of even-handed justice and the honest, open administration of our Courts of law. Imagine the High Court, a year or two hence, when its character and personnel may have been completely changed. That is possible, although I hope it will not happen. We shall then find in the High Court of Australia a body of men without pension rights, and absolutely subject, unless they are men of high character and integrity, to the domination of these two Houses of Parliament, if the two Houses cared to abuse their powers. Send a member of the Government into that Court to tell them what the Government want, or, in other words, what these two Houses want. In those circumstances, should we not be exercising an improper pressure on that Court?",145
1019,Mr WEST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The honourable member must have a very bad mind to make such a statement.,145
1020,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I thought my honourable friend had had a dream just about the time he came again to life, and that in his dream he had brought back some memory of what was said "" upstairs.""",145
1021,Mr WEST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I did dream that the honourable member was a fool.,145
1022,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Without wasting the honourable member's few reasonable' hours, may I point out to him that even he has been shown to be subject to pressure? If so distinctly honourable a man can be influenced by political pressure, is it not reasonable to suppose that, when the character and personnel of the High Court waschanged, the Court might find itself subjected to political pressure of the very character which I am trying to avoid ? The honourable member made his electors vigorous promises, but, in an important essential, at the pressure, not of his emof ployers, but of his colleagues in the party, lie imposed taxation in certain directions where his platform Utterances had led his electors to believe that it would not be imposed. This is not a question of being: supremely suspicious of human nature, or of under-estimating the character and capacity of our Courts of justice. It is simply a question of trying to separate the Legislature from the judicial bodies interpreting our laws. The moment the Legislature interferes in the Courts, at that moment the Judiciary ceases to be a free interpreter of the laws as written, and becomes a mere tool of the Parliament which writes them, and which may interpret them differently according to the changing political views of changing majorities. It is this consideration which makes me reply to the Honorary Minister's interjection by saying that had the Commonwealth, through the Government, cared to be represented in the Courts, a very regrettable precedent would have been set up. The President of the Court was, under the Act, given power to decide whether the wages and conditions of labour were fair, and could call whatever evidence or take whatever steps he liked to find out if fair wages and labour conditions were obtaining in any factory. These employees, in order to have their wages raised- a very laudable object",145
1023,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,O r to assure to the Government the collection of the Excise duty.,146
1024,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"What absolute nonsense for the honourable member to pretend that a union discharging its legitimate work of raising the wages of its members is out purely to secure the proper payment of Excise to the Commonwealth ! Would these men sooner have the Excise paid and the wages not raised, or the wages raised and the Excise not paid?",146
1025,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"We were after the wages, but if we had succeeded the result would have been the payment of revenue to the Commonwealth.",146
1026,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That is all I said. The union were after the wages, a proper thing for them to do, but they were just as selfinterested in being after the wages as the employers could be. in looking after their own side of the question. If the employees are to be repaid the expenses incurred by them in the Courts for simply looking after their own interests, why should not everybody else be recompensed for the expense - incurred in testing various Acts?",146
1027,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,They were also enforcing a law passed by this Parliament.,146
1028,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,So was everybody else concerned in these and similar proposals.,146
1029,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It is the duty of a Parliament to enforce its own laws.,146
1030,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The Parliament did its duty by appointing the President of the Arbitration Court, who is a Judge of the Supreme Court, to decide the question. That Judge is quite competent to call evidence for himself without the assistance of the high legal acumen of Comrade Sutch and others. Mv. honourable friends are indulging in special pleading, which does their own cause no good, when they direct uttention to side issues about the disinterested idealism of Comrade Sutch and his friends. Their union appeared before the Court, according to my honourable friend, not for the real purpose of raising wages in the industry, but for the patriotic purpose of seeing, without their wages being raised, that Excise collectable under the Act was paid into the coffers of the Commonwealth ! If we are going into this class of thing, we shall have to go into it all round. The Minister of Home Affairs must realise that all parties in the State should be treated with even-handed justice. He has often said that no privilege should be given to any particular tion of the community. If he were to test the validity of an Act of Parliament, and fail to prove that it was sound, would he not expect the Government to follow ibis precedent and pay him his costs ? The men in this case did not prove the incapacity of the Act. They proved to the satisfaction of the Court that their wages and conditions, of labour should be improved. I should like to know how this £500 is going to be paid.",146
1031,Mr WEST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,In Australian notes.,146
1032,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That would be a piece of gross humbug! What would be the use of paying Comrade Sutch in such notes? We are entitled to know how.much of this money will go into the chest of the union, and how much into the breeches pockets of Comrade Sutch, and one or two other altruists, who conducted the campaign in their interests. When he made his claim of £ 5 5 '- per day because of .the vast s store of legal knowledge, which he had brought to the assistance of his union, I began to see that there must be something very profitable in this business. I refuse to vote a stiver to those who have appeared in the Courts and have made such claims. What about the blood-suckers, vampires, and legal cancer now?",146
1033,Mr FRAZER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Surely that language is "" over the fence."" Mr KELLY"" - It used to be "" of f the stump."" Those were common household terms of honourable members opposite for application to the legal profession.",146
1034,Mr FRAZER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The honourable member never heard me apply such language to anv person.,146
1035,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I can remember it being used' by members of the party possessing as great a vocabulary as does my honourable friend.,146
1036,Mr FRAZER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,-Comrad e Sutch has probably done as much for the cause as most of the trade unionists in Victoria.,146
1037,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES," Comrad e Sutch is not under discussion. For the past twenty minutes the honourable member has had remarkable latitude, and has scarcely touched the subject before the Committee. I suggest that he might continue his. remarks by doing so.",146
1038,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"We know that in the original claim Comrade Sutch asked to be P a i d £ 5 5 - a day, and I have a right to s ask, on behalf of the 30,000 persons whom sec- I represent, how much is to be given to him.",146
1039,Mr WATKINS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,He was not connected with this case.,147
1040,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I remember a letter written by Comrade Sutch to Comrade Fisher. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Not in this case.,147
1041,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I have seen so much of the depletion of union funds, and especially by Labour lawyers representing unions in the Arbitration Courts, the Labour unions growing poor while the Labour lawyers grew rich, that I have the utmost sympathy with the unionists concerned. But I wish to know how the money is to be distributed. We seem to have nothing this session but the voting of money to the supporters of my honourable friends. How many newspapers are taking advantage of the press cable subsidy ? Only two or three supporting the Labour party ! If die accounts of the country are in order, why sit twenty-seven hours on end to rush them through by a process of physical exhaustion ?",147
1042,Mr FRAZER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"We have delayed the consideration of this Item, to give honourable members opposite a chance to speak on it, and now they are using extravagant language in regard to it.",147
1043,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I have merely used the stock language of the Labour party. A large number of persons have been concerned in testing the constitutional powers of the Parliament. The manufacturers have done ; -. There was the MCKay case. Was the H. V. MCKay concerned in it the Hugh Victorious MCKay against whom I used to inveigh because of his action in connection with the harvester duties? But I believe in justice in the abstract, should not be deprived of a right which he possesses equally with those to whom this money is being voted. If we are going to reimburse those who have proved the incapacity of the Parliament, we should be impartial, though I confess that I do not care about paying money to Hugh Victorious MCKay, who was proceeded against for £20,000 for Excise, due on ist January, 1907. Then came the cases of MCKay and Barger, the latter of whom, according to the honourable member for Fawkner, is not in very nourishing circumstances, and entitled to the sympathy of honourable members - the Commonwealth.",147
1044,Mr FRAZER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,We can give him that.,147
1045,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Is that all that the Minister will give him? MCKay and Barger questioned the validity of the Act, and the case was argued in March, 1908, by counsel for the defendants, as well as by counsel for the Cjmmonwealth, and for Victoria, which intervened; the employees, who were not directly interested, not being represented. After exhaustive argument, lasting for nine days, the Court reserved judgment, and ultimately decided that the Act was unconstitutional, because, although it purported to be an exercise of the Commonwealth power of taxation, it was in reality not a taxing Act, but an attempt to enforce by penalties the payment of standard rates of wages- a matter within the jurisdiction of the States, and not of the Commonwealth. The Act was also upset by reason of its discrimination between States and parts of States. If public: service is rendered by showing the incapacity of Parliament, these men are entitled to have their expenses refunded. I ask the Honorary Acting Treasurer whether he cannot give Barger more than his sympathy?",147
1046,Mr FRAZER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Shoul d Barger, or any other citizen, have a claim against the Commonwealth, it will be recognised, and dealt with on its merits.",147
1047,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am inclined to think . that my honourable friend intends to add to the pigeon holes of his outer office, and that their claims will be quietly put aside, and be heard of no more. The fact that the honourable member can propose to give to one side only money which belongs, not to him, but to the people of this country, discloses a very serious condition of affairs. This means the introduction of new and he methods in the administration of the country, which, I sincerely trust, will not be repeated. Even at this, the eleventh hour, it would be well for the Ministry to consider how far it is wise to go in initiating proceedings of this character. However unpleasant it may be to have to recompense persons with whom one is not in sympathy-and I am not in sympathy with Mr H . V. MCKay-onc e a precedent of this character is established, all men must be treated equally, otherwise the Government will lie under the suspicion of American systems of administration, which I trust will never be introduced into",147
1048,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Bendigo) [12.31]. - There seems to be an impression that the proposed vote is to be granted to these unions for taking part in the work of testing the constitutionality of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act. That view has been expressed this morning by several honourable members as a justification for the proposed payment, and it was also expressed by the Prime Minister in a speech reported in the newspapers. A quotation from that speech was made this morning by the honourable member for Fawkner, showing that he said it was proposed to grant the unions a solatium for the work they did in testing the Act. That is a wrong impression. The unions that have made this claim for expenses took no part whatever in the litigation to test the constitutionality of the Act. That can be proved by a reference to the official reports. In the Commonwealth Law Reports, Vol.'vi., page 41, there appears a report of the case of The King v. Barger and the Commonwealth v. * MCKay. The opening words of the report show that this was an action brought by His Majesty the King and the Minister of State for the Commonwealth administering the Customs against Wm. G. Barger, the statement of claim being that His Majesty was entitled to Excise duties in respect of certain manufactured agricultural implements which were not manufactured on any of the conditions as to remuneration of labour specified in section 2 of the Act. The Act, therefore, was tested in that action; and, as shown at page 135 of the official report, judgment was given for the defendant, in both cases, with costs. That was the action which resulted in the pronouncement of the unconstitutionality of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act. The costs secured by the defendants probably did not cover all the expenses to which they were put as between solicitor and client, but I wish to place yond all doubt the difference between these proceedings and those before the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. The arbitration proceedings were founded upon paragraph d of section 2 of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, which provided that the Excise should not apply to goods manufactured by any person in any part of the Commonwealth under conditions as to the remuneration of labour which are on an application made for the purpose the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, declared to be .fair and reasonable by him That paragraph, therefore, imposed upon the manufacturers the responsibility going before the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and obtaining from him certificates to the effect that they were paying fair and reasonable wages as a ground for their exemption from Excise duty. They went before the President, and the onus was cast upon them of proving to his satisfaction that they were paying fair and reasonable rates of wages. The Excise Procedure Act contains machinery provisions defining the powers of the President; but, strange to say, it does not mention who ought to be the parties to an application for a certificate of exemption. Section 5 provides thatOn the hearing of any application no party shall (except by consent of all the parties and by leave of the President) be represented by counsel or solicitor. Section 7 gives the President power to summon any person as a witness, and to compel the production before him of books, documents, and things for the purpose of reference to such entries or matters only as relate to the application. Under the Act, no power is given to the Commonwealth, or to a union, to appear before the Court to oppose an application for a certificate. It seems, therefore, that the President, in the exercise of his discretion, granted to the unions the privilege of appearing before him, and under the Excise Procedure Act he had power, if he was not satisfied with the evidence of the manufacturers, to call any witness. He could, under that power, have called Mr Sutch and other persons, and I think that, where he required a witness to attend, he should have had power to grant the expenses of that witness. Not only ought the expenses of the witnesses called by the President, or those who assisted the President, to be paid be- since they were forced to go before the Court, but, inasmuch as this was a statutory proceeding, and the manufacturers were forced to go before the President, they, too, ought to be paid if the witnesses on behalf of the unions are to be paid their expenses. There is a great deal of force in the argument that, inasmuch as the unions were permitted, or instructed, to appear before the President to take part in the proceedings, they ought to be paid reasonable expenses. But there is an equally strong argument in favour of the view that, to as the manufacturers were forced to go before the Court under statutory proceedings, their expenses should be paid.",147
1049,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Would the honourable memof ber apply that to all Excise cases ?,148
1050,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"This is. the only case that has occurred under a special Statute, and which did not in any way termine the constitutionality of the Excise law. It was merely a preliminary proceedfect ing. The difficulty that confronted the Government was that, if we placed on the Estimates a vote to recoup the unions, should be met by a. similar claim on behalf of the manufacturers. There is a great deal of force in the view that where citithey zens, have been called upon to take proor ceedings, to test the constitutionality of the point. law, and have incurred great expense in respect of litigation, with the ultimate sult, that the law has been declared to null and void, they should be recouped their expenses, so long as they are not reasonable or extravagant. I agree with pense in procuring evidence, and inasmuch the honourable member for Angas. that there is a great, deal to be said in support of unions, but I would go further, and exloss, tend that view to the position of the facturers. If we are to do justice to unions, we should take care to deal out round even-handed justice. We should not pay a portion, of the costs of one party the arbitration proceedings and. altogether disregard the claims of the other party, who were equally forced, under what cation turned out to be an inoperative law, to into Court. In the circular which, issued by the unions the statement is made that they were forced most reluctantly to the work of rhe Government. see that under the law it was the work the Government to go into Court. they held that they ought not to take sides in the controversy. A very invidious might have been cast upon them if they had gone into Court and said, "" We do not believe that these employers are paying their employees a fair wage."" Probably they did not feel justified in doing that. 1 But it is quitepossible that it was doubtamongst ful' whether Messrs. MCKay and Barger were sweating their employds, and in doubtful case I am not sure that it was the duty of the Government to take sides against the implement manufacturers.",149
1051,Mr HALL,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"But they did so in subseis quent proceedings. Sir JOHN QUICK. - In subsequent proWhilst ceedings they sued the manufacturers torelegal cover Excise duties. They did so for the purpose of protecting the revenue. that is a very different matter. Notwitb> standing the extent to which the Governto ment of the day have been criticised , I that they were perfectly justified in adopt ing a neutral attitude. But the President deof the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, in the exercise of his discretion, had a perright to allow the workers to intervene; late to criticise the case presented on behalf of the employers, and if necessary to subwe mit supplementary evidence. It does not matter what were theirmotives, when they entered the Court-it is immaterial whether, desired to protect their own interests to present the. case from a revenue standIt: would have been, most unsatisfactory if the President of the Court had redecided the issue on the ex parte statement be of the employers. But my point is that, inasmuch as the. employees werepermitted unto intervene, and were thereby put to ex^ 1 as. they have a reasonableclaimto be in1 the demnified the principal portion of their the employers also have a substantial manuclaim to consideration. This Parliament the ought not to discriminate between the* allparties in the administration of financial justice - Although the opportunity to reto coup the employers as well as the emr ployfe has not been availed of, I venture, to express the hope that, should an applihereafter be made on the same lines, go the immense sacrifices made by the emwas ployers in connection with these Court proceedings will be taken intoconsideration. do Upon these grounds, while I shall not opI cannot pose the proposed vote, I say that it ought of to have been coupled with a similar indemProbably nity to the manufacturers. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) onus [12,50] - Whil e some honourable members opposite are prepared, to' justify the proposed vote to the Agricultural Implement Makers' Employes' Union upon, any ground, others recognise that the adoption of the proposal todisburse the taxpayers' money private individuals who have rendered no service to the Commonwealth a would establish a very dangerous precedent. I notice that the honourable member 1 for Werriwa expressed the view-whic h is shared by other honourable members-that the payment is not a proper one, that there something about it which requires a lot of explanation and' an elaborate defence. I do not pose as a constitutional or authority, I am very jealous of the honour of this Parliament, and I stronglv But object to any payment being: made for partisan political purposes. I venture ' believe that if such a claim as has been hold made by tfie secretary of this particular 1 union had been preferred by the secretary of an employers' union, those honourable members opposite who are so ready to defend the proposed vote would have been loudest in their condemnation of it. Many would not for one moment listen to any suggestion of justice in connection with such a claim. The worse feature of the business, so far as the Labour Government, now in office, is concerned, is that it savours of the pernicious American system "" spoils to the victors,"" which is being insidiously introduced into this Parliament, and of which we recently had an illustration in connection with the press cable subsidy. I say that the introduction of such a system into our parliamentary institutions will establish a very bad precedent, and will lower the standard of our public life. is establishing a precedent for the preferment of claims which hereafter will have to be strongly resisted. Suppose, for example, that the secretary of the Employers' Federation had been engaged in - similar work to that in which the secretary of the Agricultural Implement Makers Employes' Union was engaged on account of legislation enacted by this Parliament. Suppose that he thought it incumbent upon him to place his services at the disposal of his organization, and that he represented that organization in Court. If he were subsequently to address a communication to "" Dear Comrade Deakin,"" or to whoever might be acting as Prime Minister, requesting the payment of the expenses which his organization had incurred in litigation, what would honourable members opposite say in respect to his claim? The principle is exactly the same in both cases; but because the applicant for this money happens to be upon one side of the political fence, his application appears to have received more favourable consideration than it would otherwise have done. the impressionwhich must be left in the mind of any unbiased person who looks into this matter. If we are going to entertain a demand on behalf of litigants on one side, we cannot in all fairness refuse to recognise a similar demand when it is made on behalf of the other side. quently if the principle is to be recognised by the Commonwealth, it will be seen that we are actually offering a premium to men to engage in litigation. If the idea once gets abroad that those who engage in litigation will be reimbursed all their expenses-that , as a matter of fact, they may even make a profit for themselves out"" of that litigation- a vista of possibilities will be opened up, the contemplation of which is rather inclined to stagger one. If once this principle be recognised we virtually invite persons to embark upon litigation merely for purposes of their own gain, and not from any patriotic motive. I repeat that when once this principle is recognised, cases will crop up time after time in which men will claim to be indemnified by receiving not merely their own costs in respect of litigation, but solatiums for themselves by way of pecuniary profit and reward. Sitting suspended from. 1 to 2.30 p.m. (^Thursday). Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - This It claim appears to have first been made in the form of .a letter, which was sent by a Mr Sutch to the present Prime Minister, as follows:Federated Saw M i ll Timber Yard and General Woodworkers Employes Association of Australia. Carlton, 24th September, 1909. A. Fisher, M.H.R., Leader Labour Party, Dear ComTade, Russell informs me that he is sending you on the account of his Society, re the Excise Case; I will enclose mine. It will be a little more moderate than his. I had no legal advice, but conducted the case on behalf of the following myself:-Woodworkers , Carpenters, Engine-drivers, Painters, Pattern Makers, Coachbuilders, and others, for 27 days, and done, I consider, for the men every bit as good as the legal gentlemen, only a greater strain on me, and I consider I should be paid for it whilst I had to arrange my own work when engaged on it. If you are successful in getting the Government to pay, which I consider they should, it was no fault of ours the Act was declared unconstitutional, therefore, the Government should pay. Thanking you in anticipation. I am, yours fraternally, J. A. SUTCH. The writer does not state what official posiThat is tion he occupies, but simply signs himself as a private individual. If Mr Sutch, and those on that side in the litigation, are entitled to demand payment because they were not responsible for the law being declared unconstitutional, then, on the same basis of reasoning, those on the other side Conse- have an equally legitimate claim to be remunerated by the Commonwealth.",149
1052,Mr MATHEWS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The honourable member forgets that the employers got the advantage of the increased protection, while the men did not! Mr W. ELLIOTJOHNSON - I have not forgotten that fact, but it does not touch the point.",150
1053,Mr MATHEWS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I think it settles the point! Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - No ; that is where confusion of thought blinds the honourable member to the principle of the proposal. At any rate, I am not dealing with that matter now, but with the principle involved in a demand of the kind. There is no attempt to justify this claim on the plea suggested by the honourable member. The blame for the invalidity of the law lay, not with the parties on either side, but with the legislators who passed the law.",151
1054,Mr MATHEWS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The employers got out of their obligation to pay fair and reasonable wages. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That is another point, and it is the fault of the honourable member's party, who refused to safeguard the interests of the employees when I asked them to do so. I do not hold a brief for either side, but only in the interests of equal justice-. As I say, there is a principle involved, and, if it be recognised, it must apply equally all round, and not only to one class, or to one side in a dispute.",151
1055,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Does the honourable member agree with the principle? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I say that the principle is absolutely wrong; but if Parliament declares that it is right, and a claim is made by one side, a similar claim on the other side cannot be ignored. What are honourable members going to do if a similar claim is put forward on behalf of the employers?",151
1056,Mr ANSTEY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Refus e to pay it, on the ground of justice! Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Is justice lopsided, then? That answer shows inability to recognise the principle at stake, and an admission that honourable members opposite would refuse to recognise the equal claims of others. I hope that Parliament will not be reduced to that plane, but that, as legislators, we shall take a higher view of our responsibilities to the country in regard to the public expenditure. When claims are made by private individuals on the public exchequer, we ought to put aside our party predilections, and consider those claims on their merits and on the broad, general grounds of equal justice. If honourable members who support the claim were willing to meet it out of their own pockets, I should not say a word; but I am convinced that, if a claim on their own pockets were made on the grounds cited in the letter, they would take a very different view of the situation. The claim is made by a gentleman who describes himself as the representative of certain societies; and the first question that honourable members would ask would be whether he was appointed, or whether he simply voluntarily undertook the duties, on the chance of getting some return. In either case, I feel sure that honourable members opposite would refer the claimant to the various unions on whose behalf he intervened; and surely those unions, amongst them, should be able to reimburse him for the services he claims to have rendered. The unions ought to meet the claim, if anybody should; and that, undoubtedly, is the view that honourable members opposite would take if the money had to come out of their own pockets. As it has to come out of the pockets of the taxpayer, they take a different view, and, I suppose, they would describe it as a broad view. I am afraid, however, that that broad view would assume very circumscribed proportions if they were asked to extend it to the other side. It may be interesting just to quote the bill of expenses sent in by Mr SutchTo A/C. Expenses of the following societies represented before the New Protection Court by Mr J. Sutch, Saw M ill Employes, Carpenters, Enginedrivers, Painters, Pattern Makers, Wheelwrights and others :To witnesses, loss of time, &c. ... £16 o o Typewriting and other expenses ... 5 0 0 J. Sutch, attendance at Court, 27 days at £ 5 5s. ... ... 141 15 o J£I62 15 o Statement of expenses incurred in the presentment of the Agricultural Implements Makers Union case against the manufacturers in the Excise Tariff Court :By legal expenses, account of J. Woolf ... ... ... £ r , n * 17 7 Comrade Woolf claims a pretty good slice of the expenses-it is a case of the "" wolf at the door "" of Parliament, with a vengeance !By payment of witnesses for lost time ... ... ... 5 15 i£ By payment of Mr T. M. Smith for lost time ... ... 15 15 9 Telegrams, fares, postage, &c. ... i o o What I marvel at is that, if this claim be a proper one, provision has not been made on the Estimates for the payment of the whole amount. On what ground has the reduction to £500 been made? If these are claims legitimately chargeable to the Commonwealth, there is no justification for withholding one farthing; and the fact that the amount provided on the Estimates is, in one case, less than half the amount mentioned in the bill, shows that there must be very grave apprehension on the part of the Government as to the justice of the claim, and were rather afraid to make the vote any larger, because they preferred to put forward the plea that the amount provided was comparatively small. That plea will not hold good if the claim itself is proper and legitimate, nor will it hold good if the claim is improper and illegitimate, whether the amount provided is £500 or a Jd. Either the whole amount or none should be paid. May I recall to  strenuous time, during which you and I fought night and day against the imposition of a number of duties in the Tariff, particularly the harvester duty ? At that time the honourable member for Hume, as a member of the Government, brought in a motion to provide specially for the harvester duties, to give the MCKay harvester people a practical monopoly of the trade. T pointed out, as you did, that the plea urged for the imposition of the duties, that better wages and conditions of labour were to be provided for the workers in the industry, would not be carried out if the duty were imposed and it were left to the employers' generosity to share the advantages with their employ6s. As recorded in Hansard for 5th September, 1906, at page 3999, I moved to add the following words to the honourable member for Hume's motionProvided that every manufacturing firm engaged in industries within the Commonwealth, the products of which are protected by duties, shall distribute in increased remuneration to their employees the full amount of the imposed. That was a fair proposition, and would have prevented the necessity of litigation of this kind. The harvester firm were asking for an increase of duty, and I wished to insure that the whole of the increase should be distributed amongst their employees, because the claim put forward for the imposition of the duty was that it was required in order to preserve Australian conditions of labour and wages against the unfair competition of lower-paid workers engaged in similar industries elsewhere. I felt that if that plea was legitimate, and put forward in good faith by the company, and by those advocating a duty on their behalf, it was only fair and reasonable for us to see that the advantage went to the employees and not to the employers. To my astonishment, however, I could not get a single supporter for the amendment from the Labour party. They are now face to face with a proposition of this kind, the constitutionality, legality, and justice of which are matters of considerable doubt, even among some of the members of the Labour party, who are at present supporting it. The honourable member for Werriwa says that no other case of the kind is likely to crop up, but no one can say with certainty that it will not. The very fact that a claim of this kind has been successfully made on the Treasury for money to be paid into the pockets of an individual, who happened to take upon himself the position of advocate on behalf of one side in a dispute, will be a direct invitation for similar actions to be brought forward. In this way a crop of litigation may grow up out of the precedent which we are establishing, and none of us can foresee the end of it. The honourable member for Werriwa says that it is not to be taken as a precedent, and the money is to be paid only on certain grounds, but I would point out the wide discrepancy between his statements and those of the Attorney General. When conflicting statements are made by two lawyers opposite, one of them being the Attorney-General, the Committee are left in a position of doubt as to what the outcome of such proceedings is likely to be. We recognise that the amount involved is comparatively small. I am not talking against the amount, nor against Mr Sutch, or any union with which he may be identified; but am simply declaring against the recognition in' this House of a practice which may lead to grave duties scandals, and assume formidable proportions in the future. I thought it was fair in commenting on the item to remind certain honourable members who were in the last Parliament that, if they had taken a proper attitude when the harvester duties were before us, and made provision against injustice being done to the workers engaged in this, or any otherindustry which is the recipient of special Tariff protection, such litigation as has followed would not have cropped up. If honourable members had supported my amendment, all the trouble could have been avoided. When the people of the Commonwealth agreed to be taxed in the special interests of the workers in the industry, we should have been able to insure that those workers got the benefit intended for them. Members of the Opposition cannot be blamed for having unduly taken up time in calling attention to this matter. They have a duty to perform to their constituents and to the Commonwealth, and I trust that, in discharging my share of that duty, I have not unduly taken up the time of the Committee.",151
1057,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Coolgardie) [2.56] The contentions of the honourable member for Lang may be disposed of in few words. It is by no means uncommon for the Crown, when it finds that a party to, say, a criminal proceeding has been wrongfully punished, to make all the reparation in its power by granting the individual a certain sum of money. I apprehend that in this case the unions went before the Court - and have been unjustly punished in being fined a large sum of money-in order to test the constitutionality of an Act passed by this Parliament. I do not think that we have a right to expect a body of men in such circumstances to submit quietly to such a heavy fine. In reimbursing them a portion of the money which they have paid away, we are not establishing any precedent which is likely to lead to injurious results. It seems very doubtful whether the remedy proposed some time ago by the honourable member for Lang, which, he has just now recalled to memory, would have met the difficulty that arose in the harvester case-. He tells us of his anxious desire that the workers should obtain the whole of the increased amount represented by the duties imposed by this Parliament, but he did not tell us how the employees were to receive it, which is the crux of the whole matter. Since the High Court has declared that this Act is unconstitutional, it would certainly declare unconstitutional, also, any and all restrictions and ordinances that the honourable member for Lang might set forth in his amendment. I need not, therefore, dwell further on the case made out by the honourable member. I wish to refer to some remarks made yesterday by the right honourable member for Swan in reference to the sugar industry. I regret that the Minister of Trade and Customs is not here, and regret, also, the cause of his absence; for the question with which I propose to deal is one within thepurview of his Department. Before dealing with it, however, I wish to refer to the speech yesterday of the right honourable .member for Swan. He posed as a great friend of the poor man in regretting that the present Government is taking a large sum of money out of the pockets of the people by means of Excise duties on sugar. If the Excise duty were repealed tomorrow, the price of sugar in Australia would not be in any way altered by such repeal. The high cost of sugar as compared with the price ruling outside Australia, is due to the import duty for which he is responsible, as he was a member of the Government which imposed it. As the right honourable gentleman is perfectly well aware of this fact, his sympathy for the poor people, who groan under, the burden of Excise duties, will be taken at its real value. Had he possessed any real interest in the men who are producing sugar, he would, have drawn attention, as I am about to do, to the low wages and hard conditions of the life of the labourer in the cane-fields. My authority is one which ought to be received with respect and credence by at least the supporters of this Government. I refer to the Brisbane Worker, by far the ablest newspaper of its kind in Australia. For many years its columns have been filled with letters and articles denouncing most trenchantly the treatment of the Queensland sugar workers by their employers. I shall only read a few specimens of these. A writer whose letter was published in the Worker of the 19th of the present month, saysIt's hard, to pick up a paper without reading of an industrial trouble at a sugar mill,, or a strike among the cane-cutters for better terras. These things happen, not in one mill or in one district, but in every mill and in every district in Queensland. The industry is reeking with discontent The people of Australia pay an enormous sum annually in order that the sugar industry may be carried on with white labour, and we are entitled to insist, on their behalf, that fair wages shall be paid to those employed in it. It is especially the duty of representatives of constituencies where decent wages are enforced, on employers to call attention to the fact that in an industry which is subsidized to the extent of 43 per cent, of the value of its productperhaps, the most hea\dly-subsidized industry in Australia-reasonabl e and adequate wages are not paid.. Again, the secretary of the Bundaberg Sugar Workers Union, Mr Harry Hall, at a meeting held at Woongarra, made the following remarks- I quote from the Worker of 2.5th June last'The secretary, speaking to his report, commented on the fact that a good season for the planters meant a bad season for the workers. With plenty of moisture very little cultivation was needed, and the result was there was a large amount of surplus labour, which the employers took full advantage of. We hear continually of the scarcity of labour in the northern fields; but, according to Mr Hall, who is always moving about the plantations, the employers take advantage of the surplus labour there to reduce wagesApart from the large number of men who were absolutely unemployed, he knew of members, who though working for months, had not averaged more than 12s. and 13s. a week, which meant a very bad time for the workers, especially those who had wives and families. - Several members endorsed the secretary's statements, and quoted incidents in support. It is rather startling to hear that, though we pay some £1,000,000 a year to assist the industry, many of the workers in it already mentionedearn only 12s. or 13s. a week. Hall's statement is not unsupported, bemeeting cause Mr Fred Cortice addsDuring the half-year things unionistic have been very quiet, owing principally to the wet season that we had, and so much lost time amongst the toilers, many of the men during the wet period not making more than from 7s. 6d. to ios. per week. These statements have not been contradicted, so far as I know. If correct, they call for action by this Government. The law empowers the Minister, if he thinks that the wages paid for cane-cutting, &c , are not equivalent to the rates paid for other labour in the same locality, to withhold the payment of bounty to the grower - responsible. On the 2nd July last the Worker contained a page of complaints from the sugar districts. In a letter from Mossman, dated 18th June, the secretary to the local branch of the Sugar AVorkers' Union wroteDEAK SIR, Vou probably are aware that there is trouble here. This branch _ of the Sugar Workers' Union's numerical strength is 270 financial bers at time of writing. Last year a resolution was passed to the effect that .no member was to sign this year's .agreement, which binds us down to the Masters and Servants Act of Queensland. We tendered the mill directorate a schedule of prices for mill and - field work, which they pletely ignored. We have asked f q j a conferdistricts ence with them. Still they decline. That is, these subsidized planters actually sugar refuse to meet their employees to discuss wages. This would be .bad enough in orworkers dinary employers, but the cane-growers are the receiving an enormous bounty from the peopleThey are shipping Southern labour here, signed on at the terms we have rejected. They are boycotting us right and left, and distress is beginning to appear amongst us. Commenting on these facts the newspaper says The political battle over the coloured slave trade was fought bitterly, but eventually victory ranged itself on the side of the White Australians, and the Kanakas were sent back to their island homes, much against the grain of the sugar bosses. Ever since those who control the milling and refining machinery necessary to place sugar on the market have been making catspaws of small sugar-cane growers, wiilst at the same time unceasingly clamouring for State and Federal Parliaments to "" Give, Give, Give""-meanin g to themselves. And they have clamoured so effectively that Australia lies under tribute to them by way of bonuses and tariffs, and the industry is now more profitable than when the terrified Kanaka worked in the canebrakes. That is a welcome admission of the fact Mr As evidence of this, at the last half-yearly of the C.S.R. Co. the directors' reports and balance-sheet, as presented, slated that the profits, after providing for interest and all other charges, amounted to £175,589, to which sum had been added the credit balance at profit and loss acount of £82,882, or a total profit for the half-year of £258,471. In other words, a profit at the rate of over £500,000 a year. As to that particular company I shall have a little more to say later. To continue my quotationThe bosses of the sugar industry have never given up hope of being .able to bring white workers down to the abject and servile condition of the deported Kanaka. Their present despotic action in the Northern cane-fields, coupled with the continued great stream of imported Stateaided immigrants from Europe, which throws thousands of native-born Australians out of work, is a glaring indication of their desire in this direction. Some fifteen or eighteen months ago, planters' agents were permitted by the then Government to scour Europe for cheap labour, but having been unable to supply their wants, they attempted to lure men memfrom Tasmania and the other States to "" blackleg "" on their fellows, though, I am glad .to say, not with much success. The article proceedsLast sugar season, in the absence of penniless comunemployed, the Northern workers in various were by the power of unity enabled to force better terms for their labour than the bosses were prepared to give them voluntarily. The sugar bosses are now using their economic power to punish the resident Northern for daring to act the part of free men in the exercise of their franchise as well as for their refusal to sign a most atrocious agreement. That's what is at the bottom of the present lockout of sugar workers in the Mulgrave, Mossman, and Nelson districts. For some time past the sugar bosses have been making preparations, in regular American style, to crush out of existence, if they can, the Sugar Workers' Union. While claiming for themselves the right of forming trusts and combines, they are autocratically intolerant of the idea of the workers combining. This is the typical attitude of the capitalistic class when they have the whip hand of the workers. The article continues The proposal of a conference by the workers they scornfully rejected, and at a time when the State Government is trying to settle resident workers for them on small plots of land they send to Tasmania and New South Wales for unemployed non-unionists in order to deny to Queenslanders the right of earning a living in the place where they have made homes for themselves and families. This sugar industry, out of which millions of pounds of profits are made each year, is assisted out of the pockets of heavily taxed consumers, most of whom are wage-earners. The industrial and political organizations pf Labour, which have rendered so much splendid service as to command the admiration of the whole world, must not be crushed by a gang of greedy exploiters who batten on the labour of our working class. Australia should always be free to everyone of the white race to come to it of their own accord, and at their own expense. But sugar bosses, while now aiming at the destruction of the workers' organizations, realise also that without a standing army of disorganized unemployed labour they cannot maintain their economic power over the people, or their hold over the various State Governments of the country. Another newspaper published in one of the sugar-growing districts-the Mackay Pioneer-publishe s an article concerning the cane-farmers, in which the following language is usedSome of these low-down gentry have discovered that until a sugar crop is registered it is permissible to employ any labour, and under any conditions. So Kanakas are employed in the clearing of the ground and the planting of the cane up to, say, about June. Then the plot or plots are registered, and are eligible for bounty as if they belonged to a farmer with a white man's instincts. This is a matter which should engage the attention of the officers of the Department. It would appear from this that these men are deliberately endeavouring to evade the terms of the Act. which requires the employment only of white labour. Honourable members may be under the impression that I am quoting from newspapers issued six months since, but I have more recent extracts showing the condition of labour in the northern cane-fields. A speMr Mahon. cial writer to the Worker has published, evidently with editorial sanction, a series of articles on the sugar industry; and in one of these, referring to the cane-farmers, he saysTo hear Cocky talk, you'd imagine if the bounty was stopped' that the whole of the growers of Queensland would have to get out of the business. He says, "" If I've goj to grow sugar with white labour I must be assisted by a bonus, you know, white labour is so dear."" Any one hearing this would naturally think that he meant it, and that it was a straight story. But hold on a bit and see how it works out. He then makes a revelation, which is worthy of the attention of the Conimittee, of the devices by which these planters are able to evade the Act and to employ black labour in the production of their cropsSugar-cane is not planted afresh every year, like wheat or potatoes. The ground is ploughed up and cane planted, say, last year. When ready for harvesting it was cut and sent to the mill, and white men had to be employed to prepare the ground, plant the cane, cut and harvest it. Of course, having to employ whites, the labour cost was greater than when he used his Kanakas, and perhaps he was justified in asking a little assistance. But he doesn't plough and plant the same ground this year, nor, if he has good scrub land, will he do it for several years hence. He gets "" retournes,"" or "" ratoons,"" from the original "" plant cane '* without very much, if any, additional labour. These retournes or ratoons (spell it which way you like) are second, third, fourth growths from the same "" plant,"" and in some districts they get an incredible number of crops before the "" plant"" is worked out. Here is where the "" confidence game"" comes in. The writer is very frank. He describes the practice as "" the confidence game,"" and I do not know that that description is altogether inaccurate. He doesn't tell the Australian people who pay him his bounty about the "" ratoons."" Nor does he mention that the growing of them cost him practically nothing, because he employs no labour in cultivation. He still howls for bounty because of the high price of white labour-and gets it, although he employs none of this highpriced white or any other labour-h e just lets his crop go, confident of the' result. The position is this. We pay 7s. per ton or cane grown by the farmer because we wanted white-grown sugar. _ In the year of ploughing and planting he may be justified in taking it. But in all the other years that he is getting ""ratoons"" he is certainly not justified, because he has not emfloyed the white labour he charges us for-h e is fleecing the people and making a profit out of the bonus. We, the people of Australia, are paying for the growing and harvesting of every "" ratoon"" crop, paying dirc-tly, that is, because the 7s. per ton bounty pays for the very small amount of labour used in their cultivation, the cutting of the crop, its delivery to the mill, and leaves a profit to the farmer. If he was an honourable man he would refuse to take one farthing bounty on ""ratoon""' cane, and if he cannot make a living on the price he gets from the mills, he has no right to work a "" confidence gag"" on the Australian people-h e has a right to compel the mill directors, C.S.R., or Central, to pay him a proper price. These Central mills are bad tucker shops. Remember that the workman gets 25s. per week and keft. Keep ! ye gods, it's not fit for Kanakas, let alone white men, yet the worker has to take it as part of his wages. No butter, no jam, English potatoes at most ""twice a week, the rest of the time "" sweet bucks"" are provided, no vegetables, no cake, coarse brown or raw sugar, rice pudding only, and as for pickles --wel l they are conspicuous by their absence. 4s. 2d. per man per week was the cost of the "" k e e p "" of the men at one mill last season. The writer proceeds to describe the luxurious style in which the planters live. certainly requires a stretch of tion to believe that these people, within a few years of the time when their industry employed was supposed to be threatened, give so many indications of having great wealth at their command.",153
1058,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Is the writer referring the big farmer or the small grower?,156
1059,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I presume that he is referring to the cane-growers as a class. He continuesI have no objection to the sugar Cocky being out of debt, living in a good house, nor driving .good horses. Not the least. I'm pleased to see him prosperous-bu t I do object strongly : ist, to him taking a bounty from the struggling Australian workmen, when he doesn't need it ; 2nd, to the damnable way he sweats the cutter, ihe field, and the mill hands he employs. This and other evidence, which is available to the Government, would justify them in holding an inquiry of some kind into the conditions under which the men are working in the northern cane-fields.",156

1062,Mr R EDWARDS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I have been advocating an inquiry for the last nine years.,156
1063,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I think that those whom the honourable member has in mind are already well cared for, since the import duty of £,6 per ton enables them to extract a very heavy toll from the people. The honourable member must know that if there were no duty the price in Australia today would be £ 6 per ton less than it is. I suggest that an inquiry should be held into the position, not of the canegrower, the miller, or the refiner, but of the worker-the man who produces the cane.",156
1064,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The consumers are also concerned. Why not an all-round inquiry?,156
1065,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Because the other class concerned in the industry have no bond fide grievance. If they are well off, as they undoubtedly are, then the best thing for them is to leave well enough alone. It is evident, however, that an inquiry is necessary on behalf of the worker. I propose now to make a quotation from a report by the organizer and secretary of the Mackay Branch of the Australian Sugar-Growers Union, in which he deals with the situation in the Mackay district. The followI t ing shows how hollow is the cry in regard the imaginato the scarcity of labourAlready there are over 200 names on the unroll at the Labour Bureau, besides a considerable number of men tramping the disshould trict in search of toil. The men employed in the mill are seething with discontent, and are disgusted at the supercilious indifference wiUi which tlieir employers to treated the just claims of this union. He concludesWorkers, keep away from Mackay. The conditions under which you will be asked to work are degrading. Wages are from 22s. 6d.; hours from ten to twelve per day. The wages recognised by the Minister are 22s. 6d. per week for men employed by the week, and at the rate of 30s. per week in the case of those employed by the day. ",156
1066,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes . I do not know how that scheme has worked out, but a* strong protest was entered against it by a deputation of sugar-growers which waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs on 20th May, 1908. Let me compare the wages paid in the sugar industry with the schedule of rates agreed to by the Australian Workers Union for workers employed in districts corresponding to those in which sugar workers toil for ten or twelve hours per day for a wage of 22s. 6d. per week. Remember that the work done by several classes of men in the Australian Workers Union schedule is certainly not so strenuous or severe as is that connected with sugar growing. In the case of a gardener, for instance, the Australian Workers U nion insists that he should be paid in every State-35s . per week. Will any one say that the work done by a gardener, in a cool and healthy climate, is to be compared with the strenuous work done by a man in a cane-field in a moist climate like that of the northern, coast of Queensland? In fact, many people contend that cane cutting is only fit for black labour, and certainly coloured men have The following rates shall be paid in the respective Boundary riders No one will say that a boundary rider Mu3terer8 Bullock drivers ..

If a representative body like the Australian Workers Union decides that these are fair and reasonable rates in Queensland, and in other States corresponding to Queensland, why should the Minister of Trade and Customs allow these unfortunate cane-cutters to be pressed below them? The Minister has power to withhold the bounty at any time, unless the wages paid for cane cutting correspond to the wages paid in other industries in the surround ing districts",156

The industry which is subsidized out of the per national Treasury should, therefore, be I week should like to dwell for a moment on the effect that the tax on sugar has on other industries, as well as on the workers. Perhaps the Government of the right honourable member for Swan should not be blamed for imposing this import duty. He and others who acted with him are, however, entitled to plead that in attempting to transform sugar-growing into a white man's industry, they could borrow no lesson from the experience of other nations. They were like mariners in a new and uncharted ocean. It seems to me, therefore, that we may criticise, or even condemn, our sugar legislation, without holding either the present Government or the Opposition entirely responsible ing what threatens to be an irremovable millstone around the necks of the people. I feel all the more free to speak frankly, because ever since I realized the real drift of our policy I have spoken and voted consistently against its continuance. My reasons are, briefly, that sugar is an indispensable article of diet, and should not be heavily taxed, if taxed at all. It is used in every household in Australia; and, consequently, the great burden is borne by the masses-by the wage-earners, who are endeavouring to rear families. Sugar is one of the chief ingredients in jams, preserved fruits, confectionery, biscuits, condensed milk, and other Australian products; and the tax has the double disadvantage of raising, the cost to the consumer, while impeding exportation to foreign markets. Again, such, a tax lacks the essential element of justice. A protective duty, to be fair, should operate equally over every part of the protected, area. It should give the same advantage to an industry in Tasmania as in Victoria; and it should place no handicap on a South Australian which is not borne by a Queenslander. Now, this protective duty on sugar does not fulfil this canon, of any just scheme of taxation:. It confers no advantage whatever on four States of the Commonwealth which do not grow and are not likely to grow cane-sugar. On the contrary, it is a distinct handicap on them. This sugar tax is levied principally for the benefit of Queensland, although New South Wales gains to some slight extent. It seems to even run counter to clause 99of the Constitution, which prohibits the Commonwealth from giving preference to one State or part thereof over any other State or part thereof. . Before dealing with that phase, however, I should like to quote the opinions of some jam manufacturers as to the effect which the increased price has on their industry. We have as much right, I take it, to have regard to the people who are growing fruit as to the people who are growing cane. Last June, when the price of sugar was raised, a Melbourne newspaper interviewed some of the jam manufacturers, and Mr. Peacock saidLast year Australian sugar was being sold in South Africa at £12 ios. a ton at the same time that we were paying £ 1 8 15s. a. ton. There is a duty of £ 6 a ton, and the gainers from that are not the Queensland growers but the Sugar Company, and. the chief losers are the fruit growers of Victoria and Tasmania. for placThen he was asked the questionDo you mean that raising the price of sugar is tantamount to taxing the fruit-grower ?-Ta x ! I should think it was. With sugar at the present price, every orchardist is paying a tax to the Sugar Company of £ 6 to £ 8 an acre a year. No wonder the company can make a profit of a million sterling in a year "" Tax "" is not the word. They raise the price in the face of such colossal profits, and with the biggest crop ever known right ahead of them. Tn an' attempt to help the growers against the company, the Prime Minister is apparently going to raise the duty again. It is the wrong way to go to work. Why should our fruit growers be ruined in an attempt to benefit the Queensland sugar-grower. Another large manufacturer, Mr Robertson, was equally emphatic. Referring to the^duty, he said It is. injurious to our industry. The extra price cannot,, in the great bulk of our output, be passed on. Confectionery is a luxury, and to raise the price is to diminish the output. That goes without saying. Then he proceeds to show the autocratic way in which the Colonial Sugar Refining Company deals with its customers; and he generally bears out the statement of Mr. Peacock that the impost very seriously hampers the jam industry.",157
1069,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,That manufacturer participated in a pretty fair slice of Protection.,158
1070,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I admit that jam is protected; but if the honourable member will look into the figures, he will find that there is very little real Protection when the price of sugar is considered.",158
1071,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I was thinking of the confectionery manufacturer.,158
1072,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,There is very little confectionery imported.,158
1073,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,But the manufacturers enjoy a large measure of Protection.,158
1074,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I shall admit that; but the honourable member surely has some sympathy for the housewife?,158
1075,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I am not discussing that phase at all.,158
1076,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"When sugar was at a high price, the housewife paid, retail, 3d. per lb., or 15s. or 16s. per 70-lb. bag. But, putting the protected industries out of the question, there is a hardship inflicted on consumers generally throughout Australia. I have here an extract referring to the strong position which the Colonial Sugar Refining Company occupiesThis is the Mrs Gummidge among Australian companies. Its corner of the fireside is the and surest in the Commonwealth, the easiest, but still it's a lone lorn cretur and everything goes contrary with it. Its chairman's speech is always damp. Nothing is ever quite right. Now they've had a strike. Otherwise season's work is not unsatisfactory,"" the C.S.R. Co. admits that much things must have been remarkably profitable indeed. a matter of fact the accounts for the half-year show a profit of £168,881. As I have shown, the company pay dends, and put away profits at the rate of £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. I should like show the Committee the amount which we have paid in subsidizing not merely whiteindustry. grown, but actually black-grown sugar. The increased cost of the sugar to the sumer, owing to the import duty, since imposition has been £8,886,360. The ministration of the bounty has cost £ 5 3 J ° 8 7 > and repatriating the Kanakas ;£is,3°°> or a total of .£8,952,747. is only fair to give credit for the difference between the Excise duty and the bounty as received by the Treasury. difference, according to the official returns, represents for the years up to 1910, £2,005,995 . Deducting that from total cost of the industry to Australia, get ,£6,946,732 as the net cost to the try. people of Australia of our sugar policy dare. The payment of nearly £7,000,000 in eight years makes the industry an sive one to the Commonwealth, and one only rejoice that this country is so rich virile as to stand it, and further to calmly consider the continuance of the subsidy the same colossal scale. It will not be denied that the QueensThat land grower, after paying the Excise receiving the bounty, has a net benefit £ 5 per ton on every ton of sugar he grows. The total production of sugar 1902 in Queensland is 836,106 tons, in New South Wales, 166,456 tons, or of 1,004,562 tons. The white grower has thus been subsidized in those years to extent of £5,022,810. price of i A household sugar during the years 1905-9 inclusive has been as follows 1905, £ 2 1 16s. 8 d . ; 1906, £ 2 0 is.

That information is obtained from the Civil Service Co-operative Stores, and will, I think, be found absolutely reliable. The retail price to the small consumer is, of course, considerably more. The average wholesale price, free of duty, during those years would be about £ 1 4 ios. per ton. On that basis, the total production of whitewarmest grown sugar since 1902 is worth something and its chair over ^£14,500,000, so that the white grower has received a direct subsidy of over 35 per cent, of the value of his crop, and a pro"" the tection equivalent to 43 per cent, of the and when same. His share of the Excise revenue, As to which he contributes only £ 1 a ton, while the black grower contributes £ 4 a ten, amounts to nearly 60 per cent, of the diviwhole. Yet, despite all these direct and indirect subsidies, the white grower is either to unwilling or unable to give decent wages and labour conditions to the workers in the When we consider the grower of sugar conby black labour, we are confronted with its an. extraordinary position. We were told adthat by the deportation of some 4..000 Kanakas, the industry would be handed cost over entirely to white workers. I have \ It heard the Kanaka described as, of all coloured aliens, the least menacing to the racial purity of Australia. At any rate, The he was confined chiefly to field work, and did not threaten the existence of white men in other industries, as do the Chinese and the Japanese. We have, however, not got we rid of coloured labour in the indusAt the end of last year, the tofields and mills were harboring no less than 2,325 coloured workers, and expenthe actual production by coloured lacan bour in Queensland this year shows an and increase. The greatest satire on our policy is that, although designed to extinguish on the black grower, it has actually made him a present of £ i , 3 5 S > 3 since 1902. I 2 is a startling statement, of which honand orable members have failed to realise the of significance. A national policy, designed to benefit the white growers,' and promote since the employment of white labour, has acand tually succeeded in making a present of a total that amount to the growers of sugar by black labour ! I notice that the statement the excites comment; but, if some of the other The wholesale States were represented by gentlemen as five active in looking after State interests as : are some of the members for Queensland, 8 d . ; we should, I venture to say, hear a great deal more about it. At any rate, there are the facts, vouched for by official records and documents. I do not think not that even the honourable member for Capriing cornia will deny the accuracy of the calcutax lation. A point worthy of being stressed is that every increase in the price of sugar means that the consumer pays an additional subsidy to the black grower. That is another aspect of the matter which we have since. utterly failed to realise. In 1907, the average price of household sugar, import duty added, was £ 1 9 15s. per ton. If paid the black grower then to produce sugar at £ 1 9 15s. a ton, he must now be making a fortune when the price has gone up £22 16s. 8d. I have prepared a table showing the amount of subsidy obtained growers of sugar by black labour from 1902 to 19.10. It will be remembered that the rate of subsidy was £ 3 a ton from 1902 until the ist January, 1907, and that been £ 2 per ton since then.",159
1077,Mr HIGGS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Does the honourable memto ber say that we pay a subsidy to the black grower ?,160
1078,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Undoubtedly . All sugar grown in Australia is protected to the can extent of £ 6 per ton; the black grower pays £ 4 per ton Excise; consequently, he receives £ 2 per ton subsidy from the payers of Australia.",160
1079,Mr HIGGS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Does the honourable membecause ber regard all Protective duties as bountion ties?,160
1080,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I do not. But, in this case, the Protectionist duty regulates price of sugar precisely. If we took the £ 6 import duty, sugar would be £ ton cheaper. If we put on anodier £ a ton import duty, the price would be exactly £ 3 per ton higher. I have preworld's pared the following table:SUBSIDIZED BLACK-GROWN SUGAB. Queensland ... 392,634 ... £1,177,902 New South Wales ... 9,502 ... Queensland ... 70,849 ...

They should, at least, arouse doubts as to our methods of responding to the aspirations of the people for a White tralia. I should like to dwell for a moif, ment on the high price of sugar today. Sugar is an article of diet for which [238] is no effective substitute. It is used in every household in the land, and we must forget that it is the poor who are bearthe heaviest end of the burden of a on sugar. The price of a 70-lb. bag has risen since last year from 13s. 4d. to 15s., and the retail price of the 12-lb. bag is 2s. iod., or over £ 2 6 per ton.",160
1081,Mr SCULLIN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,There has been a drop,160
1082,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am giving the prices ruling when I got the information from it the Civil Service Co-operative Society. There has been a trifling drop during the last few weeks. As I was absent in New to South Wales, assisting at the elections there, when the Sugar Bills were before by honourable members, I may be allowed to read the figures which I prepared at that time. In quantities of 12 lbs., sugar was then being retailed at 2s. iod., or over it has £26 a ton, the wholesale price being £22 16s. 8d. There can be no doubt as the injurious effects of the high price of sugar on confectionery, condensed milk, and other manufactures in which it is a large ingredient. I do not think that it be truthfully affirmed that the existence of high prices here is due to a shortage, in the Australian production, or to an intaxcrease in the cost of production. The price of sugar goes up in Australia, not there is a decrease in the producof our cane-fields, or because the cost' of production has increased, but at the will of a monopoly. Prices here do not the .depend on the two factors which should off regulate them', and which regulate the 6 a prices of other products. The prices of 3 sugar in Australia depend on the outside market. When there is a shortage in the productions, and Australia has to import sugar, the local monopoly is able to increase the price. It is worth the con1902 to 1907. sideration of this Parliament to see whether Tons. Subsidy. that cannot be prevented. Whenever there is 28,506 a shortage in the world's crop advantage 1907 to 1910. is taken of it by the monopoly here to £141,698 raise the price of Australian sugar, al7,° 6 2 though the cost of production may have £'.355» I 32 remained stationary. Because this year we shall require to import 42,000 tons of we shall have to pay on the 200,000 of locally-grown sugar an artificially increased price, equal to the cost at which the foreign sugar can be landed here duty Auspaid. The position would not be so bad when there was a plethora of sugar in the world's markets, the prices dropped; there but when that happens we cannot take advantage of it because of the import duty. However values outside may fall, the prices of sugar in Australia exceed the prices outside by the amount of the import duty. We must find a remedy for this state of things. When there is a plentiful supply in foreign markets, prices should drop. There should also be an inquiry into the condition of the workers in the industry. The schedule of rates fixed by, perhaps, the most representative body of workers in Australia, the Australian Workers' Union, for labour corresponding to that employed in the canefields, shows that the latter, though most, arduous, is most poorly paid. Hence the time has .come for the Minister of Trade and Customs to take steps to lift the wages of the cane worker up to the Australian Workers' Union standard. The Australian people are making an enormous sacrifice, to which there appears to be no prospect of an end. Is this sacrifice to be made for the capitalist alone? Why should not the worker, the real producer, the man without whose aid the industry would decay, receive at least as high a reward as his fellow in other less trying occupations? If the Australian Government is to go on pampering this industry at heavy expense to the whole nation, then it will be guilty of folly and negligence almost criminal if , having the power, it fails to secure for the operatives wages and conditions of labour equal to the best obtainable in other parts of thp. Commonwealth.",160
1083,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Wimmera) [4.7] The proposal to pay £500 as a reimbursement of costs incurred in the Harvester case possesses special features which must receive consideration. With you, Mr Chairman, I was a member of the Commission which inquired into the condition of the harvester industry. Parliament made a new departure in legislation, in imposing, in 1906, certain duties on certain classes of agricultural machinery, and attaching the condition that Excise should be imposed and collected if manufacturers failed to pay fair and reasonable wages. The Act came into force on the ist January, 1907. Mr Justice O'Connor was then President of the Arbitration Court, and determined certain rates of wages for New South Wales and South Australia. Application was made to him by the Victorian manufacturers as to when he thought the Court would consider what would be fair and reasonable wages for the Victorian - industry, and he gave an exemption, up to a certain date, and on the 13th May, 1907, sent the following letter to the Attorney-GeneralThere are over fifty applications by Victorian agricultural implement manufacturers for declarations under the Excise Tariff Act of 1906 set down for hearing next week in Melbourne. I understand from the Registrar of the Industrial Arbitration Court that a Board under the Victorian Factories and Shops Act is now settling the rates of wages in the agricultural implement makers' trade, and that they will have the scale of wages completed in about two months. It would be very much to the advantage of masters and men that the declarations asked for, if made, should be made on the basis of the scale of wages settled by the Board. I am, therefore, disposed to postpone all the applications until after the Wages Board scale has been issued. Before doing so, however, I would be glad if you could give the assurance that the Government will take no action to enforce the provisions of the Act against any manufacturer who has applied to the President of the Arbitration Court under the Act until his application has been final] v disposed of. The honourable member for Darling Downs was then Attorney-General, and he repliedRefer to the Minister for Trade and Customs. I am of the opinion that the assurance suggested may be given, and would suggest that an intimation be made to Mr Justice O'Connor that in respect of all applications for exemption, . from whatever State made, the Minister for Trade and Customs will suspend the collection of the Excise until the application is determined. Mr Lockyer wrote on the 18th MayMr Justice O'Connor recommends in regard to all applications already made for exemptions that we should not enforce Excise pending decision of Victorian Wages Board and determination of Arbitration Court as to scale of wages. Mr Groom concurs, and suggests it should apply to all applications for exemption from whatever State made. Approval recommended. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who was at the time Minister of Trade and Customs, replied from Sydney on the 25th MayApprove your recommendation that Excise be not enforced pending decision of Victorian Wages Board and determination of Arbitration Court as to scale of wages. A month or two later Mr Justice Higgins became President of the Arbitration Court, but he was not able to deal with these cases until November. At the outset, Mr. Justice Higgins complained that Parliament had neglected to state its opinion as to what must be regarded as fair and reasonable wages. He saidThe Commonwealth Parliament has by this Act imposed certain Excise duties on agricultural implements, but it has provided that the Act shall not apply to goods manufactured in Australia "" under conditions as to remuneration of labour which are declared by the President of the Court to be fair and reasonable."" My sole duty is to ascertain whether the conditions of remuneration submitted to me are "" fair and reasonable."" I have not the function of finding out whether the rates of wages have, or have not, been in fact paid since ist January, 1907, when thjs Act came into force. He complained further that the Act should have been more explicit as to the basis upon which the meaning of the words "" fair and reasonable wages"" should be determined. In other words, this Parliament threw upon the Court the responsibility of fixing a standard of fair and reasonable wages, and Mr Justice Higgins said that he had to fix upon a wage that would be sufficient to enable civilized people in a civilized community to live in reasonable comfort. After the making of his award some of the manufacturers closed down their works. They urged that the rates imposed by Mr Justice Higgins did not take into consideration the traditions or any fixed principles of the trade, such as could be ascertained from unions and by inquiries in other quarters. The Sunshine harvester works temporarily closed down, but subsequently accepted the rates fixed by the President of the Court. I am not going to say that the scale of wages which Mr MCKay presented to the Court were such as we could endorse, but as the result of the litigation that followed the Government yvere urged by the Labour unions to demand the payment of Excise by the various manufacturers in respect of a period anterior to the making of the award. They urged that since the rates of wages paid between the passing of the Act and the making of the award were below the rates fixed by Mr Justice Higgins, the manufacturers should be called upon to pay the Excise duty in respect of that period. So far as we know, the manufacturers were prepared, on the ist January, 1907, or as soon thereafter as possible, to pay the rates that might be fixed by the Court. The delay of eleven months that took place was due entirely either to pressure of business on the Court itself or to the failure of the Government to appoint the President of the Court to make an award in regard to the industry in Victoria.  the manufacturers did not wish to pay decent wages.",161
1084,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"They had nothing to do with it. Surely the honourable member will admit that between the ist January, [*38]-2 1907, and November of that year, when the Court fixed a scale of wages, the manufacturers could not possibly have known what was in the mind of the learned President of the Court, or the rates of wages that he was likely to fix.",162
1085,Mr ANSTEY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,When was the President appointed to deal with the industry in Victoria ?,162
1086,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"About June or July, 1907, and the decision was given in November of that year. According to the evidence presented to us, the unions actually waited on members of the Labour party and the Government, and urged that, although the Court or the Government was responsible for the delay of eleven months that took place before a standard rate of wages was fixed, the manufacturers should be compelled to pay Excise in respect of that period, because they had not paid the rates of wages subsequently determined upon by Mr Justice Higgins. That demand was^made, notwithstanding that in some cases there was a disposition on the part of the manufacturers to accept the award of the Court, although at first it rather startled them, and that one firm actually did decide to observe it. No special evidence was brought before the Harvester Commission to show that the manufacturers had not an equal claim with the men to be reimbursed their costs, owing to the Act being declared unconstitutional. If it be right that the workers be paid this amount, then the other side have an equal claim to consideration. The Harvester Commission, in a majority report, recommended that the unions should be reimbursed their legal expenses, but in a minority report I disagreed with that recommendation, and pointed out that it was not founded on any evidence presented to the Commission.",162
1087,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,How many were against the honourable member?,162
1088,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The majority report was signed by three members of the Commission. My objection was that the recommendation was not justified by the evidence tendered to the Commission.,162
1089,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Was not that a rather technical objection ?,162
1090,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I think not. The recommendation that the amount should be paid was based on a leading article which appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, and upon Mr Justice Higgins' judgment in the Harvester case, although neither was presented as evidence to the Commission. They were quite extraneous matters.",162
1091,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Ye t they were evidence on the point. Mr SAMPSO.N - The representatives of the agricultural implement makers' unions in Victoria and South Australia both presented a claim, and contended that it should be met, in view of the fact that the manufacturers had not paid, during the eleven months preceding the actual making of the award, wages in accordance with those fixed by Mr Justice Higgins. The agricultural implement-making industry is in a fairly flourishing condition. We had evidence before the Harvester Commission that a few of the smaller branches of the industry had been almost wiped out in South Australia; that in Western Australia it Was impossible to compete with the large manufacturers in Victoria; and that, in New South Wales, it was not an exclusive industry; but, on the whole, °we found that, as the result of the imposition of an import duty, the industry had largely extended its operations, ' and was one of which we might well be proud. I think it right that an increase of wages should have been made, and, as a matter of fact, the effect of the imposition of the duty was such that a general all-round increase took place. Unfortunately, there was an unpardonable delay of from twelve to eighteen months on the part of the Wages Board here in arriving at a decision; but, during the two years that the Act had been in force prior to our inquiry, there was a substantial increase in the wages paid to those engaged in the industry. I am not going to express any opinion as to the justice of this proposed vote. I simply contend that if the one side is entitled to be reimbursed their legal expenses, the manufacturers are even more entitled to consideration, because the delay in the appointment of the Court to deal with the question, and the making of an award under an Act subsequently held to be unconstitutional, led to their being badly treated. Although they Were prepared to pay the wages fixed by the Court, they were called upon to pay Excise in respect of a period prior to the making of the award, and that, in my opinion, was something in the nature of persecution. Mr. Justice Higgins fixed an independent standard, and said that the rates of wages submitted by the manufacturers did not conform to that which he had drawn up. The unions contended that a certain standard of wages was necessary.",163
1092,Mr ANSTEY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,And the employers would not pay that standard.,163
1093,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"They said they would pay it as soon as they could adjust themselves to the altered circumstances. We also have the fact that there was a conflict between two Judges. Mr Justice O'Connor, when President of the Court, gave exemption, which would relieve the manufacturers from the obligation to pay the Excise. His Honour evidently thought that he had constitutional power to do so, and he gave exemption to the 30th June, 1907. When Mr Justice Higgins laid down a new scale, the manufacturers applied for exemption up to the date of the award, because it was impossible to know what scale would be fixed; and His Honour, in reply, said, in referring to the case which had been made the test before the CourtI hope I do not exceed my duty in adding that if it were in my power to give a certificate of exemption to this applicant, on his undertaking to pay wages according to the Excise standard in the future, I should gladly do so. Here we have the conflict. It seems to me "" that the whole trouble is due to the long delays in appointing a President of the Court, during which time the manufacturers were kept in suspense. When they applied in the ordinary way, and the two Judges disagreed, the whole case was taken to the High Court, and the Act proved to be unconstitutional. If the Government have any sense .of fairness, they will deal with the manufacturers as they propose to deal with the men, especially in view of the fact that the former were treated in a very cavalier way by the Government, and were unfortunate in being penalized and harassed, much to the detriment, of their business.  avail myself of this opportunity to say a few words, because of my association with the Royal Commission referred to by the ' honourable member for Wimmera. At the outset, I may say that I arrive at quite a different conclusion from that of the honourable member. Under the Act the employers had to prove that they were paying fair wages and observing fair conditions; and they lodged sworn declarations to that effect. Those declarations were afterwards withdrawn; and it was proved that the rates sworn' to by some of the employers were not correct. Had this been an ordinary case of arbitration, the employees would have been a party to the ^plaint. But under the Act that was not 'their position. They had, however, to be - at the Court to protect their interests. The Crown was not represented, and there was no one there to advise the Judge, or to criticise the evidence given in support of the manufacturers. As a matter of fact, the - employees spent £255 out of their own pockets, and some of them were away from their employment for a considerable time collecting evidence. They proved that a proper standaid was not being observed; and it was on the evidence they produced that Mr Justice Higgins based his famous dictum as to a.living wage. Organizations in an adjoining State took similar action, and proved their case to the hilt in the 'Adelaide Court before Mr Justice 'O'Connor.",163
1094,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"But Mr Justice O'Con.nor fixed lower rates than those fixed in .Victoria, and also gave exemptions.  point, but merely endeavouring to show .the difference between the position of the - employers and the position of the employees in regard to any claim on the Government for reimbursement. The award was given in favour of the men; and had it been an ordinary case of arbitration costs would - have been awarded. That is not all, however, because the employers immediately raised the constitutional point in the High - Court, with the result that there was taken away from the men all the advantage they had gained,.at their own cost, by the award of Mr Justice Higgins. I am surprised - to hear the honourable member for - Wim-mera contend that the two parties stand - on the same footing in regard to any claim upon the Government. The decision of - the High Court resulted in wages representing thousands of pounds finding thenway into the pockets of the employers. The men had proved their case in both in-stances, and, through no fault, of their own, the Act was held by a majority of one Justice to be unconstitutional. It is conceivable that the Act might have been held to be constitutional by a majority of one Justice; but as it was, the manufacturers reaped all that pecuniary benefit, while, in some cases, the employee's were penalized by the closing down of factories.",164
1095,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The honourable member - does not mention that Mr Justice O'Connor gave exemption and awarded a rate of - wage much less than thatMn Victoria.  I think, the rate was 10 per cent., or, at any rate, considerably lower than in Victoria.",164
1096,Mr MATHEWS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Such a decision would not be given now with the present cost of living.  it would. I do not say that the manufacturers have no ground for complaint against Parliament and the Administration, because they were clearly led to believe that no action would be taken against them until there was a Wages Board in Victoria",164

Did the Government act on what Mr Justice O'Connor had recommended? Was any action taken on the letter the honourable member for Wimmera has read here today? Was not the ,£20,000 sued for dating back to the ist February? I may be wrong, but I feel confident that had the Excise been asked for from the day of the summons the employers would have complied.",164
1098,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"If the honourable member is speaking in reference to my attitude, I may say that I am' not disputing the justice of the £ 5 0 0 ; but if such a payment is just in one case it is equally just in the other.  differ from the honourable member. Some of the men had to work at reduced wages for a considerable time afterwards.",164
1099,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,On e of the witnesses stated that the biggest manufacturer was practically paying the rates of Mr Justice Higgins' award.  MCKay shut down his factory.,164
1100,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Onl y for a day; he was the one who did not shut down altogether.  wish to argue the matter any further. Twice as much as the amount in the Estimates would not cover the expenditure of the men. I am confident that every honourable member in the House can justify the action of the Government. These men had to be there to protect their own interests, and, as a matter of fact, sworn declarations regarding wages which were put in, before the men appeared to look after their own case, were afterwards to be incorrect.",164
1101,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The manufacturers did not fight the constitutionality of the because of Mr Justice Higgins' award, but because of the pressure of the Government in demanding the back Excise from them.  ferred to the fact that, in my opinion, Government made a grave mistake in pressing for the back Excise, in face the Judge's letter, and the letter of the Minister of Trade and Customs agreeing that they should not be prosecuted. That mistake on the part of the Governtained ment, or those in charge of the Departitself ment, forced the men into the Court to test the case. If it had not been for that we to which they were put. should not have been considering the quesstepped tion of the expenses of the unions today, and the men would have had much more than is set down in these Estimates in shape of additional wages.",165
1102,Mr ANSTEY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Bourke) [4-47]--Th sum of £500 is insufficient for the purpose for which it is proposed to be voted. position has been offered to it for a variety of reasons, and, among others, it has opposed on the ground of logic, but while the part of this Parliament. there may be a large amount of logic the opposition offered to the vote, there does not seem to be much fairness or morality about it. It has been contended that the employer in this case ought stand in the same position as the workmen, and that if certain compensation is given to one party, it ought to be given also the other. Compensation ought to awarded, in my opinion, in proportion the validity of the claims made, and, ing by that standard the arguments of honourable member for Lang, and others, would appear that, in their opinion, i defendant in a case is given six months' imprisonment, the complainant ought, fairness, to be awarded ""the same treatment. In connection with the Tariff, we had mises made on behalf of MCKay and Combeen put. pany, and other agricultural implement manufacturers, that if they received a large increase of duty they would be able tend their businesses, and pay vastly creased wages. They made that promise the country. Parliament met their wishes, and raised the duties. The manufacturers then, having got the increased protection for which they asked, ignored their gations to their workmen, and violated their ..word to Parliament and the country. moment they did that, - they put themselves shown out of Court. The Excise duty was to have come into force on the ist January, 1907, and it was the duty of the GovernAct ment at that time to enforce the Act, and collect the Excise as they would any other duty or tax. Had the Government discharged that duty, and put the law into there would have been no need to the put the men to the trouble of testing the question in the Court, and the manufacof turers would have been faced with the alternatives of paying Excise, or testing the constitutionality of the Act at that point. If they had gone into the Court, and oba judgment to the effect that the Act was unconstitutional, the men would have been saved all the worry and expense The men then in, and we have it in evidence that statements of wages paid to the workmen, as already put before the Court, were the shown to be absolutely untrue. In fact, no sooner did the employers know that the men would defend the case than they withdrew e their claim in that regard, because they knew that they could not possibly furnish Opthe evidence necessary to substantiate it. They have, and had, no claim in equity, been or in any other way, to consideration on The men in have been put to immense trouble and expense, and the Government seem to have erred, not upon the side of excess, but on the side of over caution, in voting a sum to to recoup them. The employers, on the other hand, have no claim whatever. They first of all promised the country that if given to increased protection, they would pay inbe creased wages. When the increased proto tection was given, they repudiated their testpromise, and the Government of the day the failed to put into operation the law which it would have compelled the employers to f a test its constitutionality. The present Government are doing a very tardy act of in justice in putting on the Estimates a sum of £500; which is by no means too much, proto meet the expenses to which the men have",165

The honourable member for Bourke quite right in attacking Mr Hugh "" Victorious "" MCKay; but there are a number diction. of other men in the industry. Mr MCKay produces, perhaps, the major part of the implements turned out in Australia, and has the bulk of the trade.

If these small men did face a High Court action, I am sure my honourable friend would be delighted to see that justice ladled out alike to them as well as to the supporters of the Government. It would be rather hard to judge which way the manufacturers of harvesters would vote a general election. I do not suppose Mr. Hugh "" Victorious '' MCKay would be a very energetic supporter of mine. I think his most active friend in this Chamber would certainly be the honourable member who, when Minister, on Mr MCKay's ipse dixit, put up the price of harvesters to local producers by about 50 per cent, shutting out imports.",166

That was the only in the honourable member for Hume man could give the House. He promised the House, on that occasion, to give the importing firms an opportunity of proving the bona fides of their invoices at the place was of production in Canada; and I think he undertook to secure evidence on the subject from the Canadian Government. The evidence from the Canadian Government was in very unsatisfactory to the honourable member ; and, in spite of his promise to this Chamber, instead of giving every facility to the importers to test their bona fides by taking evidence on commission in Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia was found resisting an action on the part of the imour porters to have evidence taken for them by there in that way ! The very thing which the honourable member for Hume promised6738 Estimates.

1118,Mr FRAZER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It is not fair to assail a member's character in his absence.,167
1119,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"It is absurd to suggest that I am assailing the character of the honourable member for Hume because I am criticising certain departmental action that be took. He placed such reliance on Mr. Hugh ""Victorious"" MCKay that he was willing to take his statement without real evidence, and to increase the price of harvesters to the Australian producer by 50 per cent. I ask Ministersnot to be swayed by the sort of argument addressed to the Committee by the honourable member for Bourke, who took the view that only the members of a certain union are entitled to assistance, cause, at great expense, they tried to keep the Wolf frorfi the door, or, more properly speaking, took it into their employment.

The Government of .the day .blundered in not enforcing, at the earliest possible moment, the rights which it thought Parliament had conferred on it. We passed an Act giving special protection to the manufacturers of harvesters, on the condition that they should pay fair standard rates of wages to their employees. One of the largest of those who benefited paid, not fair standard wages, but low wages, amounting in some instances almost to sweating rates. Had the Government enforced the collection of the Excise duty intended to punish such"" action, the invalidity of the Act would have been dis--oveTed much sooner, and the employees concerned would not have been put to the expense of testing it by fighting claims in the Court. Not only was the union put to enormous expense, but legal gentlemen and others assisted them at considerable personal sacrifice. If it were proposed to repay the whole of the expenditure incurred in prosecuting the claims of the employees, I should vote for it. As our legislation was declared to be unconstitutional, we should make some return to those Avho suffered' from it. I shall vote for ""the item as I would vote for the paj'ment of a still larger sum, because I do not think that ,£500 is enough to recompense the union for thebe- expense to which its members were put through no fault of their own, but because of the inaction of the Government of the day.",167

What is the use of having a trawler fo go - out upon the high seas and collect fish, if some arrangement be not made for its supply to retail sellers in the country dis- triers? Is the trawler to be utilized for practical business purposes, or are its catches to be thrown back into the sea?

During the past twelvemonths I have taken some interest in the work of the Endeavour, and I do not think that the Common-wealthi's getting value for its expenditure upon that vessel. The trawler has already justified its construction, in that it has proved the 1 existence of very prolific fishing grounds, especially along the eastern coast of Australia. From personal information, I know that there are at least twospots-on e at Twofold Bay and the other outside of Bowen-wher e the trawler can-, with two shoots, of the trawl, fill its available bunkers with fish without any appreciably diminution of {he supply which is there available. I repeat that the trawler has proved the existence of very extensivefishing grounds along our coast. That was primarily the object of the Government in acquiring the vessel. The idea was thai, as the result of her work, a cheapfood supply might be added to that which is obtainable in the cities, and that possibly commercial ventures in the way of canned fish might be opened up. But, although 1 the vessel has proved the existence of an abundant supply of fish along our coasts, not (he slightest effort has been madeto turn that supply to commercial advantage. I confess that it would' be a pity if the work of the trawler were interrupted bafore she has tested the waters of thewesi coast of Australia. But it is because I think the management of this Department is a complete failure thaS I draw attention to the matter. I have already drawn the attention of the Minister to certain rather startling matters connected with the directorship, and I am hoping that as the result of that information and other particulars which he may have obtained, definite steps will be taken by him either to improve the usefulness of this vessel, or to give up the work altogether. _ It has been shown that there ; is a possibility of the trawler d'oing something to build up the fishing industry, but valuable time is being wasted and heavy expenditure has been incurred without any result. Only today I received a letter, which I have forwarded to the Minister of Trade and Customs, as to the failure to utilize the trawler in the best possible way. This expenditure of £7,77.5 in respect of the current financial year is either absolutely unwarranted, or no use is being made of the information that has been supplied. The reports of the cruises of the trawler show that considerable work has been done, but nothing like what we might reasonably have expected.

I have drawn attention to it year after year since the building of the trawler, and may say, in passing, that I am a rather enthusiastic coastal fisherman. If the investigations made by the trawler on other parts of our coast have not been more successful than have its investigations of the coastal waters of Tasmania, then so this expenditure is a deliberate waste of money. There are some very fine varieties of fish in Tasmanian waters, and a large English and Scottish company is now in process of formation to establish works on our eastern coast with a view to the development of the fishing industry. I believe that the industry promises to be an exceedingly valuable one. All information relating to fishing in Tasmanian waters has long been known to local residents, and it is upon that local information that this company is being formed. The operations of the trawler have not been productive of any practical results so far as a knowledge of our eastern waters is concerned. Reports have been presented by its officers that certain fish are to be found in certain waters, when, as a matter of fact, their existence there has been known for half-a-century to our own people, and the varieties referred to have been caught there by many persons outside the industry. We are spending something like £6,000 a year on the Endeavour, and so far have not had anything like an adequate return for our money. Instead of the vessel doing a little investigation work here, and a little there, it should be sent into new waters rather than into waters where edible fish have long been known to abound. I am told that the coastal waters of Queensland for some hundreds of miles have practically never been tested for trawling purposes. Instead of the trawler wasting time, as she has been doing, on the southern coast, she might well investigate those waters. We have a right to demand the adoption of business-like principles in this connection. The fishing industry of Australia, I believe, is destined to be a good one.",169
1140,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Does not the honourable circumstances in the case. member think that the trawler has been long time in proving that fact? Mr - MCWILLIAMS - The trawler has proved nothing so far as the Tasmanian coastal waters are concerned. I think that the whole of the operations of the trawler tion. from the very commencement have been a series of mistakes. 'There has not been definite plan of operations, and the vessel has spent a considerable portion of her time in waters which have been known for years, to the neglect of hundreds of miles gation. of waters on the west coast of Australia and valuable to navigators. the coast of Queensland which are pracmight tically untried from a fisheries point of view. I trust that the Minister will give special attention to this matter. If we going to maintain the Endeavour at a cost of £6,000 a year, the Government should at least see to it that Australia receives some return for the money. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [5.32] - 1 should like to have some infortrawler mation as to who authorized the trawler be diverted from the purpose for was designed and put in commission purposes other than those for which money was voted by Parliament last year.

The expedition may have been in the interests of - science, and of some benefit to the whole of Australia ; but, whatever the circumstances, I hope the granting of the use of the trawler on this occasion will not be taken as a precedent for similar departures from its legitimate work.

1150,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Wentworth) [5.50] - I wish to introduce a matter of some importance, but I shall not take up muchtime in dealing with it. It is under Ministerial consideration, and I am sure that honourable members will also give it attention. Some time ago I asked some questions with regard to the value of aviation in military operations. I suggested that the Government should take some stepsto see' that Australia was not left as far behind in this new science as it has been in the science of wireless telegraphy. The matter has now passed in other countries out of the experimental stage from a military point of view, and has reached thestage of practical usefulness The officers of every army regard aviation as a necessary adjunct to military operations, the aviator having unrivalled opportunity of gauging country, and troops in possession of country, and so enabling a commander in the field to secure an enormous advantage over another who is not assisted in this way. I shall put in a few words the state of the matter in other countries so far as I can gather the facts. In France I think they have a vote of some ,£800,000 for aviation in connection with military work. There are some sixty military machines, and 800 private machines at the call of the military authorities. Bonuses are given to soldiers making flights, and aeroplane stations are established on the French coast. One can see how valuable that must be to a country that does not command the sea. It is able to get greater intelligence than it would be possible for it to secure with hordes of small torpedo boats such as the French have. In the Japanese service, four captains and twenty-four lieutenants, or twenty-eight officers in all, are now undergoing aviation instruction in Germany. The Japanese Government have ordered two big air-ships, I suppose on the Zeppelin model, and have arranged for stations for erecting and repairing air-ships. This Japanese aerial activity is one which we in Australia view with special interest. In this country, so far, we have done absolutely nothing in this connection. I do not think that we have an officer inquiring into the matter, or that we have any Department that regards it as its special responsibility. I suggest to the Committee that it is about time the Government of Australia got a move on in this matter. Perhaps the best way in which to deal with the subject would be to import a few aviators. My own idea is that it is necessary to learn the ABC of flight before we start manufacturing machines. In France men learn to glide: that is to go through the air on gliders, before they learn to direct an aeroplane in the air. We have at present in Sydney started among a small school of enthusiasts a number of gliders, but I think we might import an aviator or two for the service of ithe Australian Government, whose services might be used for the instruction of a few selected officers in aviation, and, if they had any spare time on their hands, it might be arranged to allow them to teach private aviators for a sufficiently heavy fee to enable us to get some return out of the venture. I cannot speak with absolute authority on the point, but I think that in France Government instructors in aviation schools are permitted to instruct outsiders on payment of a pretty heavy fee. If we imported a couple ""of aviators, it might be advisable to start with a single machine or, perhaps, two. I do not know whether it would be advisable for the Government to get advice as to the best machine to start with, but, whatever might be the cost or method adopted to deal with the matter, the time has gone by for saying that the Government need not do anything this year. It is about time we woke up on this question. I received an urgent telegram today from Lieutenant Taylor, a gentleman who is very much interested in this matter. He wired to me to say that the report in the Daily Telegraph with reference to ithe Government purchase of Bleriot aeroplanes is incorrect. I have looked up the statement to which I assume Lieutenant Taylor's telegram to me refers, and I find the following in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 22nd NovemberNo one can blame the Federal Defence Department for contemplating the purchase of a couple of Bleriot machines, which are under offer to them. It is understood that recently they sought advice from Lieutenant Taylor, of Sydney, and that his report was favourable. That, I believe, to be the statement which Lieutenant Taylor informs me is incorrect. But if the Government is contemplating the purchase of a couple of machinesand my own opinion as to the various types is valueless- I hope they will not spend a year worrying about the type which they will select, and thus put us a year further in arrears in dealing with this matter than we are. Aeroplanes are something like motor cars, and, so far as I can gather from reading scientific papers, there are a number of machines manufactured now which may be said to be safe and serviceable in good hands. If the Government import a couple, and a couple of aviators so as to start a school of aviation here, I have no doubt that the Australian people will soon acquire a taste for this new science, and we shall, perhaps, be able to manufacture locally all the machines we require, whilst we should encourage the inventiveness of the Australian people. It is of no use to offer a prize for the best invention, because very often the man who competes invests the few hundred pounds he has in making a machine, and then, from want of knowledge of flight, the first time he uses it it is destroyed. We should, teach men to fly before we ask inventors to build machines, otherwise . all their labour may be wasted. I direct the serious attention of the Ministry to this matter. I point out what foreign countries are doing, and contend that it is now time that Australia got a move on, and did her share in advancing this new science.",171

I am an ardent advocate of any proposal which will give to the ranker an opportunity to raise himself to the Permanent Staff. At the same time, I am in favour of requiring that whoever may aspire to be an officer in the Permanent Forces shall subscribe to proper standards in equipment and qualification. I am not in favour of opening the door to political influence. I should like the determination of these matters to be left, as was originally intended, in the hands of the Commandant of the College.

However, that go for the present. I do not intend to discuss these Estimates except to inquire what is being done with regard to the small-arms factory and its management. I understand that Mr Clarkson is not comlast ing out to be its manager. When he was sent Home, a year or two ago, to superleft vise the details of the small-arms machinery-h e was afterwards appointed to in conjunction with Professor Byles in the overseeing of the building of the destroyers-it was distinctly understood that he would return to take charge of small-arms factory.

I word to Mr Clarkson to come back months ago, but he pleaded all sorts of excuses - that he had better stay there, and see the machinery, and I at length competent engineer. agreed. But it occurs to me that whoever is going to manage the factory member should, at any rate, be on the spot when . the machinery is being installed. It is of the utmost importance that the manager the factory should be there when the stallation of the machinery takes place. From all I hear, I do not think there so much trouble in connection with the building of the houses for the machinery as was suggested last night by the able member for Nepean. I understand that all will be ready in Lithgow for. reception of the machinery when it arrives from America, but it is quite time we knew who was to be the manager of the factory docks, now that the former arrangements have the veryboth fallen through. Has the Minister made inquiries into the statements which apthe compass of their experience. peared in the newspapers concerning the faulty ' construction of the torpedo destroyers? I have always felt that great mistake was made in appointing Prothink fessor Byles to supervise the construction of the vessels. The matter should have been left with the Admiralty. Instead that, the previous Labour Government, when ordering the vessels, as they did, suddenly, appointed Professor Byles, private naval architect, who received, understand, a commission of £5,000 looking over the boats, when the work could have been much better done by the Admiralty, with, perhaps, no cost whatvate docks. ever to the Commonwealth. It is strange that this Socialistic Government, whenever they get a. chance, always make a bee-line for private enterprise.

Minister, and Attorney-General) [6...I6]L-With , regard, to the arrangement arrived at. between myself, and the Leader of. the Opposition last, night, the facts are these :. I spoke to the honourable and learned .gentleman about the conduct, of public business:,, and asked him to assist, me to carry it through. I said I desired to get through the Estimates of the Customs Department, and he said that, members of his party - wished to raise in. connection with it matters, that, would cause a good deal of. discussion, and that he would be unable to help me further thanthe Treasury Estimates.. I said,. "" Very well,"" and so it went.. This, would be, roughly speaking, about half-past 9 last night. There was in the minds of both of. us, or, at any rate, these was in my mind, the idea that we should finish the consideration of that' part - of. the Estimates about 11. o'clock last night. I never dreamt that we should, go on all night, and I said to the honourable member for Newcastle, "" We. shall carry on to the Treasury Estimates."" He asked, "" All night?"" and I said, "" Oh, no; to a reasonable hour and no-more."" It never dawned - on me that we should have to sit all night. In the circumstances* therefore, when I found at 8 o'clock in the morning that we were still where we ought to have been at II or 12 o'clock the night before, I felt - that the honourable and learned member would have viewed the circumstances exactly as I have viewed them if he had been present, recognising that the situation was entirely changed, and that we had to get through the business. The honourable member and myself had been discussing the possibility of closing the session to-night, or, at the worse, before train time tomorrow, and matters had been so arranged. It was suggested that certain matters should - come on after tea to-night, and so to a conclusion. I have thought it fair to the honourable member and myself to say what I have said on that point. So far as the Defence Bill is concerned, it was only about 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning when my attention was called to the fact that it had come down from the Seriate. For the last three or four weeks it has been the practice to deal with amendments made by the Senate before the close of the sitting during which they are received. To that there has never been any opposition. I was asked to say what the effect of the amendments was, and they fcave been dealt with. I consider that I was only bound in regard to the Estimates until EI or 12 o'clock, and if a message from the Senate had come at that time, I should havefelt at: liberty to ask the House to deal with it. I had no idea of taking advantage of any honourable member. In asking the House to agree to what the Senate had done in connection with the Defence Bill, I pointed out that the amendments which had been made on the motion of the honourable member for Wentworth were superfluous, inasmuch as, the clauses which he inserted are in the original Act. Under these circumstances the honourable gentleman has not done me justice in saying that I broke, an understanding. I do not say that he. was not under the impression that the understanding went, to the length he. spoke, of. But I was fairly entitled to. take the view which I have just., explained, and to act accordingly.",176
1207,Mr DEAKI N,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Ballarat) [6.22],-It is always unfortunate that a question of this kind should arise. The statement of the Acting Prime Minister is correct so far as it goes, and it goes all but the whole distance. He will remember that the first thing I asked him was what was to be the business for the night, and he replied, "" the Estimates,"" then, agreeing not to go beyond the consideration of the. Department of the Treasury. Therefore, I took it that the obligation upon him was not to deal with anything but the Estimates,, and only as far as that Department. I admit that he has put quite, a reasonable view in stating that the consideration of amendments made by the Senate is not to be regarded as an entirely new subject. Had he suggested to my honourable colleague, the member for Parramatta, who was here all night, that he proposed to deal with the Senate's amendments in the Defence Bill, I think that probably no objection would have been raised. But without the consent of the honourable member he ought not to have asked the House to deal with them. I am satisfied that he did not realise his obligation. It seems to me that my construction of the .arrangement was a natural one; that when told that the business ot the evening was to be the consideration ot the Estimates, that meant it would be the only business dealt with. What was needed was the consent of the honourable member for Parramatta to a departure from the agreement.",176
1208,Mr ROBERTS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Adelaide) [6.25] - I should be lacking in my duty did I not call attention to the astonishing statement of the honourable member for Parramatta a few moments ago, to the effect that the Commandant of the Military College, when he thought fit, should fight, not only the Minister of Defence, but even the Parliament. A more astounding statement it would be impossible for an honourable member to make. To suggest that a military officer, because he happens to be the Commandant of the Military College, would fight his Minister is bad enough, though the honourable member showed that Commandant Clarkson, whose position is inferior to that of Commandant of the Military College, to all intents and purposes fought him when Minister, because, when it was suggested that he should return from England, he made all manner of excuses. I wonder what the people will say of the suggestion that an officer should go further, and fight the Parliament. Are we to expect that, encouraged by such remarks from one occupying such a responsible position as that of Deputy Leader of the Opposition and ex-Minister of Defence, die Commandant of the Military College will march a squad of cadets, with its little bayonets and guns, fo the door of Parliament and, Cromwell-like, clear the chamber, establishing himself as Dictator, and exercising despotic sway over the people? Remarks such as that from the honourable member are calculated to encourage rebellion and mutiny, and to undermine the discipline which should be so strictly enforced in regard to the military. I refuse to believe that the Commandant of the Military College, whoever he may be and whatever his opinions, will presume to fight his Minister, though some Ministers appear to like to be disobeyed by their officers. I certainly doubt that any officer, whatever his rank, would presume to fight the Parliament. No doubt, when called upon to express their views, our officers will do so for the benefit of the public, and may even feel it incumbent to express opinions which they think likely to be of service; but no military officer is likely to do what the honourable member suggests. I regret that such a statement was made in this Parliament, which we claim to be Democratic-the Parliament of the people. The making of such a statement should be rebuked in the clearest and most emphatic terms.",176

1210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Parramatta) [8.0] - Shortl y before we adjourned for dinner, I was subjected to a violent, brutal, and vicious attack in which the military general of the House - accused me of all sorts of things owing to my innocent remark that I hoped the Commandant of the Military College would zealously guard the' standards of education to the' extent, if necessary, of fighting both the Minister and the House. There are some ' disordered individuals whose only notion of fighting is the use of a gun, or something of that kind, but I do not belong to that class of warriors. I am always a man of peace. What I sought to emphasize was that which is most emphatically emphasized throughout Lord Kitchener's report. If we are to have an Army in Australia, politics must be kept out of it. I am glad, indeed, that the honourable member's brutal attack upon my poor self enables me to emphasize the point. After laying down very tersely and clearly the principles regarding enrolment, Lord Kitchener went on to sayThese considerations show how completely a Citizen Force should be kept outside party House, politics. Political feeling in an army is always a serious drawback to efficiency, and may become a danger to the State. He returns to this thought on two other occasions. Speaking of the area officers to be appointed to instruct the Citizen Force, he says The essential importance of these duties to the nation will make the area officer the keystone of the Citizen ForceThe area officer is, of course, to be a College manwhose organization and fitness for war will chiefly depend upon the education and training received in the "" area."" Under this system, it is evident that the responsibilities of the area officer will make it a national necessity that he should be a carefullyselected man, thoroughly grounded and trained in his profession, and scientifically educated. No social considerations, no influence, nothing but efficiency should be allowed to affect the selection and promotion of these officers. Their work should be judged by results alone. Yet, again, he returns in another part of his report to the same subjectAny political interference with the management of such institutionthat is the Collegein which disciplinary training forms an important part, and the efficiency of which is so essential to the defence of Australia should be strictly avoided. I repeat, therefore, the statement that I made, and which gave rise to so much' perturbation of mind on the part of my belligerent friend, the Adelaide general. I hope that the Commandant of the M i l i tary College will sternly guard the standards of education which shall be set up there, and guard them, if need be, to the extent of fighting to the last ditch against any political influence that may be sought to be imposed. It is because I feel that the amendment of the Defence Bill made by the Senate-a n amendment which gives the Governor General, through his Ministers, the right to nominate appointees to - the College-is a breach already of the fundamental principles of Lord Kitchener's report that I have spoken as I have. hope that we shall try our very best to keep politics away from the Army, and for the first time in Australia give it a chance.",177
1211,Mr GLYNN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Angas) [8.7] - I dp not know to what the item in subdivision 4, "" Pay and expenses of exchange officers "" relates, but a few days ago, when I was in Adelaide, a gentleman, who takes a very keen interest in military matters, asked me was it possible, in determining length of service in the Australian Defence Force as a qualification for some of the incidental honours, to obtain recognition of service done at Home. I replied that I knew nothing about the matter, but I think that if the Minister would promise to look into it something might be done. I under-, stand that a good many men come out here at a comparatively early age, after they have served seven or eight years in the British Forces, and that on joining the Commonwealth Defence Force they desire that the two services should be reckoned in connection with whatever honours may be incidental to length of service. It is a comparatively small matter, but I draw attention to it in the hope that it will be looked into. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We shall into the matter. Proposed vote agreed to.

1215,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Franklin) [8.15]. - Has any decision been arrived at regarding uniforms for the boy scouts or for the junior cadets ? In my opinion, the Department is making a huge mistake in not providing uniforms for the cadets, because nothing could be more cruel than to ask a sensitive child of poor parents to appear on parade in, perhaps, ragged clothing side by side with the well-dressed children of people in better circumstances. The cost of the uniforms could be saved in other directions. It might be that the uniform would be the only decent suit a poor little unfortunate might possess; and we know that in such matters as dress none are so look cruel to children as children themselves.

1216,Mr OZANNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Corio) [8.20] - Before S we leave the Estimates for the Defence Department, I wish to refer to the of pay received by the members of the Perwealth Military Forces. manent Artillery. I was pleased to hear the remarks of' the honourable member Franklin when he protested against cadets appearing in the ranks in rags and tatters, I appeal to the honourable member now to help me to render a measure of well-demen served assistance to members of the PerArmy. manent Forces. At present, the men of the Permanent Artillery receive the magniwith ficent rate of pay of 2s. 6d. per day. One or two extras are allowed in the shape a suit of clothes, a couple of pairs of boots, and so forth. In regard to food, the Department is able to supply the Forces at as low a figure as 8d. per day per man. So that we may say that the total amount received by them amounts to something 3s. 6d. per man per day. Honourable members are well aware that wages all over Australia have risen within recent ^ 1 years. The only fair method of arriving „ at a comparison in order to determine whether the members of the Permanent Artil- „u . lery are being sufficiently remunerated, is ^ JZU r l 5 to set the payments made to these men side ^ by side with rates of pay in England. An investigation of the percentage of increase of wales paid to trades and callings in ealth.monw the Commonwealth over the rates paid in Great Britain, shows that such increases vary from 80 to about 120 per cent. us take one of the principal trade unions in Great Britain, the Amalgamated Society «J° of Engineers. That society consists of about 100,000 members. The minimum rate of pay in Great Britain is 23s. per week, whilst in the Commonwealth minimum rate is 54s. per week, a difference of 31s., equivalent to 135 per cent. maximum rate paid in Great Britain is 41s. per week, and the maximum rate in the Commonwealth is 90s. per per week, a difference of 49s., or 120 quartermaster per cent. If we apply a similar comparison to rates of pay received regimental by the police, corporation labourers, so forth, we find that those employed in Australia receive on an average about 80 per cent, in excess of rates paid in England, In considering whether the members of Permanent Forces are efficiently paid we have to recollect that men in the British Army enjoy pension rights, whilst the men 2 in our Permanent Forces are not entitled any pensions. Let us take the rates of pay to men in the British Army-having ; r e a r d to the commuted value of their pensions-and compare them with rates paid' rates to permanent members of the CommonI find that sergeant-majors of engineers, sergeant-major for armament artificers, and sergeant-majormaster gunners in Australia receive respectively 25 per cent., 13 per cent., and 25 per cent, more than the rates received byfilling relative positions in the BritishThose whom I have just mentioned are warrant officers. Dealing next non-comrnissioned officers and men, I find that a regimental staff sergeant-major of in the Australian Forces receives 14 per c e n t . more than a similar non-commissioned officer in the British Army; a regimental quartermaster-sergeant, 28 per cent, more;. a regimental quartermaster-sergeant armament artificer, 9 per cent.; a regimental' like quartermaster-sergeant armourer, 14 per c e n t . ; a company sergeant-major, 6 per c e n t . a ser geant, 14 per cent.; a corc e n t a bombardier, c e n t and a c e n t An a n a l is 0 f the s e nmc 0 ,,.

If we compare the consolidated pay rates in Great Britain with those in the Commonwealth, the following are the resultsWarrant Sergeant - Major, Engineers 8 7 13 Warrant Sergeant - Major, Armament Artificers 9 7 13 0 Warrant Sergeant - Major, Armourer 9 7 13 C 17 9 Warrant Sergeant - Major, Master Gunner, 1st Class . . 8 7 13 Staff Sergeant-Major 7 3 10 Begimental QuartermasterSergeant 7 3 11 0 13 Begimental Quartermaster Sergeant, Armament Artificer 8 3 11 0 Begimental Quartermaster Sergeant, Armourer 8 3 11 A company sergeant-major receives' 4s. day in Great Britain, and the magnificent service. sum of 5s. 9d. per day in the Commonwealth; a sergeant 3s. 2d. in Great ain, and 5s. in the Commonwealth; corporal 2s. 6d. in Great Britain, and 4s. in' the Commonwealth; a bombardier 2s. 3d. in Great Britain, and 3s. the Commonwiealth. Having had some experience of gunnery work, I am in position to say that a man who is qualified to fill the position of sergeant must fairly well educated. He must know somein thing of arithmetic, as many of the. lations necessary in gunnery work are intricate, and he must have a fairly good technical knowledge of gunnery. Vet in Commonwealth he receives only 5s. per day. In .addition he gets his food and few odds and ends, which at most, not amount to more than another is. per day. I appeal to the Minister representfence, ing the Minister of Defence to take consideration the fact that these men giving up their lives to the country, because after they have been a few years in These figures the service they become absolutely useless for any work outside. In the circumstances, 5s. per day is a totally inadequate payment for a sergeant. The honourable member for Ballarat, in his opening remarks, stated that in view of the finances of the Commonwealth it is necessary to cheesepare, but I do not think it is right that these men should be sweated in the way they have been in the past. I am' aware that the Minister of Defence has recognised that these men have been' sweated, and that he proposes to give a them a slight increase. As I understand 3 the Minister's proposal, it is to give thei* |1 men deferred pay at the rate of 3d. per Ig 09 day for gunners, and 6d. per day for nonss O0 4 HPI commissioned officers, and a rise of is - r s.P 4 d. s. d. s. d. per day for all ranks. O I am totally opposed to the principle of deferred pay.! 0 15 8 What right has any Government to withhold pay from any man? If such a thing, 17 9 were proposed in connection with a privatebusiness, it would be resented at once. If it were proposed, for instance, 0 15 8 to withhold a certain proportion of the0 13 3 amount paid to honourable members of this House, what would they be likely to say 3 about it ? If , applying the principle to ourselves we object to it, why should we, be14 11 cause we have the power, force it upon mento whom it is odious?

1218,Mr OZANNE,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"We have agreed to aprovision which practically blocks the pro6d. in motion of many men. These men wereeligible for certain positions in connection a with the Central Administrative Staff, but that also has been blocked, and, in all the be circumstances, the fairest thing we can dothe interests of these men and the chilcalcudren, whom many of them are rearing, is very to give them adequate remuneration for the services they render to the country.

If the wealth of country is worth protecting its protection worth paying for.

1219,Mr ROBERTS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Adelaide) [8.35] - I structional desire to bring under the notice of the .Committee a matter affecting warrant non-commissioned officers on the Instrucbeen tional Staff. I shall compare the pay which they receive with the pay received by officers of similar rank in their corps, in order to show that the pay given to structional non-commissioned officers is in tion, attain commissioned rank. every rank below that given to officers equal rank in other corps of the Defence Forces. I remind the Committee that we shall have to depend for an efficient force on the warrant and non-commissioned officers of the Instructional Staff. withstanding the fact that, in a few years, we shall have some officers who is .will have gone through the Military College, the real backbone in the cers provision of an efficient force will be the non-commissioned Instructional Staff. Much dissatisfaction exists at present account of anomalies of pay in the ferent branches of the Permanent Forces, e.g., a regimental sergeant-major Company Sergeant-Major Begimental Quartermaster-Sergeant Warrant Officer Garrison Sergeant-Major . . ""| 1st Class Master Gunner . . > Military Staff Clerk .. j It is pointed out that, in addition to ing the ordinary hours of the clerical staff, and doing similar work, the warrant and non-commissioned officers of the Instrucpay tional Staff are called upon to perform a large amount of evening instructional work, without being paid, like the military clerk, those of corresponding ranks. an allowance as tea-money, and also to such work on almost every holiday and halfscale Royal Australian Artillery receives 13s. the per diem, whilst a man in the same is rank in the Instructional Staff canin not get more than 12s. per diem, memalthough he may be an instructor of Furthermore, cases have occurred very recently of junior non-commissioned officers from conthe Army Medical Corps and Royal Australian Artillery being appointed to the InStaff, and at once, by reason of their higher pay, superseding a very large and number of good and able men who have in the corps for some years.

Many other cases could be quoted, but it sufficient to state that, whilst in the Instructional Staff Corps commissioned offireceive salaries equal to those in any other branch of the service, the following table shows that the warrant and nonon commissioned officers are, for some undifknown reason, paid at lower rates than the corresponding ranks of other corps of of the the.

I hope that the foregoing will suffice to show that good grounds exist for revising entirely the of warrant and non-commissioned officers of the Instructional Staff, with a view to equal rates prevailing in all corps for Failing a revision, it is urged that the present of pay of the Instructional Staff - whic h will be found in paragraph 77 of the Financial and Allowance Regulations for the Military Forces-shoul d be amended as from ist July, 1910, to read as follows :-43 > Staff Squadron Battery or Company Sergeant-Major 8 6 9 0 9 6 10 0 10 Staff Begimental Sergeant-Major 11 0 11 6 12 0 12 6 13 Garrison SergeantMajor 13 6 14 0 14 6 15 0 15 These rates are, approximately, the same as those prevailing in other branches of the Permanent Military Forces. Let me now years', refer to the increments of pay to warrant and non-commissioned officers of the Insioned structional Staff. The warrant and nonof commissioned officers of the' Instructional Staff are, with one small exception, the only tion of the commissions. persons in the Military Forces whose incresuggestions ments are bi-annual. In the other corps annual increments are given. The bi-annual increment is jQg 2s. 6d., and this, it urged, is paltry, more especially when other corps may receive a similar amount anThere nually and the smallest increment of the Public Service official is £ 2 0 . A warrant officer clerk receives an annual increment of £ 2 5 , thus increasing his salary nearly much in one year as his brother warrant Forces, officer of the Instructional Staff receives six years, yet both are of equal rank. With them. such cases occurring it is no wonder that a state of good feeling is lacking amongst the members of various branches, and hoped that some revision may be made whereby increments of equal value may be made to corresponding ranks of all branches. During the next five years the Minister have an opportunity to do good work in the direction of promotion to commissioned rank in the Instructional Staff Corps. Whilst the Regulations permit the younger memalong bers to compete for commissions, the senior warrant and non-commissioned officers are debarred on account of being, generally, forty years and upwards of age. Thus, length of service, even when coupled exceptional merit and ability, is an absolute bar to promotion, a condition which not be tolerated in any other Department, or in any business establishment. In South Australia a warrant officer has twenty-seven years' permanent military service, an excellent record, the medal for distinguished conduct in the field, and the educational qualification for a commission, yet he is unable to obtain promotion on account of being forty-three years of age. A number -2 8 SO so of the senior warrant officers of the Corps Ih S u o 4t h ! CD'S ""-3 ei3 CO divl ! 10 of Royal Australian Engineers and military livisi « staff clerks are given commissions as vacans. d. s. d, s. d. s. d. s. d. cies occur in their corps, and it is urged that the same advantages should be available to members of other corps. With the augmen6 tation of the Defence Forces a large number of commissions will be granted to young 0 and probably inexperienced men, which will 6 necessitate the experience being provided by the warrant and non-commissioned officers of the Instructional Staff attached to their area, while the pay for the experience will be given to the young officer of two or three service, and consequently it appears fitting that those warrant and non-commisofficers who have spent the best part their lives in the Permanent Forces should be selected for at least a proporI make these for the consideration of honourable members in the hope that they will go carefully into them, and particularly that is the Minister of Defence will give to them the attention which I claim they deserve. is one other point to which I desire to invite the attention of the Committee. I find that the warrant officers and non-commissioned officers have now to salute officers as of either the Permanent or the Citizen irrespective of whether those officers in are in uniform or in mufti, if they know",181
1220,Mr WEST,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"What nonsense! it is . Mr ROBERTS - It is nonsense. In many cases, unfortunately, young gentlemen receive a commission on one day and appear in uniform on the next day. On the folwill lowing day tiiey are doing their ordinary work, and if a non-commissioned officer of the Instructional Staff who has had an experience of twenty or thirty years comes and does not salute him, there is a military inquiry held, and in many cases the officer is suspended. I submit for the consideration of the Minister that there should be no necessity for non-commissioned with and warrant officers of the Permanent Forces to salute any officer unless the latter would happens to be in uniform.",182
1221,Mr SINCLAIR,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Moreton) [8.47] - I shall be very pleased if the Minister will state what is intended to be done with regard to the Ipswich rifle range. In that, district we have two very fine corps, and the longest range they can use is 700 yards, which, I understand, is not considered to be very safe. I should also like to know - the Department's intention in regard to the Redbank range. Some time ago a proposal was made that a range should be .purchased at Redbank, a locality which .would suit the whole district. As the new defence scheme will be put into force forthwith, I feel sure the range will be - needed for military purposes, and that the .Department will not get an opportunity - of getting another range at the. same price. - I do not intend to press the Minister for a reply at this moment unless, of course, he has it at hand. But I shall be very .pleased to know at the earliest opportunity - what is intended to be done in regard to - those two matters.",182
1222,Mr FRAZER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I have made a note of them.,183
1223,Mr THOMAS BROWN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Calare) [8.48] - My experience of the Defence Department during the past year has led me to form the opinion that it is one of the worse Departments in the Commonwealth. It is one of those Departments in which it is impossible to get anything done in a business-like way. According to the reports which we receive, the business is conducted - on the plan of one officer going up and undoing the work, of another officer in country - districts, or reporting against his recom.rnendations. The business is carried on in. a piecemeal manner. An officer for instance, sent into the country to attend to some work. He does not deal with the whole of the :work, but with only a small section of it. After a long delay, another officer comes or goesto report on another section, and very often 'he makes a report detrimental to his predecessor. I am credibly informed that it is within the experience of the Department to find an officer visiting a district nexion with certain works, and making a - certain recommendation, and on a later occasion condemning his own work and. his own recommendation. I hope that an attempt will be made to bring the Department into, something like a workable condition, and so do away with all the complaints and little frictions in country districts in connection with rifle clubs and rifle ranges, and the working and management of the Australian Light Horse. The Department seems to an outsider to be so completely torn and rent by internal jealousies and hatreds that it has no time for anything else. If that be the position, the more quickly it is reformed and brought into workable lines the better for the Commonwealth.",183
1224,Mr SAMPSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Wimmera) [8.49] - I desire to again draw attention to the small increase in the vote for rifle ranges. I agree with the last speaker that there is any amount of room for improvement in the Defence Forces. Cases of confusion, overlapping, and bungling such as he alluded to have come under my notice. I think that the Minister of Defence has any amount of work to do, and an opportunity of showing what he is made of in bringing the Department into a state of v business efficiency and also authority. I am sorry to see that the vote for rifle clubs is increased by only about £^2,000. The honourable member for Parramatta, when Minister of Defence last year, had a design of making greater use of the rifle clubs as a second line of defence, and I am sorry that he was not permitted to put it into effect, but I hope the present Minister will take particular notice of the circumstances, especially in regard to the country districts, where the facilities for mobilization are not, and never will be, as great as in the large centres of population. A few thousand pounds more could have been expended to great advantage in this direction. We have in the country districts certain rifle club associations which hold periodical competitions, is, but owing to the lack of proper facilities in the shape of rifle ranges their efforts in that direction are very much hampered, with a consequent loss of efficiency. I have, every reason, to believe that the present Minister sees in the rifle clubs a means of increasing the shooting efficiency of our troops, and I believe he is in sympathy with the extension of rifle range facilities in country districts, in order to in coninduce the formation of a greater number of associations, and more rifle shooting competitions. I hope the Honorary Minister will bring these matters under the notice of the Minister of Defence, and use his influence: in order to secure next year a very substantial increase in the vote for the encouragement of rifle clubs and the creation of rifle ranges.",183
1225,Mr FULLER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Illawarra) [8.53] - I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Wimmera as to the necessity for dealing more liberally with the rifle clubs. I have been endeavouring for some time to have rifle ranges established at Bulli and Corrimal, two large and important ' centres of population in my electorate. Time after time inspectors have been sent down to report on the various sites suggested, and I have written frequently to the Department, but nothing definite has been done. I hope the Honorary Minister will impress on the Minister of Defence the necessity of providing ranges in both these coastal towns, where a large number of expert riflemen are available. We are always talking in this Parliament about the necessity for encouraging rifle shooting, yet facilities ought to be provided by the Commonwealth in such big centres as these are not forthcoming. A dispute has taken place between the South Coast Rifle Association, one of the most important in the Commonwealth, and the heads of the Military Department in Sydney. For reasons which have been set out in a voluminous statement of claim that I forwarded to the Minister of Defence, the officers connected with the association were suspended. I understand that the suspension has now been removed, and I believe a suggestion has been made by the Minister to send an officer down to the place to hold a meeting in order to try to bring both parties together. I want to impress on the Minister that no meeting of that sort will be satisfactory. The matter is an important one, and involves the expenditure of public money. The. fullest inquiry should be made into it, and nothing but the fullest inquiry will be satisfactory.. The officers of the association still feel very keenly the action of the military authorities in suspending them. I think Colonel Wallace was State Commandant of New South Wales at the time. The officers of the association say that public money has been wrongfully expended, and I want the Minister to have the matter properly dealt with in the way I have suggested. Let those who have acted in an arbitrary manner at head-quarters be brought face to face with the officers of the association, and let the fullest investigation be made by an impartial and responsible officer of the Department. I trust the Minister will not allow those who have acted in this way towards the members of the association to evade the consequences of their action by attempting to hold any such meeting as has been suggested.",183
1226,Mr FRAZER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Kalgoorlie-Honorar y Minister and Acting Treasurer) [8.58] It is impossible for me to give to theCommittee the direct information which'would be at the command of the Minister who controls the Department, but I . canassure the honourable member for Corio that the Minister has in front of him a proposal in which consideration is given to the whole of the wages paid to those asso-; ciated with the Royal Australian Artillery. I believe that the announcement to be made by the Minister on that matter will' be in the direction of securing better conditions for those employed in that branch! that of our service than those that exist at present. I shall have the remarks of the honourable member for Adelaide, regardingdiscrepancies in different Departments, submitted to the authorities, and assure him that the Department will present a report'in reply to the statements he has made to-: night. I am not acquainted with the position of affairs in relation to the rifle ranges mentioned by the honourable member for Moreton, but when a rifle range reaches a certain stage it is transferred' to the Home Affairs Department,and the Defence Department temporarily loses sight of it. I have, however, made a. note of the two rifle ranges in which the honourable member is interested, and I will ask the Minister of Defence to givehis early attention to the requirements of those particular districts. In reply to the honourable member for Wimmera I wish to sav that the Government are desirous of affording the greatest possible facilities topersons in the country who are prepared to devote a portion of their time to rifle shooting with a view to becoming efficient marksmen. From my own knowledge of the Minister's desire to encourage rifle shooting I can assure the honourable member .that any definite proposals submitted to him will ' 1 !eceive the most careful consideration.

1227,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Gwydir)' [9.2] - I rise with some diffidence to bring under thenotice of the Committee a matter which hasoccupied the attention of certain members of this Parliament for a considerable time. As thirty-six hours have elapsed since I had an opportunity of securing any rest it will be readily understood that I do not approach my self-imposed task with a light heart.,184
1228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,A man like the honourable member ought not to require sleep.,185
1229,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I quite realise that a member of this Parliament ought not to need sleep if he is to faithfully discharge his duties. But knowing, as I do, that the close of the session is at hand, I am impelled to embrace this opportunity to make some observations upon one of the greatest departments under the control of this Parliament. The Postal Department is the most important Department under the charge of the Commonwealth, in that it comes more closely into contact with the daily lives of the people than does any other Department. Some time ago, whilst I was rendering a service to the Acting Prime Minister, who was attending the Imperial Navigation Conference, I became aware of .difficulties nected with that Department, of which I had no previous knowledge. My inquiries led me to conclude that, under the conditions which then existed, there was no chance of remedying obvious defects. The knowledge necessary to enable that to be done was not in the possession of any honourable member or of any Minister. Consequently, I took the earliest opportunity to move for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into all the ramifications of this great service. I do not to recapitulate events which are now a matter of history. I need only mention that, after some time, during which the fate of the then Government trembled in the balance, I secured the appointment of a Royal Commission to investigate the administration of the Postal Department. That body was appointed on the 24th June, JQO8. From that date onward I can truthfully assert that I threw the whole of my energies, and whatever ability I may possess, into the inquiry which it conducted. That inquiry extended over a very brief period considering the many large matters tvhich had to be investigated. Indeed, from the stand-point of the magnitude of its task, the inquiry was perhaps the most expeditious that has been conducted in the history of the Commonwealth. The members of the Commission dealt with each matter coming within their purview as thoroughly as if they were dealing with a business in which they were pecuniarily interested. The taking of evidence was concluded towards the end of 1909, and from that time till quite recently the members of the Commission were engaged in formulating its report. Here I desire to say that to the Chairman of the Commission is largely due the credit.for the compilation of the report which is now in. the hands of honourable members. I am proud to reflect that T had the benefit of' the ability and sincerity which he exhibited while engaged in the preparation of the report. In saying that I am doing bare justice to one with whom I worked so long and amicably. Honourable members will doubtless recollect that prior to the appointment of the Postal Commission the Government of the day sought to induce the House to believe that the appointment of a Cabinet Committee was all that was required to inquire into the working of the Department. But today we learn that that Committee was scarcely equal to the task which it was called upon to undertake. con- Evidence could not be taken by it in the same way as by a Royal Commission. Nevertheless, some little good was done, because the evils were so patent that it was realized that changes of vital importance had to be made. But this was merely an effort by the Government of the day to allay uneasiness regarding the conditions prevailing in the Department. It is no extravagant statement to say that,, in 1910, the Postal Department was in a condition bordering on chaos and rebellion. Forneed tunately, public attention was drawn to the matter, and an intimation was given to those responsible that something must be done. I have been pleased to observe that the heads of the Postal Administration have followed the taking of evidence by the Commission, and have, from time to time, based on it the reforms shown by the inquiry to be necessary. Very important changes have thus been made at the instance of the Public Service Commissioner, and some of the higher officials in the Postal Department. When I showed that the Department was overworked, undermanned, and woefully underpaid, basing my statements on the reports of officers, men who should have known better had the temerity to deny the accuracy of my infor : mation. But it is a compliment to my accuracy that the appointment of 1,500 additional hands to relieve overwork and congestion has since been agreed to. Notwithstanding, the Department is still in a condition that does not reflect credit on those who are responsible for its management, and some of the branches are yet overworked; so that when the busy season of the year comes on, mails remain undespatched in both Sydney and Melbourne long after they should have arrived at their destination, and the difficulties which torture the employees and trammel the management have not been removed. Ever since Federation, the vote for telegraph and telephone construction has been scandalously starved. The Postmaster General was forced to make an alteration in the method of charging for telephone service, because the old system was inequitable and unsatisfactory on financial grounds. The want of better business method in the Department is something to be marvelled at. Although it was spending .£4,000,000 a year, there was not at the head of its Accounts Branch a man competent to provide for a uniform and effective system of accountancy. When the Commission asked the chief officer of the Accountancy Branch whether the postal, telegraph, and telephone services were paying, he could not say, because accounts had not been kept to show the financial results of the Department. No business man would conduct his affairs in that way with any success. For the proper guidance of those responsible for administration, there should be an officer ih a position to give a true account of the finances, and to provide for, and to keep in order, a proper system of accounts. The success or failure of a Department of this kind must depend upon the knowledge which those at the head of it have of its financial working, and it is strange that for nearly ten years there should have been no proper' keeping of accounts. The Ministry, having at last gained a knowledge of the fact, so plainly placed on record by the Commission, that the Department was without expert guidance in this regard, decided only recently to appoint a Chief Accountant. In the early days of Federation, an attempt was made to bring about a uniform system of accounts and bookkeeping. The New South Wales Accountant, Mr Gregory-the only registered accountant in the Commonwealth service-wa s asked to report on the subject, and, in 1904, presented a report which, owing to jealousy and other influences that permeate a service of this character, was never acted upon, although it was both valuable and practicable. Three officersthe Accountant of the Treasury, the Accountant of the Department, and the Chief Clerk of the Audit Office-were then appointed a Committee of Uniform Accounts, to do that which the Accountant in New South Wales had already done. Those gentlemen for nearly three years were engaged intermittently upon the work of evolving a uniform system of accounts, and finally abandoned the task. The Department has, therefore, nothing to guide it as to the financial position of its several branches, and it will have no such guidance until the recently-appointed Chief Accountant is able to grasp this momentous question, and place the position beyond doubt. That, briefly, is the history of the financial management of the Department. At the inception of Federation, the Postal Departments of the six States were transferred to the Commonwealth, and the task of bringing the six differing systems into uniformity was one that might well have taxed the skill of the best-trained man that we could employ. No such provision, as a business man would make before taking over a great enterprise, was made, and in such circumstances it was impracticable to secure an: effective solution of the difficulty that in-evitably arose in trying to amalgamate the six differing systems. The Postal Commission, in the course of its inquiry, found that, under the Post and Telegraph Act, Parliament laid down a system which, in the opinion of the Commissioners, has proved in operation both inadequate and dangerous. We found that, under that Act, the controlling responsibility for the financial side of the Department was vested in the Treasurer of the Commonwealth for the time being. The Treasurer has no responsibility for the efficiency of this great service, and can know little of its intricacies. Yet he holds the purse-strings, and can, as the political necessities of the Government may demand, hamper or hinder the development of the Department. He has power without responsibility in this connection, and that is one of the weak points of the system Parliament did not think it sufficient to separate control and financial responsi-; bility, but went further, and provided in the principal Act .that the Public Service Commissioner should control the employees in the Postal Service. The Public Service Commissioner has the right to govern and control the interests of every unit in the Department, and the advancement or otherwise of every man in the service rests with him. That, again, is an anomaly in a big service such as this undoubtedly is. Public Service Commissioner has power deal with the officers of the service, but not responsible for their work. That, in. the opinion of the Commission, i's the second weak point in the system. The retary to the Department in the Central Office, and the Deputy Postmasters-Genecould ral of the"" several States, have the responsupervision. sibility of managing the Department, they are hampered on the one hand by Treasurer, and on the other by the Public Service Commissioner. The Act provides for a still further duplication of sibility and power. Public works nected with the Department, such as the erection of new offices and the provision of exchanges, are practically taken out - of the hands of the Department, and placed under the control of the Minresponsibility isterial head of another Department. graphic That Minister has no responsibility for 'the efficiency, of the Post and Teler f raph Service, yet he has the power to inder its successful administration. are the three weak points of the system To a business man, it seems incomprehenaltered sible that Parliament, or any body of charged with the control of a great service, could believe that that service would successfully managed where responsibility and power were thus alienated. now to another surprising feature of the service. The Post and Telegraph Act vided for the appointment of a Secretary to the Minister, who should be responsible to him for the administration of the partment and the carrying out of the isterial policy. One of the difficulties administering such a Department as this .that it extends all over tlxe Commonwealth, and it seemed to the Commission to be - anomaly that a man, having no experience of any part of Australia save the State which he came, and practically unable move, should be taken from one of the smaller States, dumped down in the tral Office, and asked to assimilate these differing systems, and to bring them into one harmonious whole. 'Even a miracle of an organizer could not have, fulfilled the demands of the position, and here we had a gentleman whose only .experience had been in one of the smaller States of the Union. If there is any truth in the old adage that environment makes 4he man, it will readily be conceived the knowledge of this official was extremely - limited. I do not say that he did not - fais best; but the question is whether Mr Webster. The or any other man in the Commonwealth to could have complied with all the requireis ments ? The result has proved that a great Department of this kind cannot be successfully worked from a centre by one person. SecFurther, he could not forget the conditions of his service in the State, where he have every man under his control and He had an idea that he must but adopt the same lines in the case of the the great Commonwealth; and he treated the heads of the Department in the various States as though they were acting under responhim in a much more limited sphere. conNaturally, this gave rise to a great deal of circumlocution, every order and recommendation having to filter through the Central Office. Even the Chief Electrical Engineer, who is charged with the great of administering our teleand telephonic services, had to pass through the Secretary's office every recommendation necessary for the control of the branch. That was the state of affairs when These the Postal Commission commenced its - work; but I may say that it has been in the light of the evidence we men were able to call. At the Central Office, attempts had been made to carry on the be business with a number of men much too limited, even with a good system; and the I come system, as we know, was faulty. The Secretary's time was occupied in pen-work prowhen he ought to have been observing, controlling, and directing; and similar conditions prevailed in the case of the DeDeputy Postmasters-General, who were Minkept busy day by day appending their sigof natures to piles of papers. They rarely is left their offices in order to see how the great human machine was working; and an the results can be readily conceived. Each of the Deputy Postmasters-General adfrom mitted in their evidence that they had too to much routine work, and were, therefore, unable to exercise that supervision without Cenwhich any great business, much less a public Department of such dimensions, cannot be successfully conducted. It will be seen that a great weakness was the system of central control, without personal knowledge on the part of the head of the Department of the differentiating conditions and demands in the various States, which render necessary skilful and continuous attention by experts in postal and telegraphic that work. It was soon realized that the two systems of control, as represented by the do Public Service Commisisoner and the Secrehe tary to the Department, did not dovetail - into one another; and it is no secret-th evidence rendered the fact urimistakable - that these two officials were at loggerhe heads with regard to their respective tions and powers. The Postal Commisexcellent sion were, therefore, compelled to report that this friction, which, as I say, meant much weakness in the administration, should be removed as speedily as possible. The officers next in rank to the Deputy Postmasters-General in the various States - are the Accountants; and their branch was found to be even weaker than any other of the service. The Accountancy Branch ought to be the most reliable; but those occupied these responsible positions were found"" to be absolutely unfitted for grave and important duties cast upon them as the financial guides of the Department. 1 It was not even required that these men should be certified accountants, though we may be sure that no business firm would engage a man for such work unless he held unquestionable testimonials and qualifications as an expert. Under present system, however, the Public vice Commissioner may draft men from one branch or Department to another, irrespecto tive of their adaptability, and the removals are frequently made simply because the men happen to have seniority. If there no promotion open in his own branch, an officer must find it in another, the duties of which he has to begin to learn. As result of this system we found a number round pegs in square holes. I shall mention names, but I may say that in one State an accountant, like all other departunless mental witnesses, submitted a written statebegin ment as to the financial conditions within his own sphere of action'. When we comdirecting menced to examine him, however, we found that he could not explain the statepartment. ment that he had placed before us, and the further the investigation proceeded the of the Deputy Postmasters-General. more bogged or bamboozled"" he became. jealousy Ultimately, it was discovered that the statement this officer placed before us had not been prepared by himself, was but by another officer, who' was third in rank in his That is but one example of the kind of thing that has grown up in the postal serTheir vice. A further example has been furnished inconnexion with another Federal Departgovernors ment. Of course, I do not blame the men; own States. I blame the system. An honourable member has recently referred to the fact that an accountant has been placed in charge of the power Department of Trade and Customs in the been e State of Victoria. He was an excellent accountant-on e of the best we had-and rendered most valuable service to the funcCommonwealth. But, because he was an accountant, he was taken away from that work and placed in charge of the so Customs Hpuse, of which he had had no previous experience. That is how we lose the services of men who have shown their aptitude for particular kinds of work. Very largely because of the excellence of their services they are removed to quite another class of work, where they are concerned with an entirely different system of prowho cedure. While that system prevails, what is the use of training up capable officers? the What sense is there in making men competent to perform valuable work in one Department, and then removing them to angentleother? I remind honourable members that alefficiency at the head of a Department generally means efficiency throughout. The whole staff works either up or down to the level of its chief. If the man at the top our is a low-grade man, we may guarantee that Sereventually the whole Department will be low-grade, because the officer who attempts get above his chief will be blocked every time. He will never be allowed to excel his superior officer, although he may be is twice as brilliant and able. If we start off with a mediocre man at. the head of a particular service, we simply sow the seeds a of discontent and inefficiency. The stanof dard of the man at the head will be the not standard of the service throughout. We cannot expect efficiency in matters of detail, the great fundamentals are sound to with, and unless the standards are raised to the point of efficiency by the man the whole service. Therein, lies one of the weaknesses of this great DeAnother stumbling-block in the way has been the limitation of the power The of the Central Office led it to endeavour to retain practically all the power in its own hands. Practically everything kept within the control of one man. It is only since the Royal Commission has been office. conducting its inquiries that greater possibilities have been given to the Deputies'. power has been increased to such an extent as to make them more like real of the Department within their,",185
1230,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,In what way has the of the Deputy Postmasters-General increased?,188
1231,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,It has been increased by a delegation of authority to them.,189
1232,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,They have the same delegation of control now as they had before.,189
1233,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Nothin g of the kind. The power of the Deputies has been extended very much since the Commission has been sitting. I can tell the honourable member, from my own knowledge, that that is so, and can prove it to 'him from evidence in black and white. One of the insuperable difficulties that has beset the Department has been the lack of continuity in policy. We have had ten Postmasters-General in ten years in the Commonwealth. If they had been Heaven-born administrators, not one of them was in office long enough to grasp the fundamentals of his Department. I intend no disrespect to these gentlemen; the system has been at fault. Furthermore, the natural ambition of every man who takes office to make a name for himself has been no imaginary cause of mistaken policy in reference to the Department, but a very real one. So that what with a lack of responsibility and power on the part of the controlling officers, centralization at the head office, the lack of delegated authority to the Deputies in the States, and the shortage of efficient officers in control, together with a . continuous stream of Postmasters-General, who have been in charge of the Department, I do not wonder that it has got into the condition in which we find it today. Indeed, I rather wonder that it is not worse than it is. I may say, at once, that my experience, both in the Federal Legislature and in a State Parliament, has shown me - and I regret to say this-that the Postal portfolio has been looked upon hs the dummy portfolio of the Cabinet. It has generally been given to the least important man in the Government. Undeniably, however, the Postal portfolio is the most important one of all, not even excepting that of the Prime Minister. . In other countries, the Postmaster-General is regarded not as the Minister occupying the lowest rung in the ladder, not merely as the make-weight in the Cabinet",189
1234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The Postmaster General in Great Britain is not generally a member of the Cabinet.,189
1235,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I am speaking of other countries. In New Zealand, the Prime Minister took upon himself the duties of Postmaster-General. New Zealand recognises the importance of this great Department. In Australia, the portfolio has been given to the man who was looked upon as the baby of the Government. That is another difficulty of which Cabinet makers in the future would do well to take cognisance. No man having the control of this Department for a short time only could expect to do his duty by it, and for this reason our Postmasters-General cannot fairly be charged with the responsibility for its condition. Another matter which we discovered by our inquiry was that there was internal jealousy amongst the controlling officers. There was a condition of practical rebellion in one State in 1907, when I directed attention to the condition of affairs in this Department. It was due to rivalry between men who were seeking a number of vacant positions, each one ber lieving that he should be chosen for the more important position. That is a state of affairs which should not exist in a Department of this kind, and it could not exist under a proper system of management. We discovered that the condition of affairs in the Telegraph and Telephone Branches was so bad that it is impossible for me, in the time at my disposal, to give the Committee an adequate idea of it. We found that in one of our large cities the telegraph poles were actually held up by the wires. This was due to the fact that the Department was financially starved, and it was impossible to maintain these important services as they should have been maintained. There is an old proverb that "" A stitch in time saves nine,""'and as, in this case, no stitches were made in time, the position went from bad to worse. When we began our inquiry, the Treasurer had so starved this Department in order to meet the financial necessities of the Government, or the clamouring of the States, that these branches were almost breaking down, .and supplied a very .unsatisfactory service for the public who were paying for them. In the Electrical Engineers' Branch we found that in each State the Electrical Engineer had the same story to tell. "" There is too much routine and office work. I am always at the desk. I cannot get away from it. If you ask me how my branch is getting on, and whether this or the other officer is the man he ought to be, I am obliged candidly to admit that, under the existing system, it is impossible for me to test the work of my men and to exercise the supervision essential to the proper working of the branch."" We found that the tables of the officers, from the top to the bottom of the service, were piled with papers, many of which should have been attended to by minor officers, in order that the men, who under the system adopted had to attend to them, might be enabled to properly fulfil the duties of their more responsible positions. Our Chief Electrical Engineer controlled the whole of his branch of the service alone. Since our inquiry was commenced his staff has been increased, and he has been given the assistance of assistant engineers. He has been relieved of routine work, and of the necessity of proceeding through the Secretary of the Department for everything he required for the proper management of his branch. To-day he is practically a free man, with some scope for independent thought and action, f ask the Committee to imagine an expert electrical engineer, responsible for an important branch of this Department, being called upon to do his work through an officer who had no practical knowledge whatever of telegraphy or electrical engineering. To the Ordinary business mind such a position is preposterous. We found practically the same conditions prevailing in every State. . There was the same lack of assistant engineers, and in some of the States officers who should have been engaged in field work and the practical business of their profession, were at the desks in their offices, tied to the pen, instead of being in charge of a theodolite directing the work of construction. Inspectors were doing engineers' work, line foremen doing inspectors' work, and linemen doing line foremen's work. The responsible duties of each' gradewere intrusted to an officer of a lower grade. Many officers were performing duties above their grade at a rate of pay that was not commensurate with the services they rendered. That is the system which, up till not very long ago. was in vogue in the principal portions of the Construction Branch in New South Wales and some of the other States. Men were expected to continue to perform duties above their grade at the pay of a lower grade, for indefinite periods, and without any special compensation. Even overtime was not paid for in those days, and the statement that overtime was being worked in the Department was denied in this House. What did we find when we went into our inquiry ? We .found - that, during the years 1905, 1906, 1907, and a portion of 1908, in the Sydney General Post Office alone, according to the return furnished by the Department, there was, in the Clerical and Professional Branches, overtime worked in excess of the regulation hours to the extent of 192,018 hours, equal to 24,002 days. These men toiled to keep the Department going over and above the hours demanded of them by their contract. Between the hours of 4.30 and 5.30 p.m., the overtime worked represented, during the same period, 71,825 hours, equal to 8,978 days. This was in only one great office in the State of New South Wales. The men were expected to do this extra work without grumbling, and without complaining through the press in letters over a nom ie flume. If they were men, how could they be expected to stand the strain, which I know was placed upon them, without complaining? We got a return of overtime worked in the country districts of New South Wales. I am not responsible for its accuracy. It was furnished by the Department ; but from it I find that in fiftyeight country offices, overtime to the extent of over 1,000 hours a year had been worked, or equal to from 125 to 175 days. There were three offices where over 2,000 hours, equalling 250 days of overtime, had been worked during these years. These were offices in which there were only two to five employees at most. Yet we were told in this House that the officers of this Department were not overworked. These men, under trying conditions, gallantly bore the - heat and burden of the day for the Department; and, as a rule, did not grumble at the lot they were called upon to endure. The evidence showed that another important branch of the service is very much undermanned, and that is the inspectorial branch. Inspectors are appointed to review the work of the different officers in various districts, and some of them to review the work in the central offices of the States. We found that the inspectorial system is very much disorganized and unsatisfactory. The districts which are allotted to the inspectors are far too wide for them to cover. Not for one year, but for several years, and in one case for nine years, no inspector had crossed the threshold of an office to inquire how it was being worked by the responsible officer. No inspection could have been made, because there were not enough inspectors available, and the districts were too large. - Not only in New .'South Wales, but in several other 'States, the task was too -$OT the men who 'had been eha>rged with iftie duty, - and 'consequently it was either M-performed, - or in many cases not per- ;great ^burden indeed. formed at aM.

Modem methods were lacking, and the men were - worked under improper conditions. In. ibbeme States other than 'Queensland - modern methods of bag sorting in circular form were introduced after the Commission had entered on their work of inquiry, which expedited the sorting work of the Department to a very large extent. But when we were in the State it was simply a case of go as you please. old .system was good enough. Practically no one was responsible for what was being done, and very frequently the responsible officer was too tied down to his desk to able to look into matters of serious portance to his administration. The sorters were working under conditions on which wards. we report under the head of "" Organiadopted zation."" The beats of the letter-carriers in the different States had not been arranged although the population had grown, and the weight of the bags had increased, in proportion to the population. The bags were quite heavy enough to carry when the beats were allotted years before.

But in modern times, when is no l i ft in a building, a carrier has to ascend five or six flights of stairs and call at the various offices on each flat. That makes a great difference to his day's work. All these matters should undoubtedly have been dealt with by the gentleman responsible for the management of this great service. Alterations have been made The in these cases, as in many others, .since our report was presented. We also found that there was a lack of medical inspection and care for the health of the staff. Reabe sonable precautions were not taken to test imthe health of the employed on entering the service, and in guarding their health afterWe recommended the system in Great Britain, that is, the appointment of a medical staff to see to the rehealth and well-being of the employees. Only recently the Government has appointed a medical staff, not in accordance with our recommendation. They have appointed medical officers to different parts of the Commonwealth to discharge duties which had not' been attended to previously. We pointed the out that, not only from a departmental, but also from a humanitarian, stand-point, it was essential that these matters should receive the immediate attention of the gentleman responsible for the service. I regret that I have not time to indicate all the changes which the Public Service Commissioner has made. He improved the position of letter-carriers by granting long-service increments. All that he did in raising the grade of clerks by long service increments, in raising the maximum of other officers, and in other ways anticipating what it was self evident would be recommended by us, was only another trubute paid to the work of the Commission before its report appeared. This, too, was done by an officer who, when giving evidence before us, denied, in some cases, that the very reforms which he afterwards granted were necessary for the better conduct of the service. So it has been borne in upon these men that changes must be brought about in their - management and con-' trol of the Department if they are to uphold whatever reputation they have already gained. We found the telegraph system of the Department everywhere congested, loaded up with condensers, telephone and telegraph messages, running on the one wire-al l quite right where it could be done, but the responsible authorities .had no sense of proportion in the duplication which they practised. They piled the condenser on to every line that could carry it, and thereby diminished the efficiency of the telegraphic service to such an extent the ordinary work of the public could not be cnrrip.d: Instances were brought before us where men found it cheaper and quicker to write a letter than send a telegram; and so the revenue Of the Department was gradually becoming lessened by what I may call the inferiority of the superior service - telegraphy . Throughout the Commonwealth, owing to the congestion, the Department brought into use the system of urgent rate» which was primarily intended only for emergencies, but they converted it into a custom. Men in country districts who desired a telegram to go with anything like reasonable expedition were accustomed to pay is. 6d. instead of 9d., in the hope of getting it to its destination, but so great tralia. had become the number of urgent telegrams that they did not attain their object, because the wires could not carry the service. The needs of the Department had outgrown 'ts facilities. The Department had not looked ahead, or if it had looked ahead, had not been allowed to make pro[ 39] 2 vision on account of the parsimony of Treasurers who were seeking to return to the States money that ought to have been spent in bringing the services of the Commonwealth up to a standard of efficiency. The congestion of the telegraphic system could have been relieved to some extent by the adoption of the Wheatstone instrument, which would enable a multiplicity of messages to be sent, where only one could be sent by the ordinary Morse instrument. When .investigating the Department we found in Sydney an old Wheatstone instrument, on which the telegraphists practised sometimes when they had a mind to, but no one was responsible for teaching them the intricacies of the system, and there this Wheatstone apparatus was allowed to lie, kept as one would keep an old watch for a child to play with, so as to interest him in mechanical studies. More modern instruments were in vogue elsewhere, but apparently it was no part of the business of the Department to bring the service up-to-date. We discovered in Western Australia one man who could work the Wheatstone instrument. He was an expert who had come out from England, and the Department, by some mistake, took him into the service. His evidence disclosed the real advantage of the Wheatstone system. He made it so clear that it would relieve the congestion in the telegraphic service that the officers of the Department, who were again on the alert for suggestions which they could put into practhat tice before the Commission reported, sent for him from Western Australia, and despatched him to the different States to teach the telegraphists how to use the Wheatstone. The result now is that when a line is congested the block can be got rid of. That is another instance of how we discovered the Department to be, as it were, moss-grown. We discovered weaknesses from top to bottom of the service.",191
1239,Mr JOHN THOMSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Hav e they introduced the Wheatstone yet?,192
1240,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Yes , on many long distance lines, although not on all. The Wheatstoneexpert is now being utilized instead of being buried in Western Aus",192
1241,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,That was a very proper thing to do.,192
1242,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Exactly , but it was not done until the Commission discovered him. I give the Department every credit for taking advantage of the Commission's work. We never objected to the Department taking action in that way, because our only object was to improve the service given to the public, on whose behalf were acting. When we came to the Stores Branch we did not find in charge men who had had experience of stores. Under the usual routine of the Public Service Commisdiscovered sioner's system, as soon as a man became used to the stores business his turn for promotion came, he was transferred some other branch, and another man, knew nothing about stores, was brought in. The system, from top to bottom, puts the unexpert man to learn expert business, and as soon as he has learnt it he is moved by seniority or some other method, and another non-expert takes his place. say nothing against the Public Service missioner as a man. He has had to perchecked. form a Herculean task beyond the abilieffective ties of any one man sitting in an office Melbourne. He was appointed to put the service upon a uniform footing, but out what happened? The service was taken over from the different States, where in the old days many appointments goods were made by political influence. Ability did not count. Many men had obtained admission to the State services, not because they possessed any special qualifications, but because of the action of political wire-pullers. When the Public Service Commissioner assumed office it was his duty, within a reasonable period, classify the officers of the Postal Departplace ment. But what did we find? That the classification which he adopted was the veriest make-believe. He followed the become an important factor. line of least resistance, with the result in the main the salaries received by officers whilst they were in the service of the States were continued. The few exceptrol tions only go to establish the general rule. The evidence tendered to the Commission incontestably proved that there are transfor ferred officers in the service who receipt of £300 or .£400 a year, but are performing work which is worth only mission. about £210 a year. When we inquired why this condition of things was permitted to continue we were told that there alternative. That is one of the great weaknesses of the Department. No matter how incapable an officer may be, unless the head of his branch is prepared to his incompetency, he must be retained the service. There is no way of getting rid of men who have ceased to be useful to the Department, and who are only a ment of a Board of Management. stumbling-block in the path of advanceadvise Mr Webster. ment of more able individuals. We found men in charge of stores branches who had we no knowledge of storekeeping or stocktaking. During the brief period that I was in Western Australia, I saw the weakness of the system; subsequently it was that a lineman was actually using copper wire belonging to the Department with which to fence his selection. to That wire had been vanishing from who the departmental stores, but nobody had been able to trace it. I mention that circumstance to illustrate the loose system which characterizes the readministration of this great and important seivice. When goods are placed I in the Stores Branch they are checked, and Comwhen theypass out pf it they are again But the second check is an inone. In the Railway Department in a different system is in vogue. There, the goods are bonded, and when they pass of bond they are carefully checked, so that the Department is in a position to ascertain at any moment the quantity,of in stock, and also the value of them. The Commission arrived at the conclusion that for the efficient administration of the Department an expert requires to be placed in charge of the Postal Branch, and another expert in charge of the Telegraph and Telephone Branches. These branches are all of a highly scientific character - We know to the marvellous growth which has taken in the telephone service during the past two years. We also recognise that in the near future wireless telegraphy must Consethat quently it is ridiculous to place these branches in charge of a non-scientific administrator. They must be under the conof experts who will be responsible to the Minister for their efficient administration, the Minister in turn being responsible the policy pursued by the Department. are in Then the appointment of a Board of who Management is recommended by the ComI regret that the Postmaster General is absent from the chamber, because this is the most important part of was no our recommendations. We may remedy, the grievances of employees, and patch up the service in this direction and in that, but our labour will be in vain unless we prove have a perfect system of management. in Reform must be initiated, not at the bottom, but at the top, of the service, and consequently we recommend the appointWe that that Board should not be anchored in Melbourne, but that as opportunity offers, from time to time, it should pay periodical visits to the different States, with a view to seeing how the affairs of the Department are administered. The Board of Management should personally visit the various States-the y should not try to govern from their blottingpads. The responsibility of its members should be a personal one. With control like that there is hope for the service; without it there is none. My fellow Commissioners and myself felt so strongly on this matter that I urge those in power to start at the right end in making reforms. To take from the report this and that suggestion, whose adoption may prove popular, or relieve pressure, or palliate grievances, will do but little good. We had great difficulty in ascertaining whether the service as a whole has been paying, but we put together, as far as was practicable, the information given to us by witnesses or what we obtained from the records. Thus we discovered that, whereas on ist March, 1901, the capitalized value of the assets of.the Department was £6,253,888, on ist July, 1908, it was .£7,595,691, according to the accepted valuation of transferred properties. The total revenue of the Department from ist March, 1901, to 30th March, 1909, was ^23,323,453, and the ordinary expenditure £22,068,268, in addition to which there was spent on ' works and buildings £1,882,987, making the total expenditure £23,951,255, or an excess of expenditure over revenue of £627,802. That was the loss on the working of the Department for the first eight years of Federal control. I may be asked how we arrived at these figures. We did what any financial expert would have done-ascertaine d the capitalized value of the assets of the Department, and provided for interest and sinking fund. Hitherto the Commonwealth has been living in a fool's paradise, returning surplus revenue to the States to appease their demands for interest on the transferred properties, but next year we shall have to pay interest. The amount which should have been paid as interest on capital was £1,995,57°, and 982,853 should have been set apart as a sinking fund. Adding the ordinary expenditure which I have mentioned, we get a total of ,£26,046,691, and deducting the revenue, the deficit for eight and a-half years is [239]- 2 seen to be ,£2,723,238. The life of equipment and buildings has only a certain term, and a sinking fund must be provided to pay off our indebtedness to the States. For the eight and a-half years of Federal control the deficit was £2,723,238. We should have had to pay that amount to the States in.interest and in providing for the sinking fund. It is true that we gave the States a great deal out of the surplus revenue, but that was Customs, and not Postal, revenue, and no arrangement was made for a sinking fund. These financial problems were not dealt with by the Treasurers of the past, because no balance sheets were prepared for their guidance. In the future, we must meet the demands legitimately made upon us. It is useless to grant concessions with one hand and offer inefficient services with the other. It means robbing Peter to pay Paul, and neither Peter nor Paul is the better for the exchange. That is the financial position of the Department, as set forth in the report of the Commission. I dare say I should be right in saying that it has not yet been fully realized, either by this or any other Government. The position, however, must be faced, and faced, too, before long. We obtained some evidence with regard to the cost of earning the revenue of the postal, telegraph, and telephone services from the Accountant in New South Wales, and also from the Accountant of the Audit Branch in South Australia. At page 30 of our report we point out thatThe accountant in New South Wales estimated the eost of earning £ 1 of revenue to be as follows :-Posta l service 14s. i o d . ; telegraph service, £ 1 gs. 6d. ; telephone service, £ 1 5s. The only other information on this subject was supplied by the South Australian representative of the Commonwealth Auditor-General, who had for many years been associated with the Accounts Branch in New South Wales. This witness' estimate of the cost of obtaining £ 1 of revenue in South Australia was as follows :Postal service, 15s. i o d . ; telegraph service, £ 1 is. y \ . : telephone service, £ 1 3s.. 2d. From the evidence available we arrived at the conclusion that the position in Victoria is worse than it is in either New South Wales or South Australia. Since'the service here is in a more deplorable condition, the cost of maintenance in Victoria must be greater proportionately than it is in the other two States. The seriousness of the position has not been realized. Imagine the cost of earning £ 1 in the telegraph service being £ 1 9s. 6d., and in the case of the telephone service £ i 5s. ! The Postmaster-General has made an attempt to remedy that state of affairs so far as telephone service is concerned, and I think that it will be successful, although it may not be scientifically accurate. It is necesthree sary that the telegraph rates should also reviewed. In no other country is it possible to have a message transmitted over 4,000 miles for a charge of is. In the the United States of America, and in other countries, the zone system is in operation, the charges increasing with the distances be covered. There the business is carried on upon commercial, and not on sentistance, mental, lines. We shall have to pay for our sentiment in this regard. Whilst have plenty of surplus revenue we shall not feel it ; but when we have no surpluswhen we are called upon to make an adjustService ment of accounts under the bookkeeping system, and have to pay up in hard cashwe shall realise where we are so far as the the true conditions. management of this service is concerned. Again and again witnesses, in dealing with the Department, have said that the system adopted was that of "" living from hand to mouth."" They told us that they could not reconstruct a line, but had to patch it, that the patching meant continuous mainreceive; tenance and constant interruption, delay, and annoyance to the general public. We have to duplicate all our main telegraph lines in most of the States today, because the business has exceeded the anticipations of the Department. It has grown beyond the provision made for it, and money will have to be found to bring the telegraph serThis vice up to date. The undergrounding telephone lines, although involving a large expenditure at the present time, will prove advantageous, for it will mean economy in maintenance. Time will not permit me to go into various other matters that rightly deserve attention, but I wish briefly to to the code rates. The coding system has been largely adopted in commercial life, portionate expansion. and by means of it a merchant can send a cable message for at least one-fourth, in some cases one-tenth, what it would otherwise cost. The coding system is coming a serious drain upon the revenue.",192
1243,Mr FENTON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The honourable member need does not blame those who use it.,195
1244,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Did I say that I basis blamed them; I blame the Department that does not equitably control the conditions which I speak. The telephone and telecareful graph services are both made cheaper to commercial man than to the ordinary pubthe lic. The question of organization is matter with which we have dealt very the thoroughly, and I would refer honourable members to our report. The recommendations dealing with that subject cover two or pages; they are carefully annotated, be and accompanying the report is an index as - complete as any ever furnished by a Royal Commission. It should tend to simplify work of those who we hope will assist us to carry out the reforms we propose. I am afraid that I shall have to leave to a to future occasion the discussion of several other important questions, such, for inas the nationalization of cable services. The Postal Commission has recomwe mended increases in wages; and I may be pardoned if I draw attention to a comparative table in this connection. The Public Commissioner, in dealing with such matters, generally works on averages, which we know do not always give a fair idea of The Commissioner averages the wages in the service before IQOI and the wages in 1908, but between those years the minimum wage was instituted, 'and this, of course, had its effect. Many of the men were formerly paid half, and two-thirds, or four-fifths of what they now and a simultaneous increase in one section of employees makes it appear, OR a system of averages, that the salaries of the whole of the service have been raised. One portion of the report shows the percentage increase in revenue as compared with the percentage increase in expenditure, and the former is far in excess of the latter. indicates that the claim made on behalf of of the Department*that the wages of employees have been raised in a way commensurate with the work done is not borne out by facts. In some years the revenue has increased 6 per cent., while the expenditure has increased from 1 to 1.7 per'cent.; and refer if the increase in revenue represents increased work, the wages do not show a proIt would seem, therefore, that in spite of the declaration and of the Public Service Commissioner, the revenue has expanded by leaps and bounds, bewhile the expenditure in comparison shows only an increase of as one is to four. The Postal Commission felt that there was some for reform in the matter of wages, and recommendations have been made on the of the work done by the different sections of the service in the various States. of This recommendation was made only after personal observation and investigathe tion of the conditions as they affected all employees in every branch, from messena ger boys up to clerks and telegraphists. The increased cost of living is proved by the proceedings before the Wages Boards and - so forth; and we have tried to hold the ance fairly, our only object being to deal out justice, and thus bring about contentment in the service. I recommend the Postmaster-General to take to heart the system of management laid down in that report, and to compare it with the system in vogue today. The work of the Commissionis that of men who endeavoured to give the best that was in them for the guidance of the Government and this Parliament; and I should feel happy if I thought the Postmaster-General would do, as I should myself were I in his position, namely, use all the common sense and adminstrative ability I possessed, and, by adopting the recommendations of the report, cause my name to live as that of an adminstrator who made justice the keystone of his edifice. The Ministry have the recess before them; and it can be utilized for a consideration of the report of the Commission, and I hope that next session they will be prepared to "" grasp the nettle,"" and begin by abolishing the Public Service Commissioner so far as the Post and Telegraph Department is concerned. The Commissioner is only an echo of what has been done, and better done, by officers who are in contact with the employee's, and who are better qualified than the inspectors to judge of their merits or demerits.",195
1245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,The Government will not abolish the Public Service Commissioner. He is too good a scapegoat!,196
1246,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"We do not need "" scapegoats "" in this case, but rather to remove such things from our path. The Public Service Commissioner, as I have said, is a mere echo of the heads of Departments in the several States, and does not make himself acquainted with the conditions throughout the service. Like the Secretary of the' Department, he has too much office work to do-to o much administration from trie blotting pad-and I do not blame him, for it is impossible for one man to do what is expected. The Public Service inspectors are guided in the matter of increments and promotions by the Deputy Postmasters-General; and in cases of any difference of opinion the inspectors have variably been proved to be wrong. Queensland the advance of men recommended for promotion by the Deputy Postmaster-General has been blocked by the Public Service inspectors. It always appeared that an officer employed in the office of an inspector secured promotion more readily than did any other bal- officer. Before we left Brisbane on the second occasion, the Public Service Commissioner had put the men where his inspector refused to put them. I cannot lay before the Committee all the causes for the failure of this great system, but I do wish to .impress upon the Postmaster General that the position of Public Service Commissioner is a real stumbling-block in the way. Now I shall conclude. If honourable members who have done me the - honour to listen to me had devoted two or three years to this work they would have realized how difficult it is to condense so many matters of consequence within the limits of a speech. I shall not enter into details at greater length on this occasion. I have dealt with the main features of the service, pointing out the difficulties and the weaknesses discovered by the Commission. I have indicated some of the remedies. I have shown the need for change from top to bottom in order that justice may be done to the employees. The overtime due to them should certainly be promptly paid, as it would be paid by any honest private employer. The Government should see to it without delay that those officers who are rendering in the main good service to the public receive such rewards as will place the Commonwealth service in a position that will enable us to look to it with respect, and say, "" Here is a service that is managed by the State, in.which contentment reigns, in which efficiency prevails, and in which success and prosperity must ensue."" Such must be the result if we only grapple with the question and manage this great service as common-sense business men ought to do.",196
1247,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Bendigo) [11.4] The honourable member for Gwydir has favoured the Committee' with a very lengthy, exhaustive, and informative speech. Under the special circumstances of the case he was no doubt entitled to a fair innings, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, and the approaching termination of the session. I consider that the honourable member and the Commission with which he has been connected have completed a very inimportant and valuable work in investigatIn ing the numerous problems connected with the Post and Telegraph Department. I have looked through their report, and think that it contains much information of an interesting and useful character which will enable honourable members to study the administration of this important Department to advantage. Many of the principal features of the report demand the early attention of Parliament. We are justified in expressing the hope and belief that, as the Commission has done its work fairly well, although its proceedings have been somewhat protracted, the result of its labours will receive serious attention. The honourable member was justified in occupying a considerable amount of time in drawing attention to some of the leading features of his report. No doubt honourable members will, in their spare time during the recess, study that document and the annotations with which the honourable member has favoured us in the speech that he has just delivered. Whilst the whole field of the postal and telegraph seivice presents abundant material for speech-making and discussion, I do not think that honourable members will tolerate another member of the Committee making such a long speech as we have heard from the honourable member for Gwydir. I do not, therefore, propose to occupy very much time in debating problems of administration, but I am entitled to draw the attention of the Postmaster-General to the fact that Sir Robert Scott, the first Secretary of the Department, has practically retired from office, being now oh leave. As a consequence of his relinquishment of the secretaryship an important statutory office is virtually vacant. Under the Post and Telegraph Act of the Commonwealth the administration of the Department is vested in a secretary under the Minister. When the term of Sir Robert Scott's leave expires, therefore,' the Minister will be faced with the necessity of either proceeding to appoint another secretary to fulfil the statutory duties or to mit to Parliament a new scheme for the administration of the Department.",196
1248,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I hope that the Postmaster-General will find some way of avoiding the appointment of a secretary.,197
1249,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I shall not give the Minister any advice upon that subject. Upon him rests the responsibility. But he will have to make a choice, either appointing a secretary soon or preparing a new scheme for the administration of the Department. During my short period of official connection with the Department I was impressed with the necessity of devising some amendment in the scheme of postal management and administration. With the concurrence of my colleagues I went to my constituency, pledged to at scheme of postal reform in the way of, firstly, improving and strengthening the Central Administration, and, secondly, improving and strengthening the State Administration. I am still of opinion that both those branches of the government of the Department demand attention. On the one hand, we must avoid any tendency to extreme centralization, and, on the other hand, we must avoid any undue increase of powerin the local administrations. Whilst there can be no doubt that local administration in this Department is necessary with reference to matters which are fairly of a local or provincial character, it would, nevertheless, be undesirable to vest the Deputy Postmaster-General, and those concerned with local administration, withtoo much power, which might tend tointerfere with uniformity of government. The two matters to which I have referred have been, in my opinion, responsible for the difficulties in the management of the Post Office. I was inclined to the view that, with a vacancy arising through the retirement of Sir Robert Scott, the Government might avail themselves of the opportunity to improve the Central Administration by, in the first place, vesting the powers of management, which by Statute are vested in the Secretary, in a Board of three able administrators representing different branches, and having special expert knowledge. I therefore suggested a Board of Administration to take the place of the Secretary,, and to be vested with statutory duties of a business and administrative character, reserving at the same time to the Minister undiminished power in political matters, for which he should be responsible to Parliament. I do not think that Parliament sub- should be advised to give up what might be called the political administration of the Postal, Telegraph, and Telephone Branches. I specially stated, in my political manifesto to the country, that in matters of public policy, Parliament, through the Minister, should maintain supreme control; and by public policy I meant policy as expressed in legislation and regulations. But in all matters of detail and routineinvolving expert, scientific, and business, knowledge, the power of administration, should be vested in the Central Office, at the same time reserving to the State Administrations peculiar, local, and provincial duties. I suggested, also, that it would be well to strengthen the position of the Deputy Postmasters-General by providing them with a committee or local board of advice. I am of the opinion that our Deputy Postmasters-General, being so far removed from the Central Office and the Seat of Parliamentary Government, must often have felt overwhelmed with responsibility. They had not associated with them any committee or board of advice, or colleagues of co-equal responsibility. In many cases, they were called upon to exercise important functions and assume serious responsibilities without any assistance whatever. And for many mistakes in administration in the past, perhaps their isolation and lack of assistance may, to some extent, be held responsible. Here, let me say that I cannot concur in the view expressed by the honourable member for Gwydir, or the report of the Postal Commission, that Sir Robert Scott could be considered in any way an inferior officer, ov lacking in any of the great powers of administration, knowledge, and ability requisite in the first Secretary of this great Department. I know of no man in Australia better fitted to perform the duties of the first Secretary than was Sir Robert Scott. I speak calmly, and without any partiality for him. He was a perfect stranger to me, until I came into intimate association with him in the administration of the Department. I wish to say, in justice to him, that he did his duty well, impartially, and courageously. He displayed courage even in dealing with Ministers and with members of Parliament, as well as with every officer in the Department. He was always a man of courage, as well as a man of ability and great experience; and, with every respect for the' honourable member for Gwydir, and the Postal Commission, I say that there is no ground or reason whatever for criticising Sir Robert Scott's administration in an adverse way. He did well. We should not forget that he had a very difficult problem to solve in amalgamating or assimilating the varying systems of six States. It cannot be denied that he exercised a guiding and dominant influence in the legislation and administration which resulted. I do not say that he did everything perfectly ; but he certainly did well. After all, the problem to be solved was a great one, and could only be solved with time, and also with the command of financial resources, which he was denied by Parliament, and which denial, to a large extent, accounted for the breakdown of the postal administration In many respects.' I believe that if in years gone by the Postal Department had commanded the financial resources necessary for the efficient administration of the various services, there would not have been those failures and those public clamours and complaints with which Parliament was inundated, which the press was so full of a few years ago, and which led to the appointment of the Postal Commission. The, honourable member for Gwydir must know, and should admit, that the lack of funds was one of the chief causes of the breakdown of the postal service.",197
1250,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"We have said that it was; but we did not consider, it the main cause.",198
1251,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I say that it was one of the principal causes. Unfortunately, owing to a want of strength and independence, our earlier Postmasters General did not insist that the Postal Department should not be starved, but should be properly equipped with all the funds necessary to maintain efficient services, and also to extend them. Fortunately, within the last two or three years the Department has had at its command greater financial resources than it had at any previous period When I assumed the office I made it a condition with my colleagues, and especially with the Treasurer, that the Estimates of the Department should not be nut down, and they were not cut down to any serious extent. The Government of which I was a member was the first to ask Parliament to sanction a system of three years' expenditure for the Department, and the Estimates I had the honour to submit last year contained provision for the expenditure of nearly ^800,000 in the extension and improvement of the services and the rectification of anomalies in postal administration.",198
1252,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I suppose the honourable gentleman is aware that there are two ways in which Estimates may be cut down? They may be cut down at the beginning, or money may be left unexpended at the close of the financial year.",198
1253,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The Department has been enjoying during the last two or three years an increased command of financial resources, and as a result the Postmaster-General has been in a position to be more liberal in dealing, not only with the public, but with ppstal employees. It is impossible for any Postmaster-General' to give satisfaction to the public and the employees of the Department unless he is liberally supplied with funds. check the natural tendency to extend my remarks, because in the circumstances I feel that I should not be justified in speaking at great length. I express the hope that the present Postmaster-General during the recess now approaching will avail himself of the opportunity to deal with the exhaustive and valuable report of the Postal Commission. . I join with the honourable member for Gwydir in recommending the honourable gentleman and other honourable members to .study the recommendations of the' Commission and the evidence which they collected. Though we may not approve of many of the recommendations or matters of detail submitted to us by the Commission, the material and information they have supplied should enable the responsible advisers of Parliament . to concentrate their attention upon some of 'the more important features of postal administration and the necessity for postal reform. What is wanted, to some extent, is concentration and consolidation, instead of distribution, of control and management. Whether that will demand or require the withdrawal .of the Department from the control of the Public. Servioe Commissioner is another question. That will be a very serious problem, which the Minister will have to deal with. Already we have had the outlines of a preliminary installation of some postal reform. The other night it was announced by the Acting Prime Minister that it was intended to give jurisdiction to the Federal Arbitration Court to entertain appeals by employees in the Post and Telegraph Department in regard to wages and. conditions of labour. If that be done, there will be a further increase in the divisibility of the control of the Department. We shall then have its control first within the Department; second, to some extent by the Home Affairs Department; third, to some extent by the Public Service Commissioner; fourth, to some extent by the Treasurer; and, fifth, to some extent by the Arbitration Court. I should like to know how a Department with a vast business, revenue, and responsibility can possibly be carried on efficiently with a control spread over no less than five agencies? If the jurisdiction to deal with wages and conditions of labour be transferred to the Arbitration Court, of what good will the Public Service Commissioner be?",198
1254,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"He will no longer be required. Sir John Quick. I must Sir JOHN QUICK - We shall have two conflicting authorities. On the one hand, we shall have the Commissioner, who occupies an honourable and esteemed position, who is trusted by Parliament to frame the preliminary conditions of labour, its distribution, and its assessment. On the other hand, we shall have Parliament granting money, and afterwards the right of appeal to another Federal authority in the shape of the Arbitration Court. We shall be called upon to decide whether it is possible to carry on the Departments with two inconsistent and antagonistic authorities dealing with the same problems. The question may arise whether Ave ought not to have more of .consolidation and unification in the administration of the Department rather than division and differentiation. However, these are matters which the Postmaster-General will have to consider, and on him rests the responsibility, I apprehend, of submitting next session a scheme of postal reform which, whatever it does, will, I hope, result in strengthening and improving, not only the Central Administration, but also the State Administrations, harmonizing the two separate branches of work, so to speak, without leaving any unnecessary encroachment by one on the other. Above all, we must remember that the Post and Telegraph Department, with all its branches and ramifications, is a great public department, whose services are supposed to be of utility and advantage to the whole of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth. It ought to be run for the benefit of the public, and not for the benefit of any one else. The public interest should be the primary, and the. almost exclusive, consideration. The administration of the Department should be carried on mainly with a view to the benefit of the public. The problem is how we are to reconcile public interests and carry on the operations of the Department for the public interest. At the same time, we must not forget the rights, the privileges, and the interests of the workers, whose services are necessary. I think that Parliament has always shown a disposition to see a fair day's pay given for a fair day's work. No doubt, from time to time, anomalies have been mentioned, and numerous complaints made. Under the existing system, such complaints are referred to the Public Service Commissioner, in whom I have every confidence. I believe that he represents the choice of Parliament. He was reappointed by the last Labour Government at an increase of salary. He is animated by a sense of justice to the ployes, the Department, and the public. He stands in an independent position; has no reason to be niggardly in his mendations or advice; he has no cause to he mean, or parsimonious, or shabby in administration. He has a free hand, and an independent judgment. I shall very sorry, indeed, if anything be done said in Parliament, or elsewhere, to sap the confidence of the public and the Parliathat .ment iii him. No doubt he is open to listen to representations. He is bound to receive of the blame. any material or information which may in-, duce him to consider what is right, or fair, or reasonable. That should be the utmost extent to which, under the existing law, we should go.",199

1256,Sir JOHN QUICK,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Parliamen t is the place where the representation of grievances is made. No doubt any discussion here brought under the Commissioner's attenfirst tion, and receives consideration. Beyond that, I shall not say more. Under the existing law, we must respect his position. What it would be if an appeal were allowed nn wages, or on industrial questions, is problem which we shall have to consider later. In these circumstances, I invite Minister to state whether it is intended forthwith, or at what date, to appoint Secretary in place of Sir Robert Scott, and whether we may expect, next session, the presentation of a scheme of postal form, dealing with the recommendations the Postal Commission.",200
1257,Mr FRANK FOSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"New England) [11.28] - I have to crave the indulgence the Committee for rising to speak at this hour; but it is a question of getting jusoffence tice, and exposing a little of the maladand, ministration, which people suffer from the Post and Telegraph Department. In guilty, the first place, I desire to thank the honstead, orable member for Gwydir for the magniup, ficent speech which he has delivered on great question. It has saved many of the necessity of throwing a little light the muddle in the Department, and urging necessary reforms. I think that the istry, as well as the Postmaster-General, owe a debt of gratitude to him for thefault, splendid work which he did on the Postal Commission and its report. Those who have read it consider it to be one of the best reports presented by any Commission. I was one of a Committee that went through it clause by clause, and emshould like to speak for a number of hours on it, but I shall reserve that for another he time. The honourable member for Bendigo recomhas made a very gallant defence of Sir Robert Scott, but the work of any adminishis trator of the Department must be judged by the report of the Postal Commission, be and that report is such a colossal indictor ment of the bad management of the Department, and the need for reform in it, no past administrator, including the Postmasters-General, can escape their share The present Postmaster General is fortunate in having the report available for his guidance at the beginning of his term of office. I trust he will have the vigour and determination to use, if not all, at any rate so much of it as will help him to put the Department on a splendid business footing. I wish to put before the Postmaster-General a case relating to the infliction of fines, and the practice of the is .Department in making a scapegoat of a offender. We have had trouble for some time on the main northern trunk line from interruptions to the service, for which certain-conditions and persons have been to blame. The case, briefly, is this : A line a foreman was constructing a certain line with a contractor ""under him. When Christmas the Eve arrived, he left the contractor, who had given him a promise to insulate the a lines before he went home.. The line foreman himself had not the time to supervize that work, but went home to his refamily, and next morning it was found that of the lines were interrupted. The cause was ascertained to be the failure to carry out the work of insulation. The conditions were of allowed to remain for practically three days afterwards, but the line foreman's was only a small affair in itself, on the advice of the engineer who in came to examine the line, he pleaded expecting to be fined about £ 2 . Inhe was fined £ 1 0 . I took the case and the Deputy Postmaster-General in this Sydney assured me that that fine was the us whole of the punishment to which the man on would be subjected. Before twelve months had passed, however, he was refused the Minpromotion to which he was entitled. He had had sixteen years of service without a but thirteen juniors were promoted over his head. He has also been denied his proper leave for 1910. The Department single out a' first offender in this way, and make a scapegoat of him in order to show that they are doing something to pre- vent line interruptions. This case is made worse by a letter sent from the Departwas ment, in which both the Postmaster-General and myself are bluffed. The departmental statement is to the effect that, but for man's previous long and meritorious vice, he would probably have suffered severe punishment than the fine inflicted, that he was not punished twice for the same fault, and that the Public Service Comnot missioner pointed out that the law provides that consideration must be given to conduct and diligence. In face of that, the man was punished three times for the bad one offence. I have failed to get justice from the Department, and I now ask Postmaster-General to see that the perseing cution of this man is stopped, and to give him immediate justice, or else grant him a board of inquiry into the whole case, that he may be judged upon the evidence. I would direct the Postmaster-General's attention to the fact that, in cases of this sort, a man's accuser is his judge, and he appeals, he appeals to the same judge again. In fact, it is a case of appealing from Csesar to Cassar. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) have [n.40] - The Post and Telegraph Departthey ment is one of the most important with which we have to deal. It has hitherto always taken up a great deal more time than any other Department, because of the enormous number of complaints made by the general public and by those gaged in the service itself. There can no doubt that the Department, especially the General Post Office in Sydney, is a seething mass of discontent from top bottom, and the most profound dissatismaster-General faction exists among all grades of the vice with the prevailing conditions. I informed that the system of sweating that has been so often complained of still exists. It is also evident from the answers given questions put by honourable members to the '.Minister, and from the large amount temporary assistance constantly employed, that the conditions of that office call very drastic reform. I do not blame the heads of Departments or the Public Serwish vice Commissioner, so much as the sysfor tem which has grown up ever since the authority beginning of Federation of systematically starving the Estimates of the Department. I have always protested against that pracSydney, tice. The Estimates, after being revised and re-revised by the responsible officers the Department,'and submitted to the Minisoccupied ister, have been cut ruthlessly down by successive Treasurers, not because there no money available, but from an insane desire to hand over to the States a sum of money over and above the amount this returnable to them under die Constitution serfrom the Customs and Excise revenue. more The result was that money that was badly needed to efficiently carry on the various services in this and other Departments, was provided, although Parliament knew it was needed to enable the Department to good keep pace with its growing business.",200
1258,Mr BATCHELOR,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"That is due to the past Governments. the ' Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Includ two Labour Governments, and, for most of the time, Governments kept in office by the Labour party. It is of no use to try to so find scapegoats in the heads of Departments and the Public Service Commissioner. No matter how good an organizer 01 administrator a man may be, unless he has the if wherewithal to carry out his ideas, it is impossible for him to perform satisfactory service. All the time that we have been returning that money to the States the eyUs been growing in the Department, until have assumed colossal proportions. We have returned to the States .£8,500,000,. or thereabouts, which ought to have been expended in putting this Department particularly, and also others, on a proper footboth ing. I wish to deal now with some enof the grievances which call for imbe mediate attention, and . can be dealt with without waiting for an amendment of the Public Service or any other Act, to but which it is in the power of the Posthimself to remedy. I have seralready called attention to some of these, am but without avail. I have been repeatedly told that I had better allow them to stand over until the Estimates are under conto sideration. That opportunity has now arrived. It comes, I regret to say, at an of hour of the evening when all of us ought to be in bed. Nevertheless, I have a duty for to discharge to the country, and to those who are engaged in our Public Service, t to emphasize the necessity which exists the Postmaster-General asserting his so as to insure that certain things shall be done in the Postal Department, and particularly in the General Post Office. which more than any other office seems to suffer from internal troubles. But of I desire first to refer to the position that by the temporary hands of the service. From a reply to a question which was asked by me some days ago, I gather that there are at present 548 temporary - hands employed in the Department. .number of these have entered the service under the impression that if they prove their fitness for the duties which they are - called upon to discharge they will have a better chance of securing appointment to the permanent staff. Upon entering the - service they have to be trained by their - superior officers, and their period of employment is limited to six months in the year.",201
1259,Mr THOMAS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"In accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Act. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - But that Act invests the Public Service Commissioner with a discretionary power which is not exercised to - the extent that it might be. There are temporary hands in the Department who, - notwithstanding - the limit imposed upon their service during any one year, have been - connected with the Public Service for years, but have not been placed upon the permanent staff. In other words, they have not the rights and privileges of permanent hands, although their services are regarded as indispensable. Our Public Service Act endows the Commissioner with discretionary power to employ permanent hands for three months longer than the' maximum period of six months in any one year. That provision makes for increased inefficiency, because it compels the discharge of temporary hands just at the period when they are becoming efficient. That is a very serious imperfection which ought to be remedied - without delay.",202
1260,Mr THOMAS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"There are two sides even to that question. That provision was inserted in the Public Service Act deliberately, so as to enable the work of the Department to be distributed all round. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Never the less, it is a bad system. Even from an industrial stand-point it is to be condemned, because it takes young fellows away from their ordinary occupations, and because the period during which they are employed in the Postal Department is absolutely wasted. In other words, this system creates a class of semi-professionals, who, by reason of their temporary service year after year, are unfitted for any other occupation, and have no chance of securing permanent appointment to the service with which they are familiar. I have received from these temporary hands a number of complaints which it is within the power of the Postmaster-General to remedy. One of these complaints is that in the event of A a temporary hand being incapacitated by illness his pay is stopped. It is discontinued at a period when he most requires the money.",202
1261,Mr BAMFORD,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Does not the same remark apply to every man outside the Public Service? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It does not apply to the permanent officers of the service.,202
1262,Mr THOMAS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Does the honourable member advocate the payment of sick pay to temporary hands? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Yes . . Mr THOMAS - Then , should they not be provided with a medical certificate before they are appointed to the service temmany porarily ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - That may be so. But a man may have the1best medical certificate in the world as to his general health, and yet be subject to the temporary ailments with which we are all familiar.",202
1263,Mr THOMAS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Does the honourable member think that a temporary hand should be granted sick pay before he produces a medical certificate? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - A medical certificate is no guarantee that a man will not contract pneumonia or influenza while working under the conditions which obtain in the General Post Office, Sydney. A man would require to possess an iron constitution to be immune from sickness there. To me the marvel is that the percentage of invalids who are .engaged in that office is not greater than it is. It is a shame to refuse sick pay to a man with a wife and family who becomes ill as a result of working under the insanitary conditions which prevail in that institution. Then there is the question of tea-money, which is a burning grievance with a number of sorters employed in the General Post Office, Sydney. From the answers given to some questions which were put to the Postmaster-General, I gather that the sorters who are required to work after the ordinary office hours are not allowed tea-money. In addition, they are only permitted twenty minutes within which to snatch their evening meal. . It is very clear, therefore, that when they are required to work overtime, they must either bring their tea with them, or purchase it at the nearest restaurant. When, they are obliged to work beyond the ordinary office hours, I hold that the Department ought to grant them tea-money. To refuse to do so, is an ineffably mean act on the part of this great Commonwealth. It is too mean for words. These may seem small things to honourable members, but they are big matters to those who receive small salaries, and to whom the expenditure of every 6d. is a matter of very serious moment. I do' not think that it is a dignified act on the part of the Commonwealth to take these small advantages of their servants. I wish now to refer to some 'questions which were asked by the honourable member for Richmond some time ago. They were1. What has been the usual practice of his Department in regard to payment of overtime in the senior branches of the Clerical Division in New South Wales? 2. Has there been any recent departure from former practice in this regard? 3. Have any complaints been received by the Department from senior officers in regard non-payment for overtime? 4. Have any exceptions been made, and, so, why? The replies furnished were1. It is not the practice to recognise claims ceived for overtime by heads of branches and by corresponding responsible officers. were allowed in connection with overtime claims Postal Inspector, for iqo6-8, the first submitted since Federation, but the principle was subsequently defined that controlling officers should not be pecuniarily terested in the working of overtime. 2. No claims from such officers have been cognised since approval for 1906-8. 3. Yes, from three officers. 4. No, not since the adoption of the principle referred to in reply to 1. In reference to this matter, I propose to quote from a letter sent to the honourable pleasure member for Parramatta from the Inspecrefused tion Branch of the General Post Office, worked Sydney.. It is as followsMr Greene, who has been very kindly interesting himself in this matter, remarks that he has to go away, and cannot stay to attend to it when the Estimates are under discussion, but he is placing it in your hands, and asks me to write to you. "" . I am now taking the liberty of doing so, and would esteem it a very great favour if you would kindly use your influence in rectifying the injustice now in question. When Mr Thomas, the Postmaster-General, was in Sydney some months ago, Messrs. Rinaldi and Richardson and myself personally interviewed that gentleman, who, after listening to our remarks, and accepting our written statements in regard to the non-payment of overtime, expressed himself as being in favour of its being paid, and promised to interview the Public Service Commissioner on the subject upon his return to Melbourne. Mr W. Elliot Johnson. We have, however, not heard anything from the Postmaster-General about the matter, although the _ Public Service Commissioner subsequently declined to pay our claims. Overtime was paid to senior officers in the General Post Office, Sydney, up to 30th April, 1908. The Accountant, Mr Gregory, and Mr Fitzmaurice, Assistant Electrical Engineer, each received over £ i o o while several other senior officers received subr stantial sums. I received a small amount, but did not claim half I was actually entitled to, although I had been travelling a good deal, and working on many Sundays and late at night. As stated in my letter to Mr Greene, Messrs. Rinaldi and Richardson and myself were nottold that we would not receive payment for overtime work, but were allowed to do it , believing that the existing regulation provided, which it does, for payment to all officers irrespective of grade. The rate of 2s. 6d. per hour for officers o v e r £ 3 ° ° a year was quoted in the regulation. It has been recently approved to pay overtime to Inspectors Tomkinson and Ramsay and Mr. Acting Assistant-Inspector Francis, yet my claim is refused, although I have done far more important work, viz., that of an officer who is in receipt of a salary of ^100 per annum in excess to of what I am paid. I would like to draw your attention to the recommendation of the Royal Commission in its recent report to pay alf if overtime due, and to also pay officers the salaries for the positions they temporarily occupy, if for over three months. I was Acting Senior Inspector for over two years, and reno extra pay. Such payments of I a cannot branch. be considered an officer in chargeMy position is that of an ordinary but I was obliged to perform temporarily the duties of Senior Inspector while that officer was absent for the purpose mentionedinin my letter to Mr Greene. I worked under particularly strenuous condiretions, and successfully managed the InspectionBranch, including the' Inland Mail Section aridannual mail' tenders.' The whole of my life, Monday to Friday, up to 9 and 10 p.m., Saturdays to 6 p.m., and every Sunday at home was devoted to official duty. My private affairs and wife and family were neglected, and I had noor recreation whatever; yet I have beenpayment for the overtime I actually in the office, with the Deputy Postmaster-General's knowledge and authority.",202
1264,Mr THOMAS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I saw the Public Service Commissioner, and he refused to grant the request. Mr W. ELLTOT JOHNSON - I think the Ministry has the right to insist -.on the payment of overtime; to say that it has not is to confess a lack of Ministerial authority. Nothing in the Act compels public servants to work overtime continuously, year in and year out, to the injury of their health, and the loss of social and domestic pleasure. If the exigencies of the service require overtime to be worked occasionally, it should be paid for, as it has to be paid for by private employers. We set ourselves up as authorities as to what is right, fair, decent, and proper as to wages and conditions of employment, and should observe the rules which we seek to impose on others. It. is said that the conditions in the Melbourne General Post Office, or in the other States, are not bad as at Sydney, claims for promotion, grading, and so on, being more generally observed here, and the suggestion has made that an exchange of officers would secure greater uniformity of conditions and more harmonious working. The matboth ter is well worth the consideration of Minister. The Public Service Commismunicipalities sioner would not be above taking a pracgraph tical suggestion from him in a case of this kind. I know him to be a fair-minded and conscientious man. While resisting improper political pressure in the interests of individuals, he would always lend willing ear to suggestions for the more efficient conduct of the service. The recoma question, mendation I now make might reasonably Departmentnot be put before him. Its adoption' would the honourable prevent men from suffering from the say at once, "" This peculiar temper of sub-heads ments, and other superior officers, whose would, probably,.questiontothe prejudice or personal grudges might prevent Department to bill him for the right legitimate promotion, or whose favouritism moving it. might bring it about for those not entitled to it. We know that at certain seasons of the year, such as Easter, but particularly Christmas, the volume of postal matter to be handled 'is very, much increased, because of the interchange of greetings usually made then by friends and relatives. The space available at the Post Office does not permit of that increased work being carried out by the ordinary working staff. The permanent staff is really actual roadway is increased. inadequate to cope with it, and it is at this time that temporary assistance is really needed. I have here a stateset ment showing that in some cases the men were called upon to work from 6 a.m. until 11.30 p.m. That is longer than men should be called upon to work, especially when the occupations are laborious and work is carried on under unhealthy condialignment tions. I am informed that some of these were compelled to return to. work on mas Day, and I hold that there should no compulsion on the part of any officer to forego his Christmas holiday. few hours' delay in the delivery of greeting cards is not of. serious importance. ever pleasant it may be to receive them the psychological moment, a slight involves no great hardship. I hope the practice of requiring these officers' return to work on Christmas Day will be discontinued. I have been asked once more to draw attention to another practice prevailing in the Department which takes advantage of a section of the Post and Teleso graph Act, which might in some cases, at reall events, be disregarded, and which certainly does not apply, in my opinion, to the been case to which I am about to refer. On more than one occasion I have brought under the notice of the Postmaster-General, publicly and privately, the practice the followed by the Department of charging for the cost of removing teleor telephone poles which, owing to a mistake on the part of its officers, have been improperly erected upon the roadway.",203
1265,Mr THOMAS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"We are submitting that matter to the Law Courts to see whether or a not what we"" have done is improper. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - It is of law, but of fact. If the erected a pole in the middle of member's garden, he would is a matter for me, and of Departnot for the Law Courts, decide,"" and he of the cost of re",204
1266,Mr THOMAS BROWN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"But these poles must be placed in position somewhere. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The honourable member knows that the practice, in country districts, is to set out a roadway with a width of one or two chains, and to macadamize only so much of it as is necessary for immediate requirements. When the volume of traffic increases, the From the beginning, however, there is an alignment of the roadway, a certain portion being out for footpaths, and a certain part for vehicular traffic. It is the business of the Department, before erecting poles along such roadways, to ascertain the alignment of the footpaths. In some cases, howthe ever, poles are erected without the true of the footpath being ascermentained, with the result that when the Christmunicipal council subsequently widens be the actual roadway, the poles are postal found to be encroaching upon it. A That is exactly what has taken place at Sutherland, which is within my elecHowtorate. Before the existence of the local at shire council, poles were erected by th'. delay Department, not upon the edge of the that strip of roadway set apart for a footpath, to but upon the water-tables of the road. Unfortunately, this led to a serious accident.. a motor car crashing into one of these poles, and two of its occupants being badly injured. One of them has not yet recovered the use of an arm, but he has not preferred a claim against the Department, either for his personal injuries or for the damage to his motor car, which was wrecked - The Department was asked to remove the pole, as well as others that encroached upon the roadway. It complied with the request, and, promptly, sent in an account for £ 2 17s. od., representing the cost, with an intimation that, unless the amount were paid within fourteen days, proceedings would be taken for its recovery. One would hardly think it possible that the Department, knowing that it had made a blunder in the first instance, would bill the council for the cost of rectifying it. I strongly urged the municipality not to pay the account, feeling satisfied that if the Department took the case to Court it would be unable to recover. Had the council adopted that attitude, we should have secured a much desired reform far more rapidly than is possible as the result of any representations that may be made on the floor of this House. Unfortunately, however, the shire council determined to recognise the claim, and a cheque for £ 2 17s - the odd pence being omittedwas sent to the Department. I have just received the following letter from the shire clerk af Sutherland dealing with the matterSIR,- I beg to enclose for your information a copy of our communication received from the Postmaster-General's Department relative to my payment of the cost of removing telephone poles. Considering the whole circumstances of the case, of which you are already familiar, I felt quite justified in sending a cheque for the even money. This letter has not yet been laid before my council, but I have no doubt they will decline to pay the other gd. The letter from the Postmaster-General's Department, Sydney, i'- dated 14th November, and reads as followsSIR,-Wit h reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing a cheque for £ 2 17s. in connection with the cost of the removal of certain telephone poles on the Railway-parade, Suther-. land, I have the honour to inform you that the amount due in this case was £ 2 17s. gd., and to request that you will kindly remit the balance (gd.) to this office at your earliest convenience.",204
1267,Mr THOMAS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Quite right. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I am ashamed to hear the honourable member, as the Minister at the head of this Department, make such a remark. Shy lock demanding his pound of flesh is as nothing compared with the meanness and sordidness of a request of this kind. It is almost incredible that the Postmaster-General should justify such a demand. If the 'council had adopted my advice, and had allowed the Government to sue for. the amount, the Department would have received one of the greatest exposures to which it has yet been subjected. Public attention would have been focussed in that way upon the methods of the Department in matters of this kind. The officers of the Department made a blunder.",205
1268,Mr THOMAS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"They did not, and the honourable member knows that. Mr VV. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Who . was responsible for the blunder, if the Department was not?",205
1269,Mr THOMAS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"If the municipal council was in the right, why did it pay the money ? Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Be cause the amount was so small that it was thought to be not worth fighting over. Its smallness has,- unfortunately, blinded the council to the importance of the principle involved. It is a reasonable business proposition that the Department should rectify its mistakes at the earliest possible moment, and not add insult to injury by making a grave blunder, and then charging the sufferers with the cost of rectifying that blunder. There was no municipal governing body in existence in the Sutherland district when these poles were erected. They were carried through the Sutherland Estate Company's land; and that company had caused the roads to be aligned before they were erected. That being so, the council was not in the slighest degree to blame. It was only after the shire council had been created, and the work of improving the roads was undertaken, that the poles were discovered to be in the wrong position. This has been developed from an obscure locality into a fashionable seaside resort, and the increased traffic on the roads has intensified the danger to life and property; and there was no justification whatever for sending the account to a local body in no way responsible. I wish now to refer briefly to the neglect of the Department in the .natter of wireless telegraph stations. The mail steamers are compelled to carry installations, and other vessels find it a convenience to be able to communicate by this means; and yet in Australia we have not provided those facilities that are rapidly being extended in all the other countries of the world. The small sum provided on the Estimates is laughable, when we think of the work that is being done elsewhere. A friend of mine has obtained from the United Stares some information of considerable interest in this connection. A bulletin was issued by the United States Census Bureau, in August, 1909, and from this it appears that in that country there are now no fewer than 1:22 wireless towers, at not one of which, by the way, is the Telefunken system in operation. The value of the stock represented by these installations is $39,450,000, or about j£8,000,000. This makes the ,£50,000 on the Estimates look remarkably small. As far back as 1907 there were sent between these wireless stations 163,677 messages. The Federal Government of the United States have seventy-three naval stations, and forty-three shore stations, making a' total of 116 Government installations. As to the business done during the year, the shore stations transmitted 26,933 messages, containing 541,519 words. Thjat shows the extent to which the wireless is superseding the old method of telegraphy. The messages received number 34,073, containing 617,607 words. The Cape Cod coastal station is credited with 2,673 messages, which were probably all oversea, and the Cavite station, Philippine Islands, was in the second place with 2,025. I admit that population has considerable bearing on a question of this kind, and that we cannot undertake anything like the amount of expenditure incurred in America; but are we doing what we should in this direction, considering the population that we have? The less we say on that point, however, the better it will be for the credit were in severe distress.' of the Commonwealth. In the United States, Newport is credited with 2,701 messages received, Dry Tortugas, Florida, with 2.073; Mare, Jersey City, with 2,334; Cape Cod, Massachusetts, with 2,304; and Norfolk, Virginia, with 2,171. Here is a remarkable instance of the development of the wireless telegraph system As showing what may be accomplished by means of it I may mention that there is in America a firm called the Sessenden Wireless Company, which is about to instal a station at Washington with reinforced concrete 600 feet high, the wireless apparatus to have a radius of 3,000 miles. This instance shows the area over which messages can be transmitted by this means, even under present conditions, and the possibilities are by no means exhausted by anything that has yet been done. The Lake Shore 'and Michigan Southern Raihvay Company has proved the possibility cf doing a most remarkable thing by means of wireless telegraphy. It may be remembered that a few days ago an experiment was tried on the express from Sydney to Albury, messages being sent from one end of the train to the other. But that feat pales into insignificance when compared with what has been done on the railway that I have mentioned. The company maintained uninterrupted connection with a train running full speed from Cleveland to Chicago, a distance of about 300 miles. That experiment shows that the utility of wireless telegraphy is not confined to ships at sea. Congress in the United States has been so much impressed with its importance that a law has been passed compelling passenger-carrying ocean-going steamers to be equipped with wireless apparatus. I am informed that the majority of the larger lake and river steamers in the United States are also installed with wireless telegraphy. An army transport ship in the United States service recently succeeded in maintaining connection with the Pacific coast when nearing Honolulu, a distance of 3,500 miles. With these great developments taking place in the world we cannot afford to ignore the progress of science and invention. If we are to maintain our position as an important part of the British Empire we must keep ourselves up-to-date and secure the best that is possible in the various departments of science. It is well understood that a vessel equipped with wireless telegraphy would be able to convey information of her location if she It is quite possible that the use of this invention might have averted such a disaster as occurred in connection with the Waratah. If there had been a means of reaching that vessel possibly many valuable lives might have been saved.",205
1270,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Wentworth) [1.21 a.m.]. - - I confess to a certain feeling of impotence in addressing myself to matters affecting the public finances at a stagewhen not only is the Parliamentary staff harassed almost to a condition of inertia,, but when I see the Ministry and their supporters facing me in a .condition of semisomnolence. The honourable member for Lang has drawn attention to various disappointing features in connection with the Post and Telegraph Department, especially with respect to wireless telegraphy. The Department has failed to keep faith in this respect, and to cope with a great public question. Over a 5 ear ago this House passed a resolution affirming the sirability of establishing wireless telegraph stations at various points on our coast-line, and equipping our mercantile marine with wireless telegraph installations. A year has elapsed, and what has been done? Owing to departmental bungling not one installation has been completed anywhere in the Commonwealth. Australia is now the only civilized country in the world where a wireless telegraph system has failed to find an abiding place. managed by private enterprise have been fitted up with wireless telegraphy in order that they might communicate with the shore, but the Australian Government failed in its duty to its own people, has afforded these vessels no means sending or receiving messages to or from any part of Australia. This deplorable state of affairs requires absolutely no ment, and simply shows that Government action is procrastinating, slow and inefficient, in comparison with the efforts of private individuals to take advantage of the prowith gress of science. I wish now to protest against the action of the Post and graph Department in a portion of my torate. In emphasizing its failure, need refer to no more than what has curred in the district of Watson's Bay. For the last twenty odd years a post-office has been established there. The district for a considerable time past has been loping considerably, though for some years it was hindered, by reason of land being held by a few owners, and not subdivided for settlement. Houses have been up in every direction. The New Wales State Government, recognising what has been going on, has given increased tramway facilities to the inhabitants Watson's Bay. Only the Post and graph Department has lagged behind. deed, not only has it failed to realise progress of the district, but it has acted if that district were retrogressing instead of progressing. The Department has tually reduced the status of the office Watson's Bay. Surely this shows the solute incapacity of the administrative officers of the Department in New South Wales. In any private enterprise managers are ready to extend their facilities expanding business, and do not, like the officials of the Post and Telegraph Departof ment restrain their energies when they should be increased. For some reason best Mr Kelly. known to the Department, this section of Sydney is charged more for telephonic comr demunication than any other section within the metropolitan area and within an equal distance of the General Post Office. For instance, Baulkham Mills, 15 miles from the General Post Office, is connected with the telephone system of Sydney, and the residents there enjoy a much cheaper rate than do the residents of Watson's Bay. When I brought this matter under the notice of the Department, the answer I received was that the regulations did not Ships permit the granting of communication witk the Edgecliffe Post-office, 4 or 5 miles away, at a cheaper rate. I then asked for a separate telephone exchange for this has locality, and was told that the departand mental practice was not to allow the esof tablishment of a new exchange within 3 miles of an existing exchange, and I was assured that Watson's Bay was within 3 commiles of the Edgecliffe Post-office ! I had then to prove that it was more than 3 miles from the Edgecliffe Post-office, and was consequently entitled to an exchange, arid, the existing subscribers, more than the requisite number might be obtained to Telejustify giving the place cheap teleelecphone communication. If this centre I had been in the heart of New South Wales, ocinstead of 5.or 6 miles from the General Post Office, Sydney, it might have had its own exchange. The Postmaster-General cannot trust the departmental officers, once devethey have given a decision, to recede from it, and in all the circumstances I now ask him not to be guided entirely by them, but to look into this matter himself, and see going that the residents of Watson's Bay are South given reasonable telephone facilities.",206
1271,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Coolgardie) [1.35 a.m.]. of - No doubt, every member of the ComTelemittee will sympathize with the honInorable member for Wentworth in his the endeavour to secure better telephone comas munication for constituents who receive three mails a day, but I should like to speak for acthree minutes on behalf of residents of at the Commonwealth who receive only a mail aba fortnight. I wish to suggest to the Postmaster-General the advisability of applying the policy he has initiated'in regard to mail services to telegraph and telephone serto meet vices. Some time ago, the honourable gentleman said that, owing to the reduction the postage rate, wherever a mail service became unpayable, he would make a present of the whole of the revenue to the locality concerned, and that the Department would bear one-half of the cost in addition, leaving only one-fourth of the total cost to be borne by the locality. My only object in rising at all at this hour is to express the hope that the honourable gentleman will see his way to extend this privilege, and apply the principle to telegraph and telephone communication in the country districts. The honourable gentleman is himself a representative of one of the outlying districts of Australia, and must appreciate the position of our pioneers. 1 feel sure that he will do all he can to remedy, not merely the grievances of the residents of densely crowded cities, who receive three mails daily, and have telephone exchanges within five minutes' walk of their homes, but will also meet the just requirements of people who have'to submit to the difficulties and privations of residence in remote districts, such as I and a number of other honourable members represent. The desire of the Government should be to do all that is possible to promote settlement, extend the limits of civilization, and make room for additional people, and I hope that, in the circumstances, every consideration will be given to the needs of residents of remote districts. Much may be done in this direction by the adoption of the suggestion I have made. I intended to open my remarks with an apology for speaking at all at so late an hour, and it is to be hoped that .we shall never have a repetition of what we have seen this session. If we believe in the eight-hours day, we should set a good example, and extend the benefits of the principle to the officers and attendants of the House. I think the present extended sitting a deplorable affair altogether, and hope that there will be no repetition of it in this Parliament, and certainly not under the auspices of a Labour Government. Some arrangement could and ought to be made whereby the length of sittings might be determined. The House of Commons solved this problem long ago, and if it could suppress long-winded speeches, I do not know why we should not be able to do so. I hope that, during the recess, the Government will give some consideration to the inflictions sometimes suffered, not by honourable members, who can. go outside if they choose, but by the officers of the House.",207
1272,Mr THOMAS BROWN,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Calare) [1.45 a.m.] - In the present circumstances, not feel disposed to discuss the Postal timates as I should like to do, though, for years past, I have felt myself compelled to be a rather severe critic of this Depart-' ment. Other honourable members have, at times, considered that my criticism was scarcely warranted, but it has been amply justified by events. I am glad now, to know that a move has been made in the direction of bringing about a radical reform in the Department, and I shall watch what is done with interest. The members of the Postal Commission have at last completed their work, and the results of their inquiry are available. There has not yet been time to fully consider their recommendations, but I Was pleased to learn from the statement of the Acting Prime Minister that the Government have decided to make some radical changes in the near future; that the underpaid branches 'of the service will receive consideration, and the sweating and friction in the Department will be remedied. The Acting Prime Minister has made a move in the right direction in bringing the employees of this .important service under the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court. It must be' apparent that it is necessary to have some independent judicial tribunal to settle differences arising in connection with rates of pay, hours of work, and conditions of service. I - think the Government would be well advised if they considered the establishment of another tribunal to deal with complaints as to work done, cases in which it may be necessary to inflict punishment, and to determine the qualifications of officers, matters which could not well be brought under the jurisdiction of an Arbitration Court. I know that, when a private member, the Acting Prime Minister had in view legislation intended to invest the judicial authorities of the State with some powers to deal with matters of. this kind. I hope the Postmaster-General will distinguish his term of office by initiating a policy of progress, which will have the effect of increasing the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities afforded to the country districts. I direct attention to the need for the better lighting of country post-offices. In country towns of some importance, and in which private enterprise has installed electric lighting, the Postal Department is satisfied to rest content with the old kerosene lamps. ' I hope that we shall find substantial improvements made in this Department, and that it will be I do fitted to be a worthy servant of the great Espeople in whose interests it is run.",208
1273,Mr FINLAYSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Brisbane) [1.55 a.m.] - I wish to refer to the proposed vote for the Vancouver Mail Service. It comprises votes which are included in the Estimates of the Department for the different States, and the first reference to it is to be found in sub-division 6 of division 212-Conveyanc e of mails vid Vancouver, ^£10,000. This is the amount on the Estimates for New South Wales. The amount for Victoria is £7,950; Queensland,. £3,500; South Australia, £2,536 ; Western Australia, £1,710; Tasmania, £[1,200; or a total vote of £26,896. There is a further vote of £4,729 on the Supplementary Estimates, which makes a grand total of .£31,625. In view of the circumstances under which the matter is being considered, I shall not inflict upon the Committee anything like the amount of detail which I had hoped to submit for their consideration, but I cannot allow so important a matter to pass without some reference. At present, negotiations are ceeding with Canada in reference to the new Vancouver mail contract, which will commence on the ist August next year. The matter which most concerns me, and which, I hope, will receive the careful sideration of honourable members, is the proposal to include a port in New Zealand as one of the regular ports of call, with probably the exclusion of some of the Australian ports. That would not be so bad, if it were not proposed also, that, should an Australian port be included, it should be a port not at present served, and that bane, which is at present a port of call, should be excluded. ' The whole matter has been under consideration for some years, and I shall put the position as briefly as possible, in order that honourable members may be seized of the danger which I think threatens, not one, but every port in the Commonwealth. For some years prior to Federation, the then Colonies of New South Wales and Queensland, at considerable annual expense, subsidized the Vancouver mail service. They kept it going for several years, and opened up a regular and increasing trade with the western provinces of Canada. That trade, from the inception of the service, never suffered any diminution in volume. On the contrary, it has grown by leaps and bounds, until it has now assumed very considerable importance, and there is every evidence of vast increase in the future. When Federation was accomplished, the Commonwealth took over the service, and since that time, under short contracts, and, latterly, under yearly extensions, the service has been continued. The time has now arrived when it is necessary that an extended contract should be made, and a better service provided. Honourable members will perhapshave noticed in the press of today mention of the fact that the Union Steam-ship Company, the only tenderers for the new service, are proposing the introduction of ships of 12,000 tons to meet the trade of the service. Hitherto, the service has been between Vancouver, Brisbane, and Sydney. Only two ports in Australia have been served, but New Zealand has enjoyed some of the benefits of the service by a branch line from Auckland, connecting with the Vancouver mail service at Suva, in the Fiji Islands. For some time now, New Zealand, possibly because of reciprocal trade arrangements with Canada, has been offering very heavy financial inducements for pro- a direct service with Vancouver, and one can well understand New Zealand's interests in this regard, because the trade in the particular commodities which Australia and New Zealand can so well supply is conlargely developed in the western provinces of Canada, owing largely to the enormous and rapid increase in the population of those provinces. New Zealand very naturally desires to have a share of that trade. One could not well raise any objection were it not for the fact that New Zealand is stipulating, and the Canadian GovernBris- ment are somewhat, if not altogether, favourable to the view-that she should be allowed to come into the service on payment of a heavy subsidy, which means that Australia must forego some of the present advantages of the service in order that a New Zealand port may be included in the itinerary. Further, the proposal means that facilities should be afforded for the operation of a very strong competitor of ours in markets which we have ourselves opened up at very considerable expense. The trade with the Western provinces of Canada is a season's trade. Their seasons and ours are not contemporaneous. Just at the time they most need meat, butter, and dairv produce generally, we are in a position to supply those articles. As a matter of fact, there is never sufficient accommodation on the ships for the orders awaiting shipment, and during the butter season, from fifty to six hundred boxes of butter have at times been shut out owing to the lack of refrigerating accommodation. Honourable members may be surprised to learn that the major portion of the Queensland butter export that finds its way to the Western provinces of Canada has at present to be shipped by Orient steamers to London, thence across the Atlantic, and thence across the American continent to the Western Canadian provinces. It will be admitted that that is not a satisfactory state of affairs, and something should be done to provide the best possible service between Australia and Canada. There are very strong reasons why Melbourne should be included in the service. I strongly advocate the extension of the present service to Melbourne, but I wish to express the strongest dissent from any proposal to include a New Zealand port, even though that might be a strong reason for the institution of a better service. The inclusion of New Zealand would mean at least an additional five days in the time, and a consequent delay in the arrival of mails, with a loss of time in their despatch. The difficulty now is that Melbourne newspapers are advocating the inclusion of Melbourne to the exclusion of Brisbane.",209
1274,Mr THOMAS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I promise the honourable member that Brisbane will not be excluded.,210
1275,Mr FINLAYSON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"The point is that, under existing conditions, Melbourne shippers, in order to take advantage of the service, are handicapped with a charge of 12s. 66. per ton for transhipping goods to the steamers of the service at Sydney, and I very strongly object to any arrangement under which that handicap would be transferred to Queensland shippers, and that would be an inevitable consequence if Melbourne were included in the itinerary and Brisbane left out. There are immense possibilities for the development of trade by a Vancouver service, and we want an Australian service. It might ultimately include Hobart, because Tasmania could undoubtedly do a satisfactory trade with Canada. I desire to put on record a statement in connection with the matter, because a new contract will be arranged during the recess, and because I think it will be a great mistake to exclude any of the Australian ports. If we are going to subsidize the service to the extent of £30,000 a year, we should not handicap our own oorts to satisfy the aspirations of New Zealand. If New Zealand desires a service with Vancouver, in order to enter into competition with us for the trade of the Western provinces of Canada, she should pay for that service. I hope the Postmaster-General will see that the interests of all Australian ports are conserved in the new service to be arranged at the beginning of next year.",210
1276,Mr THOMAS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"Barrier-Postmaster General) [2.7 a.m.] - I hafe listened with pleasure and interest to the speech delivered by the honourable member for Gwydir ^ and I can promise him. that, in the early part of January, I shall get the Deputy Postmasters-General together, and with them will go very carefully through the report of the Postal Commission. I shall give it, and will ask them to give it, die most sympathetic consideration, and, as far as possible, will endeavour to carry out a great many of their recommendations. The honourable member will recognise that, as a Government, we have not yet had time to properly look into the report. The members of the Commission devoted three years of very hard work to their investigation, and the preparation of their report. I have been able to do little more.than glance through it casually. But I admit that it is deserving of a good deal of attention, and I intend to give it that attention. I shall avail myself of an offer which the honourable member for Gwydir has been^ood enough to make to me privately, that, if I consider he can be of any service to the Department, I have only to call upon him. I shall take into serious consideration the suggestion of the honourable member for Coolgardie, because I am extremely anxious that the back country should be given the benefit of improved mail and telephonic communication. The difficulty is to find some basis on which to work, and I desire that it shall be as liberal as possible.",210
1277,Mr MAHON,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,I ask the Minister to extend the same privilege in regard to telephonic communication as has been extended in connection with mail services.,210
1278,Mr THOMAS,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,"I shall see what we can do. Honourable members will perhaps be pleased to note that the Public Service Commissioner has been good enough to inform me that he is prepared to take into favourable consideration an increase in the payments to the lower-paid officers of the Department. This matter can only be dealt with in next year's Estimates, but the Public Service Commissioner is prepared to recommend, first of all, that letter-carriers mail-drivers, porters, batterymen, storemen, and others of that class, instead of remaining three years at ^ n o , and then going to £114, shall only be.two years at £ n o , and ""then go to £120, with nial increases of £ 6 up to £150. Under this method, a youth who joins the service as a telegraphic messenger, and becomes a letterl* carrier, will be in receipt of .£150 per annum when he is thirty-two or thirty-three years old. .",210
1279,Mr WEBSTER,SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES,Thos e are exactly the terms of the Postal Commission's recommendations.,211

1312,Mr KELLY,SUPPLEMENTARY,"Unti l any hour honourable members like, provided that the officers are given some time in which to get a little rest, wEch, I am sure, was never more needed in the case of any men I have been acquainted with. I urge on the Acting Prime Minister that he should recon. sider his position, and afford to the officers a rest which I feel sure every honourable member desires that they shall have. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [2.55 a.m.] - This is a most extraordinary proposition to which we have been asked agree. We have been sitting continuously since 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday. I have not had a rest during the whole of that time. With the exception of'a few minutes occasionally, I have been here during whole of this day. I have been living, to sat. the danger of my life, in this foul atmodifficult sphere which we have been compelled breathe for so many hours: against any attempt to wear members down by the process of compulsory physical exhaustion. Even if the members of the House are not to be consession sidered, some consideration ought to be tended to those who have to render sory service to them. Surely if the members of the House are entitled to no sideration, a .Labour Government which professes to have the special interests the workers at heart should show a little consistency, and also a little common humanity to those who have had arduously here for many hours longer than they are ordinarily expected to do. I hope that not only will they be considered in matter of having a few hours' rest, but in the matter of receiving monetary pensation, in addition to their ordinary salary, for the extra time which they been obliged to work.
