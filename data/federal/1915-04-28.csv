LANDING AT THE DARDANELLES-RABAU L COURT MARTIAL - HEALTH OF TROOPSRECRUITING. - Mr ANSTEY - I ask the Assistant Minister of Defence whether he is aware that a statement has appeared to the effect that the Allied Forces, under Sir Ian Hamilton, have landed in the Dardanelles, and whether he has authority for saying that the Australian troops form part of the general's command?",4
1,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,Information has been received that a portion of the soldiers who were recently in Egypt has been sent across to the Dardanelles.,4
2,Mr GROOM,Unknown,A portion of the Australian force?,4
3,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,Yes .,4
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Is the Assistant Minister of Defence aware whether there is any objection to laying on the table of the House the reports of responsible officers made in connection with the proceedings at Rabaul ? As there is a great deal of mystery surrounding this matter, I do not see why the House should not be placed in full possession of the documents.",4
5,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Nearl y all the papers in connection with the case are now in Sydney, having been sent there in order that the inquiry there may be completed.",4
6,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"Has the Minister seen the report published by the Argus, and written by its special correspondent, stating that many of the men in Egypt have been in bad health, but that not one officer has had to go to the hospital? Does ho know whether the statements aro true or not!",4
7,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The Department has no knowledge of this matter. The reports coming to hand from General Bridges are most satisfactory. The General states that the officers are all in good health, or that most of them are,- and they seem to be well satisfied wibh their conditions.",4
8,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I shouldlike the Assistant Minister of Defence to tell us' whether recruiting is up to the numbers that can be dealt witli by the Department. Is any large number of additional recruits required, and, if so, would ib not be possible for public men to arrange week-end recruiting meetings with the view to obtaining, the necessary men ? It is not known to the public what are the requirements of the Commonwealth in this regard; nor is it known to what extent the authorities are prepared to equip and send troops to the seat of war?",4
9,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The recruits who are offering themselves to go to the front are very satisfactory in regard to number, and are up to the Government's requirements.",5
10,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Are we to take it that (&he Government are sending recruits to the seat of war as quickly as they can be equipped and got ready?,5
11,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,The Governmenb are sending to the seat of war what recruits the Imperial authorities require. AMERICANFRUITQUARANTINE . Minister,5
12,Mr GROOM,Unknown,A few weeks ago sent to the Minister the report putation of f r u it growers who pointed that the quarantine regulations in the United States amount to a practical prohibition of the export of f r u it from Australia to that country.

Three or four sentences further down am made to sayThere is no danger,. nor is there likely be any, so long as we have an inconvertible note issue. I have always stated that we are in of a convertible note issue. As a' matter do likewise. of fact, the galley proof in which the mistake first occurred was corrected, but, to the regret of the officials .and myself, it was mislaid in the Government Printing Office. I wish honourable members and the country to know that, so far as this Government are concerned, we are not in favour of an inconvertible note issue. We stand by the present issue, which is convertible at all times. MURRAY WATERS AGREEMENT .",5
15,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister take steps to have the report of Mr Elwood Mead, on the Murray Waters Agreement, which is being laid before the Victorian Legislative Assembly by the State Minister of. Agriculture, made a parliamentary paper of this House?",5

20,Mr FENTON,STONE WORK FOR VICTORIA,"I should like to ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether the stone work in connection with the extension of the Victoria Barracks is to be carried out by day labour; if so, when w i ll the work be ready? A number of stonemasons are unemployed.",6
21,Mr ARCHIBALD,STONE WORK FOR VICTORIA,"The stone work, so far as is known at present, will be done by day labour on the job almost immediately. NA CARRIER S.",6
22,Mr RODGERS,STATERAILWAYS AS COMMON,"Has the Attorney General had brought under his notice the published statement that some States have declined to allow their railway systems to be used for the purpose of Inter-State trade? Do not the States stand in the position of common carriers in respect of their railways, and if the Government have no constitutional power to deal with any such attitude as that indicated, will they consider the advisability of introducing legislation to confer that power upon them?",6
23,Mr HUGHES,STATERAILWAYS AS COMMON,"I have not seen the statement to which the honourable member has referred. B y the terms in which the Railways Commissioner refers to the matter, it would appear that, so far as Victoria is concerned, the refusal by the Department to carry certain goods was due to a misunderstanding. The Commissioner is reported to have saidIt was never intended that the prohibition order should apply to the Biverina. There has [97]- 2 PAPERS been a misunderstanding somewhere, and steps will be taken at once to revoke the order so far as it has been applied to the Biverina. I understand, however, that the honourable member's question has a much wider significance-that ' he desires to know whether the Railways Commissioners of any State have the right, as common carriers, to refuse to carry goods tendered. I will give the honourable gentleman a matured opinion on that question tomorrow. BORROWING BYTHE STATES.",6
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATERAILWAYS AS COMMON,"A statement having appeared in the press that the Victorian Government have floated a loan of Â£2,500,000 in London with great success, I should like the Prime Minister to inform the House whether that loan in any way contravenes the agreement made at the Conference between the Premiers and the Federal Ministers as to borrowing by the States in their relation to the Commonwealth Government? Does this loan invalidate the arrangement by which the States were to do no borrowing on their own account, but to rely on the Commonwealth Government for the raising of any loan in London ? Is the agreement still intact?",6
25,Mr FISHER,STATERAILWAYS AS COMMON,"I learn from the press that the Victorian Government have borrowed money in London; that loan is not in conformity with the agreement entered into by the States with the Commonwealth. I do not think that the loan nullifies that agreement, but I should not expect that we would raise any objection to the States availing themselves of an opportunity to raise money. Nevertheless, they certainly did enter into an agreement not to borrow money in London or in Australia.",6
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,STATERAILWAYS AS COMMON,Does that apply to the Norton-Griffiths agreement?,6
27,Mr FISHER,STATERAILWAYS AS COMMON,Yes ; if it comes into operation during the term of agreement. On two occasions I have told the States that we did not consider it our duty to stand in the way of their making a good financial arrangement.,6
28,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,STATERAILWAYS AS COMMON,"W as it not part of the arrangement arrived at by the Conference that the States were not to borrow money except for the conversion of existing loans, and were not to compete with the Commonwealth by entering upon the general money market for borrowing? Obviously the object of that was not to embarrass the Federal Government, which was lending the States a large sum of money. Does not the Prime Minister consider it necessary, in the interests of the Commonwealth, to see that that condition, which attached to the lending of that large sum of money, should be enforced?",6
29,Mr FISHER,STATERAILWAYS AS COMMON,"I have again and again called the attention of the States to the terms of the agreement which the Premiers signed, but, as the honourable member for Flinders knows, in this matter we are not like private contracting parties. Circumstances may arise in which it would be in the interests of a State and the Commonwealth to relax the terms of that arrangement.",7
30,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,STATERAILWAYS AS COMMON,But should the States approach you first?,7
31,Mr FISHER,STATERAILWAYS AS COMMON,"They have mentioned the matter to me more than once. One of the Premiers broached the subject before he left Melbourne, just after signing the agreement. In the case of another State, immediately the trouble arose, I was approached on the subject, and on the advice which was available I felt that it was my duty not to hold the States tightly to their agreement. However, the agreement is not set aside, and I never pretended to have any power to set it aside.",7
32,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,STATERAILWAYS AS COMMON,Is it understood that the States may borrow without restriction ?,7
33,Mr FISHER,STATERAILWAYS AS COMMON,No .,7
34,Mr RILEY,STATERAILWAYS AS COMMON,What is to prevent them from doing so?,7
35,Mr FISHER,STATERAILWAYS AS COMMON,"In my opinion, only their honour. NA SOUTH WALES .",7
36,Mr BURCHELL,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"H as the attention of the Attorney-General been drawn to the statement in the press, that the Government of New South Wales are prohibiting the free transmission of butter from that State to other States? If so, what action does he propose to take in order to re-establish Inter-State Free Trade ?",7
37,Mr HUGHES,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"I did see a newspaper statement to the effect that the Attorney-General of New South Wales had decided to prohibit the export of butter, but I thought the item had strayed from the humorous column of the paper. The Attorney-General of New South Wales has no powers in regard to export, and I can hardly suppose that his Government would attempt to exercise any. The control of exports is confined exclusively to the Commonwealth. EXPERIMENTS INRAIN MAKING .",7
38,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"Will the Prime Minister inform the House whether Mr . Balsillie's experiment in rain making was for the purpose of obviating the "" l it t l e d r o u g h t "" ; also, in view of the wide extension of the "" l it t l e drought,"" whether those experiments are likely to bear any f r u it ?",7
39,Mr FISHER,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"I am not a hydrostatic expert. As regards the scientific not researches of Mr Balsillie, there is no gentleman of my acquaintance or reading in whom I place more faith in a matter of this kind. However, the Government decided not to employ him in those experiments"" but I shall be glad to hear of his success. unemployed CUSTOMS DEPARTMENT : FURNITURE.",7
40,Mr GROOM,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"Has the Minister of Trade and Customs seen the newspaper report of a deputation which waited on him with reference to certain importations of leather, or alleged leatlier? That report states that the leather-covered f u r n i ture-covere d with imported leather-in the office of the Minister had been ordered by his predecessor. As a matter of fact, the furnitur e in the room when I was at the Department was the same as that which was there when I became Minister.",7
41,Mr TCJDOR,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"After the deputation had been heard, it was mentioned that the very chairs on which they had been seated-which , by the way, were not worn as stated-were covered with the imported leather which had been referred to, but I told the deputation that so far as I knew those chairs had been in the Department since the commencement of Federation. PRICE OF BUTTE R.",7
42,Mr JH CATTS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"Before the At torney-General takes any action having as its object interference with the New South Wales Labour Government in its regulation of prices, will he take into oonsideration the fact that, in consequence of that regulation, first-class butter is selling at 6d. per l b . less in Sydney than in Melbourne? the honourable gentleman, in any action he may take, consider how far it may prejudicially affect the public?",7
43,Mr HUGHES,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"I am rather at a disadvantage in answering a question in which questions of constitutional law and facts relating to prices of commodities and certain suggested action in regard thereto, involving f r i g h t f u l consequences, are closely associated. I can only say that the Commonwealth is unable to take any official cognisance of the prices of commodities, wholesale or retail. question of the honourable member, as in terpreted to me by the Minister of Trade and Customs, appears to be whether I will most carefully consider the effects of any action proposed to be taken. I certainly shall. As to the powers of the Commonwealth I have no doubt at all as to what these are; and I have already expressed my opinion in regard to their use in reply to a previous question. WAR PRECAUTIONS BILL .",8
44,Mr WATT,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"Does the Prime Minister feel at liberty to make available, for the confidential use of members, the later communications that have reached him from the Imperial Government respecting the War Precautions Bill now before Parliament ?",8
45,Mr FISHER,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,I must ask the honourable member to put that question on the notice-paper. I should like to look into the whole matter.,8
46,Mr WATT,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,Will the right honourable member hold the Bill back ?,8
47,Mr FISHER,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"I do not think that will be necessary. At a later hour of the day I may, perhaps, be able to give the honourable member the information he desires. MAIL CONTRACTORS.  ister prepared to place a sum of money on the Estimates in order to enable the Postmaster-General to afford some modicum of relief to those mail contractors who are so hardly h it in consequence of the high price of fodder?",8
48,Mr FISHER,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"That is a question of policy with which I , as Treasurer, can deal only on a report from the Postmaster-General. It would not only be a loose, but a dangerous thing to make a promise of the kind suggested u n t i l the Will matter has been reported on by the Minister concerned. I do not wish the matter itself to be compromised by anything I may say.  able gentleman consult the Postmaster General ?",8
49,Mr FISHER,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"A report made by the Postmaster-General to the Cabinet will be considered in the light of the experience of the last year. LAND TAX.  that in New South Wales, and, I believe, in other States, a great number of graziers are paying more in the way of graduated land tax than they are paying to the State in rent on their leases? A gentleman in the Forbes district is paying Â£ 2 5 a year to the State as rent, and Â£ 45 a year to the Commonwealth as land tax.",8
50,Mr FISHER,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,I am not aware of all the facts in those cases. DARWIN PRESS: CENSORSHIP.,8
51,Mr WATKINS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"In the absence of the Minister of External Affairs, I desire to ask the Assistant Minister of Defence whether he noticed a paragraph in today's newspaper, to the effect that the people of Darwin are complaining of the censorship over news published in their local newspaper. Is there any difference between the censorship imposed at Darwin and the censorship imposed in other parts of the Commonwealth ?",8
52,Mr JENSEN,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"I know of no distinction, but I shall make inquiries for the honourable member. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). EXPEDITIONARY FORCES : AUSTRALIAN TROOPS FROM EGYPT.",8
53,Mr SPEAKER,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"I have received an intimation from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The condition of, and the treatment meted out to, the soldiers from Egypt, invalided to Australia."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. - Mr MATHEWS (Melbourne Ports) [3.28] - I know that to many honourable members the matter to which I desire to call attention sinks into insignificance when compared with the mighty events at the seat of war. But armies are made up of units; and it is essential, in the interests of all armies, that the conditions of the units should be considered, so that they may be guaranteed to be in that state of physical fitness so essential to good soldiers. If the men are not treated in a manner that reflects credit, not only on their officers, but on the Government responsible, we cannot expect to get from them the results we desire. In Victoria - I do not know as to the other Stateswe are informed that there is a falling off in the number of those who desire to enlist; and the figures have been published in the newspapers. This falling off, I am afraid, will continue when the men who have been returned from Egypt are able to explain to the people in Australia how they were treated when abroad, and how they have been treated since their arrival here. Surely, if men are willing to leave Australia, and possibly sacrifice their lives, it is the duty of the Government, and of the community generally, to see that the treatment meted out to them is such as to a feeling of satisfaction, and worthy of a civilized community. If it is not so, we cannot expect our men to be imbued with the ardour we all desire they should display. A terrible in dictment is laid against the management of not only the commissariat, but the hospital accommodation in Egypt. is difficult to understand how this trouble should arise seeing that there is really no fighting in Egypt. Whattook place on the Suez Canal was merely an affair of outposts. The Australian camp is close to Cairo and Alexandria, and if the requisite supplies could not be obtained from either of thosecities, they should be procurable without difficulty from Europe, since Britain has command of the seas. Is it not peculiar, then, that there should be any cause for these complaints ? Then again, our men have been overworked. This, perhaps, has been due to a desire on the part of the authorities to make them specially fit for the duties that await them. All that is necessary to make them hardy should be done, but surely some discretion ought to be exercised. Why should men who, even in what might be described as extranormal circumstances, would remain physically fit, be subjected to such heavy work as to make them actually. unfit for the very duties for which they enlisted ? I make this charge against those responsible in Egypt for what has occurred. It may also reflect on the Government which I support, but, so far as that is concerned, I care little, believing that action must be taken to remedy these grievances. The fact that we have an abnormal sick list in Egypt reflects great discredit on those in charge there, and we are justified in taking steps to ascertain what has brought it about. When we hear that it is traceable to overwork, under-feeding, and bad feeding, it is surely time that we investigated the whole matter. The men who enlisted for active service should have considerate treatment while in Egypt, and those who have become physically unfit and have consequently had to be returned are also entitled to consideration at our hands.",8
54,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,P r o m whom do these complaints come ?,9
55,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,F r o m men who have returned.,9
56,Mr KELLY,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"Not from men still in Egypt ? create Mr MATHEWS - Yes ; I , in common is with other honourable members, have submitted to the Minister of Defence letters from men in Egypt complaining of the manner in which they have been dealt with there. I admit that many of the members of the Expeditionary Forces in Egypt are satisfied with their lot. They It are, for the most part, hardy men, and have made certain provision for themselves. Many of them have been fed fairly well, but they secured better food only by contributions of their own to the camp funds. There must be some reason for the abnormal sick list, representing as it does 10 per cent, or 12 per cent, of the men in Egypt. Will any one say that our troops are more sickly or less sturdy than are those from Europe or Canada ? I , for one, refuse to believe anything of the kind. We are told that those on the sick list at the front comprise only about 3 per cent, of the British Forces, notwithstanding that the men have been engaged in fierce fighting, have been compelled to remain for long stretches in the trenches, and to endure bitterly cold weather. On the other hand, our men in Egypt, who physically are quite the equal of troops from any other part of the British Empire, or those of the allied nations, have this serious rate of sickness. We who saw them leave, and who know many of them disciplinary cases. personally, are satisfied that they are quite as fit to fight in Europe as are any of the allied forces. The Government promised to inquire into the reasons for this abnormal sick list, but we have reticular ceived no reports on the subject.",9
57,Mr KELLY,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,Have the promised to remedy the trouble?,10
58,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,They some time ago to look into the matter.,10
59,Mr KELLY,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"If that is so, why the question here?",10
60,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"Because the Gofirst vernment have been rather long in ing their inquiries, and I feel that i in the interests of Australia that this ance should be remedied. abroad that the men are not properly treated, we cannot hope to maintain the fron t the army that we desire to keep there.",10
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"In other words, the honourable member wishes to "" f l o g his joss.""",10
62,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"The right honoron able member is entitled to have his joke, but this is not a joking matter. We have lately had returned to us a number of had their overcoats. men, who are full of complaints. realise that it is human nature to comthought plain, that the right to growl is the Britisher's prerogative, and that those who volunteer for active service should expect to be treated as feather-bed diers or to be pampered in any way. I will be said, of course, that these knew when they enlisted that they were entering upon a difficult task, that they should be prepared to acsponsible cept hard knocks. But while that is we ought not to condone any failure to continuestake reasonable precautions to prevent disabilities such as those under which men have laboured in Egypt. the progress of a battle, it may be quite impossible to provide all the hospital acto commodation that is desirable, and the - commissariat department is sometimes to the platform. hindered from bringing up supplies - exactly when required. In Egypt, howhis swag. ever, there has been practically no fighting, and, therefore, I feel justified i bringing these complaints before the House, and asking for an investigation. of There recently returned by the Ulysses several hundred meu, most of whom had been invalided home, while others were",10
63,Mr KELLY,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,Have the Government have promised to look into this matter?,10
64,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,Not into the parcase to which I am about to refer.,10
65,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,Why not place Government it before the Minister?,10
66,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"I am going to place promised it before the House, because the answers I have received from the Department raise have not satisfied me. I have before me a typewritten statement, written in the person, but signed by a number of makmen who have returned. It would have t is been signed by dozens of others if the grievopportunity had offered. I have also If it gets letters from many men bearing out the complaints made in this statement as to at the treatment to which men have been subjected, both in Egypt and upon their return here. The writensays23rd April, 1915. SIR,- I wish to complain of the treatment meted out to returned convalescent soldiers who returned from Egypt by the s.s. Ulysses Thursday last. The following is a list of our grievances: Convalescent patients on night previous to disembarkation were sleeping without bedding or covering. A number only I That was due to the fact that it was possible to land the men the night before, with the result that all their bedding was removed. These men, who had not been invalided home, were thus left all solnight on board ship without even such t bedding as men physically f it would demen sire. Surely an incident of that character ought to be looked into, and its recurand rence prevented. What is more, those ref or it , to use a colloquialism, so, should be made to "" sit up."" The writer On Friday morning we disembarked about our 10 a.m. at Williamstown. Every man was D u r in g compelled to carry his own kit to the station, and many of the men were not in a fit state do so. A private, by name of Winepress, was so exhausted at the arrival at the station that two of his comrades had to assist him on And yet this man was expected to carry On arrival at Flintlcrs-street station we were n relieved of our kit-bags and marched*to Army Service Orderly-rooms at rear of St. Kilda Barracks. Not more than 100 yards in front of us was an escort with fixed bayonets in charge of the disciplinary cases. In rear of us there was also two or more of the armed escort. This treatment we objected to, as we consider it made us appear in the eyes of the public as undesirables. We protested, but no notice was taken of our complaints. We all know the contumely that has been heaped ou men who, for disciplinary reasons, have been returned to Australia. Though we realise that, perhaps, to an extent, they should be excused, we feel a sense of disgust that they could not restrain themselves or do credit to Australia, and that by their action a taint has been cast upon this country. If we feel this disgust, how much more disgust would be felt by those who were compelled to consort with these men on landing. Surely the Defence Department should have recognised the difference in character between the men who were ill and men who had been disciplined - at any rate, so that the distinction should be apparent to those who witnessed their arrival. I heard the statement that 'certain people were surprised to see that two men whom they had been informed had been invalided were among the disciplinary cases. These may be matters of detail, but the men who were invalided considered that their characters had been besmirched by their having been subjected to the condemnation that was meted out to the disciplinary cases, and all owing to the lack of forethought on the part of those who supervised the landing. The letter continuesOn our nrrival at the Orderly-rooms informed that no leave would be granted, the guard with fixed bayonets was placed - around the Orderly-rooms. This we considered as unnecessary, as it was unjust, seeing that many .of us were not more than twenty away from our homes. I myself applied for war. leave to see my wife and family, stating I would return at any time they fixed My request was refused. These men were invalided, yet they were guarded as if they were something which Australia had to be ashamed. Mid-day meal wos given to the men. I sisted of one 4-lb. loaf and a tin of "" beef to eighteen men. Here, in Australia, eighteen invalids were given a 4-lb. loaf of bread and a of "" bully "" beef for their dinner ! The men complained of the short rations, and they .were informed that that was had for them, as they did not know of their arrival. Mr Mathews. They were in Hobson's Bay on the day before. Prior to this the previous two meals, Thursday's tea and Friday's breakfast, were short. These two meals we had on the Ulysses. Many of the men complained that they had no breakfast. On Saturday at 2 p.m. the men were granted leave till the following Monday. I had ascertained that they were there, and had interested myself in getting them away. There was a sort of examination, and the men were let ofi on the Saturday. 0 We complained of the manner in which our clothing was taken from us. Many men whose homes were in the country were made to return their uniform, and were given a suit of civilian clothes. This meant that the men had to return to their homes as ordinary citi-Â° zens. One man who objected to this treatment was placed under arrest and stripped of his uniform. This may seem a small matter to many, but the impression created by stripping these men of their uniforms would be that they were disciplinary cases sent back to Australia. Australia had been proud to see them leave for the fron t in their uniforms, each man's town had been proud of his departure, yet when they wished to return to their towns in those uniforms they were robbed of them; and because they objected one man was subjected to ill-treatment and his uniform was forcibly removed. The men on being discharged, myself included, were handed discharges showing "" Becord of character while on service unavailable."" Every action of the Department branded these invalided men as disciplinary cases. we were I have the discharge of a young man and whom I have known from his birth, and with whom I have been associated all my life. He is a nephew of the late General minutes Hoad, and was at the South African On leaving Egypt he was given that complimentary letters from his lieutenupon. ant, from his captain, and from his colonel, Colonel Elliot, commanding the 7th Battalion, who wrote a most compliof mentary letter. His discharge bears on it the words "" medically unfit for sert convice,'.' and on the back are the words bully"" '* No record available."" The Defence Department, when it has no desire to be hard on a man who is dist in charged from service has a system of placing on his discharge the words "" Services are no longer required."" These all they words are not to a degree condemna? tory, but at the same time their meaning is well known. Here we have the case of a sergeant whose record must have been, according to his officers, good to an unlimited degree, and from whom his colonel, as he writes,' was sorry to part, and yet when he returns to Australia and seeks for work, he is faced with the words on his discharge, ' ' No record available."" He was in hospital at Mena, and the authorities knew that he was to be sent to Australia, yet they did not follow the ordinary military usage of sending on his record, so that the authorities here could distinguish between his case and that of a disciplinary case. It is no wonder that these men feel that their position was an undesirable one, not only from their stand-point, but also from, the standpoint of an Australian citizen. We know that in many cases records of our service were retained, as many of us had read our conduct sheets. I , myself, have three testimonials, one from the colonel of my regiment and two from my officers. With such, character* of discharge we believe that many of us will find it difficult in securing employment. Men were discharged who, in our opinion, were medically unfit. Here is the charge against the Department. When they had no further use for these men, because they were physically unfit to carry on their duties as soldiers they discharged them, and paid them up to the date of discharge only, though they were unfit to earn their living. Such conduct is not conducive towards increasing the enlisting roll. I may be told that I am "" fouling my own nest""; but the only method of removing the present grievance is to show the men that while we clamour to send them away, while we urgently desire to see them fighting at the front, we are also determined that when they' are returned, maimed or ill , they shall be treated as men, and not things. We are brought here to, if possible, make the condition of the men better; but, as a matter of fact, we seem to have been perpetuating the old ideas carried out amongst British people from lime immemorial. To continueAnd in the case of Private Nelson it will only menn a short time when this man will ceed(-et ill again unless operated upon. His complaint was brought on while on service. necessary, further details regarding our ment will be readily furnished. I held the runic of sergeant at the inception of the First Expeditionary Force at Broadmeadows. 1 gained promotion to platoon sergeant while Egypt. I have had many years' service in connection with the Commonwealth Military Forces, and served also in the Boer War. There is not a blemish on my character since I have been connected with the Military Forces. It .is not likely that this man is going to destroy his record by making statements of this character, and action was forced on me because I have known him during the whole of his life. He is a man who would do credit to Australia, and who has the interests of Australia at heart. He would go back tomorrow were he physically fit. When I heard these complaints, I proceeded to the Department. I went over to the barracks, and there I made verbal complaints. These are the replies I have receivedWith reference to your. verbal representations yesterday, I am directed to inform you Â»s follows :-Discharg e issued to No. 641, Sergeant F. J. S. Hoad, 7th Battalion. This non-commissioned officer. was returned as an ordinary invalid, and no papers have been received at head-quarters regarding him. He was shown in divisional orders of 4th March,1915, as ""No longer physically fit for war service."" His papers no doubt will shortly come to hand. If that man cannot get work because he has not a discharge, it is the duty of this Government to see that he is paid until he can get work. That is a duty we owe to the men who volunteer.",10
67,Mr RILEY,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,Was his pay stopped before he i was discharged ?,12
68,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"The .men were only paid up to a certain point. But I would like to point out, with regard to Sergeant Williams, that he had only collected 30s. in pay while he was away. Wben he arrived back he expected to get the money that was due, but the Department had no record showing what he had drawn, and did not know how much he was to get. They gave him Â£ 4 on account, but if a man who leaves the whole of his money as deferred pay cannot collect what is due to him until the record is sent for and comes back from Egypt, what position is he in? Another peculiar feature is that, in common with others, he was sent on board immediately before the ship sailed. The commanding officer knew nothing about the men at all, and had no record of what they were returned for. To proNo. 1309, Lance-Sergeant J. Williams, 5th If Battalion. The only information . regarding treatthis man at present to hand is contained in a cable from the base depot, Egypt, dated 29th March, 1915, which shows his to be a medical case, and that medical certificates and recomjn mendations for discharging will follow. From his pay-book it appears that this man has been subjected to certain stoppages of pay whilst in Egypt, and it is not apparent what amount is now due to him. In the meantime the sum of Â£4 has been advanced to him on account. What sort of a system is that to mete out to these men? W it h regard to other charges, the departmental reply statesWith reference to your representations to me yesterday regarding treatment of recently returned soldiers, I am directed to inform you as follows in connection with the several statements which you referred to :1. That on the return of the troops from Egypt they are all marched through the streets together with an armed guard, and the public is unable to distinguish between disciplinary and medical cases Here is the sort of sting given by the Defence Department in reply to all these matters. I am not charging Civil Service authorities. This is the reply that comes from the military man when an attempt is made to maintain the principle that men are innocent - until they are proved guiltyI t is reported that the troops were brought from the transport in a body, the disciplinary coses being separated from the medical. This was done as a result of the report of the offihearing ? cer commanding the troopship, who stated that the medical cases had given' considerable trouble on the voyage, and proved equally troublesome ashore. The only trouble tliese men gave ashore was that they objected to being stripped of their uniform and complained of being locked up. Before the ship arrived, Captain Abbot, the officer in charge of the whole of these men-the ordinary cases, the medical cases, and the disciplinary cases-passe d very complimentary remarks upon their behaviour on board, stating that they had given no trouble at all. This reply ought to have been referred ""to Captain Abbot, who could not have made one statement on the ship complimenting the men upon their behaviour while aboard, and then have reported to the Defence Department that they had proved troublesome on the voyage. a matter of fact, all those on board the ship tell me that they were surprised at the general bearing of the disciplinary cases.",12
69,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,Is it true that the men complimented Captain Abbot?,13
70,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"Yes , the men comloaf plimented the captain, and he compliany mented them. As a matter of fact, I madethink that they must have been a very happy family on board. No trouble was cases, they were on arrival fit for duty and experienced in getting disciplinary cases return to camp. to carry on the ordinary fatigue duties of the ship, and I object strongly to this style of comment on the part of either naval or military people when any question of discipline is 'put before them. Asto the foodIt appears that there was great uncertainty as to the time that the troops would arrive, and on this account it was considered inadvisable to prepare cooked rations. The men, arrived there at 1.30 p.m., and for their luncb were served with tinned beef. For their subsequent meals they were provided with ordinary rations, including fresh meat. I want to ask if there can be any excuse in this matter. The Department knew that these men were to be landed the day before. They must have been communicated with, and they must have known the men were on the way, and yet they made no preparation to give them an ordinary civilized meal when they came ashore.",13
71,Mr SPEAKER,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,The honourable member's time has now expired.,13
72,Mr WEST,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,Can I move that the honourable member be granted a further,13
73,Mr SPEAKER,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"I would like to point out to the House that only a limited time is available for this discussion. A certain time was occupied in questions, and the debate must close at 5 o'clock. If the honourable member continues for another quarter of an hour there will only be three-quarters of an. hour for other honourable members who may wish to speak. Is it the pleasure, of the House that the honourable gentleman be further heard ? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",13
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,Do I understand the complaint is that these men had tinned meat for one meal instead of fresh meat?,13
75,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"Yes , "" b u l l y "" beef is scarcely fit food for invalids. As Mr JENSEN - I have had it many a time, and I think I look well on it .",13
76,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"The Department thought fit to invalid these men home, and that being so, I doubt whether any one can justify the "" bully "" beef, but I would point out that what was supplied was one t in of "" bully "" beef and one 4-lb. for eighteen men who had not had breakfast. The statement is further Although the men were returned as medical' 1 Here then is the basis of another charge which may be made against the Department, or those responsible in this matter. I suppose it may be estimated that from the time these men were enlisted, trained here, sent over to Egypt, trained there, and brought back, they must have cost the Commonwealth between Â£500 and Â£600 each. Yet there is evidence that amongst those who were returned there were many whose services could have been utilized in Egypt. For instance, there are many men in Egypt physically fit, who are acting as cooks and performing various depot duties. They could have been taken into the ranks, and many of the men who have been returned could have taken their places in the performance of various depot duties. might have been given work to do in Egypt, which they could have done while they were recuperating, and they would have become physically fit there, and able to go to the front . That must be clear from the admission that when they arrived here they were physically fit for duty. I have still another complaint to make concerning. some men who were returned here as suffering from venereal complaints. One of these men has been discharged, and it has been admitted that he had not the complaint. There are three others who swear that they never had it , and are prepared to submit themselves to examination by a doctor who is not in the service. If it was possible for the medical officers respon'sible to make a mistake in the case of one man who was said to be suffering from a venereal complaint, it is possible that a similar mistake has been made in other cases. Surely medical science has sufficiently advanced in these days to enable doctors to be able to say whether a man is really suffering from a venereal complaint or not! I have seen the certificate pf one of these men by a doctor here to the effect that he is not suffering from the complaint. I was afraid to take charge of the certificate for fear that I might lose it, and it might subsequently be required as evidence, but I have seen it . There are three other men who claim to be equally free from the disease. The first of these men was a man called Hughes. When returned here he was sent to the - camp at Langwarrin. I am not prepared to be too hard on the men said to be suffering from venereal disease, because the disease is often escaped more by good luck than by good management. Still it is a fact that men who are not suffering' from the disease object to be placed in an establishment where it is understood that only men suffering from the disease are confined. Very often men will deny that they are suffering from this disease, but they will scarcely do so unless they feel that they are able to prove their statements.",13
77,Mr HAMPSON,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,How many of these men were returned ?,14
78,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"I am referring to four, one of whom has since been discharged, because it has been shown that he has not the disease, whilst the three others make the claim that they have not had it . It should be remembered They that it is impossible to induce military or naval officers to admit that they have done anything wrong. Once they make a statement they will stick to it by hook or by crook. The matters to which I have directed attention demand an in vestigation, and one not conducted by military officers. No military investigation into the cases of these men who have been returned will satisfy me. I should still say that the report would be coloured, because it is impossible to induce military or naval officers to admit that they have made a mistake.",14
79,Mr JENSEN,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,-That is a very serious allegation against the officers.,14
80,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"I am aware that it is, but it is based upon experience. Mr JENSEN:-The honourable member implies that there are no honourable men amongst the officers.",14
81,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"I make the statement with a full sense of its seriousness. It has passed as a saying in the A r m y and Navy for generations that in both the Army and Navy the man is never right, the non-commissioned officer is seldom right, and the officer is never wrong. In the case of the men to whom I have referred today, we have the fact that the day before they were landed, the officer commanding them complimented them upon their behaviour during the voyage. I say that these cases should be investigated, not by military officers, but by some one who will be actuated only by a desire to see justice done. The charges made are specific find definite, and it is evident that many of the men should never have been brought back, because they could have been given duties to perform in Egypt u n t i l they became physically fit, whilst others who are not physically fit have been cast upon the world to earn a living as they best can after volunteering to fight in the interests of the country.",14
82,Sir ROBERT BEST,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"Kooyong) [4.5] - The Defence Department and the Assistant Minister are entitled to the sympathy and encouragement of the House, in view of - the gigantic task they were called upon to perform in the appalling emergency which has arisen. I feel sure lhat every effort in that direction will willingly be made by the House generally. We have a common national duty in thut regard, and a common anxiety to help. I feel, therefore, that, so far as personal grievances are concerned, we should be very chary about encouraging their ventilation in this House. Such a practice might result in interference with discipline, which is so essential to the ciency of our Forces. I feel that the Minister is sufficiently cognisant of the responsibility imposed upon him in regard to personal grievances, where they are circumstantially supported, as these cases have been by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, to give them promptly the most searching and exhaustive investigation. The Minister should be given the opportunity to make such an investigation of these grievances upon statements privately laid before him by honourable members. We cannot too strongly urge the undesirability of making Parliament the arena for the discussion of these grievances. After all, these charges are of an ex parte character. There may be substance in them, or there may not. If there is substance in them, the fact will be ascertained by the Ministerial investigation to which I have referred. But when such complaints are brought up in public in this way, they involve serious charges against responsible officers, who may thus be subjected to a great injustice. The task which was undertaken by the Department on the outbreak of war was not only of magnitude, but it had to be attended to with the utmost expedition. The Department was unprepared for the emergency, but, nevertheless, they made a fine effort to cope with it . Fault-finding was easily resorted to, and necessarily there was room at first for much faultfinding; and complaint. But, speaking broadly and generally, I do think that the Department' has proved itself equal to the emergency, and is entitled to the utmost credit for what has been done. It was an extraordinary emergency, and, as regards the equipment of the Forces that have already been sent away, I think the response of the manufacturers and others concerned, and the devotion generally of the responsible officers to their duty, are deserving of the highest praise. The fact remains, however, that after the departmental officers have had at least six or seven months' experience in administration, we have a' right to expect greater efficiency and less room for complaint. That much room for complaint exists at the present time cannot be denied. Every man about town hears of many cases which appear to be cases of unnecessary hardship. If there be a tithe of justification for the complaints which are constantly heard regarding the administration at Broadmeadows camp, effi- particularly as to the arrangements for treatment of the sick, the position there does not reflect very much credit upon those who are responsible for its management. I hope that these complaints are not warranted, but the Assistant Minister of Defence cannot ignore tlieir gravity. I have never brought before this House complaints of any description, although I have been the recipient of them daily. But some of tliese complaints are of such a character that my honourable friend sbould direct a very close attention to the management of our Forces at Broadmeadows. I do not say for a moment that the complaints are well known to the responsible officers in charge of that camp. But it is urged that neglect lies at the door of the management of the Broadmeadows camp by reason of the existing hospital arrangements and of the inadequate attention which is devoted to the sick. These general statements are of such a character as to warrant investigation, particularly in regard to the manner in which sick patients are being treated. I am told that there is an abnormal amount of illness at the camp-why , I am at a loss to know - That circumstance, in itself, is a reflection upon its administration, and the allegations which should either be refuted or their causes amended. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has referred to the troops in Egypt, and I must say that some grave statements are being made regarding the management of affairs there. It is only fair to aay that my own son and son-in-law were there-if they are not there now-and I have never, directly or indirectly, received a word of complaint from them.",15
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"I have a son there, and I have never heard a whisper of complaint.",16
84,Sir ROBERT BEST,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"Ye t we cannot ignore the allegations which are constantly being made in such a circumstantial form.  ber's son-in-law among the rank and file, or amongst the officers?",16
85,Sir ROBERT BEST,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"My son is a full private, and my son-in-law is an officer, so that I should be in a position to hear something on both sides of this question. Only on Monday last a responsible newspaper like the Argus, in an article by its special reporter, made some very serious allegations respecting our Expeditionary Porces in Egypt-allegation s which can be readily confirmed or refuted. I do not propose to enter into details of tliese charges. One statement was that 2,500 Australians were simultaneously on sick leave. Another was that 1,200 Australians were lying ill at Heliopolis. Seeing that these statements are direct charges, circumstantially stated and not cloaked in any way, and that their accuracy* can be either confirmed or refuted without much trouble, I say that it is not likely they Vtould be made if they could not be substantiated. We have been told, too, that the cases of pneumonia amongst the men represent 70 per cent, of the cases of sickness.",16
86,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,And they are amongst the mon-no t amongst the officers. The termer get inferior food.,16
87,Sir ROBERT BEST,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"The newspaper to which I have already referred has contrasted the conditions which obtain amongst the men with those which obtain amongst the officers. These statements are of such a serious character, and reflect so gravely upon the administration of our Forces in Egypt, that they cannot be overlooked. Other direct allegations have been made, not only as to the insufficiency of the food, but as to its in ferior quality. I regret that I have to repeat them on the floor of this chamber. 0 I do hope that a most exhaustive investigation will.be made with a view to determining the truth or otherwise of these statements. Personally, I know nothing of them, but I cannot ignore reports which are so circumstantially stated when the material for their confirmation or refutation is so readily obtainable. I am sure that the Assistant Minister of Defence will, credit me with having refrained from uttering an ungenerous word, either against him or the Defence Department. But this is a question in which the whole commuuity is interested. W it l i other public men I have recently been engaged, night after night, in endeavouring to encourage the youth of this country to realise their responsibilities by joining the colours in the defence of the Empire. But if charges of this character are brought under the notice of the youth of the community, I recognise that enlisting will be discouraged, and that the success of our recruiting efforts will be seriously menaced. If Australia does not provide her fair proportion of troops to take part in the titanic struggle which is now being waged in Europe, it will be a serious reflection upon her national escutcheon. Speaking, therefore, in the broadest possible spirit, I commend my remarks to the attention of the Assistant Minister, and hope that, to the credit of the military administration, they will receive immediate attention, so that there may be no room for complaint in the future.",16
88,Mr JENSEN,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"Bass-Assistant M in ister of Defence) [4.20] - I am sorry that the honourable member has brought up this subject in the House, because I do not know that it will have a tendency to improve matters.",16

94,Mr JENSEN,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"I cau assure the honourable member that the Defence Department has done everything possible in order to comply with the request of the women of Australia who are in such a position because their husbands have gone to the front. In many cases, the difficulties have been due to the fact that the men signed on as single men, and thus left their wives and children unprotected. Those cases, however, are being inquired into.",17
95,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,Will you inquire into these cases?,17
96,Mr JENSEN,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"Does the honourable member suggest that the Department has no feeling for these men ? There is no foundation whatever for such a statement as that.  little feeling. We want a Cromwell amongst the departmental officials to clear them out, root and branch.",17
97,Mr JENSEN,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"In his statement, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports said that several venereal cases were among those who were invalided from Egypt.",17
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,I thin k he said four cases.,17

The hon the orable member will see, therefore, that will be considered at once. we are making provision for them.",17
102,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"Let us hope so; but they have had no information of that kind, at any rate.",17

108,Mr JENSEN,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"T he honourable member says that men returned as unfit have been discharged, and thrown on the world as if the Department did not care for them, but I have shown we have made provision for such cases.",17

112,Mr JENSEN,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"If there are such cases they will be full y inquired into, and I will see that justice is done to the men. as The medically unfit cases are sent to the Police Hospital on the St. Kilda-road, and their pay will continue u n t i l they are discharged.

The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has complained of the lack of information obtainable from the Defence Department about these men, and I want to say straight away that it is almost impossible to get communications through to the Defence Department by the same boat on which the soldiers return from Egypt to Australia. It takes a few days before the correspondence comes along, and yet the honourable member condemns the Defence Department because the information about the men is not at hand. The honourable member has been informed by the Department that as soon as the correspondence comes along, these soldiers will be notified, and if there is anything owing to them they will be duly paid.",17

We cannot decide any case which is invalided back here uutil we have the correspondence dealing with it . I have heard of warehousemen who have had goods landed in Australia for two or three weeks, though they had not received the invoices to enable them to .get the goods out of bond. Is the honourable member condemning that system ?",18
123,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,Yes ; it is bad ness.,18
124,Mr JENSEN,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"It is the same thing with the Department.

But as against that, it should be remembered that we are sending very many medical men to the front. They have all passed examination and received diplomas; and .are honourable members to get up here and admit that the men we have sent to the front as medical men are not qualified to diagnose a case? If I adopted the view of my honourable friend, I should have to admit that we have sent away medical men who are unfit for the positions they hold. A m I going to admit that?",18
127,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"When other medical men differ from their diagnosis, what then ?",18

130,Mr JENSEN,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,The honourable member quoted a letter he had received from the Defence Department. The very fact that the Secretary to the Department haa supplied the honourable member with certain information goes to show that we are not attempting to hide anything.,18

142,Mr MATHEWS,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,As they are the most physically fit men in Australia the percentage of deaths ought to be less.,19

150,Mr JENSEN,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,I do not desire an extension of my time.,19
151,Mr ANSTEY,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"Bourke) [4.36] - The Minister who has just resumed his seat has given an endorsement to the services of the medical officers with the .Expeditionary Forces. He is quite right. I am not inclined to blame Ministers. I suppose that they are doing all they possibly can. At same time, there is no need to defend the medical men if they are not doing the correct thing. To show the sort of medical men at the front, let me cite a case. A doctor started to experiment with a man. He commenced on one side, and cut the man up for gall-stones, and when he found that the man had not that complaint, he wanted to start on the other side. The man said, "" You are not going to have a post-mortem on me until I am of dead."" That is the type of medical man we have sent to the front. What answer has been given to the statement made in the Argus the other day in connection with numerous cases of pneumonia in Egypt? It is not necessary to weigh pros and cons in the matter. When our men were taken over by the Imperial officer, General Birdwood, he said that they Vere completely overworked, being sent out at 5 in the morning, coming back at night, lushing for their food, many being unable to get it, and then lying down physically exhausted. Some of the men died in a couple of hours after they came back to the camp. The Imperial officer said the Australian soldiers were completely overworked. Nothing has been said either about the charges made in connection with the men who returned from Egypt. On their arrival at Eremantle a wireless message was sent to Melbourne, but the authorities did not know who the men were or where they had come from. When the men went to get their discharges, they were told that the necessary information had not come through. The of authorities can find money to pay the men off; they know how much money is coming to them; they know how much the men drew in Egypt and on the return trip, but they do not know anything about their characters. That is sheer bunkum and indolence on the part of officials. The duty of the Minister is not to applaud the conduct of such men, but to condemn it at all hazards. The duty of the Minister, I take it, is not to support wrong-doing, but, when he finds it out, to hit the wrong-doer pretty hard. Is it not a fact that on the arrival of these men their blankets were taken from them, and they were left to sleep in their clothes all night ? Here are a few accusations which want to be answered. These men were returned, but were left to sleep without their blankets, which were taken from them. They were left to sleep in their the clothes. That is either true or false.",19
152,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,Where did happen?,20
153,Mr ANSTEY,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"In Australia. It has never been denied. It is an admitted fact that men were l e ft to sleep all night in their own clothes. Who was responsible for that situation? The man who - did that thing ought no longer to be l e ft in the position he occupies. Is not that sound logic ? Is it not justice ? Is it not common sense? If I were the Minister of Defence, I would take that man and say to him, "" Are you the individual who was responsible for that thing? The custody of no man's life shall be l e ft in your hands in the future. Out of your position you shall go."" Again, men were taken down to the barracks in Coventrystreet, and although there was nothing against them, they were not permitted'to go out, while undesirables were allowed to go up and down Bourke-street, parading their uniforms. I refer to men of good character, with not a word or a mark against their names, who were detained at the barracks all night, deprived of their blankets, and compelled to sleep iii their clothes. The men were kept there without proper provision being madej and there would have been no escape had. not some of them violated the regulations, scaled the fence, and in formed the honourable member for Melbourne Ports of their treatment. That is' how the matter became public, and the men got their liberty. The next step was to take the men out of the barracks in shoddy clothes. Meu who had been returned on the ground of sickness were not permitted to wear their uniforms. How natural for a man to say, "" I wouia like to go home in my u n i for m . "" At least, these men should have been allowed to put on their own clothes. But the authorities said, "" No. Here are some clothes that we want you to put on. Off your uniform must go."" refused to submit to this ignominy were stripned, even the very underclothing that their wives had brought them being taken from them. If that is not an outrage, I should like to know what is. Who are the men responsible for these happenings? Those who are responsible should be retained in their positions no longer. It is the duty of the Crown to ask them, "" Did you authorize these things to be done?"" I wish now to refer to complaints coming, not directly from men at the front, but embodied in rethis ports by the correspondents of the Tory journals of this city, who tell us that the Australian army is being decimated, not by the bullets of the enemy, but by disease, and notably by pneumonia. We are told that the officers do not suffer from this disease, and while shiploads of the rank and file are being returned, no' officers have been sent back. Are officers immune to sickness? Is there something in 'their constitution which makes them unassailable by disease? In describing the pleasures of the troops, the correspondents tell us that one place is reserved for officers and another for privates. When the officers have anything the matter with them, they are kept au the front, drawing tlieir allowances,. and hobbling about on crutches. They can suffer from venereal disease, or have anything at all the matter with them, and the whole force of officialdom is used to maintain them in their positions, and to cover up the true state of affairs. We are told that all the immorality, all the disease, is to be found among the rankers. No officer is immoral, or yields to the temptations of the flesh. No officer hankers after women, or touches what is not his. Why are the men coming back by the hundred, stricken down with pneumonia? Because they are overworked to the point of exhaustion, and are underfed. It is the duty of the Government to call upon the officers to disprove the allegations that have been made, and, if they cannot do so, to make them resign their positions. So far, there has been no answer to the questions asked by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. When the War Precautions Bill is brought forward, I shall have something to say on another interesting phase of tins subject. Question resolved in the negative. Those who "" COMMONWEALTH SAVIN GS BANK. LONDON BRANCH.",20
154,Sir JOHN FORREST,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. Was that portion of ""the statement"" presented to the Honse on 14th inst. referring to the Commonwealth Bank prepared specially for the purpose by Mr Miller, the Governor? 2. What authority is there for the statement that "" the Savings Bank in London was established primarily for the benefit of Australians and to assist immigrants leaving England for Australia, and has been exclusively made use of in this respect. Other persons are not encouraged to deposit with the Savings Bank Department in London, and several suggestions that the Bank should receive deposits from the public throughout Great Britain have been declined "" ? 3. Was this policy mentioned by Sir George Beid in his speech at the opening of the Bank; and was this policy mentioned in the letter to the British Post Office Savings Bank when it was consulted at the time of the establishment of the Savings Bank in London? 4. Will he place on the table of the House a copy of the letter to the British Post Office Savings Bank and the reply in which "" it took no exception whatever to the establishment of this portion of the activities of the Commonwealth Bank in London"" ? 5. Could not the Commonwealth Bank in London have equally well attended to the wonts of "" Australians or intending Australians, and generally assist emigrants leaving England for Australia,"" without having a Savings Bank in London ? 6. Was not the original intention to secure deposits in London to assist the Commonwealth Bank; and whether with that object a higher rate of interest was offered than that offered by the British Post Office Savings Bank?",20
155,Mr FISHER,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. The facts were supplied to me by Mr . Miller. The statement is mine. 2. The authority of the facts. 3. I do not know. 4. Yes. 5. No. 6. No. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES - that MEANING OF "" DISCIPLINARY.""",21
156,Mr MASSYGREENE,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"the Assistant Minister, representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Whether the following paragraph which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday, 19th inst., correctly expressed the Minister's meaning :WHAT "" DISCIPLINAR Y "" MEANS. MELBOURNE, Saturday - The Minister for Defence explained today that the fact that a returned soldier's name appeared in a list of "" disciplinary "" cases did not reflect upon his moral character. If an officer reported a man physically unfit for service, that was a "" disciplinary"" case. Private P. Logan, of 2nd Reinforcements, 7th Battalion (Victoria), had been returned according to list as "" not likely to become efficient."" That did not imply that he was of bad character. It has been stated that Private Logan was kicked on the head by a horse, causing concussion of the brain. The effect was to render him unfit for active service? 2. If so, will he take steps to clearly distinguish between men who are invalided home and those who are sent back purely for disciplinary reasons?",21
157,Mr JENSEN,EXPO RT OF BUTTERFROMNEW,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. It is not considered that in the strict sense of the term the case of soldier discharged as physically unfit for service is a "" disciplinary "" case. If an officer reported a man as unfitted for the duties of his corps, or not likely to become an efficient soldier, such action is akin to disciplinary action if the soldierwas indolent or lazy, & c , but it is not considered that unless conditions, such as those were involved, the case would be a ""disciplinary"" one_ to the extent that it should be classified with others in which men were sent home for definite misconduct. 2. In the cases referred to-that of Private Logan-it was distinctly shown on the list of men returned that this man was returned as ""not likely to become efficient,"" but was included under the heading "" disciplinary "" cases. In future, care will be taken that such cases are shown altogether separate from disciplinary cases. NA RAILWAY. Sir JOHN FORREST asked the P r i m e Minister , upon noticeAs the Prime Minister has informed the House that he has not been asked by the Government of Western Australia to negotiate a loan so as to provide funds for the construction of the railway from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie on the 4-feet 8|-inch gauge, and that no correspondence had taken place on the subject, will he inform the House what was the foundation for the statement made by him on 14th inst., that "" there are reasons to believe the same gauge from Kalgoorlie to Perth will be in existence before the railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie is completed?",21

159,Mr MASSYGREENE,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"for Mr GREGORY) asked the Assistant Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice I. Whether the Engineer-in-Charge at Cockburn Sound (Mr W. B . Swan) did not report on 28th April, 1914, that Mr Henshaw, foreman of works, wns not a suitable man for the position he held, and that he considered it dangerous to allow important work to be given 1 him to carry out? 2. Whether, in June, 1914, the officer in charge at Cockburn Sound reported that he had no work to give to Mr Henshaw, and stated that his services were no longer required ? 3. Whether, notwithstanding this, Mr Henshaw's services were retained on full pay for many months without his doing any work whatever, notably, from 8th June to 3rd September, 1914? 4. Whether Mr Henshaw still continues as foreman of works at Cockburn Sound, albeit the Engineer-in-Charge considered it dangerous to allow the work to be given him to carry out?",21
160,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low : 1. The report, which was confidential, was dealing with a difference that arose between the Naval Civil Engineer, Mr Walkeden, ond Foreman Henshaw, .and had reference to a particular work- a trial shaft-and not to general operations. The report read, "" I do not feel thut Mr Henshaw is the most capable man for the important position of genera] foreman."" 2. The officer in charge wrote to the Director of Naval Works, - inter alia, on 9th June, 1914, regarding Henshaw :""Unless you can authorize some work on which he might be employed, I do not think liis services are further required."" The Director of Naval Works replied, calling attention to previous instructions as to emploj'ment of the general foreman, which set out work of a general character upon which he could be employed. 3. No. Mr Henshaw was retained on the recommendation of the Naval Board and with the approval of the theii Minister, and it was reported weekly by the officer in charge that he was engaged upon general duties and supervision. Between the dates indicated, Mr . Henshaw was granted eighteen days' recreation leave, commencing 13th August. 4. Yes. The Director of Naval Works considers Henshaw a competent foreman and there are no adverse reports from the present Engineer-in-Charge. NON - PRODUCTI ON OF DOCUMENTS",22

Debate resumed from 23rd A p r i l (vide page 2636), of motion by Mr JENSENThat this Bill be now read a second time.",23
170,Mr RILEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"South Sydney) [4.34] During the week-end I have had an opto portunity to read the Bill , and have had conversations with Ministers, which enable me to know what is in the mind of the Government so far as this measure is concerned. The Ministry must very careful how it hands over the civil rights of the people to military trol and the judgments of courts martial. This Bill is giving over to the military authorities of the country the rights the people. Those who have read the early history of Australia know that when the military power ruled this country there was nothing but stagnation and tyranny, and it was only when civil Courts were established, and people were no longer at the mercy of the courts martial that there was any progress. I cannot for the life of me understand why a person charged under this measure cannot be tried in a civil Court. We are a civilized community, with the whole machinery of the law ready to be put into operation at any moment, yet this Bill proposes to take certain civil offenders away from the civil Courts and hand them over to a military Court which is given power to impose the sentence of death. To my mind, that is giving altogether too much power to the military authorities. I can understand them having that power on the field of battle, where they have to deal with large bodies of men, but not in Australia, where we are surrounded by all the machinery of the civil law. I desire to know what is in the minds of the Government that they should desire to take away the civil rights of any individual for and hand them over to a military Court. I object to this Bill because of that proMr posal, but I have also another ground of objection. The measure gives to the Governor General power to issue regulations, which means that the Bill itself may be carried out by regulation. The for Executive may make any regulation they choose, and if this House is not in session, the government of the country Mr under this law may be carried out under the military authorities by regulation. That is a very great power to confer. A l we are too .much governed by regulation. When we, as members of Parliament, open our correspondence, we receive piles of regulations from this Department and that Department, and it is impossible for any one of us to know the whole of the regulations, and the extent which the country is being governed also by that means. To now propose to give to the Governor General further powers of issuing regulations in connection with the administration of this Bill is simply be to further increase the objectionable policy of government by regulation. I conhave the utmost confidence in the present Ministry; I believe they will work thoroughly and well, and do their best of for the country, but we, as members of Parliament, are the elect of the people, and are responsible for seeing that their liberties are not filched away and handed over to the military power. I desire the Minister to tell the House whether this Bill is to be made retrospective. If it is, that very fact is an indication that the courts martial have failed, and that further power is sought to do thoroughly that work which was not properly done in the first place. I am opposed to any retrospective legislation. I believe there are some good clauses in the Bill , and I understand that it is designed to tighten up our laws in order to protect the Commonwealth from the common enemy, but there is a great danger of giving too great a power to the military Courts. A man may visit a camp, and having seen something of which he did not approve write to the press, or make a speech on the subject. In that way he might do something which would have the effect of belittling the military administration, and he could be seized under this Bill and sentenced by court martial.",23
171,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"That could be done only by the Executive,",24
172,Mr RILEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I have already said that I have the utmost confidence in the Government, but no man can do thoroughly the work which falls upon a Minister of Defence if he has all the details to attend to. I notice that it is propossd that the Naval Board and the Military Board shall act in conjunction with the Minister of Defence, but in nineteen cases out of twenty the Minister will take the word of the men who advise him.",24
173,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"It is not a question for the Minister of Defence, but for the Executive.",24
174,Mr RILEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"It is extremely likely that Cabinet, not knowing anything of the circumstances, will approve of any recommendation by the Minister of Defence. That is the danger, and we have no right to put that responsibility upon the M i nistry or the Executive. The civil Courts should be clothed with power to deal with all actions against civilians that may arise out of the passing of this Bill . Another reason why I am loth to agree to this Bill is that we are handing away the right of trial by jury, which is the keystone of the liberties contained in Magna Charta. Further tjian that, I see no necessity for these extreme powers. We have control of the Pacific and the whole of the wireless stations, and the postal, telephone, and telegraphic services are under the administration of the Commonwealth Government, so that Australia is perfectly safe.",24
175,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Suppos e a man cut the cable and prevented us from obtaining news in regard to a threatened invasion; do you not think that he would deserve to die without further delay ?,24
176,Mr RILEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I bave no wish to prejudge any man. I believe the civil Courts of the country are sufficiently powerful to impose sentence of death on any such offender, and that we do not require to erect a new Court to deal with a case of that kind. Does the Attorney General wish us to believe that the civil Courts are not qualified to deal with a case such as he has supposed ?",24
177,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I certainly think that they are not qualified. The time that should elapse between the commission of that offence and the death of the offender should be not more than a quarter of an hour. Mr Riley . ; - Not knowing what is in the Attorney-General's mind, I am not prepared to hand over to the military authorities the right of civilians to be tried by a civil Court.",24
178,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,The military authorities cannot prevent him from having a civil trial.,24
179,Mr RILEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,The civilian can ask for a civil trial.,24
180,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,And he can get it .,24
181,Mr RILEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"A not h e r feature of these prosecutions is that the onus of proof is thrown on the accused person. I know a man who was employed by the telephone branch in the undergrounding of wires, and who was arrested on suspicion of being a German. No evidence against him was discovered, yet that man suffered the indignity of detention, and lost his job.",24
182,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Was that a court martial?,24
183,Mr RILEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"No . I do not know what would have happened had he been dealt with by court martial. I will be pleased to hear the Minister's explanation of these provisions. There are many tilings in the Bill of which I approve, but I object to handing over to the military power the right to try civilians by court martial and pass sentence of death upon them; and I also object to the Governor General having power to frame regulations of which honourable members may not be aware if Parliament should not be in session.",24
184,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Angas) [5.7] - Whils t honourable members on this side who spoke on the original measure last year said they were prepared to-give every reasonable power to the Executive, I think we would be guilty of a dereliction of duty if we did not try to examine the scope and meaning of the various measures as they are submitted to us. When the original measure was introduced, I asked the Attorney-General particularly to give us some assurance that the administration would be very careful and vigilant, so that our dearest rights as British subjects would not through any inadvertence be put in jeopardy. I am not sure that there has been such a strict attention to the administration of the Act as to make us feel that we have that security in the administration of the law which would induce us to trust the authorities with greater power. It ' seems to me as if the draftsman, when he prepared this Bill , was unaware of what legislation had been passed in England, and the objections which have been taken to it , both by men competent to speak as lawyers, and by, I think I may say, the dispassionate press in the United Kingdom. If necessary, I could quote a good many expressions of opinion from the leading weekly journals in England on the extraordinary scope of the measure, and the administration in some cases, not very many, by the military officers. It is very difficult to explain a measure of this character, because almost each clause involves a very careful interpretation. There are a great many possible developments under the generalization, and each particular phrase covers more than one could, on the spur of the moment, suggest; but as the clauses come forward for administration it may be discovered that the scope is much wider than was in tended by the Attorney-General, who is responsible for the drafting, or by Parliament, which sanctioned the measure. When looking through the Bill and the existing legislation yesterday,- I endeavoured to reduce to some heads what is possible under this law, but I had to abandon the task almost in despair. Of course, under the original measure any citizen may be tried by court martial for any offence. I will deal with the regulations later, because they are the main matters to be considered. I may say that it was only after the in troduction of the original of this B i ll in another place that the M i nister of Defence discovered that he was introducing a measure that had been passed through the Imperial Parliament in November last, and at the time strongly condemned.",25
185,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Are you alluding to this Bill 1,25
186,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"To this Bill . I think I am right in saying that the second war Bill introduced was for consolidating the Defence of the Realm Bill , a copy of which I have not been able to obtain, but the main provisions, at least, of which I have read in the English press. I think that the measure, when introduced into this Parliament, was practically a copy of the consolidating Defence of the Realm Act , which was criticised in the House of Lords on the 27th or 28th November last year.",25
187,Mr RILEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"It was greatly altered in the House of Lords, I think.",25
188,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"No ; but I shall tell honourable members in a moment what was done. It was amended on the 27th February by a Bill to which I shall refer. That amending ""measure does not seem to have come under the notice of the Attorney-General, because, if it ' h a d , I am perfectly sure that that honourable gentleman, who is pretty quick at seeing what ought to be done, would not have allowed the Bil l introduced in this Parliament to be placed before members in an unamended state. Under the War Precautions Act that we did pass, any citizen may be tried by court martial, and that provision is very vague. I use the word "" v a g u e "" owing to the phrasing of the sub-clause itself, and also in the light of the criticism directed against the measure at Home. For such an offence as spreading reports likely to cause disaffection or alarm",25
189,Mr RILEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,That is very wide.,25
190,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"It is so wide that the Cabinet at Home had to disavow the statement as to the scope of its application made by the Solicitor-General in the course of the debate. Reading the Act into the regulations, a person may be arrested by a police or Customs officer, or any other authorized official, without warrant, and he may be tried either by court martial or by a civil tribunal at the option of the Government. As a matter of law, I believe that such a person- I am speaking now in the light of a judgment by Mr Justice Lush-ma y be detained indefinitely, as in one instance I know a man has been, without - any specific charge, or charge of which legal cognisance can be taken, being laid against him, or without any declaration by the Executive as to whether he has to be tried by court martial or a civil tribunal. Under regulation 9, for in stance, an officer of the police, or Customs officer, or any person authorized for the purpose by a competent naval or military authority, may arrest without warrant any person whose behaviour is of such a nature as to show reasonable ground for suspecting that he has acted, is acting, or is about to act, i u a manner prejudicial to the public safety or the defence of the Commonwealth. A person so arrested is to be handed over, and kept in military custody, u n t i l he can be dealt with in ordinary course of law; and, while so detained, he shall be deemed to be in legal custody. I do not say that liabeas corpus may not lie even under these circumstances. Happily, it is the glory of the English law that a person can always appeal to the Court, unless that right is expressly taken away by Act of Parliament, to have a declaration as to why he is under arrest. But if it is found that we have given power by Act to effect an arrest and detain a person indefinitely, the Court can go no further by way of habeas corpus. There have been bases, however, in other times, as well as one or two since the Defence of the Realm Act came into force, in which, if I may trust to the judgment of Mr Justice Lush, reported in one of the English newspapers, habeas corpus did not lie, because the Executive seem to have the power to keep a man without absolutely declaring under what particular jurisdiction, civil or military, he is to be tried. However, I would not take that decision as final, because there have been cases before this legislation in which the Executive has been forced to a decision as to whether they intended a person to be tried by court martial or by a civilian tribunal.",25
191,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The honourable member is directing his remarks to that part of the measure which deals with the t r i a l of civilians by court martial? Mr Glynn"" - That applies to every one; but I am now dealing with the Act we passed, and not with the amending measure. Since this Bill came before the Senate, the Attorney-General has, very properly, supplied his colleague there with an amendment, which, in effect, is a similar provision to that placed in the Imperial Act last February. There are other regulations to which I might refer, but I do not desire to be too particular. Let me now refer to the I m perial Act. In this connection we have been shown the necessity for vigilance; and I think our Administration ought to have been a little more careful, in the light of the criticism directed against the particular clause which was inserted last November in the Imperial Act, and which we here knew of six weeks or two months ago. Lord Halsbury, dealing with the text of the Act, apart from the regulations, said I do not think the liberty of the subject is such a trifling matter that it should be supplanted in a moment because some of us are in a panic. . . . Undoubtedly it is the most unconstitutional thing that has happened in this country. Lord Parmoor, the real author, by suggestion, of the amendment to restore the right, under Magna Charta, of being tried by a civil tribunal, moved a clause which I need not read, because it has been adopted both here and at Home; and he elicited a promise from Lord Haldane that the Executive would not allow any sentence of death on a civilian by court martial to be carried out u n t i l Parliament met again and members had an opportunity to consider the import of a measure which, with too great a reliance on the knowledge of Ministers, was passed practically without debate in the Commons, and was subject to very keen criticism in the House of Lords.",26
192,Mr WATT,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Was that promise embodied in the Bill ? Mr Glynn"" - No ; but, at all events, the Bill was amended when the House met again.",26
193,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,That amendment is in our measure now.,26
194,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I know; I am merely giving a synopsis, showing that, while we are willing to help the Government in the discharge of responsible duties in times of great strain, we should be ignoring our duty if we withheld criticism of the measures that are introduced. Lord Parmoor asked Lord HaldaneWhy the method of ascertaining whether or not a particular British subject is guilty should be altered to what is really his disadvantage in times like this? He - went on to sayCourts martial have neither the procedure nor the experience that our ordinary Courts have. Lord Haldane would not agree to the amendment, but be made the significant remark that the Bill was directed, not so much against aliens, as against British subjects; and that is the point we are concerned about. Lord Haldane said that, in his opinion, aliens came within the purview of the common law already, as he believed they did to a large extent come under the defence legislation. He saidThe Act is not directed against aliens, as they, at any rate, are not protected against military jurisdiction by the laws of Great Britain. This was a Bill , then, to suspend the Petition of Rights, or Magna Charta, at a time of alleged crisis, in regard to British subjects; and I say, with due respect, that it is the duty of Ministers to show the necessity for such a modification of civil rights. Beyondthat the Government have copies of the measures passed in the Old Country, I have not yet heard a word urged in favour of the measure, in view of peculiar circumstances in Australia. Under court martial the t r i a l need not be open; and one has only to look at the Defence Act to see that the incorporation of the court martial provisions of that Act give extraordinary powers to a court martial. It is true, as the Attorney-General mentioned when the honourable member for South Sydney was speaking, that the matter of the t r i a l rests with the Executive, or something to that effect. But it rests with the Executive only in the sense that the court martial has to be convened by the Governor General, who acts under advice; but, if an offence is committed, a man must be t r i e d ; and, if he is to be tried by court martial, it is the duty of the Executive to summon that tribunal.",26
195,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,It is not the duty; is in thÂ© absolute discretion of the Executive.,27
196,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I beg the honourable gentleman's pardon; I think that if an offence appears to be established in the opinion of the Attorney-General, on the facts put before him, it is his duty to either discharge the man at once or have him tried. It is the Attorney-General's duty to have the person tried if there is a fair case established by the facts.",27
197,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Is the honourable gentleman speakiug of the operation of sub,27
198,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Not at all. My object at present is to show that we must watch carefully what we are doing, because the Government did not know, when this Bill was introduced in the Senate",27
199,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Unde r sub-clause 6 all civilians are entitled to a civil trial.,27
200,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"All that I know. My purpose is to explain, in view of the Ministerial easy-going observation of I m perial legislation, the purport of the Act before it is amended; and then I shall come to the consideration of the Bill . I am not going to give the specific provisions; but Part VIII . of the Defence Act will apply to all courts martial; we have also to read into the Bill the very drastic provisions of the A r m y Act. There is, by the way, an amendment of the Defence Act proposed which will apply the A r m y Act wherever the troops are; and when that amendment comes before us we shall see what it means. Let me see what the position was on the 24th February. Speaking on the measure to which I have referred, Sir John Simon, Attorney-General, halfheartedly acknowledged that a serious blunder had been made in passing the original measure in November. He said, referring to the jurisdiction of courts martial over civiliansThere was no good disguising the fact that this was an extremely novel proposal, and created a unique situation. That was an acknowledgment by the At torney-General that a blunder had been made. Honourable members are as familiar as I am through The Times-for I think the matter was also mentioned in this morning's issue of the Argus-wit h what was said by the Whip of the British Labour party regarding this legislation. Mr Goldstone, the Labour Whip, said that it was to the House of Lords that the country had to look for the vindicai t tion of the ancient privilege of trial by jury. We are not such iconoclasts that, when we see a body of - men like the House of Lords discharging a very high obligation to the public, we cannot give them the credit due to their patriotism and their vigilance in the public interest. I think we shall be less loth to do so now whilst the men of whom it is chiefly representative in England are displaying such a magnificent spirit on the field of battle. Nothing is more touching than to take up the illustrated papers at the end of each week and read there the lists of officers who have been killed in battle. Some of the most historic blood- I shall not talk of it as the "" be s t "" blood; but what, by way of lineage, may be called some of the best blood in the TJnited Kingdom-is represented amongst those who have paid their last tribute of loyalty and devotion to their country. In order to show honourable members how dangerous it is to give too wide powers to the Executive, I would remind them that in the debate on the first Bill before the British Parliament, the Solicitor-General said that the censorship should be applied to prevent criticism of the Government of such a character that it. might destroy confidence in the Government, who had charge of the conduct of the war. In other words, if the Solicitor-General thought that a particular article was too strong in its condemnation of the A d ministration, or its ability to administer, he might avail himself of the censorship provisions to prevent auy future outpourings on the part of the newspaper concerned. Such a statement went a little too far for the Ministry, and'they disavowed the declaration of their Solicitor General as having any Cabinet autliority. When we are asked to simply trust M i nisters, I can only say that in the light of the fact that we had. a measure without any of these amending provisions introduced in another place, and that a declaration of the manner of its administration by the Solicitor-General was disavowed at Home, we may well be excused for being perhaps a little cautious, however desirous we are of assisting the M in istry in this crisis. ""Coming to the present Bill , it is quite true that the provision in regard to the subjection of civilians to the jurisdiction of courts martial in respect of the death penalty is modified, but I think that the Attorney General ought to go further. The Government give with one hand what they take away with the other. In the first place, the right of a person under arrest to demand to be tried by a civil tribunal under this Bill must be exercised - within six days, whereas under the Imperial Bill four days was the time limit . Notice has to be given to the person arrested that he may have the option of being tried by a civil tribunal, and that notice must be exercised within six days. That is provided for in sub-clause 6 of clause 4 ; but under sub-clause 8 of the same clause it is declared that In the event of any special military emergency arising ont of the present war, the Governor General may, by proclamation, forthwith suspend the operation of sub-section 6 of this section. . If we are not prepared to trust the Executive with the provision itself, surely weought to hesitate before trusting the Executive with the power to suspend it . Ministers, to some extent, trust to the advice of subordinate officers. The Minister of Defence more particularly seems to do so. I do not think I am doing Ministers any injustice in saying that very often they cannot know exactly what are the facts on which they are asked to suspend a provision.",27
201,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,To a large extent that is inevitable.,28
202,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Not to a large extent. The Attorney-General, in his own Department, sees a good deal of the facts of the cases.",28
203,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,But the position of the Attorney-General's Department is verydifferent from that of the Defence Department.,28
204,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"W h i 1st Minister of External Affairs I had, on one occasion, the luxury of spending^ the whole of m y Christinas holidays in reading, among other matters, the voluminous evidence sent down from Papua regarding men who had been arrested and found guilty of certain charges. While in my own home I read some hundreds of pages of evidence, to see that no injustice was done to thosemen.",28
205,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,The honourable member could not have done that had he been Minister of Defence.,28
206,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I do not say that I could have done so. Whether a Minister of Defence may be over inclined in times of peace to trust to the Major-General, or whoever the Commanding Officer may be, as to the facts of a particular case, I cannot say, since I have not had charge of' that Department; but I believe I am correct in saying that at present, at all events, Ministers do not trust in all cases to their own knowledge of the facts before coming to a decision. I have referred to the Defence Act ; let me come now to the regulations, through which we are giving a very wide power of Executive legislation. B y the way, it was surmised by one of the English, law journals-and tie surmise was adopted by one of the English newspapers-that the in the British Act, giving martial power to inflict the death penalty on British subjects generally, was inserted because a doubt existed as to the validity of the death sentence passed by a court of the realm. martial on the German spy, Carl Lodz. It was surmised that that provision was inserted to cover the possibility power to impose the death penalty being non-existent. If the offender had been found within certain areas, then, irrespective of this particular Act, he could have been ordered to suffer death penalty. It was a purely matter that this provision was designed to cover. This serves to show that, cause the Imperial authorities necessary to pass a certain provision, it does not necessarily follow that we should do the same here. If that provision was inserted to meet a special case-and never insert a clause ostensibly that-surely it does not do for us to the imitate, parrot like, exactly been done at Home. Happily, we have They got over that particular matter by amendment. Under the regulations naval and military authorities may order the whole of the inhabitants ticular area to remain within doors. That provision appears in the printed tions. They may also remove from any to locality any person suspected of being Act about to act in a manner prejudicial to the public safety and the defence of the realm. Under the provisions relating to censorship - t it is probable that an attack on the justness of the war might be made the basis of a trial before court martial. to refer briefly to the most recent critiof cism I have seen of these Acts. pears in a book entitled War: Its Conduct and Legal Remits, by Baty and is Morgan. Professor Morgan, as the AtAct torney-General knows, is lecturer in Conin stitutional Law at the London and is perhaps the most eminent tutional authority in the United dom. He certainly seems to have the best grip of the law of the United and the Commonwealth of Australia. has written a great deal on the subject, and is held in the highest esteem as an authority in the United Kingdom. and his co-author refer to the extrathese writers, unimpeachable. ordinary scope of some of these regulawords, Mr Glynn. tions. Reference is made, for instance, to regulation 9, which I quoted, as to the provision power to arrest, without warrant, any to courts person whose behaviour is of such a nature as to give reasonable ground for suspecting that he is acting, or about to act, in a manner prejudicial to the safety Professor Morgan expresses the opinion that that regulation, as well as some others, is ultra vires, beof the cause it cannot reasonably be read into the specific provisions of the Act .",28
207,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,W as he referquite ring to our regulations?,29
208,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"He was referring to the regulations that are the same as our own. technical I am dealing now with regulation 9 under our Act , and regulation 13 under the beImperial Act . Dealing with this, Baty deem it and Morgan writeThis seems to us to be quite meaningless. Conduct "" prejudicial to the safety of the realm"" can only be an offence if it comes within the military offences as defined in (a), we (b), (c). Such conduct is iiot of itself an to do offence at common law unless it comes within recognised categories of treason, conspiracy, sedition, or is within the Official Secrets Act. what has go on to s a y To disobey a statutory rule or order, if (and an (mly if) lawfully made, is of course always a the misdemeanour. But no one can be arrested for a mere misdemeanour without a warrant, and therefore the regulation directing arrest of a parwithout warrant for breach of the regulations is wholly bad. Or are we to assume that the regulapower to make regulations includes a power abolish the common law as to arrest whenever convenient? If this can be read into the when nothing is said therein to that effect, then anything can. In that case, "" Any person authorized by the competent naval or military authority"" may be authorized to do anything o hang peaceful citizens on lamp-posts. That particular provision is now being I propose amended, but not so as to touch the effect this criticism. Dealing generally with It apthe regulations, this authority says The truth of the matter is that the Statute brief without being terse, and the regulations are voluble without being explicit. Had the said, "" It shall be lawful for His Majesty Council to make any regulations he may University, deem expedient for tlfe public safety, and the defence of the realm, and such regulations shall constiuot be questioned in any legal proceedings Kingwhatsoever,"" then the articles we have been criticising would have been unimpeachable. States As a matter of fact, we have, both in the He unamended Act and in clause 2 of this Bill , practically part of the same text as that which, if adopted in the Imperial legisHe lation, would have been, according to In other they say that it would have given the naval and military authorities any power which they chose to exercise for the defence of the realm. That statement, however, is based on the assumption that tliere would be in the Bill a provision taking away the righ t to challenge their decisions by certiorari, or by any other form of bringing a case before the Court.",29
209,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Does the honourable member contend, for one moment, that, according to this authority, a Court of law would decide that it was ultra vires, or were the writers merely making an academic point?",30
210,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Every legal opinion is based on the assumption that the lawyer giving it is asked to advise whether, in the event of the point being taken before a Court of law, it will be upheld or not. Lawyers do not offer academic opinions having no relation to facts.",30
211,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Does the member believe that if such a regulation were taken before an English Court it would be declared to be ultra vires}/,30
212,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The powers given are very wide; but, in the light of the considered opinion of Professor Morgan, which I have only read with in the last half-hour, it would not be right for me to say Avhether it is right or wrong. However, the Courts refrain from restraining, or would hesitate to declare ultra vires, any legislation which Parliament has thought necessary for the purpose of the protection of the realm, or as being essential as a war precaution. This authority proceeds to sayBut the Act being what it is we have never seen any statutory regulations which appeared to outrun so breathlessly the statutory powers actually conferred. For a parallel we should have to go back to the proclamations of Henry V III . , who could at least point to the lex regia on the statute-book (repealed in the reign of his successors) giving all his proclamations the force of law. We cannot admit that the Defence of the Bealm Act is such as lex regia, and we are quite sure that our present Parliament has not contemplated anything of the kind. It may be said that the gravity of the occasion dispenses us from invoking the usual rules of construction, but if so we may as well dispense with the Rule of Law altogether and entrust the Cabinet with autocracy. And since we know on high authority that the conflict against destitution and disease is perpetual-contr a miseriam aeterna auctoritaswe may soon be called upon to do so in time of "" peace."" Now, passing away from this authority - an authority which is doubted by the Attorney-General-ther e is no ter in the provisions of the Bill to which I need refer u n t i l we reach the Committee stage, except sub-clause 3 of clause 2, which providesThe Minister may(a) require that there shall be placed at his disposal the whole or any part of the output of any factory or workshop in which arms, ammunition, or warlike stores or equipment, or any o articles required for the production thereof are manufactured; and (b) take possession of and use for the purpose of His Majesty's Naval or Military service any such factory or workshop or any plant thereof. Nothing is said as to whether compensation is to be paid or to what extent it is to he paid. When thp Imperial Bill from which these provisions are taken was before the British Parliament, M in isters said that they intended to appoint a special Board to provide compensation for those affected by the exercise of these honourable provisions, though, very properly, not to the full extent of the damage suffered; because all men must suffer to some extent, vicariously, if not directly, from the war, and the payment of full compensation to men in the TJnited Kingdom who are making exceedingly high profits, would not be right. The ground on which the Imperial legislation was introduced was principally that there had been such a colossal increase from week to week in the demand for munitions of war that it was impossible to get the requirements of the Admiralt y or M i l it a r y Departments supplied. Lord Kitchener has stated that since the outbreak of the war the output of munitions of war has in creased three hundredfold, and that the manufacturers have not the knowledge nor the time, nor the machinery, in some cases, with which to keep pace with requirements.",30
213,Mr ARCHIBALD,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Lloy d George has said that.,30
214,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"And so, I think, has Lord Kitchener, to some extent. Lloyd George has said that it is necessary to mobilize the industries connected with the output of munitions of war. Has the Minister shown that the same necessity exists in Australia? Because, if that is the case, we may give the necessary power.",30
215,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"We have had to do it . already, under mutual agreement; but it is necessary for us to have the power, other matshould it be required.",30
216,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"If the Minister finds that this extraordinary power which he seeks is to any degree desirable, and that, without it , he cannot cope with the obligations of defence, I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition, on behalf of the Opposition, will accord it to him.",31
217,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,It is necessary to the power.,31
218,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"As one of the reasons for taking this power in Great Britain it was alleged that some men, not many, were not giving the full results of their earnings. Another reason was that nearly all employers were making exorbitant profits. I have read an account of the Clyde engineers' strike, and my im pression is that the men were right. For twelve months there had been a dispute, but immediately the war broke out the employers offered three-fourths of the men's demands, and the point recently was, whether the men's demand should be conceded in full . I do not wish to go into the merits of the case, but the judgment of The Times correspondent, on the facts of the case, seems to me to be correct. In a well-considered leader The Times paid a very high tribute to labour for its loyalty and efficiency since the war had broken out, but Lord K it chener, in the House of Lords, had to say that tliere were cases that interfered with what otherwise would have been his general approbation of the employees who were engaged in the output of munitions of war, and necessitated the proposal of the Government to take over general control. Lloyd George and Lord Kitchener have pointed out that one of the main objects of this proposal is the cutting down of the exorbitant profits that would be made by some manufacturers owing to the great demand for munitions of war, and if the Minister of Defence can show us that the same necessity exists here, I shall be satisfied. I offer these criticisms in order to show that the Opposition are justified in devoting a little attention to this measure. ""We have no assurance from the Minister of Defence that the giving of very wide powers, especially as regards the taking over of manufactories, has become necessary. The honourable member for Balaclava suggested this . afternoon, by question, that some communications with reference to the Bill had been received from the Imperial Government. No doubt, if that is the case, the Minister will be glad to give them to us to consider privately or otherwise. I hope the Minister will understand that what I have had to say in regard to the Bill is not dictated by factious opposition, though at times my remarks may have been directed to a little remissness in have observation of what has been done in the Old Country.",31
219,Mr CARR,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Macquarie) [5.49] - After what has been said, further criticism of the Bill is hardly necessary. The provisions of the measure cut right across the grain of a democratic people such as we are. At the same time, I realise the necessity for conceding a good deal of power in order that efficiency may be secured for the A r m y. As to whether we are conceding too much is a matter for argument. In my opinion, this Bill will concede too much. It doubles on its track, as it were. For instance, while in sub-clause 6 of clause 4 it pretends to give civilians a choice of t r i a l , that option is taken away from them by sub-clause 8. I object to this. In my opinion, that which the Minister desires can be equally well achieved by retaining to the Executive the right to review serious penalties, especially the death penalty. The right of review should not be taken out of the hands of those directly responsible to the nation. According to the Bill , the Governor General may invest tribunals with all the powers of life and death. By regulation, he may give them the absolute power df investigation and imposing their verdicts. This should certainly be avoided. I have not come to the stage in which I can vote for a Bill containing such a provision. I maintain that Parliament should always retain this power through the Executive. I do not intend to say much on the Bill at present, as I understand other honourable members wish to speak. I merely make these few remarks at this juncture in order to show to the Government that there is a fairly solid opinion against permitting these great powers of the people to be whittled away in the manner in which they would be by treatment of this description.",31
220,Mr WATT,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Balaclava) [5.52] - I do not propose to detain the Minister or the House very long, but there are certain features of the Bill to which many honourable members on both sides object, though I do not suppose any honourable member would be inclined to refuse the second reading on that account. I hope that when we get into Committee the Minister will offer some better explanation as to the necessity for some of the provisions. Better still, I trust that he will suggest amendments for their modification. The Bill , as has been said by the honourable member preceding me, strikes a blow at many important principles which have been built up as the result of centuries of endeavour, and they are principles of which we all approve. The plea for submitting this legislation is that we are at war, that we are in a period of t r i a l *nd crisis, and that the British Parliament has adopted proposals of substantially the same character. The fact that the greatest and most responsible statesmen of the Empire think that it is advisable for the safety of the Home Land to recommend legislation of this kind is an argument which weighs with every loyal member of the House, and of the - community; otherwise the Minister would uot get ten votes in this House for the second reading of the Bill .",31
221,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,It would not be submitted .,32
222,Mr WATT,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I thoroughly agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Angas that factious opposition is not posed. What comes from honourable members on this side will be nothing but gentle and suggestive criticism. But hope the Minister will realise that, though the Home Land, and many of the men engaged in its government may feel the need for very drastic able treatment of many of its problems, put we in Australia are free from the necessary conditions existing in the Old Counwealth. try. It does not necessarily follow that the conditions existing in the Isles of North, ringed by waters, and the resort his intention. of myriads of alien enemies, are the same as those existing in a Dominion like ours, ont on the circumference of the world, so that provisions necessary to Great Britain may not be needed here. Therefore, I trust that the M i ister, in Committee, will receive suggesthis tions for the modification of the B i l We must preserve the principle that even significant character. in time of war individuals in a Democracy have rights as well as the community, and that while the safety of the comWestern munity is the supreme law, the rights individuals must be respected, as far as possible, consistent with the preservation of that safety.",32
223,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Civilian s are absolutely protected under the powers given in the Bill.,32
224,Mr WATT,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"There are attempts to protect civilians, but there are certain features which show how far this protection may be withdrawn in case of emergency. In order to illustrate my attitude, I may refer to one of the provisions of the Bill which should claim attention in Committee. I refer to what is now labelled as clause 8, under which, in the event of any special military emergency, certain rights of civil t r i a l are withdrawn and military trials substituted. One cannot anticipate what may happen, and I presume satisfactory reasons exist for the insertion of this clause. The only question is as to whether the phraseology adopted by the draftsman and the Minister does not open too wide a door to misadventure and, possibly, grave injustice. What may be a special military emergency in the mind of one Minister may be altogether a different thing in the mind of another. If this country, being at war, were threatened with invasion by some of the Powers that seem to be favourably disposed towards the Triple Entente proat the present time, that would be an occasion upon which large powers should belong to the Executive. Is such a cirI cumstance as that what is meant by al- ""special military emergency""?",32
225,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,I can assure the honormember that the power will not be into operation unless it is absolutely in the interests of the Common,32
226,Mr WATT,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,I am always prepared to t ^ Â° accept the assurance of a Minister as to,32
227,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Circumstance s will have to change a good deal from their present appearances before the power is applied.,32
228,Mr WATT,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I should judge that, notherwise, the Minister would not suggest clause at all.; but a "" special military l . emergency "" may be a matter of very in A "" special m i l i tary emergency"" might occur if it were deemed advisable to put 5,000 troops into Australia for the protection of of certain dock or harbour works. It might be a "" special military emergency "" if we sent troops into Thursday Island, or into other portions of this country.",32
229,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,But the plication of the Bill will have to be sanctioned.,33
230,Mr WATT,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,No . We give full power under this Bill.,33
231,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Suppos e some of the nations, our friends today, are our enemies in three months. I think the honourable member will see",33
232,Mr WATT,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I think I can see what the Government have in mind, but before this clause disappears from Committee I am anxious that its terms should be made particularly explicit, so that Parliament will know exactly to what it is consenting. Then, following the general view of the Leader of the Opposition, I am prepared to forego many of the prejudices I have against Executive legislation, and to give the largest and amplest powers to the Government for the protection of our rights and privileges in this time of crisis. But let us do it as cautiously and sagaciously as possible, so that every honourable member may know exactly to what principle he has consented, even in a time of Cl'lSlS* Mr Laird SMITH [5.58] - I think we are indebted to the honourable member for South Sydney, and to other honourable members on both sides of the House, for the information they have given in reference to this matter; but I am inclined to be doubly careful after reading the information contained in a paragraph in the Christian Commonwealth on the working of the Act that was So hurriedly passed by the House of Commons. There we had a body of highlyqualified legislators, who passed a measure hurriedly, and with what result? According to the newspaper to which I have referredThe Government have discovered their mistake in suspending the Magna Charta, the Bill of Rights, and all the other Statutes which safeguard the civil liberties of the individual. It was left to the House of Lords, when the Defence of the Realm Bill was before them, to act as protectors of civil rights. The House of Commons, acting either 'in ignorance or in panic, but certainly in haste, had permitted the Bill to pass in the most objectionable form. A few days ago Lord Parmoor, who was once known as Sir Alfred Cripps, introduced a Bill into the House of Lords to amend the Defence of the Bealm Act in the direction of restoring to the civil population the right to be tried in a civil Court. The Government were unable to resist the measure, and agreed - to the second reading. It is the intention of the Government, however, to take up the matter ap- themselves, and to introduce a Bill of their own. The Attorney-General is understood to have succeeded in getting his own way against the military authorities. It is a monstrous thing that, when the civil Courts are still sitting, Britisli subjects should have to be brought before courts martial for what are really civil offences, and tried by an incomo petent and biased body. The Bill to be introduced for the amendment of the Defence of the Realm Act will reserve power to the Government to rc-impose military law in the case of invasion. When this Bill comes before the House of Conimons, we hope members will be a little more alert, and that the measure will not be allowed to pass, except in such form as will secure the t r i al of persons by the civil Courts for all otl'ences while it is possible for civil Courts to sit. The last tribunal to which the British people ought to hand over their civil liberties is a military court. I agree with much .that appears in t h is quotation, and I am of the opinion that we should guard the rights of the citizen very dearly. The honourable member for Balaclava deserves credit for pointing this out. We are not here for the purpose of dealing with a matter of this character in any party spirit, and I hope we shall only look at it from the point of view of the general interest of the com(Denison) munity. 0",33
233,Mr MASSYGREENE,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,There is no fear of an invasion of Australia.,33
234,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"No immediate fear, I think.",33
235,Mr MASSYGREENE,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Then , why give this power at all?",33
236,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The honourable member agrees that we are proposing to grant extensive powers to the military; but we do not kuow how they will act. We do know the duties the Minister has to perform will prevent him from investigating as many cases as he would probably like to. The Minister of Defence and the Assistant Minister of Defence have done much to remedy many evils. The excellent work they have done has been brought under my personal knowledge; but we are bound to have trouble at a time like this. We must expect it, and it is our duty to assist the Ministers to perform the heavy duties which may come before them. It has been suggested that prices might not be put up to ah excessive point in Australia-that we are at war, and that the loyalty of the people would induce everybody to do what the Minister has stated a number of commercial men have been good enough to do already. But what do we find in the Old Country ? A gentleman of very high repute, one of the biggest merchants in Victoria, speaking at a dinner the other n i g h t - I refer to Mr Charles Duckett, and quote from the Age of 26th A p r i l , 1915-replyin g to the toast of his health, saidHe was in England when the war broke out. They had read of strikes amongst the workers tliere, and, no doubt, blamed the men considerably for their actions. He did not blame .them at all. He considered they had done right. The manufacturers tliere cared nothing about the country as long as they could make money, and they haa jumped prices to an enormous extent-muc h more BO than was necessary-wit h the result that they were making more money now than they had made before the war, while the eost of living had gone up tremendously. In the face of these facts; coming from a - source not influenced by politics in any way, it behoves us to pass such a measure as this, so that the military authorities can take over any trade that they - consider necessary in the interests of the community. That is the reason why I am so desirous thafcfcheHouse should allow this Bill to go into Committee. There, I hope that each honourable member of the House will .give us of his talents to enable us to amend the Bill so that it will operate in such a manner that all civil rights will be retained. We must do that, notwithstanding that we are afc war; bufc I hope we shall not gefc excited or allow ourselves to be carried away by the influences of the moment. We must not pass measuresfchafcwill place i u the hands of a very few people powers that may not be exercised judiciously and fairly. shall vote for the second reading of the Bill , but I hope it will be amended in Committee.",33
237,Dr MALONEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Melbourne) [6.5] The one question which I will always in sist upon whenever a B i ll of this sort is introduced to the House is, "" Have the Government left the civil power higher than the military power?"" I do not wish to see military authorities dominating over the civil power. One officer of very high rank-thaf c is if my information be true-whe n he arrived at sixty years of age, and should have been retired, was put into a higher position by the small ooterie that rules the Defence Department. Ask any ranker outside if he would care to be tried by that man. His record in one portion of this State was such that he was fined, and yet continued in the service. How could any ranker obtain justice from a man like that? It would be the same if a Judge of the County or Supreme Court who had committed a theft, for which he was fined, was spokeu of as a good Judge, and one who ought to continue in office.",34
238,Mr WATT,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,That is a case this Bill would not touch.,34

244,Mr WATT,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Her e is another honourable gentleman less cautious than the honourable member, making what I think is an entirely unprovoked allegation.

I hope the Courts in this count ry will give him greater compensation than the Â£100 he has Unless the members of a court martial are men who have had legal training, what will they know of the law of evidence? Legal men of wide experience laugh at courts martial. As a matter of fact, they represent little more than a slightly idealized form of lynch law. Both are equally sudden, and liable to be unjust. Whether a man be a soldier or a civilian, I desire that he shall have the right of appeal to the higher civil Courts in cases where the penalty may be death, a long imprisonment, or punishment, it may be, by the lash. I know of no great jurist or lawyer of international repute who has supported courts martial as just and equitable tribunals. Having obtained the assurance of the Attorney-General that there is nothing in this Bill to make the civil power subservient to the military, I am content to vote for the second reading.

261,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,I do not think any amendment of the existing Act proposed in this Bill will make the operation of the measure retrospective.,35
262,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Angas) [6.16] - It is not easy to understand at once the effect of the measure, but my impression js that it will not be retrospective in the ordinary sense. The provision in this Bill is more specific than that in the existing Act, for which it is substituted. I think it is possible that these specifications are required to cover regulations already passed. I do not know that some of them would be perfectly valid otherwise.",35

If that be so, it is necessary that this clause should pass as it stands.",35
266,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Buss-Assistant M in ister) [6.19] - Honourable members will notice tbnt in this amending Bill we are proposing to repeal many words in the War Precautions Act of 1914, which are repeated in this measure, but, as the honourable member for Angas has said, some regulations have been made which require to be covered by this ameudiug Bill to make them valid. We have discovered that the War Precautions Act, of 1914 was not worded exactly as we sliould like. This measure is necessary to give the Executive the power they require to frame the necessary regulations to give effect ro what they desire to do.",36
267,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Darling Downs) [6.20]. - Before the War Precautions Act of 1014 was passed certain regulations and Orders in Oouncil had to be made by the Government to meet certain emergencies. There Was no Statutory authority in existence upon which those regulations and orders could be issued, so section 3 of the original Act was passed, making its operation retrospective as affecting those orders and regulations, and making breaches of those regulations punishable offences. Then came the Act of 1914 to give a statutory basis for the Executive's power, and to> specify a certain number of things for which regulations might be made. It now appears that those powers were not wide enough. Certain regulations have been made under that Act, and it may be open to question whether some of them have not gone further than the Act contemplated. There is nothing in the Bill we arc considering now which says that if the powers have been exceeded, and the regulations have been ultra vires, this measure shall validate them. All that this Bill does is to widen the powers so as to enable regulations to be made having a wider scope than those which could be made under 'the existing Act.",36
268,Sir ROBERT BEST,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,I do not think so.,36
269,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Le t me give an illustration. Under paragraph 6 of the next clause power is given to make regulationsto prevent the transmission abroad, except tlirough the post, of any letter, post-card, lettercard, written communication, or newspaper. That is entirely new.",36
270,Sir ROBERT BEST,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,That does not matter ; it would probably be covered by section 3 of the Act of 1914. [98],36
271,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"It might or it might not be covered by that section; but in this Bill it is included as a specific power. This measure does not purport to be retrospective legislation, but to take wider powers than are provided for under the original Act . If anything was done under regulations issued before the passing of"" the Act of 1914, this Bill does not provide that those acts shall be valid.",36
272,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,There was not much done under the Act of 1914.,36
273,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"That is so; but honourable members opposite have raised the question, as to whether the operation of this Bill will be retrospective so as invalidate anything done under regulations already issued.",36
274,Mr RILEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Will it affect the case of the men who were recently tried and. sentenced to five years' imprisonment?,36
275,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,I am not expressing any opinion on that at all.,36

277,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I do not know the charges that were preferred against them. I do not think that this Bill is intended to meet those cases at all. Those men were charged with specific offences, were brought before a court martial, and possibly dealt with under the"" Defence Act . This Bill deals with precautionary measures, which, is an entirely different matter.",36
278,Mr WEBSTER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Coul d the men referred to be placed on their trial under this Bill?,36
279,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"No . The Assistant Minister will correct me if I am wrong when I say that if this Bill gives any. additional power, or creates any new offences, it can only apply to breaches of the law made after the passing of this measure. It would be a serious thing to hold a man accountable for some act which, at the time he committed it , did not constitute a breach of the law - It is, of course, presumed that every man in Australia knows the law, and ignorance of the law is not a defence to any charge.",36

291,Mr WEBSTER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Bu the said that they were not operative. This Bill , I would remind honourable members, covers a great deal of ground. It is a measure which is new to Australian legislation, and seeing that we are vesting judicial functions in an authority which has not alleged hitherto been set up in the CommonAct wealth, it demands very serious considerawhen tion at our hands.",37

An offence against this Act may be â prosecuted either summarily or upon indictment, or if the regulations so provide by court martial, but an offender shall not be liable to be punished more than once in respect of the same offence.

(b) If the offence is prosecuted upon in dictment- a fine of any amount or imprisonment for any term, or both : Provided that where it is proved that the offence is committed with the intention of assisting the enemy the person convicted of such an offence shall be liable to suffer death. (c) If the offence is prosecuted by court martial-the same punishment as if the offender had been a person subject to military law and had on active service committed an offence under section five of the Army Act: Provided that where it is proved that the offence is committed with the intention of assisting the enemy the person convicted of such an offence by a court martial shall be liable to suffer death.

Penalty: One hundred pounds, or six months' 7'.4.5 p.m. hnprisonment, or both.",37
297,Mr CARR,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Macquarie) [7.46] This is the clause which has given rise to the objections that have been voiced in this Chamber. Earlier in the debate I stated my objection to sub-clause 8 of proposed new section 6, which provides, in the event of any special military emergency arising out of the present war, the Governor General may, by proclamation, suspend the operation of sub-clause 6, which gives to any British subject not subject to the Naval Discipline Act or to military law the right of appealing to the civil Court. Sub-clause 8 would establish a dangerous precedent, for by it we should be creating a tribunal outside the jurisdiction of the ordinary Courts. No person's liberty, and certainly no person's life, should be taken from bim without at least giving the Executive the opportunity of reviewing the decision. If sub-clause 8 is passed in its present form the matter will be taken entirely out, of the hands of the Executive. What is desired can be just as effectively obtained without investing the military authorities with the great powers which will be conferred upon them by this tribunal. The Executive of the day should have the right to review a death sentence, and unless the Government can see their way to provide for this and have it inserted in the Bill, I will not vote for it.",38
298,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Angas) [7.47] - This is a very important clause. I do not know whether the Minister will make any modification of the sub-clause that gives the power to suspend the right to claim a trial before a civil Court; but, if not, we ought to get an assurance that the power contained in this sub-clause will be exercised very rarely, and only in circumstances of the most compelling necessity.",38
299,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I have already given an assurance on behalf of the Government that no sentence under this proposed new section will be carried out unless, and until, it has been presented to the Attorney-General for review.",38
300,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"As a matter of fact, under the Act the death sentence is now presented to the Attorney-General, and, therefore, to Cabinet.",38
301,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"That is a different matter. What I said was that the matter could be sent to the Attorney-General, [ 9 8 ] -* and should be sent, not necessarily for review, but that each sentence could be reviewed, and would be, if necessary.",38
302,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I understand that Cabinet has the power of review, and I hope that the Attorney-General will look very closely into it. That is what has been promised. But, as the honourable member for Batman has pointed out, the powers of the military authorities depend on the kind of court martial appointed, and upon that there is no light given by this Act. In the event of a court martial being appointed, it is probable that the officers of that court would have an exalted opinion of their powers. I ask the Attorney-General if he will see that thesepowers are not pushed beyond the limits outside of which, by practice, we know the civil Courts would not apply them. Then if ever there is occasion to suspend the operation of this right of trial by jury or the civil Courts, we may hope that the power will be exercised with as much judicial tact and reserve as the civil Courts display, because in the hands of men who are somewhat authoritative in their ideas of discipline, fchey may become a menace to the community.",38
303,Mr MCGRATH,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Ballarat) [7.52] - I am not inclined to vote for this clause, including as it does the sub-clause to which objection has been taken, because by passing it we shall be placing too great a power in the hands of the military authorities. I would like fco ask the Attorney-General who is to be the judge of any case being a matter of special urgency. I take it that the Governor General will act on the recommendation of the Minister of Defence, and that the Minister will be guided by the advice of his officers. Why should there be any hurry to shoot a man ? Even if he has committed a serious offence against the Empire, I see nothing wrong in the proposalfchafche should have a fair trial, and be judged by the civil Courts. As the honourable member for Angas has pointed out, many military officers have a very exalted opinion of themselves. They may be splendid officers, but still they have no legal training to qualify them to act as judges. I hope the At torney-General will amend the clause,, because I do not want to vote against any clause in the measure now before the Committee, as I recognise that in these times we must be guided to a large extent by the responsible Minister.",38
304,Mr JH CATTS,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,But we want some justification for the great power contained in sub-clause 8.,39
305,Mr MCGRATH,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Yes ; that is what I am asking for. Australia is not honeycombed with spies, and what may be necessary in Great Britain may not be necessary in the Commonwealth. At present We are not threatened with any invasion, aaid have very little to fear, yet, in spite of this, the Minister brings down a Bill practically similar to that introduced in Great Britain , and seeks to give the military authorities ithis great power over the lives of our people. Mr KINOO ' MALLEY - They have not got it in Great Britain.",39
306,Sir ROBERT BEST,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Yes . they have.,39
307,Mr WATT,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Balaclava) [7.571-As far as I am able to judge, the bulk of this clause seems to be wise and necessary, and if sub-clause 8 were eliminated I think the Committee would be unanimously satisfied. Sub-clause 6 gives civil rights to civilians accused of offences, upon six days' notice being given. Sub-clause 8 is the cause of all our apprehension and anxiety, because in cases of special military emergency the right of the civilian as contained in sub-clause 6 may be cancelled. As far as the immediate future of Australia is concerned, the prospect does not justify the stringency of sub-clause 3, but if there should be developments, then Parliament surely will be prepared to grant all the necessary power to the Government to meet the situation. I would suggest to the Minister, and to the At torney-General, that sub-clause 8 should be quietly dropped out of the Bill for the present, because the interests of the community are sufficiently safeguarded without it . There is no party spirit in this discussion, and I think the Minister will take counsel with wisdom if he consents to the elimination of the sub-clause, and thus secure for the Bill a more speedy passage than it is otherwise likely to get. . Mr HUGHES (West Sydney-Attor uoy-General) [8.0] - The scope of the general criticism is not directed against the clause itself, but against sub-clause 8. Sub-clause 6, providing for trial by civil Courts, is an ample safeguard of the rights of persons dealt with under the section, and its provisions are an answer to all that has been said in regard fco the clause as a whole, excepting sub-clause 8. This sub-clause gives the Governor General power, in ""a special military emergency,"" to proclaim what is, in effect, martial law. Assuming for the sake of argument that sub-clause 8 was not there, I want honourable members to look at the clause as it would read, and apply it to the case of a civilian tried for any offence under the Bill , and, in particular, fco apply it fco an offence for which the death penalty might properly be imposed. Now, the death penalty cannot be imposed by a civil tribunal for any other offence than one for which any person would be liable to that penalty under the civil laws as they now exist. This Bill does not create any special offences for which the death penalty may be inflicted, and, although it may be argued that the death penalty may be inflicted by court martial for offences other than those for which the civil law provides that penalty, this does not apply to civilians. It therefore follows that if the case be heard before a civil tribunal, the only offences for which a person can be subjected to the death penalty must be offences which are provided for under Statute or common law. So much is clear. This brings us to the point-wha t is the civil law in this matter ? In regard to offences against the Commonwealth for which the death penalty may be inflicted - I leave all those offences which are provided for under State laws, such as murder and the kindred offences-the law is declared in the Crimes Act, to which I direct the attention of honourable members. Section 24 of our Crimes Act readsAny person who within the Commonwealth or any Territory(a) instigates any foreigner to make an armed invasion of the Commonwealth or any part of the King's Dominions, or (6) assists by any means whatever any public enemyI venture to say that paragraph b is as wide for all practical purposes",39
308,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,What happens under the provision?,39
309,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"It is provided that such an offendershall be guilty of an indictable offence, and shall be liable to the punishment of death.",39
310,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,It means that be is in dicted before a j u r y .,39
311,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I asked honourable members to assume fchafc sub-clause 8 of proposed new section 6 of the War Precautions Act was not in the Bill-that is, to read clause 4 without sub-clause 8. I hold that a civilian committing an offence uuder clause 4 would be, so far as the death penalty is concerned, in exactly the same position as he would have been in but for the clause. He could not be tried for any other offence, and if guilty the penalty would be the same. That is my reading of the provision. The terms of section 24 of the Crimes Act- "" Any person who assists by any means whatever any public - enemy ''-ar e so wide and sweeping that in times like these no civil Court would hesitate to use the in to the full extent when it was clearly demonstrated that an act of treachery had been committed and the safety of the Commonwealth had' been deliberately imperilled. If that be so-and there can be no doubt about itthe effect of clause 4, assuming that sub-clause 8 is struck out, is to re-enact, so far as the death penalty is concerned, those offences for which the person would be liable under the Crimes Act. I now come to sub-clause 8. It deals with events of "" special military emergency "" arising out of the present war; it provides that the Governor General may by proclamation- forthwith suspend the operation of sub-section 6 of this section, either generally or as respects any area specified in the proclamation, without prejudice, however, to any proceedings under this section which may be then pending in any civil Court. I do not deny that "" special military - emergency"" is an elastic term. It has to be interpreted by somebody. It has to be interpreted finally by the Executive Government. The responsibility for recommending action presumably will rest upon the Minister of Defence, but it is the Executive Government who must give effect to the recommendation. It is hardly credible that the Executive Government of this country, composed as it is of members of Parliament, and subject, as every one of them is, to censure by Parliament, would agree to the suspension of the civil law in anything but an emergency which amounted to a position of grave national peril. In my speech on the second reading of the Bill I said that, in my opinion, sub-clause 8, after all, did not confer any more powers on this Government than we had, put that it put those powers in a statutory form. I shall not labour that point. Personally, I must confess that I entirely sympathize with the views expressed as to this clause. I do not like it. I never pretended to like it. Whether the Bill without the clause would give us sufficient power to meet every emergency I do not pretend to say. I presume that it is easy for us to imagine a set of circumstances which could be met by nothing less than what is popularly known as a proclamation declaring martial law, but we must have this power, although we believe, and have every right to believe, that such an emergency will uot arise. Beyond that I do not think that there is auy need for me to speak. If the objection to clause 4 is directed wholly to subclause 8, the Government will consider any suggestion for its deletion.",39
312,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Flinders) [8.101 - I do not quite understand from the remarks of the Attorney-General whether the Government propose to proceed witli sub-clause S or not, but perhaps they desire to hear further debate on the subject.",40
313,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Exactly .,40
314,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,I do not take any exception to that in dealing with a matter of this grave importance.,40
315,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,This is not a party measure.,40
316,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"No . If (he Government, after considering this matter, think that this enormous power of practically proclaiming martial law in one of its most important aspects is essential, I , for one, will support them. If they decide, in their discretion, that it is necessary, I think that the Committee should support them. But I desire to point out that this is not a power to declare martial law in all its aspects, or not in those, so far as I read the measure, in respect to which it might be most important that the Government, in an extreme peril or emergency, should possess that authority. In most countries a proclamation declaring astate of ri'artial law is merely a proclamation having no legal force or effect, but indicating that the Government, in the extreme peril of the circumstances,, propose to break the law. What has been known in some countries-and this has very frequently happened in Ireland-as the suspension of the habeas corpus is merely one branch of what is ordinarily known as martial law. A proclamation of that kind has no legal effect; it is done i u breach of the law, and in the anticipation that subsequently Parliament will authorize or sanction that breach of the law in view of the national peril which is supposed to make that step necessary. In this case, the Government propose to adopt, so far as it goes, a course which seems to me, if they contemplate any such national peril as is implied in this provision, preferable to breaking the law. I think that in a national peril, which may require the suspension of the ordinary civil rights protecting the liberty of the subject, it is preferable that the Government should take the power of doing it legally rather than do it illegally, trusting to subsequent ratification by Parliament. if the Government contemplate the possibility, during any recess, of circumstances requiring practically the taking away of the safeguards surrounding the liberty of the citizens-it may be necessary; in the case of an invasion of Australia, probably it would be necessary- I think that they are perfectly right in asking Parliament beforehand to invest them with the ower of doing what otherwise they would e obliged to do illegally. rose specially to point out is that this provision only proclaims martial law with regard to what is, perhaps, the least i m {>ortant part of the declaration of martial aw, namely, taking away from persons the right to be tried by the civil tribunals. It is an important part; but, for practical purposes, supposing that at any time we were faced with a war in Australia, or a rebellion, or anything of that kind, in which the Government must take steps at once, and must disregard the ordinary rights of the citizen for the protection of the whole, what is really the most important power for the Government to possess is that known as abrogating the habeas corpus; that is to say, of imprisoning persons suspected, with reason it may be, of acting treacherously and holding them there to prevent them going further. That is most important, and that power is not given by this clause.",40
317,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,B y clause 2 that is given. 1 This is a measure to prevent the committal of offences; the Grimes Act is a measure to provide for the punishment of offences that have been committed.,41
318,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Q u it e so. Of more importance than the question how a man is to be tried is the consideration of what powers are really necessary. Among these is the power fco hold in detention without t r i a l , or prior to t r i a l, a man supposed, with some reason, to be guilty of traitorous practices. The power taken by sub-clause 8 is not a complete power of proclaiming martial law, and is not sufficient for the proclaiming of martial law in a way in which its proclamation would be effective. I do not contemplate any practical possibility of the proclamation of martial law in Australia being necessary, but one never knows what tur n a great struggle of the kind in which the nation is now engaged may take. I do not blame Ministers for asking Parliament fco invest them with Therefore, even such extreme powers as those for which they ask, and which they think may, under some circumstances, be needed. They having asked for these powers, I think that it is our duty to grant them. No Government which possessed the confidence of a majority of this House would attempt; fco exercise these powers unless there were the direst national peril to be met.",41
319,Mr ANSTEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Bourke) [8.17] - I But what I agree with the honourable member for Flinders that the maintenance of the national existence is the supreme necessity, and that every step necessary to that end is justified, even though it should mean the abrogation of every civil right. But where is the justification for what is proposed ? Where is the indication that the conditions at present necessitate the abrogation of every civil right? What will be my position when this Bill becomes law ? Farewell to friend and foe. No more will be heard of Anstey! Under the Bill the military chiefs will be able to arrest any man in the community, and do as they please with him. We have had Defence of the Realm Acts, War Precaution Acts, and other measures of the kind ad libitum, and it has been stated in the press that these Acts are the most stringent in existence. Now the Government come forward with a request for additional powers for the military. For what purpose? We ought to be told why these new powers are needed. Have fresh dangers arisen for Australia? Is her position more precarious than it was six months ago ? Have new enemies arisen in our midst? Is there some danger abroad with which the existing laws cannot cope ? A r e our present laws inadequate for the necessities of the country ? If they are not adequate, tell us why they are not.",41
320,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Parliamen t has been told that they are inadequate.,42
321,Mr ANSTEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Broa d assertions do not make facts. The Minister of Defence, who introduced the Bill in another place, said that the measure was intended to fill up gaps. He said, "" I shall explain its provisions, and shall tell you in detail what is l a c k in g "" ; but he only talked round about the subject, and gave no explanation, aud no explanation has been given in this Chamber. All sorts of crimes and possibilities have been imagined, but we have not been told that Contingencies justifying legislation of the kind proposed have arisen. There has been no justification for the suspension of civil law and trial by jury. We have not been told why individuals should be dragged before military tribunals to be sentenced for anything they may do, or say, or write. The honourable member has told us that the Crimes Act is in similar terms. If I do anything to serve the purposes of the enemy I am liable at common law, and if the law makes my deeds punishable with death I am liable to that penalty. Bufc before the penalty can be exacted I must be tried in a civil Court, and must be given an opportunity to defend myself. If my friends will supply me with money, I can hire a lawyer to speak for me, and I can have my case put before a j u r y of my fellowcountrymen by a civil Judge. What chance should I have were I hauled before a tribunal of military gentlemen, armed with the power of the rack, the gallows and the torture-chamber, whose. sentence would not be subject to appeal? The Attorney-General has told usfchafche will review these sentences. What chance should I have under such circumstances? A court martial afc Rabaul passed long sentences of imprisonment on five men. Those sentences were subject to review by the Attorney-General; but he has been too busy to review them, and has had to act on the advice tendered by his officials. We hear it whispered everywhere, even in this chamber, that the military can do no harm. I ask to what law is the military authority to be subject when the civil population is subject to the military. To what Court shall armed criminals amongst the chiefs of the M i l i tary Forces be brought? Who shall save the common people from their tyranny? We were told, in regard to the Rabaul cases, that consideration would be given to the sentences later. No doubt, if 1 were brought before a military tribunal at this juncture, and appealed against its sentence to the Attorney-General, he would say, "" At the present time the sentence cannot be reviewed,"" and next morning my neck would be pulled out ten yards. A f t e r my death, the case might be reconsidered, but what comfort would there be to me in that? What is the supreme Court of this country? Is Parliament the supreme power in Australia? Is it intended to be the supreme power? I asked a question this afternoon of the Assistant Minister of Defence. I presume that I was within my rights as a member of Parliament in asking that question. I presume, too, this being a free community, that members of fchis Parliament have the right fco be reported in the newspapers of the country. The M in ister answered my question, but the M in ister of Defence gave instructions to the military authorities to exercise the power which they possess of refusing permission fco the press to allow the question to appear in any newspaper in Australia.",42
322,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Hear , hear!",42
323,Mr ANSTEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Las t night the Governor General informed the public of fchis country that the Australian troops are at Gallipoli. Have I not the right fco the same information as is given fco the Governor General ?,42
324,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,The honourable member got that information.,42
325,Mr ANSTEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"It was suppressed, so far as the newspapers were concerned. I demand rights co-equal with those of the Governor General.",42
326,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I said the Minister would give the information to this Parliament, and that that was as far as it would go. The honourable member got the information.",42
327,Mr RODGERS,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Is this standing behind your country at a time of crisis?,42
328,Mr ANSTEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,I am here to express an opinion.,42
329,Mr RODGERS,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,To explode!,42
330,Mr ANSTEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"We l l , explode; and it would not be a bad thing if the honourable member did the same.",42
331,Mr RODGERS,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,The Prime Minister is entitled to a little more respect.,42
332,Mr ANSTEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The Prime Minister is entitled to that amount of respect which he earns from the men assembled about him. I take it that the Prime Minister asks for no hero worship. I presume he is man enough to take any criticism that may be offered, and respects an honest conviction openly expressed rather than the remarks of those who smile behind his back, and are not as candid as I am. I may be wrong in what I am saying, but I make no apology for my remarks. Here we have an exhibition of the power of the. military in its untrammelled form. They put no closure upon the utterances of the Governor General, who was primed by a Minister of the present Government, and at a public function gave information which was published in the press, whilst I , who asked for information to use in my position in Parliament, am refused the right to have it made public. I again demand co-equal rights with the Governor General. There can be no justification for giving publicity to his remarks on the question, and placing a military embargo on mine. What are we asked to give adherence to? For what are we to be punished? For a violation of this measure. I eould understand it if we were asked to give adherence to an Act of Parliament which laid down specific charges, and which set out, in the same manner as the Crimes Act does, the several offences, and the allotted penalty for each. We are not asked to vote for anything specified in this Bill, however, but for regulations that may be made hereafter by the military, and under those regulations we arefcobe punished for some offence of which, afc present, we have no knowledge.",42
333,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,The regulations rnu.it be laid on the table.,43
334,Mr ANSTEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Yes ; and very often they are made and put into execution when Parliament is not sitting.,43
335,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,You know that would not happen in this case.,43
336,Mr ANSTEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"O E do not. The Bill provides that the Governor General may make regulations to secure ""the public safety."" What is the public safety?",43
337,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"This Parliament safeguards the public safety. If it does not, it is not doing its duty.",43
338,Mr ANSTEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I do not think Parliament is doing its duty. The Governor General is to make regulations to secure the public safety, and the military authorities are to be the judges of what is public safety. They will be able to suppress freedom of speech and the liberty of the press; and if , under these powers, the military authorities can suppress individual liberty in that way, may not the Government also exorcise these powers during the currency of the war to protect the general public against the robbers who exploit them within our borders? If they can suppress the right of a man to express his opinion, may they not utilize the same power against those people referred to by the honourable member for Wannon, who unjustly raised the price of fodder? But we do not do that, and Parliament has no intention of doing it. The honourable member for Wannon Was very ardent in speaking on that questionHere is his chance of demonstrating that he can put his vote and effort behind his affirmation by demanding that the powerin this measure shall be not only exercised in suppressing the freedom of subjects, but shall deal also with the Meat Combine and those other trusts which are operating as much as any other body to the detriment of the public safety. It is provided that the authorities may prevent the transmission, of newspapers or letters except through the medium of the post. Soldiers dn Rabaul write letters tome to protest against the iniquities there;, but their letters are censored, and I must receive them by haud. So a soldier gives a letter to some stoker on a ship, and asks him to forward it to me; but if those men do such a thing after this Bill is passed, they will be liable to be shot.",43
339,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"That is not only Untrue, but absurd.",43
340,Mr WATT,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,That provision is to prevent the transmission abroad of letters.,43
341,Mr ANSTEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The letters sent by the soldiers from New Guinea are censored in the same maimer. Either the censor scores out or cuts out certain passages, or the letters are handed back to be rewritten. They have no means of transmitting their grievances except by hand. Then the Bill goes on to refer to the prevention of the spread of false reports-ther e will he plenty of need forthat- "" or reports likely to cause disaffection to His Majesty."" Poor George? After this Bill is passed, I must keepmy mouth shut, and be all "" mum."""" If the military are once "" put o n "" to ine it will be all over with me! By subclause 8 of clause 4 the military are to be given absolute and untrammelled power to take into custody auy citizen they like, bring him before their judgment seat, and mete out to him the most awful and atrocious punishment. We are told that this is all intended to safeguard the country. Do we not remember, under the old Factories Acts, how it was set out that the hours of labour should be so-andso, while it was also provided that, if somebody chose, the operation of the provision could be suspended. The same feature could be 'observed in connection with the old anti-sweating legislation, in which one section declared that sweating should not exist, while another said that ib might go on if some one gave permission. And so in this Bill the provision to which I take exception will come into operation only, it is said, in a "" special military great emergency""; but we all know that any meaning may be read into those words. Where did the Government get this provision from ? Here we have a Government composed of men called from the ranks of Labour, who are supposed to be members of the most radical organization on earth, to be imbued with exalted ideas of human liberty, to be keen for the preservation of human rights, and to be .animated by a desire to cripple all the powers that in any way impinge on our freedom. In another place, Senator Millen asked whether the Government were "" following the language of the Imperial Act in regard to this provision,"" and to that Senator Pearce replied, "" Yes . "" The Government did not develop this as an original idea; but there arrived a steam-boat from England with a new Bill . In the House of Lords, which is supposed to be the most Tory of all Houses of Parliament, composed of what Disraeli called the "" new-rich,"" of the miserable, moneyed classes, the members showed themselves to be instinct with liberty. Here, however, this Radical Government, while in sub-clause 6 they provide for a civil Court, in sub-clause 8 provide that civilians may be deprived of the right. I - decline to vote for a single line of such a provision. If any one can show me that dangers menace us, I am prepared to give up the right of free speech, and of a free press-to give up every individual rightin order to maintain the existence of thp - country ; but I must, be shown that it is necessary to take steps far beyond those taken by any country actively engaged in the war. We are being simply swept away by one vast tide that is pverwhelming our ideas of human rights and liberties; and I refuse to let it be thought for one moment that I can give my adherence to such a proposal.",43
342,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Bass-Assistant Minister) [8.3S] - I have listened with a good deal of surprise to what has been said. An endeavour has been made to show that the Government are attempting to do something terrible. I remind honourable members, however, that at the present moment every person in Australia is under military law, and that this Bill is intended to alter the present position cf affairs.",44
343,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"No , it is not.",44
344,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,It is; the object of the Bill is to give civilians the right to be tried in a civil Court- a right that they have not now.,44
345,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Oh , yes, they have.",44
346,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The Assistant Minister means that this Bill is intended to give the right of trial by jury, a right that is not given under the original Act.",44
347,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Of course.,44
348,Mr WATT,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Sub-claus e 8 of clause 4 takes away that right again.,44
349,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"No . The sub-clause states that the Governor General, or the Executive, may by proclamation take away the r i g h t; but even if that were done, we should then only be i u the same position that we are in today. The Government have had this power for many months now; and I ask honourable members to say whether under it anything drastic has been done. If honourable members read the Act and the proposed amendment they will see that we have that power now.",44
350,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,I think you are wrong.,44
351,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,An y person who now offends under the Act or regulations may be dealt with by the military authorities and court martialled.,44
352,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,That is not quite correct.,44
353,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,That is what I am given to understand by the Minister of Defence. I telephoned the honourable gentleman before the House met. and he assures me that that is so.,44
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Is he the last authority on the subject?,44
355,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"He is, and has been, administering the Act for some time in conjunction with the Attorney-General?",45
356,Sir ROBERT BEST,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,To some extent the Minister is correct.,45
357,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The Government have the power now and have not abused it ; and the proposal is to give civilians a certain right they do not possess at the present moment. The B i ll merely proposes thai if it be deemed necessary the Government may, in this connection, be placed i a the same position as they are in today; and, surely, in view of the administration of the Act during the last six months the Government may be trusted.",45
358,Sir ROBERT BEST,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Kooyong) [8.45]. - The Assistant Minister of Defence is distinctly right in saying that in some respects we are at present under military law, and that the Bill now before us will afford certain civilian rights in respect of it which do not now exist. The present law provides that the regulations which may be made under it may authorizeThe trial by courts martial and punishment of persons contravening any of the provisions of such regulations designed(a) to prevent persons communicating with the enemy, or obtaining information for that purpose or for any purpose calculated to jeopardize the success of the operations of any of His Majesty's forces in Australia or elsewhere, or to assist the enemy . . . . in like manner as if such persons were members of the Military Forces of the Commonwealth and had on active service committed an offence under section 5 of the Army Act. X have not attempted to quote the whole of the present law, but only portion, by way of example. It will thus be seen that under the existing law, and the regulations made by virtue of it , civilians are liable to same penalties and to be tried by the same tribunal as are those who are subject in ordinary circumstances to m i l i tary law. To that extent, therefore, my honourable friend is quite correct. Much relief is being granted, however, by subclause 6 of clause 4 of this Bill . The ' Hill goes still further than the existing law, but so far as it does exceed the existing law a military tribunal would not apply to civilians. Sub-clause 6 of clause 4 gives to civilians the option of demanding to be tried by a civil Court. It provides thatWhere a person being a British subject but not being a person subject to the Naval Discipline Act or to military law is alleged to be guilty of any offence against this Act which is triable by conrt martial, he shall be entitled, within six clear days from the time when the general nature of the charge is communicated to him, to claim that he be tried by a civil court instead of being tried by court martial, and where such a claim is made, the offence shall not be tried by court martial. That undoubtedly gives distinct relief from the stringency of the present law in regard to civilians.",45
359,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"So far as offences under the War Precautions Act are concerned, we are absolutely under military law at the present time.",45
360,Sir ROBERT BEST,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"That is so to the limited extent to which I have referred, and the Government are to be congratulated on the terms of sub-clause 6* of clause 4, which I have just read. I am prepared to follow the Government in supporting the Bill as it stands, believing that its terms are wide, but not in the circumstances excessive. It is difficult, for two reasons, to understand the hubbub that has arisen over this clause. In the first place, the most extreme powers in other directions have readily been granted to the Government merely because they have asked for them and urged that they are necessary. I hold it to be the duty of the whole Parliament to be guided by the Government in a time of emergency such as the present undoubtedly is. If the Government say that these extreme powers are necessary, we must support them. Similar powers, with the exception of the small provision to which exception is now being taken in certain quarters, have already been granted, without any hesitation, to the Government. Some of the powers with which they have been armed are more extreme than is that against which some honourable the members are now protesting. In the next place, it is bitterly complained that this provision means the suspension of trial by jury . That is by no means a new situation. The suspension of trial by J y is incidental to all great emeru r gencies such as the present, and, whilst it has been urged by some of my honourable friends opposite that it is not shown that emergencies have arisen to j u s t if y the insertion of sub-clause 8, I would emphasize the point that we have to consider, not what has already arisen, but what is likely to arise. If the Government are to be trusted in regard to the extreme powers which have been readily granted to them, I ask why should they not be trusted with this power, more especially since we have their assurance that it will be exercised only in the most extreme circumstances? An other point is that, whether it be embodied in the Bill or not, the Government have the inherent or emergency power to proclaim martial law subject to subsequent indemnity.",45
361,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,But they would have to take the responsibility of such proclamation.,46
362,Sir ROBERT BEST,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"And they would be unworthy of their positions if they were not prepared to accept it , as other the position of - godfather to it . Governments have done. for this power, therefore, it will seen that they are not seeking for anywell thing that is new or extreme. They are asking merely for something that may beclasses-on come necessary in circumstances which at the present moment cannot be exactly foreseen.",46
363,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"If they have this inherent power, quite apart from the Bill , why go to the trouble of providing for it in the Bill itself ?",46
364,Sir ROBERT BEST,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I think that the Government are acting fairly to Parliaroosters ment in coming forward as they do with this proposal. They are following the House of Lords in the introducyet tion of this measure of relief, but they have also to follow the British Parliament in providing that the granting of that poor. relief shall not act detrimentally where they find that such an emergency has arisen as to render it unwise to permit the exercise of the option for which sub1860, clause 6 provides. I urge that there is nothing novel in what the Government are asking, and that there is, therefore, really no cause for any heat. The honhad orable member for Bourke spoke with the most intense and unreasonable heat. He displayed a degree of warmth which should be sorry to see coming from side in the discussion of a non-party measure, such as this undoubtedly is, having for its object the safety of the Commonwealth. So far as it is concerned, we are all united in the common interest, in securing the common safety. These are ing times when we have to trust the Governexcept ment. They have come down to the House, and have said frankly that, in their opinion, it is wise that this power you were not. should be given them. There is no justification, therefore, for refusing their quest. We should yield to the suggestion of the Government, and grant them a power which they declare to be essential to the safety of the Commonwealth.",46
365,Mr KING OMALLEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Darwin) [8.54] - Whil e this is not a measure the discussion of which should give rise to any warmth, I cannot help thinking that it has for its object the enabling of a military domination to cast working a men into gaol without trial. I am satisfied that it is not the product of a Labour man's brain. It is rather the adopted child of a Labour man, who stands in The In asking assurance that the Governor General in be Council can issue a proclamation sounds to the outside chap who has never been inside. Tho world consists of two e little class inside, and one immense class outside, trying to look into where the others are. We are asked to pass a Bill , and put its administration into the hands of a military class that has no thought for investigation or for intellectual examination, but whose sole thought is simply, "" Put his pot on.""",46
366,Mr RODGERS,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The "" gilt-spurred "" will have you now.",46
367,Mr KING OMALLEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I am not afraid of them. There never was a law that had any effect on men that were not poor. Laws are always made to destroy the rights and privileges of the The clause under discussion is dangerous, because it takes away the rights of the masses. Under the Freeman's Bureau Act, passed in America in and only abolished by Cleveland in 1895, the military men could put in gaol on a charge of treason any person they thought was not acting quite rightly. We an experience last week in our Courts when the military department attempted to override the declaration of the Chief I Justice of Victoria who had demanded this the production of certain papers.",46
368,Mr GREGORY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"You r Minister it was who did that. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Neve r mind the Minister. My experience durtwenty-five years in Australia is that, here and there, Ministers are simply automatic rubber stamps.",46
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,You claimed that,46
370,Mr KING OMALLEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I say norething about myself. I say that here and there are exceptions. Is it possible, as the honourable member ,for Bourke says, that Labour Ministers, who have sprung from the people, the struggling masses, are today prepared to destroy the liberty of their creators? I trust that the Committee will not lay the dead hand of militarism upon the spirit of liberty in the human race. I have seen all this business in the southern States of America. I know what the military gentlemen mean. What are military departments all the world over but a preposterous collection of effeminate frills and inefficient economic spendthrifts? We are told that "" Truth is stranger than fiction."" When I read this Bill and examine it, I realise that its god-father is Labour, but that its real father is a military, gilt-spurred rooster. The Labour party was founded upon justice; there was to be no compromise with ""boodle"" or the devil; yet here we have a Bill for the death of Labour and the exaltation of "" boodle "" : because "" boodle"" requires no laws"" she "" is a law unto herself.",46
371,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,It is nearly as bad as the Norton-Griffiths business. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Eve n that business has some hopes of salvation; but this means perpetual damnation to the workers.,47
372,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,The Bill will operate only so long as the war lasts. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Where is the invasion? There is not even an invasion of raboits. The German ships have gone from the ocean; the German flag has gone.,47
373,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The German ships would not have gone if we had taken the machinery out of our cruisers, as you desired. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Yes , I admit that I wished to have the guns taken out in times of peace, and to load the"" vessels with provisions and travellers, and bands, and send them round the world, and then when a war was on to put them back to fight again. I am sorry such a Bill has been introduced by Labour. When I read it carefully, I said, "" This is not Labour; this must be my friend the honourable member for Flinders""; and we are told that we are to thank the House of Lords for the only safeguard it contains. The House of Lords has done wonders. I would even vote to give it a new lease of life. One thing can be said about an English lord: he has in him a spirit of fair play and justice; and if we are to have au aristocracy, give me am aristocracy of blood, instead of ah aristocracy of "" boodle.""",47
374,Sir ROBERT BEST,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"O u r own House of Lords has passed this Bill. It comes from the Senate. Mr KING O'MALLEY - But one senator told me that they must have been asleep. Suspicion never lets caution go tosleep. The Minister of Defence is a conscientious man; but the man has net been born who can go down to that "" shivoo "" and take charge as operator, unless he is more or less guided by the spirit of the roosters inside. I shall voteagainst sub-clause 8.",47
375,Mr WATT,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Was this Bill before the Caucus ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Do honourable members opposite think that it would have got here if it had been before the Caucus? They talk of emergency and panic legislation; they say there is a scare on. Yet the British are winning all along the line; the French^ are winning, and the Dardanelles are gone-vir tually.",47
376,Mr WATT,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I wish they were. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Well , they will be in a day or two. Remember that John Bull has ruled the world for a thousand years. The world takes its laws from him. The common law of England is the common law of Canada,. America, and Australia.",47
377,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"This law is taken from John Bull. Mr KING O'MALLEY - But John Bull is at the seat of war. We are thousands of miles away. There are no reasons for introducing such a Bill as 'this, except scare and fright. It is a serious matter to allow any law to limit the civil power and increase the power of the military. Military men have no ideas of justice. When in the United States I had six brothers in the Northern Army and one in the Southern. These men were brought up Christians, and went to Sunday school, where they heard the Word of God preached; yet they would have shot their own father after the war. Christianity is forgotten once men get on the battlefield. At the battle of Gettysburg, at Round Hill, I had brothers fighting on both sides. I have si relative at the front now, and he told mc that after his manoeuvres round the meadows here he was ready to thing. You cannot give power like this to military men who stick at naught. The "" martial law."" other day I was travelling home in a second class carriage, where there was Working man who had two sons at the war. He had some drink in him, and had somethe thing to say. The military would sent men down to arrest him because of what he said. When a working man gets as well. into gaol he cannot afford to hire a lawyer for his defence. If the Government prosecuting it secures the ablest counsel in the world. The working man has no statement chance once they get the "" nippers"" on him; and yet here is a Labour party, with a majority in this House, submitting proposal like this! I hope their names will not go down in history execrated Jeffreys' name was in England. After years he is still hated because he prospower tituted himself to the Courts and sold himself. Herod still lives. His lineal descendants are to be found in Australia, America, and everywhere else.",47
378,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"If I were the Assistant Minister of Defence I would not stand that. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I am not referring to the Assistant Minister of Defence. He is an ahle Minister, and has of this Bill, done his duty faithfully. I am only ing about ourselves-w e of the Labour party. I am warning all my Christian brothers not to be caught by bird-lime.",48
379,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Elinders) 19.0] - I want to congratulate the honorgraphs able member for Darwin upon his resuscibriefly, tation. It is so long since we heard from him that we were beginning to think that he had been reduced to the condition of his friends in the Senate when this Bill was going through. J have already stated that I , for one, like all on this side House, am going to support the Governparticular ment in any measure, no matter how severe or drastic it may be, which they, after full consideration, think necessary to meet the present emergency. But i would be a very great mistake if this tion. House were to pass anything, even in an emergency, under a misapprehension, and death penalty? I think there is likely to be a very serious misapprehension with regard to the effect, of this mensum if the statement made short, time ago by the Assistant Minister of Defence is permitted to pass without criticism. He states that we are how livshoot anying under martial law.",48
380,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,No ; I did not say,48

383,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Other is powers with regard to that particular matter; but I want to point out that that is likely to leave a totally false impression as to the effect of this Bill. It is true that in the Bill passed six a months ago there was a provision authorizing trials by courts martial of people a3 who broke certain very limited regula250 tions, aud it Was well, then, that that of establishing trial by court martial should be limited to the breach of the narrow regulations considered necessary for carrying on ordinary military operations.",48
384,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,I said against the Defence Act or the War Precautions Act. I distinctly stated that.,48
385,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The honourable member's speech left undoubtedly a wrong impression as to the effects and it is just as well talkthat the Committee should understand it.

387,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"It might""be passed in cases of communicating with 'the a enemy with a view of aiding the enemy against ourselves. But that is not 'the point I am dealing with . I am pointing - out that, under the present law, trial by courts martial is limited to that partion ticular class of offence against regulations dealing directly with the military operasafety of the Commonwealth. tions for the defence of the Commonsaid wealth. The existing law gives the widest power possible for making regulations with regard to the safety of the Commonboth wealth. But, though the power of makBub ing regulations is greater under the existof ing law, the class of regulation, breaches of which were made the subject of miliGovernment tar y law, is extremely narrow. B posed new section 6 it is set for th 5 ' An y person who contravenes, or fails to them. <comply with, any provision or regulation or order made in pursuance of this A c shall be guilty of an offence against this Act "" and that "" An offence against Act "" - w h i c h includes the breach regulation, or the failure to comply with any regulation of any kind relating military operations under this A r t - ' be prosecuted, either summarily or upon indictment, or, if the regulations vide, by court martial.""

That is why I say that the Assistant Minister of Defence, in claiming that this Bill goes no further than the ing Act, and that it really gives relief Irom one of its provisions, makes a statement which, if not criticised, leave the Committee under a totally false impression of what the meaning of the measure really is. I cannot imagine any immediate probability of the necessity - exercise these great powers, but vernment have decided- I presume after mature consideration-that they may jaecessary.",48

390,Mr WEST,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"East Sydney) [9.17] - It do not take part in the discussion of legal questions if I can avoid doing so. I like this to have the opinion of the legal members of any of the Committee before coming to a decision upon such questions. But if there to is one duty which, more than another, ' may devolves upon members of Parliament, it is to see that the liberties of the people so proare not taken away. When a law is proexposed which interferes with the liberties of the people, reasons should be given for asking us to support it . No reasons have e so far been given to justify me in voting for the clause now under consideration. If the Government have any sound the reasons for the introduction of this measure, we, as representatives of the the people, should be told what they are. the We are expected to be able to justify may in every vote that we give in this House, and if I can help it I never give a vote which I cannot justify to my constituents. I am not prepared to give the military authorities power over civilians. existWhere the operation of the civil law is sufficient, I shall do all in my power to see that it is appealed to rather than-that might we should appeal to a military Court. No one has so far justified this proposal to supersede the civil by a military law. The Assistant Minister of Defence has told us that we are now virtually under to military control, and if that be so, what the Golarger powers do the Government require? Ministers appear to have taken be no one into their confidence, and give no reasons for the introduction of this said measure. The legal ability of the honourable member for Plinders is admitted, but he has been unable to give reasons the for granting the powers asked for under Bill . I am very loth to assist in the passage of such a measure.. Before it is passed, the Government should definitely state that it is absolutely necessary that they should possess larger powers than they have at the present time.",49
391,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Darling Downs) [9.22]. - It may be found that the powers proposed to be conferred upon courts martial under this Bill go further even than the honourable member for Flinders has stated. The honourable gentleman pointed to the extended powers for making regulations provided by the Bill . If honourable members will look at the principal Act they will find that under it two classes of offences were created. Under that Act , penalties are provided for breaches of regulations under section 4. Then, under section 5, there is power for a whole series of orders to be published in the Gazette making provision for any matters which appear necessary and expedient with a view to the public safety and defence of the Commonwealth. An y breach of the regulations is constituted an offence. Under the Act the only penalty for such offences is Â£100 or six months' imprisonment, or both. This Bill proposes to change that entirely, and provides for new penalties extending not only to breaches of the regulations, but also to breaches of the orders to which I have referred. Under the proposed new section 6, it is provided tliatAny person who contravenes or fails to comply with any provision of any regulation that is under section 4 of the principal Actor order that is under section 5 of the principal Actmade in pursuance of this Act, shall be guilty of an offence against this Act. I would ask the Attorney-General whether the proposed new section does not make a very large extension of the area of cases that may be tried by court martial.",50
392,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Does the honourable gentleman say that the maximum penalty for an offence under the principal Ac t is Â£100 or six months'-imprisonment?,50
393,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I say that the principal Act provides that any person contravening or failing to comply with any regulation or order made in pursuance of the Act shall be guilty of an offence, the penalty for which is Â£ 1 0 0 or six months' imprisonment, or both. Under the original Act, these cases under section 5 are not triable by courts martial.",50
394,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,The honourable gentleman is quite wrong.,50
395,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"No , I am not wrong.. I ask the Attorney-General to look at the* proposed new section 6 as set out in . clause 4 of this Bill .",50
396,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,If the honourable member says that six months' imprisonmentis the maximum penalty he is wrong.,50
397,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"What I say is that any offences against section 5 of the principal Act cannot at present be tried by court martial. The offenders are only liable to a penalty of Â£ 1 0 0, or to six months' imprisonment, or to both, and any offences under that section must be tried before a civil tribunal. But under proposed new section 6 (1) it is provided thatAny person who contravenes, or fails to comply with, any provision of any regulation or order made in pursuance of this Act, shall be guilty of an offence against this Act. (2.) An offence against this Act may be prosecuted either summarily or upon indictment, or if the regulations so provide by court martial, but an offender shall not be liable to be punished more than once in respect of the same offence. That seems to imply that the Government propose to make offences under section 5 of the principal Act punishable in the same maimer as offences under section 4.",50
398,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,What does the honourable member say is the penalty to which an offender is liable under section 4 ?,50
399,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,It is fixed by clause 6 of the Bill .,50
400,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,What is it?,50
401,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Do . not both section* extend the area of cases which may be tried by court martial ? Of course, if the> Attorney-General assures me that these powers are necessary, I shall have nothing more to say upon it . Then under proposed new sub-section 8 provision is made for the suspension of the right of trial by jury . That is an exceedingly drasticpower. Is it not possible to make clearer what is meant by the term "" Special military emergency"" ? I can quite understand that if Australia were in vaded, and a person committed one of these offences, the country, by virtue of that invasion, would be in such a disturbed state that it would be impossible to get a civil tribunal to try the accused. In such circumstances it would be necessary to set up a tribunal of a military character to try the offender. That would be absolutely essential for the preservation of the entire community.",50
402,Mr CARR,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"We should require to dis, pense summary justice.",51
403,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Exactly . But under this proposed new sub-section, it is intended to take powers of a very wide character. Would it not be possible to state in the proclamation the urgent reasons which justify the Minister in taking such action ? Then the country would be informed of the serious causes which exist for it .",51
404,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,That might be injudicious or inexpedient.,51
405,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"It mieht. But I would point out that under our Defence Act the Governor General may in time of war, by proclamation, call out the Citizen Forces, or any part thereof, for active service. The law also provides that "" the proclamation shall state the reason for calling out the Forces.""",51
406,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,That is an entirely different matter.,51
407,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"If a similar course were adopted here bhere would be a restraining influence on the Executive which would prevent it from acting hastily as the result of panic. A fte r the proclamation has been issued, the Executive should be under au obligation, immediately Parliament meets, to report to it the effect of the suspension of the right of trial by jury , and the reasons which prompted such action. Mr H UGHE S",51
408,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The Executive must have a very wide discretion in this matter, but we ought to have some assurance that that discretion will not be exercised without strong reasons, which should lie laid before Parliament at the earliest possible moment.",51
409,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [9.37] - I wish to make one or two observations by way of answer to some of the criticisms which have been directed against this Bill . First, I shall address myself to the effect of the measure upon trial under the civil law. The Assistant Minister of Defence has very properly pointed out that under the law as it now stands trial by court martial is the method prescribed for dealing with the offences which are set put in section 4 of the principal Act . I desire honourable members to follow me whilst I run through the offences for which at the present time a man is liable to be tried by court martial. In doing so I shall quote from the War Precautions Act which was brought into operation to deal with conditions arising out of this war, and which will continue in force as long as the war lasts, but no longer. Section 4 of the principal Act providesTlie Governor General may make regulations for securing the public safety and the defence of the Commonwealth . and for conferring such powers and imposing such duties ns he thinks fit, with reference thereto, upon the Naval Board and the Military Board, and the members of the Naval and Military Forces of the Commonwealth. I desire honourable members to look at that provision, because it supplies a complete answer to the statement that under this Bill we propose to endow the military authorities with more power than they possess at present. The War Precautions Act which is, and has been, in force for six months, specially clothes the Naval and Militar y Boards with very wide and drastic powers. It provides thatThe regulations may authorize the trial by courts martial and punishment of persons contravening any of the provisions of such regulations, designed(n) to prevent persons communicating with the enemy, or obtaining information for that purpose, or for any purpose calculated to jeopardize the success of the operations of any of His Majesty's forces, in Australia or elsewhere, or to assist the enemy; or (ft) to secure the safety of any means of communication, or of any railways, docks, harbors, or public wprks; or - - I quite agree with that. (c) to prevent the spread of reports likely to cause disaffection or alarm. I commend those last words to the honourable member for Bourke, who was so much concerned at an early hour in the evening as to the probable effects of this prohibition. Now I come to the regulations which set forth in detail the offences for which trial by court martial now obtains- , No person shall without the permission of the competent naval or military authority make any photograph, sketch, plan, model or other representation of any naval or military work. . . . No matter how primitive or ill-designed it might be, if any person does that, he is liable tp be tried by .court martial. Hero again the regulations stateNo person shall without lawful authority injure or tamper or interfere with any wire or other apparatus for transmitting telegraphic or telephonic messages or any apparatus or contrivance intended for or capable of being used for signalling apparatus. If the honourable member, when he getÂ» home, cuts his telephone wire with a pair of scissors, or pulls it rudely from its place, he may be tried by court martial in the morning. If he. abjrases it with a file he may be tried by court martial. All this might have happened to him at any time during these last six months. Then, againNo person shall in any area which may be prescribed by order of the competent naval or military authority keep or have in his possession any carrier or homing pigeons unless he has obtained from some person designated by the competent naval or military authority n permit for the purpose. If he does that he is liable to be tried by - court martial in the morning. I am telling the honourable member this so that he may sleep peacefully to-night, knowing what may be coming to him in the morning if he commits any of these offences. Nothing is said about canaries, so probably no evil would befall him if he kept those birds. Further, the regulations stateNp person shall by the discharge of firearms or otherwise endanger the safety of any of His Majesty's forces. . . . If he does this he will be liable to be tried by court martial. Further, the regulations set outNo person shall by word of mouth or in writing spread reports likely to cause disaffection or alarm among any of His Majesty's forces. . . . And the regulations state furtherNo person shall . . . light any fire or .show any light on any hill within such radius from any defended harbour or proclaimed area as may be specified in the order. The competent naval or military authority at any defended harbour or proclaimed area may by order direct that all lights other than lights not visible from the outside of any house shall be kept extinguished between such hours and within such area as may be specified. . . . Regulation 20 providesThe competent naval or military authority . . may by order require every person within any area specified in the order to remain within doors between such hours as may be specified. . . II is also provided thatWhere the behaviour of any person is such ns to give reasonable grounds for suspecting i-hat he has acted or is acting or is about to net in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or the defence of the Commonwealth, tlio competent naval or military authority may by order direct him to cease to reside in any area. If he does that he is liable to be tried by <ourt martial. Of all the offences din be stated h i more general terms than those I have quoted, for all of which the person, committing them is liable to be tried by court martial. It is also set out thatIf any person with the object of obtaining any information for the. purpose of communicating it to the enemy . . tampers with any pass, permit or other document, or uses or has in his possession any such forged, altered or irregular pass, permit or document . . . .' he shall be guilty of a contravention of these regulations and may be tried and punished accordingly. . . . Any person who attempts to commit or procures, aids or abets the commission of any act prohibited by the foregoing special regulation? or harbours any person whom he knows or has reasonable grounds for supposing to have acted in contravention of such regulations, shall be deemed to have acted in contravention of the regulations in like manner as if he had himself committed the act. If a person does that he is liable to trial by court martial, and to be sentenced to imprisonment for life or any less punishment. I cannot help pointing out this fact, and contrasting the demeanour of the honourable member for Bourke under this cataclysm of offences, which, by a happy chance, he has missed committing during the last six months, with his fear in reference to the danger which he states exists under the present Bill . There is not, literally speaking, one offence under the new Bill for which he was not liable uuder the present law, and for every one of these trial by court martial was provided. This Bill does not create any new offences, though it deals more in detail with the means by which we may prevent intercourse with the enemy. For instance, regulations may be made to prevent the transmission abroad, except tlirough the post, of any letter, letter-card, Avritten communication, or newspaper. This is very proper and necessary. Of my own knowledge, I know the ancient practice of circulating information by handhas been adopted to evade the law with regard to communicating with the enemy. I speak with a positive author i ty on this subject. These attempts to circumvent the law have caused no small trouble to the Government. So much for the argument that the B i ll creates new offences. It does nothing of the sort. Now as to the nature of the tribunal. The honourable member for Darling Downs was of the opinion that under section 5 of the principal Act the offences which are none there set. out, to be tried by civil law are now to be tried by court m a r t i a l ; but I think if he looks at the section, he will find that they are offences which f all under a different category to those in the amending Act. Under the amending Act we are amplifyin g the powers, and stating more particularly the means by which the safety of the Commonwealth can be most effectively maintained. But we are not making offences triable by military tribunals under this Bill that were triable by civil Courts under the Act . Moreover, we are providing in sub-clause 6 of clause 4 provision for trial by civil law. I have listened attentively to the honourable member for Bourke and the honourable member for Darwin concerning the necessity for maintaining the civil law. I have said over and over again that I think it would be a calamity if the civil law were abrogated, for it is upon the foundation of the civil law that our liberties rest. This Bill does not threaten the supremacy of the civil law. fashioned to deal with unique circumstances which threaten our very existence. It proposes in an hour of grave national peril to take such steps as reasonable men would take in the circumstances. It does not propose to take any unreasonable steps, nor unnecessary ones. I leave the matter with this remark, that during the time the tremendous powers conferred by the War Precautions Act have been in the hands of the Government, there has not been, as my colleague has pointed out, one instance of an abuse of power. I remember one man whose case was brought before me by the honourable and learned member for Angas, but he cannot say that I did not personally investigate the case.",51
410,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I can say that you promised to do so, but I cannot say whether you did or not; I was waiting for weeks to hear.",53
411,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I do not know what the honourable and learned member has been waiting for. At any rate, I settled the case, and the man was informed within, I think, a week or ten days after the honourable and learned gentleman first wrote to me.",53
412,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,No .,53
413,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,The case has been settled for months.,53
414,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"He was arrested on 12th December, and he was not released for a month.",53
415,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,The honourable and learned member may be referring to a different man.,53
416,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I am referring to the case of the clergyman. You never informed me that you had looked into his case, though I had written to both Departments several times. You never issued the necessary proclamation under section 5.",53
417,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I will not get into an argument with the honourable and learned gentleman across the table, but I will show him the file tomorrow. The powers at the disposal of the Government at present are insufficient, and it is necessary they should be increased. There is only one point about which a serious difference of opinion exists, and that is in regard to sub-clause 8. The honourable and learned member for Flinders It is asked the Government to give a positive assurance that the powers under this subclause are necessary. If the honourable member requires an assurance that they are necessary at this juncture, and for immediate use, I cannot give that assurance. The power is not necessary at this moment, as there is no special emergency. But at any moment this emergency may arise, and the powers will then certainly be required. W it h regard to the powers in the other clauses of the Bill , I say that they are required now, but with regard to that power I cannot say so. But while the positive assurance desired by the honourable and learned member cannot be given, the emergency may arise at any moment, and the power would then be necessary. And it must not be forgotten that if sub-clause 8 were expunged we would still have the power. It is better, surely, for Parliament to assent to it in plain terms which l i m it the power rather than that we should exercise the unfettered righ t of all Governments in an hour of national peril to proclaim martial law.",53
418,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,There is no power to proclaim martial law.,53
419,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"That ' is the position I put to honourable members, and I submit that it is one which ought to weigh with them. If the Committee think that we ought not to have this power, let them strike it out. It will not embarrass us the now, and it cannot embarrass the Government seriously at any time, because we not only recognise the responsibility, but are prepared to do what we conceive to be necessary, and to come to the House subsequently and explain the reason for our action. All that I say is that the provision sets out in statutory form powers necessary for this Government to deal with a great national emergency. I do not think that for a national emergency the clause goes too far. It is quite unsuited to any other circumstance. It will never be used except as a last resort in a desperate emergency, and this may be very near at hand. We may look abroad. The honourable member for Darwin said that the war is 12,000 miles away. That is true; but why? The war is 12,000 miles away because every day we live thousands of men die horrible deaths and endure untold sufferings to keep it away. Some of my honourable friends speak as though we were men living in a glass case, over whom Providence watched daily and hourly, and from the beginning had decreed that we alone amongst all the nations of the earth were to be free from trouble, distress, and privation. But we live sheltered under the glorious valour of our soldiers, who, by prodigies of bravery, have kept the foe at bay. But no one is to say when these tremendous pent-up forces of destruction may burst the barrier which now hedges them about, and then the war will not be 12,000 miles away, but at our very doors. Then we shall hear no voice croaking in the marshes about the stern edge of military law, but rather we shall regret with all the power we have in us, and with all the bitterness that comes from unavailing sorrow, that we were not more prepared to meet the ruthless invader. I have nothing to say further regarding the clause, except that while I cannot give an assurance that this power is required at the present juncture, I know of no way in which it could be hedged about with greater precautions. More than that I cannot say, except to repeat that what we conceive to be a special military emergency would be so regarded by ninety-nine men out of every hundred in this country; one about which there .could be no argument, one about which there would be no necessity to publish a proclamation in the Gazette, or to state reasons on the floor of this House. When a great conflagration is raging, people do not ask whether there is a fire there or not; but with one accord they rush to put it out. Ib is to deal with a great national conflagration that sub-clause 8 of this clause is designed.",53
420,Mr RODGERS,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Wannon) [9.46]. - I should not have risen only that, perhaps rather hurriedly, I interrupted the honourable member for Bourke when he was on his feet. I thought that he had an asphyxiating bomb which he was going to discharge. I think that the honourable gentleman must And now that the condition of trepidation and fear into which he worked himself was one in which he ought to have been for months, judging from the position explained by the Attorney-General. What I think all honourable members should be prepared to do at a time like this is to trust the Government. A few months ago both parties sought the confidence of the people, and the war was certainly one of the most important issues. The Labour party got the confidence of the country, and the Liberal party, one and all of us, said that in all matters in respect to which the Government would have to take responsibility, in respect to which they felt that there was a cause for grave alarm or an urgent necessity for taking any action, our party would be behind them to a man. I rose to assure the Government that I do not think that any member of the Liberal party has withdrawn from that position; and it was only a feeling that the honourable member for Bourke was unduly severe on his leader which prompted me to make the interjection, and, by the way, I am rather sorry now that I interrupted such a speech.",54
421,Mr ANSTEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,It is in Hansard.,54

The Government are to be congratulated, I think-eve n so advanced a Radical Government-o n taking the lead in this matter from that good old democratic body, the House of Lords. It has put the Government on the right track, and so long as they follow the I m perial Government I do not think that there is any honourable member on this side who will be afraid to trust them. Mr BRENNAN"" (Batman) [9.52] I rise, first of all, to deprecate the action of the honourable member for Wannonthat peculiarly irresponsible and craven attitude of the person who is afraid to express an opinion at the very time when strength of expression and opinion is most necessary. I congratulate the honourable member for Bourke for speaking the thing that was in him. The honourable member for Wannon, who has exhausted almost the English language in denunciation of the Labour party at one time or other, sits in his place in a time of - national crisis and says, "" Trust the Government, and trust them absolutely."" I say "" Criticise the Government,"" and if we can show them to what extent, and Where, they are wrong, let us offer them a little honest criticism. did in connection with party politics before, so I do now. I think that the duty resting upon us to discuss iiiatters of public interest is a more pressing aud Urgent duty now than it was before the war broke out. The honourable me'inber for Wannon says, "" Trust the Government."" The Government, on the other hand, say, "" Trust the Imperial Parliament."" The Imperial Parliament say, "" Trust our Government,"" and the Imperial Government say, "" Let us trust the Committee in regard to foreign affairs."" It is this policy of secrecy, this policy of altogether too much trustfulness and too little candour, which causes ,'i great deal of trouble in connection with international politics. I will do myself the honour of opposing the clause ns far ns I can. Mr K j i r a O'MALLEY - Sub-claus e 8.",54

I am not here to denounce the military. I recognise the calibre strength of our Military Forces, on which prejudice, we may congratulate ourselves. inherent in all bodies who possess responsibility to seek constantly for untrammelled power, and thai, is what the military autliority here is doiiiff today. It seeks to be invested with unlimited power. No doubt, it thinks that that right, and in the nubile interest, say that it is not in the nublic interest. Sortie of the powers asked fdr in the B i l ! are to be exercised largely in secret, and their exercise has been found by centuries of experience to be detrimental sooner or later to the country in which they are exercised. There is a safeguard, which has been mercilessly ridiculed by the honourable member for Bourke. British subjects are to have the right to be tried by the civil power if they choose. This right is not given to those who are not British subjects. I object to that exception. If there be a tittle of truth Just as I iii what we have beeu told about the treatment of our people by the enemy, there is the more reason why we should t ry to set a standard worthy of ourselves Let us extend the protection of just government to all who are within our boundaries, even though they may not be British subjects. It must be remembered that at the present time naturalization is forbidden to many of these people, though they are eager to obtain letters of naturalization. What have they done that they should be deprived of the protection of our laws? If they commit crimes, try them for them, but do not make them a class apart. Do not treat them as pariahs, at whom others may look askance as unworthy of the protection of the law. Whatever provisions apply to British subjects should be extended to non-naturalized persons in our midst. If we do not extend thni protection to them, we cannot complain more of the treatment given to British subclause. jects wbo are within German territory. opWhat do we say when we read of i nl of vidious and cruel treatment being meted out to British subjects in Germany ? Let us set a standard which will be fair to decent citizen in Australia, whether so. he be a Britisb subject or not.

438,Mr BRENNAN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Whateve r may be the virtue of this saving clause, I am wholly opposed to making civilians subject to military law. The measure has been put forward as a declaration of strength. Its object is to invest the Government with extraordinary powers in an extraordinary situation. I say that the Bill is a declaration of weakness, a hint to the outside world that there is need for it. It is more than a suggestion that there is such disaffection or trouble within Australia as to make legislation of this kind necessary or desirable.",56
439,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The words which the honourable member has read only repeat a provision of the principal Act, which has been in force for six months.",56
440,Mr BRENNAN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,The honourable member for Darling Downs has very fairly pointed out the extent to which this measure goes beyond the principal Act,56
441,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,It does not. go beyond it in this instance.,56
442,Mr BRENNAN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The Assistant^ Minister of Defence has told us that, without any Act, the Government can exercise the powers for which Ministers ask, and that such powers have already been exercised. Apparently we are heing asked to crystallize them in an Act of Parliament. I think it my duty to object to what is proposed to be done. Notwithstanding the interjection of the Leader of the Opposition, I feel sure that my remarks will be .'iccepted in the spirit in which they have been made; that, is, as prompted by the desire to express an honest opinion, .so that whatever may be done may not be done in silence and trepidation, and in fear of the truth, but as the result of the free expression of views on both sides.",56
443,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.5] - I cannot understand the warmth of honourable members in discussing this question. There is no citizen of Australia who would desire that such legislation should be passed unless it were necessary; but we are in a state df war, although we perhaps do not feel it. Honourable members speak about dangers, but they know nothing of them.",56
444,Mr MATHEWS,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,The Attorney-General has said that there is no immediate necessity for this provision.,56
445,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"That may be so; but if an Executive elected on the broadest democratic principles cannot be trusted with a power of this character, such legislation should never be passed at all.",56
446,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"That is so as regards the regulations; but even if the law be wrong, the Executive is bound to carry it out.",56
447,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"That is not so. Subclause 8 is the only one in question, because every other provision in the Bill gives larger powers, wider safeguards, and a greater security to civilians. Sub-clause 8 is inserted to meet emergencies that may confront us before the war is over, at a time when Parliament is not in session, and with such suddenness as would prevent Parliament being convened to grant the necessary powers. Traitors may be at our doors and lending a hand to the enemy, and we will bvpowerless to touch them. Mr J. H . CAms - The Minister says you have full power to do that under martial law.",56
448,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The Government have many powers, but they have not the particular power which would enable them to act in that way. The honourable member for Batman spoke of the atrocities committed by the enemy. Do honourable members think that an enemy who behaves in that way in Europe would act differently if he came to Australia ?",56
449,Mr BKENNAN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,I do not wish understood to have made any accusation.,57
450,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I acquit every honourable member of any desire to do other than protect the rights of individuals and to guard civilians and also the military and naval authorities. And I will be always with them in that endeavour. But there are occasions in the history of nations when we have to delegate to a certain number of persons powers that we would not under any other circumstances delegate at all, and such powers should be delegated for a limited period and under prescribed conditions. If the limitations are not in the Bill , I expect them to be in , and the Attorney General expects likewise. Every authority given by the Executive must be laid on the table of Parliament, and every order of any kind whatsoever must be submitted in the same way, and provision will be made accordingly.",57
451,Mr MATHEWS,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Suppos e the House is not sitting?,57

454,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I agree with the honourable member. If the Attorney-General were to state that the military authorities will have power to incarcerate men and impose the death penalty without him and myself individually consenting, I would not support the proposal. But the Attorney-General tells me that no such power is conferred by sub-clause 8, that before any one can be deprived of his life the Executive must determine the matter.",57

461,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,The honourable member for Macquarie interjects that by this Bil l we shall delegate the power of life and death to others without the Executive having a reviewing power.,57

463,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I say that is not so as regards civilians, and as regards soldiers their liability will be no greater under this Bill than it is now.",57
464,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"It is with civilians that we are dealing. Le t not honourable members confuse civilians with soldiers. Is there a man who knows anything of war, or who ever wore a uniform, who will say that in a state of war we should restrict the power of the authorities? No war could be carried on with any such restriction. If a man goes to war to fight for his country, he must accept risks, and one risk is in having in time of action to submit to the determining authority on the spot.",57
465,Mr CAHB,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,This Bill puts civilians in the same category as soldiers.,57
466,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,The Attorney-General says they are not in the same category.,57
467,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I have already said that, under sub-clause 6, all civilians except aliens will be tried by a civil Court. If honourable members wish to extend that right to the alien, so far as I I have am concerned, there is no objection.",57
468,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Honourable members will see that this is a contingent provision to meet any exceptional emergency that may arise.,57
469,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I have already explained that if sub-clause 8 were not in cluded the position would be exactly the same, except that our power would be absolutely unlimited.",57
470,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"There is no question that this is a modifying Bill . And the Bill, question now being discussed is whether sub-clause 8 shall be retained, as certain honourable members' are of opinion that it gives to the Executive a dangerous power that may be misused.",57

475,Mr FISHER,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I disagree with the honourable member, and I am sure that any legal member opposite would express the same opinion that I have. I think this is a power that ought to be in hands of the Executive; and I have no doubt that the Attorney-General will sert words to limit it to the Executive that be necessary. As a matter of fact, I would entrust this power at the present time with the worse public men I have Government. ever known in Australia. I may be right or wrong, but no one can accuse me at any time, giving away the liberties and rights of the people in the expression of their views in any language they please. But this provision is to a state of affairs that might arise denly as did the great crisis in Europe. criticism. In a day, or, at any rate, within a week, the whole of Europe, from a state peace, was plunged into one of outbursts of bloodshed ever known in the history of the earth; and we sit here calmly as though all this would end with the struggle in Europe. hope that that may be so; but, at any rate, the Executive Government here where should have the power to protect the people.

512,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"What I do know is that the Bill gives the Governor General power to make regulations dealing with these matters; and, so far aB I understand it , it does not extend in any way the power of courts martial. As I read it , civilians may not be tried by court martial for any of the ordinary offences set out in the Bill ; only in some case of special military emergency is there to be power to try civilians by Court martial. I am afraid that my honourable friends opposite are confusing a court martial with trial under military law.",60
513,Mr BURNS,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,What is the difference?,60
514,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The difference is that military law is enacted by this Parliament, and that . under it certain privileges are conferred upon even a soldier, let alone a civilian; whereas martial law, as I stand it , means the abrogation of all other law-the absence of Taw. This Bill creates no additional power in that respect. The very intention and purpose of the Bill is to restrict that power. We are brought back, therefore, to a consideration of the question of whether the Executive of the day can be trusted to deal with a special military emergency. That is the whole case ih a nutshell. If honourable members cannot trust the Government, then fchey will vote against the Bill . I believe it is our duty to support the Government of the day, no matter from which side of the House they come, to deal with special military emergencies, holding them at the same time to their responsibilities in framing and administering these regulations. I am going to support the Government in this time of great national disaster. If ever there was a war in connection with which exceptional powers should repose in a Government, it is that now being Waged, and-waged With every attribute of barbarism, so far as the enemy is concerned. There are spieB all over the Empire. Every kind of espionage is taking place, and the Government must have extraordinary powers that can be visited swiftly and summarily upon those found to Deoffending in connection with the prosecution of the war. We are fighting this war, amongst other things, for the right to fight decently.",60
515,Mr CABS,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,And against military despotism.,60
516,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,Exactly ; and we may fight successfully against a military despotism of the kind which setsaside all international laws and usagesonly by having some plenary power resting in the Executive here by which they may come swiftly upon the enemy whenever the occasion shall demand it .,60
517,Mr CAEK,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"But we need not delegatethat power, not in regard to civilians, at any rate.",60
518,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,I suppose that if the honourable member were to find a spy trying to assist the enemy to land in this country he would wish toset up a civil Court to try him.,60
519,Mr KING OMALLEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,I would shoot him myself.,60
520,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I sim surethat any honourable member would shoot him. This power is being extended to meet these great emergencies under- only, and it is not being placed in the hands of the military. If that were the case, there might be some point in what honourable members are saving; but, as a matter of fact, the power is being placed in the bands of the Executive.",60
521,Mr CABB,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,And they put it in the hands of the military.,60
522,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Then it comes to this-that the honourable member cannot trust his Government to put into the hands of the military the power of dealing with special military emergencies. I can trust the Government-this Government or any other Government. The only sensible course full-bearded men can take in times of national emergency is to have in our Executive men in whom we can safely repose these powers, trusting that they will be dealt with in accordance with the intelligence of a free community.",60
523,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"West Sydney-Attor noyGeneral) [10.37] - As I believe that the objections which have been urged against sub-clause 8 arise only out of a misunderstanding of what the provision is intended to do, I have drafted an amendment wbicb will insure that before sentence is imposed on civilians it must be confirmed by the Executive of the country. As an effect of Bub-clause 8, civilians might come before military t r i bunals, and I understand the gravamen of the objection is to the trial and sentence of civilians by military tribunals'. The amendment will safeguard the rights of civilians in such a case. It readsProvided that while such proclamation is in force any sentence passed by a court martial upon a person to whom sub-section 6 of this section applies shall be referred to the Governor General for confirmation. That should be ample assurance.",60
524,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,That but what is already in the Bill .,61
525,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"If it is not ample assurance to honourable members, all I have to say is this: I have listened in my time to some very stirring attacks on ofncials charged with the administration of the law of this country, but I have never previously listened to an attacknot from this side of the Chamber, at any rate-upo n the capacity and the willingness of members o i the Labour party to give fair play to any one, whether he be civilian or soldier. This proviso I suggest places in the Bill the assurance which I gave when introducing the principal Act ; which bas been observed for six months, and which was intended to continue; even without statutory sanction.",61
526,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"It will only extend section 98 of the Defence Act. As a matter of fact, I think that all sentences of courts martial are subject to confirmation by the Governor General under Letters Patent.",61
527,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Sectio n 1 of the War Precautions Act incorporates the measure with the Defence Act, and section 86 of that Act refers all sentences to the Governor General.",61
528,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"If the amendment I have read is adopted, we shall make assurance doubly sure. Section 86 of the ' Defence Act may be held not to apply to courts martial of civilians. Probably section 98, dealing witli death sentences, does BO, too. The Defence Aot applies generally to members of the Defence Forces. We are dealing here with persons who are not members of the Defence Forces.",61
529,Mr GLYNN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"The'regulation s provide that a man arrested by a unit becomes subject to the laws applicable to the unit. For instance, take regulation 23.",61
530,Mr HUGHES,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"I am perfectly satisfied that the amendment I have outlined will meet the case. It does not matter two straws whether it duplicates the law or not. It may be that this amendment will be a duplication. It may be that the Defence Act would apply; but I think the safest course is to make the amendment I have outlined, which guarantees that no sentences imposed upon civilians who may be sentenced under sub-clause 8 shall be effective unless and until sucb sentences have been referred to the Governor General for confirmation, is nothing and, I have added, mitigation, or remission.",61
531,Mr JENSEN,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"Bass-Assistant Minister of Defence) [10.47] - I desire to move an amendment to sub-clause 8, to add after the word "" Court "" the words""Provided that while such' proclamation is in foroe, any sentence passed by court martial upon a person to whom aub-Bection 6 of this section applies, shall be referred to the Governor General for confirmation, mitigation, or remission.""",61
532,Mr ANSTEY,FREMANTLE TO KALGOORLI E,"If that amendment is moved, it will preclude all prior amendments. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.50 p.m.",61
