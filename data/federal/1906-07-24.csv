1,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister representing the Postmaster General, whether the Postmaster-General, before agreeing to the terms of the mail contract, took steps to obtain from Sir James Laing and Sons, Limited', an authoritative extract minute from their official minute book, giv. ing the precise wording of the authority delegated to Mr Croker to sign the contract on behalf of the firm?",13
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That course was unManoeuvres, necessary. A contract was signed by vitation ? Mr Croker, whom we hold liable. He has given us an undertaking that it will be confirmed by his principals, cipals have deposited a bank guarantee in Commonwealth ? London.",14
3,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Hav e we day, the assurance of the Prime Minister that the tonnage of the steamers set contract is net registered tonnage, ar.d not gross tonnage, or tonnage under deck ?",14
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It is registered tonnage. Those are the words used in the contract.,14
5,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Is the Prime Minister satisfied that those words sequently, mean net registered tonnage, that is, the time to enable tonnage inscribed on the hatchway of a but vessel ? There is a gross registered tonnage as well as a net registered tonnage.",14

7,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon notice Whether he will postpone the contemplated alteration in the use of khaki for military clothing until Parliament has an opportunity of considering the question oh the Estimates?",14
8,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The answer to the honourable and learned member's question is as follows :The decision of the Military Board relative to uniform promulgated for the information and guidance of Commandants as far back as November, 1905, was that Commanding Officers who so desired could retain the f u l r dress in use prior to Federation, but must adopt the khaki uniDALE) proposedform for service, ordinary parades, camps, &c. The Board does not know what action has been taken by Commanding Officers of corps, who desire to revert to the old full dress uniform, but inquiries are being made with a view to obtaining full particulars. When these particulars have been received, the whole matter will receive the Minister's consideration, and a definite reply to the honourable member's question will be given. RETURN OF CAPTAI N CRESWELL.",14
9,Mr EWING,Unknown,"On F r i d a y last, the honourable member for We n t w o r t h aslked the following questions:1 - Is it not a fact that Captain Creswell went to England to gain for the Government "" the latest information regarding naval development "" ? 2. Is it not a Lict that Captain Creswell was invited while in England to attend the Naval held last month? 3. Is it not a fact that he accepted this in4. It it not n fnct that he afterwards returned tD Australia without availing himself of this and the prinperience,opportunity unique of gaining actual sea exvaluable alike to himself and to the 5. Is it a fact, as stated in the House yester. that he so returned without Ministerial sanction ? 6. If so, what explanation is offered for this down in the unexpected return? I am now in a position to supply the information asked for, the answers being as follow:1. Yes; but to leave England on his return so as to be back in Melbourne early in June. Subthe Minister granted an extension of him to attend the manoeuvres, to return to Australia immediately after. ' 2 and 3. No. Of his own volition, Captaia Creswell, on the 29th of May, applied through the Colonial Office for permission to attend the Permission was not granted by the Admiralty until the 8th June (the eve of the manoeuvres), when he was informed that he could join the cruiser SutUj. This vessel was compelled to return to port two days after staiting to undergo extensive repairs. 4. Captain Creswell did not avail himself of the permission granted, but returned to Australia. 5. Ministerial sanction to return to Australia is accordance with his original instructions was not necessary. 6. Captain Creswell explains that he decided to return in accordance with his original instructions in consequence of the nature of certain confidential information which he received from the Colonial Office on the 8th June, and also the fnct that the cabled permission to remain for' the manoeuvres indicated that his early return was desirable.

10,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I oppose the motion.,14
11,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I desire to move two amendments.,15
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"As the honourable and {earned member for Corio has intimated that he opposes the motion, it must be set down for another day. Notice of the amendments which the honourable member proposes to move will, if handed in, appear on the business-paper.",15
13,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Must I give notice of them now, or will it be enough to hand them to the Clerk?",15
14,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The time for giving notices of motion in the ordinary way expired when I called on the business of the day. Mr DEAKIN laid upon the table the following paper :Correspondence between the Prime Minister and the Premier of South Australia relative to the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth. MAI L SERVICE TO EUROPE. Debate resumed from 18th July (vide page 1457), on motion by Mr AUSTIN CHAPMANThat this House approves the agreement made and entered into on the 7th day of July, 1906, between the Postmaster-General, in and for the Commonwealth, and Sir James Laing and Sons, Limited, for the carriage of mails between Adelaide and Brindisi. Upon which Mr THOMAS had moved, by way of amendment That all the words after the word ""House"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" is of opinion that, in the best interests of the Commonwealth, the Government should purchase and control a fleet of mail steamers capable of maintaining a fortnightly mail service between Australia and Great Britain.""",15
15,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [2.39] - I regret that, owing to the manipulation of the ibusiness-paper, I must address myself to this motion after scarcely any preparation beyond a cursory glance through the conditions of the contract. I had expected to obtain a little time this afternoon for the putting of my thoughts into something like proper order while the motion for the partial suspension of standing order 241 was being discussed, and the second readinig of the Bounties Bill was being moved by the Minister of Trade and Customs. With regard to the proposed mail contract, I have arrived at the conclusion that there is nothing for us to do but to criticise its terms, and point out its shortcomings, and leave the Government to bear the ultimate responsibility. In the absence of full information, we do not know whether or not to approve of the contract. In the light of what has been disclosed, however, I say at once that - if the Government can establish the new service under the conditions set out in the contract, they will make an excellent bargain for the Commonwealth. Anything that shortens the distance between London and Adelaide is of the very essence of reform, and if the Government can, for the sum mentioned in the contract, bring us forty-eight hours nearer to London they will accomplish a very good stroke of business. PAPER. I do not anticipate that the service will be shortened by the further twenty-four houra provided for in the contract, because the agreement is so loosely drafted that apparently it will be entirely optional with the contractor to effect that improvement. The first thing that strikes me is the agencythrough which this business has been conducted in Australia. I find that the contract is signed by "" W . H . Croker."" I have not the pleasure of that gentleman's acquaintance, and I do not know whether he is identical with the barrister who represented the Victorian Government at the inquiry conducted by the Butter Commission, and received fees of so respectable a character. If he be the same Mr Croker. I presume that he is a very able man of business - At any rate, I take it that the Government have satisfied themselves upon that point. I notice that he has signed the contract as the agent of Sir James Laing and Sons, and that he has also attached his name as the representative of the contractors. At page n he has signed "" W. H . Croker, for the contractors,"" whereas on page 4 he has signed ""by their agent, W. H . Croker."" Although the contract requires that certain' things shall be done by the contractors or their attorney, nothing is said as to the possession by Mr Croker of anv power of attorney. In clause 41, for instance, it is provided that certain things, shall be' done "" by the contractor or his attorney."" In that particular case reference is made to arbitration, but apart from that matter altogether, the contract clearly sets forth that the contractor "" or his attorney "" shall be one of the parties to the agreement ; whereas there is no mention of the attorney when the contract comes to be finally settled and signed. I do not know whether the Minister has satisfied himself as to the propriety of Mr Croker signing in two different capacities, and in neither instance in the terms set out in the conditions of contract.",15
16,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Has not the contract been approved of by the Crown Solicitor?,16
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should think so; because he has signed as one of the witnesses. J hope, however, that my honourable 'friend does not think that I am doing anything out of the way in asking for a little information. 1",16
18,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I think that the honourable member is debating a purely legal question.,16
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I think so too, but I do not think that there is anything to prevent me from adopting that course.",16
20,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Nothin g at all, except the uselessness of it.",16
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have merely asked for information in a respectful way, and I hope that the honourable member will cease his impertinent interjections.",16
22,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"If the honourable member thinks they are impertinent, I shall cease them.",16
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Notwithstand ing the fact that the contract has been approved of by the Crown Solicitor, we may well ask why, in executing the contract, a departure has been' made from the conditions set forth. The matter is not of such small concern as the remarks of the honourable member for Cooleardie would seem to indicate, because we know absolutely nothing about the people who are behind, or with, Sir James Laing and Sons in the carrying out of the contract.",16
24,Mr EWING,Unknown,Si r James Laing and Sons are strong enough to stand by themselves.,16
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"So far as I can ascertain, they have never yet built any mail steamers-it is not their line of business. They have confined their operations to the building of sailing ships and tramp steamers.",16
26,Mr EWING,Unknown,They have built some vessels for the Roval Navv.,16
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The v have not built a single mail-boat of the description indicated in the contract, and, therefore, I think that the Government should have completely satisfied themselves as to their abilitv to fulfil the agreement. they have done so, and if so, what harm could have been done by their telling us all about the arrangements entered into by the company for building the steamers.",16
28,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Did we ever know whowas behind the Orient Steam Navigation Company, excepting Messrs. Anderson,. Anderson and Company ?",16
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The affairs of the Orient Steam Navigation Company as a public company have always been open to the fullest investigation, so far as weknow.",16
30,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Yes , but in the first instance we knew of them only as a proprietary concern. Mr ""JOSEPH COOK - I would point out that there is a great distinction betweenSir James Laing and Sons and the Orient and Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation companies, which are very old concerns.",16
31,Mr WATSON,Unknown,There was a wide difference between the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company and the Orient Company.,16
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"When we made contracts with those companies, we knew that they had fleets of steamers running.",16
33,Mr WATSON,Unknown,When we made the first contract with the Orient Steam Navigation* Company they had no fleet of steamers in operation-the y had to hire vessels.,16
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is the honourable member quite clear about that ?,16
35,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I am so informed.,16
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"This firm has f not constructed a single vessel which is suitable for a mail steamer. Therefore, we are entitled to ask the Government whether they have satisfied themselves of thecapacity of Sir James Laing and Sons tobuild boats of this description, and, if so, what guarantee they have of their bona fides? I am informed that they have never constructed a vessel of this character-the y have not gone into that kind of business at all. Of course this contract may furnish them with the necessary opening. Probably it will. They may have secured this contract at the value of the option mentioned with a view to taking it upon the market and thus obtaining the requisite capital with which to launch out into this new ship-building enterprise. If so, I would not doubt their capacity to carry out the undertaking, but I do think that the Government' should have satisI dare say fied_ themselves as to whether the contractors intend to proceed upon those lines. I fail to see why they should not tell the House all that they know of the bona fides of this firm, and of their ability to - carry out the contract.",16
37,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Assumin g that the Government investigation were not satisfactory, what would the honourable member - suggest ?",17
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I would suggest that we 'should adhere to the present contract until we can get a better one. I should think that that would be obvious to the honourable member. * If Sir James Laing and Sons can carry out this undertaking and provide us with a forty-eight hours quicker service to London, the Government will have made a very excellent 'bargain for the Commonwealth. not desire to-place any obstacle in the way - of achieving that result, but I do say that in return we are entitled to know whether this contract is in the nature of a pure speculation or not, and what proof can be supplied of the bona fides of Sir James 'Laing and Sons as mail contractors. findj from the papers which have been placed in the hands of honourable members, - that at least eight boats of 11,000 tons register will require to be constructed to give - effect to the undertaking. The Prime Minister has declared that this registered tonnage means exactly what it says. But I wish to again ask whether it' means net tonnage or gross tonnage, because there is all the difference in the world between the two things.",17
39,Mr WATSON,Unknown,-Registere d tonnage is nearly always interpreted to mean gross tonnage. Mr. JOSEPH'COOK - I am informed by the honourable member for North Sydney that both net and gross tonnage are - registered tonnage.,17
40,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Wheneve r we hear a vessel of 11,000 or 12,000 tons spoken of, it nearly always means gross tonnage.",17
41,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I can now answer the first question put by. the honourable member for Parramatta. Sir James Laing and Sons Limited have constructed vessels for such well-known companies as the Peninsular and Oriental, Royal Mail, West India and Pacific, Union Castle, British India, British and Colonial, Ley lands, Natal Direct Line, Compagnie Havraise Peninsulaire, Toyen, Kishen Kaisha, &c.",17
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Fro m what is - the Prime Minister quoting?,17
43,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Fro m the West Australian newspaper of Tuesday, ioth July, which contains a long article giving dates and details of the manufactures of the firm.",17
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"My information is from a very reliable authority, and I prefer to accept it to a newspaper report of that kind.",17
45,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The newspaper report gives details.,17
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am assured by gentlemen in Australia who are thoroughly familiar with shipping matters that tJhe firm of Sir James Laing and Sons has never constructed a mail steamer of any kindthat it has not engaged in that kind of busiI do ness. Hitherto, it has confined its attention to sailing vessels and tramp steamers. Up to date, it 'has not undertaken the building of swift passenger and mail boats.",17
47,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The quotation by the Prime Minister may apply to the cargo steamers belonging to mail companies. I Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Possibly. ' The interjection of the honourable member for Dalley is one which the Prime Minister might perhaps take into consideration at once. Sir James Laing and Sons may have constructed cargo boats for these mail companies.,17
48,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,They have built ships more than 700 feet long.,17
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That may be true, and yet those vessels may be carop boats.",17
50,Mr EWINGI,Unknown,Si r James Laing and Sons stand high amongst the ship-builders of Great Britain.,17
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am aware of that.' I am merely pointing out that up to date they have only specialized in a particular class of steam-ships, and that, consequently, we have no guarantee that they themselves will build the vessels with which to carry out this contract. Of course, there is the alternative that, upon the strength of having obtained this contract, they may be able to secure sufficient capital to enable them to embark upon this new shipbuilding enterprise. If so, the Government should have satisfied themselves as to the facts of the case in this particular regard.",17
52,Mr EWING,Unknown,"If they neglect to go on with the contract they will lose ,£27,500.",17
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That would be a mere fleabite to them. By-the-bye, I should like to make some reference to that matter at once. We have been told that the amount which will be forfeited by the conconfidently tractors in case of non-fulfilment of the tract is £ 2 5 , 0 0 0. But I would point out the contract itself is so drawn that under no circumstances whatever can we recover more than that sum. No matter what may be the damages in which the firm-may land the Commonwealth by any failure on their part, the full extent of their liability £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 . That sum is to be regarded a liquidation of damages, and not as a penalty.",17
54,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It is not a limitation. On the contrary, it strengthens our position very much.",18
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not think so.,18
56,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It does. member will recognise the force of that contention.,18
57,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,It doss not enable the Government to recover more from the conin tractors.,18
58,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,But it enables us to the whole of the amount with very much and less difficulty.,18
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is so, but I am pointing out how unfair the contract is as between one side and other. Let us suppose that the concated tract is not proceeded .with. assume that twelve months hence Sir or forfeiture. James Laing and Sons say, "" We have not the requisite capital, and cannot f u l f the contract. We will forfeit the £ 2 5 , 0 which we have deposited."" What will be the result to the Commonwealth? If we decided to accept the next lowest tender it would involve us in the payment p f an additional £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 during the currency of the contract. That tender, I underhaving stand, is £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 a year more than amount demanded by Sir James Laing and Sons, so that in the event of the successand, f u l contractors being guilty of a breach the contract we should incur a penalty £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 during the currency of the tract. Seeing that Sir James Laing and Sons would forfeit only £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 should they fail to complete the undertaking, and that the Commonwealth would lose lp^of ^700.000, the position to me seems very one-sided and uneoual one. that such a risk might safelv be incurred in the case of companies which are established, and which we know would out the contract-companie s which have carried out such contracts in times past, and upon whose experience therefore we might rely. But here is a firm which, conso far as we know, has not yet entered that upon the business of mail contractors at all. It has not yet constructed a vessel of the calibre of those required to carry out the contract. If twelve months hence it was unable to complete the contract-seein g that the existing contract would then have only is six months to run-the probabilities are as that the price for the conveyance of oui mails would be increased very considerably. Consequently I say that the minimum possible penalty which the Commonwealth would incur in case of a forfeiture on the part of Sir Thomas Laing and Sons is £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and that it might-and probably would-amoun t to £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 . But the contractors would escape by forfeiting Every legal £ 2 5 . 0 0 0 . and in the contract itself we expresslv bar ourselves from suing for any further penalty, no matter what the damages may actually be to us. I believe that connection with an undertaking of this kind, where, so far as we know, the conget tractors are treading upon virgin ground, where all the risks incidental to the undertaking are to be met, there ought to be some approximation as to the liability on both sides. If we are the to stand to lose to the extent I have indithe contractors should also be liable Let us to lose similarly in the case of failure If the contracting firm is a big one, that ought to increase, i l rather than lessen, the liability to penalty0 0 I , therefore, think that this part of the contract ought to be rectified in the direction I have suggested. It is said that no deposit is required in connection with our present contract, but the difference is that the Orient Company is a going concern, interests in Australia. It has been the contracting with Australian Governments for the last twenty, thirty, or forty years, therefore, the same penalties are not of requirable as are necessary in connection of with a totally new company in a totally conunexplored field. I hope that the Minister will tell us as much as he can- I think he ought to tell us all he knows-abou t the operations of the contracting company, and at what guarantee the Government have that a the contract will be carried out in the way I admit provided.",18
60,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Does the honourable memcarry ber desire a larger deposit?,18
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am speaking not of the deoosit, but of the penalty for forfeiture. Clause 10 provides that the whole amount which is enforceable as liquidated damages is £ 2 5 , 0 0 0. Commonwealth will be unable to recover A half-penny by way of penalty; the amount of the deposit represents the whole penalty to which they can be held, no matter what the consequences may be to us.",18
62,Mr FISHER,Unknown,If the company do proceed at once with the construction of the steamers we can enforce the penaltv.,19
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No ; we car. enforce no penalty; all that we can do is to liquidate the damages to the extent of the deposit of £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 .",19
64,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I think that is very fair.,19
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is so far as it goes, andi I am not complaining of it. My only complaint is that by this contract we'shall specifically exempt them from any other penalty.",19
66,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Will the honourable member read clause 10, and then turn to clause 38 of the General Conditions. that if he does so the position will be explained to him. The condition in claus» 38 relates to clause 10.",19
67,Mr MAHON,Unknown,And so with clause 39.,19
68,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , but we still have the same limit.",19
69,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Unde r clause 38 the contractors are required to enter into a bond in a sum equal to one-fifth of the annual subsidy, and to find sureties for the due performance of the contract.",19
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"But the limit to which I have referred applies even to that condition. All that clause 38 provides is that we may obtain the total amouni of £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 as we proceed.",19
71,Mr EWING,Unknown,The General Conditions come in.,19
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No ; the conditions and the contract itself are both limited by the provision as to the £ 2 5 , 0 0 0. In connection with an undertaking like this, which appears, on the face of it, to be of a largely speculative character, the question of penalties ought to be an open one. In other words, we should be able to recover whatever penalty the Court may decide that the contractors are liable to pay. just as we should have to foot the bill if any clause of a penal character applied to us in case of the forfeiture of the contract. The contractors might land us in a further expenditure of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and' all we could do in the way of recovering penalties would be to secure the £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 already deposited. It occurs to me that this is a very unequal arrangement in conThe nexion with a new mail contract of this kind. There seems to be an implication in clause 5 that the period of transit between Brindisi and Adelaide may be cut down from 636 hours to 612 hours; but, strange to say, the drafting is such that, not whilst it is implied that such an acceleration of speed may be required, there does not appear to be any compulsion on the part of the contractors to comply with that requirement.",19
73,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable member is quite right; the provision is very ambiguous.,19
74,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In clause 5 we have the wordsIn the event of the Postmaster-General requiring the said "" period of transit» on the voyage from Brindisi to Adelaide to be reduced to 012 hoursand so forth. But there is nothing re[ think quiring that the period of transit shall be so rediuced.",19
75,Mr EWING,Unknown,If the demand be made it must be complied with.,19
76,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There is nothing in the clause which provides that the contractors shall be bound to comply with the requirement of the Postmaster General.,19
77,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I ' f it is not clear, it will be made quite clear.",19
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,If the honourable and learned gentleman turns to clause 5 of the contract,19
79,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It would not appear in clause 5; that clause is all right. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I do not find in any other part of the contract a provision setting forth that the contractors shall be bound to comply with the requirement of the Postmaster-General in this regard. All that I find is the provision .mat the Postmaster-General may require this reduction in the period of transit, and that if the requirement be complied with a further sum, not exceeding £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 , shall be claimable by the contractors. But the contractors may sav, ""We cannot do it-w e will not do it , "" and, so far as I can see, there is nothing in the contract or the general conditions that would enable us to compel them to complv with the requirements.",19
80,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Clause 5 must mean something. If it d'oes not mean that we have this power, what does it mean?",19
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is what I desire - to know.,19
82,Mr FISHER,Unknown,There is no penalty enforceable if the contractor does not comply with this requirement.,20
83,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,There will be.,20
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In clause 6 we have again a piece 6f drafting that I do not feel able to appreciate. I desire to know what it means. It sets forth that if, during the sixth year of the service, any competing line of mail-ships provides an accelerated service, we may require the contracting company to do the same. That is to say, if , in the meantime, the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, as the result of arrangements with the Imperial Government, has accelerated its service, we may require our contractors to give a speedier service in the sixth year of the contract. But why the sixth year? Why not the fourth or the seventh year? Under the clause, as it stands, if such a demand were made in the fourth or the seventh year, the contracting company might very well plead that it was not bound to comply with it, since only the sixth year was specifically named in the agreement. It seems to me that other years &re specifically excluded. I admit that this is a matter for the lawyers to determine, but it occurs to me that the drafting in the first Line of the sixth clause should be widened.",20
85,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The honourable member understands that it is a long contract, and",20
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I think I understand the purpose in view.,20
87,Mr EWING,Unknown,The . intention of the clause is that the service shall be kept up-to-date.,20
88,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I take it that if, during the fourth or the seventh year of the contract, a quicker service were provided by another company, there would be no power to require the contractors to give us an accelerated service. I know, of course, that that is not intended, but it curs to me that that is what the clause as drafted would mean. Then again, I direct attention to paragraph c of clause 6, in which the wordsThe extended period for which such improved and accelerated service shall continue, appear. Is that extended period to be a period within the ten years or beyond it? If it is to be a further period beyond the ten years, it means a general power to ex- tend this contract. I take it that the Government could not do that without coming to Parliament and practically making a fresh contract. So that if the period referred to is a period within the ten years, it occurs to me that the clause might have been made very much clearer than it is. ButThe extended period for which such improved and accelerated service shall continue, might very well, if taken by itself, without reference to the whole contract, be taken as conferring upon the Minister a 'general power to extend this contract beyond the ten years. That would seem to be the more reasonable supposition, because, to increase the speed of these boats might mean a revolution in the position of the company; might mean a necessary increase in its capital; might mean the substitution of larger boats; might mean a complete change so far as the contractor was concerned. I do not know whether that is what the clause means, but I take it that as drawn, it is as. much in the interests of the contractor as of the Commonwealth Government. That is to say, if the contractor finds during the sixth year referred to in the clause that he cannot carry out his contract, the clause will give him the right to say to the Postmaster-General, "" I cannot comply with your speed requirements; I cannot run my boats as quickly as the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, with its new boats, can run theirs. I shall have to get out of the business. But I can charter some boats for a couple of years, so that you can make fresh arrangements for a new contract with this higher speed."" That seems to me to be the. underlying; motive for the clause. I can see no other adequate reason for its insertion. If that be the reason, I think that it should have been cast in a plainer mould, so that we could read it without very much difficulty. There are two points that arise in connection with paragraph c of clause 6. Does it mean that' the extended period is to be governed by oc- the ten years' period of the contract as a whole, or does it mean to confer power upon the Government to make a contract extending: beyond the ten years' period without reference to Parliament? »",20
89,Mr EWING,Unknown,Paragrap h b makes that perfectly clear. The Government could not alter this contract without the permission of Parliament.,20
90,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,- Parliament would not find the money if it did.,20
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What does it mean, then?",20
92,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"It means that, with the consent of Parliament, the contract may be extended for a further period.",21
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Of course, the Government would have to come to Parliament;-and, therefore, when you come to Parliament, this contract is at an end. To pass an Act of Parliament embodying a further proposal means setting up a new contract in place of this. The clause strikes me as being strangely worded. Does the fresh period contemplated commence in the sixth or tenth year?",21
94,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Suppos e they said to us, "" The difference between six years and ten years is only f o u r ; if you will make this a six years' contract from now we will undertake it for so much less."" would have to consider it , however, if it went beyond the ten years.",21
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I think that the provision might be put in a clearer form. We should be able to determine the contract, and make a fresh one, not providing for all these emergent circumstances. .However, these are matters of drafting. Clause 15 of the contract is another one to which I wish to call attention. It requires that if by any legislation we diminish the earnings of the company, or increase its expenses up to a margin of £ 5 . 0 0 0 , at anv time during the currency of the agreement, there shall be power either fo determine the contract, or to make provision for further payment. Those words, again, cover a very wide field.",21
96,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,That provision is all right; it was in the last contract.,21
97,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Yes , it was in the last one.",21
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not know that that makes it all right. It seems to me to be very loose indeed. For instance, it speaks of "" legislation relating to shipping."" "" Relating to shipping "" is legislation that may in anv way interfere with the company's earnings, or with the conditions under which it runs its boats.",21
99,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I take it that it would have to be legislation specifically relating to shipping.,21
100,Mr TOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It does not say so. That is what I complain of. The clause is not sufficientlv definite in its wording. It would, for instance, I suppose, cover such legislation as the Navigation Bill , or any proposal of that character. It might' apply to such a measure as the Anti-Trust Bill or the Commerce Act passed last session.",21
101,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"They do not "" relate to shipping.""",21
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,They may affect shipping.,21
103,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The words are "" relating to,"" not "" which affect.""",21
104,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Relatio n must be taken in connection with the general purport of the clause, which has to do with the diminution of the earnings of the company, or the increase of its expenses. I take it that any of the legislation which I have mentioned may possibly-na y more, probably will-diminis h the earnings of these boats. Take the rqjort of the Tariff Parliament Commission.",21
105,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Bot h conditions have to be satisfied'-the diminution of the earnings of the company and the legislation ""relating to shipping.""",21
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I know. Take, for instance, the reports of the Tariff Commission which have already been laid on the table of the House. It strikes me that if Messrs. Joshua's recommendations were carried out, there would be a great diminution of \he earnings of ships with regard to the carriage of liquor to Australia.",21
107,Mr WATSON,Unknown,liquo r does not come by mail steamer usually.,21
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Tak e the Anti-Trust Bill . Supposing that by our legislation we kept out the 1,300 harvesters, such as came in last year. The freight on those goods might tot up to a good round sum. It is also easy to conceive that the Tariff proposals might diminish the earnings of the boats by more than £ 5 , 0 0 0 .",21
109,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"That would not be legislation "" relating to shipping."" It is legislation ""relating to shipping"" that is referred to, not the effect of legislation.",21
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,- I take it that the Question of relation is bound up in the further question whether legislationdiminishes the earnings or increases the expenses of the company.,21
111,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,That is the important point.,21
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is the only point provided for in the clause.,21
113,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"So long as there is no interference with the earnings, the contracting company will not care what sort of legislation there is. 5 Mail Service [REPRESENTATIVES.]",21
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Any legislation which does interfere,22
115,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Mus t still be shipping legislation.,22
116,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I'd o not know that; but the honourable and learned member reads these clauses with a great deal more experience than I can hope to bring to bear. At any rate, the point could be made much clearer. The term ""relating to shipping"" might be confined, for instance, to such measures as have been suggested, namely, the Navigation Bill, and legislation of that kind. Would the effect of the Arbitration Act, for example, be taken as ""relating to shipping"" ? The Arbitration Act might increase the expenses of these mail ships if , as suggested in the report of the Navigation Commission, we insisted on bringing them within the operation of that Act. In such a case, the strong probabilities are that there would be an increase in the expenses of the vessels by a great deal more than £5,000 a year. I should think that legislation of the kind, which bears directly on the conditions under which ships are run, would be construed as legislation ""relating to shipping."" However, I hope the Minister will take care that the wording is made clear and definite; though there is no doubt, I think, as to the general meaning and intention.",22
117,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"The Arbitration Act came into operation prior to the agreement, and, therefore, that question could not arise.",22
118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But the effects of the Arbitration Act might not begin to operate until afterwards.,22
119,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,This agreement is subsequent to the enactment of the Arbitration Act,22
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That , I suppose, would cover the position. I should like to call attention to a departure in some of the conditions of this agreement from those of previous or existing contracts. For the first time, we have a purely mail contract, whereas, hitherto, we have required that the mail ships should go to Sydney, and, on their way, of course, call at Melbourne. That condition does not appear in the present agreement. We are told that the contractor shall be at liberty, at his own option, to continue the inward voyage of any mail ship beyond Adelaide, after calling at that port, and to commence the outward voyage from any port, provided there be a call at Adelaide. There is no requirement beyond Adelaide on the one end and Brindisi at the other; to Europe. and I should like to know from the Minister why that departure has been made. I have always sympathized with the claims of Queensland to have a port of that State made a port of call. I know, of course, that this would be a departure from the strict principle of a mail contract; but such departures are made in very many other directions, and are regarded as incidental to mail contracts, and, perhaps, as a collateral part of such contracts. However we may be disposed to regard this matter from a purely academic or purely legal point of view, I have always sympathized with the desire to encircle the whole continent as far as possible with these mail services. I remember that some years ago, I incurred a great deal of odium, temporarily, for consenting that the mail boats should call at Fremantle. I was subjected to much criticism for my action; but it seemed to me only proper consideration for Western. Australia that the mail boats should call at Fremantle, whe:e a harbour has been constructed at so huge an expense.. And so with Queensland. As I say, I have every sympathy with' the desire of the people of that State that the mail boats shall call regularly at Brisbane; and if the matter could' be managed at a small increased cost, I am not nuite' sure that it should not be made a condition of the agreement for the vessels to call at .all the ports of all the States of Australia. I do not believe that such a condition would make much difference to the speed of the mails, or very much affect the business of the contracting companv; and the whole could be provided for in the one condition.",22
121,Mr EWING,Unknown,The Government got very little assistance from the various States in the endeavour to meet them.,22
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am afraid 'that only shows how unpopular this Government is with the States'. I know of no reason why the States should fight so shy of us in this respect. I find the same complaint is made in the report of the Royal Commission, and, strangest of all ironies, the complaint is as to the action of the Labour Government in Queensland.",22
123,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Do not speak of the Queensland Government as a ""Labour Government,"" please.",22
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is ' Mr Kidstoa not a labour man? 1,22
125,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"No , he is not.",22
126,Mr DAVIDTHOMSON,Unknown,Mr Kidston is like the honourable member for Parramatta - h e has left the Labour Party.,23
127,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Mr Kidston is an portunist.,23
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Mr Kidston is not like me, because, I believe, he signed the labour pledge.",23
129,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable member for Parramatta signed the labour pledge once.,23
130,Mr TOSEPPI COOK,Unknown,"No,"" I did not.",23
131,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Yes , the honourable member did-in the Temperance Hall, Svdnev. Mr 1 0 SEPH COOK - No .",23
132,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Yes , the honourable ber did so- a pledge to abide by the caucus decision.",23
133,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,That has nothing to so on. do with the question before the House.,23
134,Mr TOSEFH COOK,Unknown,Did I sign the pledge about which the honourable member for Bland came to me?,23
135,Mr WATSON,Unknown,No ; that was another time. But the honourable member should built not deny the pledge he did sign.,23
136,Mr TOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"This is only an aside. Mr Speaker. If the Minister could satisfy by anv possibility carry out the suggestion I should like to see' Queensland grouped in this agreement with the rest of the States, provided that could be done at slight increase on the present that there is involved in the building of the new mail ships the necessity for the supervision of their construction by the Commonwealth Government. So far as I know, that is a new requirement, and not an unimportant one.",23
137,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Hear , hear.",23
138,Mr TOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There are to eight be eight new mail steamers, and it occurs to me that the supervision will represent small item, if that supervision is to be all effective.",23
139,Mr EWING,Unknown,"To refresh my memory, will the honourable member tell me in what paragraph that is provided?",23
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I cannot find any the paragraph just at the moment, but I of the construction of these vessels. know that there is a condition that the vernment shall supervise the construction of the vessels from time to time, making suggestions, and insisting on such requireof ments as seem to be necessary.",23
141,Mr EWING,Unknown,That is only with regar'3 to the tvne of the ships and the class i<f accommodation-it is not the supervision of the building of the ships.,23
142,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There are one or two references to this matter in the agreement. op- Mr EWING - It was never intended to supervise the building of the ships.,23
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I take it that that is exactly what the supervision is intended to cover, and nothing .else-to see that the type of the ships",23
144,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Yes ; but there is to be no supervision in the ordinary sense of supervision of me,n at work-it is not that class of supervision.",23
145,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,The supervision is to memsee that sufficient progress is made.,23
146,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Yes ; and in regard to the class of boats-wha t they will carry, and",23
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"This condition is set forth in paragraph 39, and is as follows:If any tender provides for mail ships to be to carry out the contract, the Postmaster General shall have the right from time to time, after the tender has been accepted by him, to cause inspections to be made in order to himself that sufficient progress is being - made with the construction of the vessels to enable the contractor to.commence and continue the contract in accordance with his tender and the conditions, and may demand from the cona tractor such information ns he may require cost. I see from him thereon. There is further reference to this point in another part of the agreement; and it struck me that there was to be very close supervision exercised in regard to the construction of the vessels. If the provision is to be effective, it would be a very costlv matter to supervise the building of large vessels such as these will be. We are told that the cost of construction no will be at least £3,000,000, and the superat vision of the expenditure of such an amount would j to doubt be worth a considerable sum to a professional man. I take it that the Government will need to employ a professional man, if they propose to take part, however slight, in the supervision I Gohave pretty well exhausted what I had to say in criticism of the terms of this contract, but after all I have said by wav criticism, I say that the Government must still be left to take the full responsibility of their action. I repeat that if they can bring into effective operation a fleet of huge steamers such as these are to be, of 11,000 tons net register, with a 5 Mail Service [REPRESENTATIVES.] minimum speed of 15 knots, and can insure their constant and regular running in the interests of the mails, and of the producers of Australia, they will have achieved a very good stroke of business deed, and a much better stroke of business, in my opinion, than we could possibly hope to make by adopting the course recommended"" in the report which is before us over the signature of the honourable member for Barrier. I am bound to sav that I cannot subscribe to, the amendment which he has. moved, not because of any prepossession against it, and not merely for any theoretical reason, but for hard business reasons which appear on the surface of the report which the honourable member has seen fit to present to the House. The amendment was moved by the honourable member in an excellent speech which traversed 'the report of the Shipping Service Commission in a very material degree. The honourable member's speech was taken largely from that report. I had not the advantage of reading it, because Hansard did not reach me before I left Sydney. I did not see the report of the honourable member's speech, or that of the Postmaster-General.' but I heard some of both, and sufficient of that by the honourable member for Barrier to induce me to make one or two interjections in opposition to the honourable ber's proposals. On taking up the reno-t of the Commission, which forms the basis of the honourable member's amendment, I find that the very first paragraph covers a great deal of ground, and shows, I think, the amateurish way in which the report has been formulated and written. For instance, those responsible for the report begin by saying that if we carried our mails on the poundage system, that is, by 'paying according to weight, we should save a matter of £80,000 per annum as compared v?ith the cost of a subsidized service under the contract system. I do not know that that brings us very much nearer to a solution of this matter. There are many other such anomalies in the postal service. There are anomalies of the kind in everv department of business life. Indeed, such anomalies might be mentioned in connection with the proceedings of the whole of the commercial communitv. The honourable member for Barrier, therefore, in this instance puts his finger upon a matter which is not at all peculiar to a mail contract, but is to be found in every department of Mr Joseph Cook. to Europe. our commercial life. If we take the work of the Post Office, for instance, honourable members will see at once that the revenue might be enormously increased if we in- charged the same rate for newspapers as for letters. We do not, although I know of no good reason why we should not. I could never get an intelligent reason from the heads of the Postal Department of New South Wales when I was Postmaster General of that State as to why the rateswere differentiated as between ordinary letters and newspapers. We carry ten times the weight of newspaper matter that Ave carry of letters for the same money.",23
148,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,We used to carry newspapers for nothing in New South Wales at one time.,24
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes ; but in every country in which they are not carried for nothing, this marked difference between the rates for newspapers and letters isi still to be found.",24
150,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,It is due to the power of the press.,24
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I believe that we carry newspapers now at the rate determined by the International Postal Congress, biit I dare say that if we were to interrogate every member of the Congress, not one would be able to tell us just why there memshould be this huge difference between the rates charged for the carriage of newspapers and those charged for the carriage of letters.",24
152,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Are not newspapers sent round by the ship, whilst letters are sent overland ?",24
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is not so; but I am speaking of inland as wel,l as of oversea carriage. I admit, for instance, that it is the rule of the Department to leave newspapers behind if they find they are overloaded. In that respect, letters arealways |g,iven tlhe preference;. That is about the only reason I know for the huge difference which is set up betwe-en the rates for the carriage of these different classes of postal matter. It is a differential rate. In the same way. we have differential rates on our railways. I doubt whether we could get any intelligent reason why one class of goods is carried at a low rate over our railways, whilst another is charged an inordinately high rate; why, for instance, two or three tons weight of stone is carried over the railways at a very low rate, and at about half the rate which is charged for the carriage of half the weight of stone, if it be cut and carved. 1 could multiply instances of this kind which raise the whole question of differential rates in every relation of our business life. So that really what appears ""in this connection in the report of the Commission contains no very material lesson of which we can take advantage. Coal, for instance, is carried over our railways today - at perhaps one-fourth of the rate charged for the carriage of other classes of goods. .A truck of coal carries about 6 tons, and it is taken over the railways for a certain - distance at £ 1 or 30s., whilst a truck of the same capacity, and carrying the same weight, of other goods, may bear a rate of £ 4 or £ 5 for the same distance. I am aware of no reason which will adequately fit the facts, but the one reason that these differential railway rates are observed all over the world, and have grown up from time immemorial, until they have become crystallized into rules and laws of railway management. In this respect we realise the truth of Disraeli's statement that custom is - stronger than law. So manv of those customs which dominate our commercial existence are stronger than any law founded upon however legitimate a reason. Again the honourable member goes on to sayThe present subsidized mail service is - maintained in the interests of the commercial clnss and of the producers ishable commodities. These honourable members might as well - say that a reduction in the freight of coal would only benefit the Korrumburra Coal Company, and would not'benefit the population whose means 6f livelihood is dependent upon the mines there. Every resident in that coal township is interested, it may be more vitally interested in some circumstances than even the proprietors of the coal mines. Yet in this report the honourable member makes a distinction between those who actually use these boats and the great bulk of the people who are dependent upon the boats being so used by these individuals.",24
154,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Wh v does the honourable gentleman sav ""the honourable member,"" - when the report is signed by slix of us?",25
155,Mr TOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I speak of the honourable member for Barrier, as repre-senting the others, because he was Chair-man of the Commission; that is the only sense in which I use the phrase. I repeat that the commercial class have to do with every class. How many persons, for instance, are dependent upon the importer for their means of livelihood? The whole ramifications of business are inter-related in a very close way, and the interest of one cannot be separated from that of another.",25
156,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Is not the importer also dependent upon the people whorai he serves ?,25
157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Exactly . In the report these classes are separated as though the one had nothing to do with the other, as though the commercial class and the producers and exporters of perishable commodities could be separated from the rest of the community. Every one knows that a large proportion of the people of Australia depend upon the export of perishable goods for their means of livelihood. It is upon the export of grain and wool that Australia has to depend today.",25
158,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Do not forget the gold.,25
159,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is upon these exports that Australia will have to depend for some generations to come.,25
160,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Do not forget the Broken Hill lead.,25
161,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No , I shall forget nothing. Therefore, every person in the community is directly and materially interested in all that h'as to do with the export of perishable commodities. cEiefly Another strong statement is contained in the same paragraph. The Commissioners and exporters of pergo on to sayIt does not appear that, outside the classes mentioned, the general community would to any material extent be inconvenienced by the adoption of the poundage system. That is equal to saying that if a railway were constructed, it would not advantage the communitv very much by knocking off the coach. The same argument might be used against the construction of a railway. It might be said, "" It does not appear that the people would be very much benefited by the construction of the railway, and it would not be very much to their detriment if it were not built."" The outstanding fact is that science and skill is being bent and concentrated in the direction of making the world smaller and quickening its processes, perhaps in the means of transportation more than in any other direction. But we are told for the first time that if we do not get quicker boats to Australia, it will not make very much difference. That, I venture to say, is an antediluvian idea; though it is a very proper observation for Socialists to make. I believe that if the Socialist ideal in regard to other things as well as shipping were realized, this world would be a very much slower place saysindeed than it is. I have often described the Socialists of today as wanting to take a "" header"" back into a condition of things from which we have slowly and steadily emerged, and which emergence is represented in what we call progress and cividifferent thing. lization. Now we have the Socialist saying, "" It does not appear that we should very much inconvenienced if we had slower service to Australia than we have."" I submit .that of all countries in the world, Australia has most to gain from quick and mind. speedv transit, whether by mail-boat or by - anv other means.",25

Mr l OSEPH COOK - The honourable lows the principlemember knows that the two questions cannot be separated. In my judgment, the mail services in Australia set the tune to a very great extent for the rest of the panies trading here. But for the requireof ment of speed on the part of our mail-boats, I doubt whether the other transport serconsideration vices to Australia would be anything like what they are.",26
163,Mr FISHER,Unknown,That is an argument in favour of this proposal.,26
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"This requirebut ment as to speed on the part of the mailboats, and the space which they have to furnish for the carriage of our produce London, sets the tune, to a very large tent, for the ""tramps,"" and for transport steamers generally, and hence for the rest of the world. I doubt whether we should have the quick services from Australia to the markets of the world that we have day, but for that reauirement as to speed",26
165,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"That is what we say in our report, that under the Government should have a line of steam-ships which would set the pace.",26
166,Mr TOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is one of onethe contradictory parts of the report. In one part the Commissioners say that it does not matter whether we have a quick serwe vice or not; that nobody would be hurt remains much if we had not.,26
167,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Will the honourable memGovernment, ber read what is in the report? *'r. TOSEPH COOK - That is what is in the report?",26
168,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Not word for word as it was put by the honourable member ?,26
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The report It does not appear that outside the classes mentioned the general community would to any material extent be inconvenienced by the adoption of the poundage system.,26
170,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Hear - hear, that is a",26
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Lookin g at it be from the point of view of my honourable a friends when they separate these people from the rest of the community, I hold that it indicates an antediluvian condition of",26
172,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The report states a very different thing from what the honourable the Commember said it stated.,26
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Her e is another The Commissioners point out that the Postal Department f o l That each service shall pay its way. The Department does nothing of the comkind. In the determination of the status a post-office its total income is taken into considenrtion. More and more is that entering into the administration of the Postal Departments. I know that the officials would like to do this if they were permitted. It would check and stop so much new business being transacted, the tendency of the administration of the post-office is to take into consideration the - whole of the service, and unquestionably the Public Service Commissioner bases to the status of a post-office upon its total exrevenue and the general improvement of the service as a whole. Therefore, that is another statement which does not square with the facts of the situation, and ought not to find a place in a report of this kind. toThen my honourable friends go on to quote - as their sole argument in favour of a Commonwealth line of steamers, a statement by we a Committee of the House of Commons of 1902, and of all the strong conclusive arguments for Socialism commend me to thisWhile as between the two systems referred to think that in the circumstances the subsidy system is to be preferre'd, the larger question of establishing a line of mail steamers under the direct control of the Commonwealth which would provide a fortnightly mail service between Australia and London equal to that of any of the private companies engaged in such work, and would, at the same time, benefit the Australian States both directly and indirectly. On the general question of .the advisability of establishing such a service we may quote the following paragraph from the report of the Steamship Subsidies Committee as laid before the House of Commons in 1902. Here is the paragraph upon which they base the advisability of establishing such a serviceThe weak point of the post-office position is that the estimate of full value (for services rendered) is arrived at by the test of public tender, and that the competition for sending in tenders for large postal contracts is very restricted, and restricted, as a rule, to powerful steam-ship companies. They are hard up for a socialistic argument when they make use of that. There is not a word of advice given there to the I m perial Government, or to the House of Commons, that they should jump into Socialism as a way out of this restricted competition.",26
174,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,It says that they do not get full value from private enterprise.,27
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It says that they get full value from all the private enterprise available, but points out that the area of competition is a narrow one, owing to the hugeness of the service to be rendered.",27
176,Mr WATSON,Unknown,And that is narrowed by a ring.,27
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is an annotation by the honourable member; but his statement is, probably borne out by the facts. I do not consider, however, that because the tendering is not as. much as one would desire, that should decide the point whether this service should be nationalized. The Commission went into the engineering aspect of the case. Although among the names of the signatories to the report I do not see that of any honourable member who is conspicuous for engineering knowledge, they have not hesitated to make an estimate as to the probable cost of the vessels necessary for the service; but there is great difference of opinion as to the correctness of that estimate, and I believe that all the experts consider it too low.",27
178,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Do the Commissioners say that it is their estimate or that it is Mr. Coghlan's estimate?,27
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Commissioners say that it is Mr Coghlan's estimate, but accept it as a full one, although the experts point out that Mr Coghlan omitted to take into account many things which should have been included. Commissioners took responsibility for the estimate when they made it their own.",27
180,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,We take the whole responsibility.,27
181,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I venture to say that if Mr Coghlan had been reporting on the whole matter, he would have looked further into the question of cost of construction than he appears to have done. He furnished an estimate which, so far as it goes, we have no reason to suppose to be incorrect; but experts point out that many things have been left out of consideration which would greatly increase the actual cost.",27
182,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"On e estimate put down the cost at £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 per vessel.",27
183,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Accordin g to the chairman of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, the vessels would cost much less.",27
184,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not know how the matter is to be settled; but it must be settled before we determine to run a mail service of our own. Persons do not generally enter upon a business transaction by taking at haphazard one of a number of conflicting estimates. A business man would obtain the best opinions available. But the opinion of those possessing experience and skill in connection with the management of steam-ship companies is in opposition to the estimate of the Commission as to the cost of constructing the necessary ships.  is not worth much. He is one of the commercial experts.,27
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am speaking of men like Mr Kenneth Anderson and others who have to do with the management of mail services.,27
186,Mr WATSON,Unknown,They are a little interested.,27
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Yes ; but there are no men possessing the necessary knowledge who are not interested.,27
188,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The ship-builders are not interested.,27
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Me n possessing the skill and knowledge necessary for the management of so huge a commercial concern as a shipping company do not stand idle; their abilities are worth thousand's a year on the market, and, consequently, find readv emplovment.",27
190,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The company which Mr. Kenneth Anderson is managing has been, The on its own showing, unsuccessful.",27
191,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,There is another story about that.,27
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Honourable members will admit that Mr Kenneth Anderson is an able man..,28
193,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"He has stated that eight boats could be built for £2,800,000. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Althoug h Mr are Kenneth Anderson, wlith the experience of a life-time, cannot make a mail service profitable, the members of the Commission .affirm that - it can be made to pay. I do not wish to criticise them unfairly. Their report is an able one, and, no doubt, spur lines. they have taken a 'great deal of time in dealing with the subjects referred to them; but, unfortunately, the necessary facts to the main lines. were not available. Consequently, report, they say, "" We cannot get the facts necessary for a proper estimate,"" then airily proceed to give - That is one of the strongest objections their recommendations. that they have not been able to obtain the data for a proper estimate, and then ceed to give an estimate. Their estimate must be the result of mere guesswork, and, therefore, absolutely unreliable.",28
194,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"It is not necessarily reliable, even if a guess, because guesses go very near the truth.",28
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Exactitud e is treating most desirable in matters of this kind would be most dangerous to commence an enterprise of this magnitude without the fullest and most reliable data. If one so, the business would, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, tumble about his ears. The Commissioners have recommended use of turbine engines, as being of. the latest type, and most efficient for the proschedule pulsion of steam-ships. They say that - eight steamers would cost £3,000,000, that and, in support of that statement, quote the evidence of Mr Kenneth Anderson, who, I believe, has since qualified his evidence, and now says that eight steamers of the efficiency and capacity spoken of .in the report could not be constructed £3,000,000. Then, the Commissioners say that, although they have no' definite and reliable figures upon which to base their estimate, it may be taken for granted that private companies do not underence-tha take the trade unless wdth the idea of making a profit. I do not know we why that statement was made. Public companies frequently undertake enentering terprises which fail. There is a very proportion of failures to successes. fore, a statement such as that referred does not carry much weight. Then the Commission go on to argue by analogy. They quote the case of our railways, and say that it must be admitted that some of the privately-owned railways in Australia not so-well managed as are the Government railways. Surely, that is not all that is to be said on the subject. Some of our State railways are run at a loss. In New South Wales, for instance, we lose £300,000 per annum on some of our cock",28
196,Mr WATSON,Unknown,But those lines are not credited with the traffic which they bring in their Mr. JOSEPH COOK - No r is any private company running at a loss similarly and credited when it has to pinch the convenan estimate. ience of passengers. to Mr WATSON - There is only one such They complain case that I know of.,28
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The fact that procertain private railway lines do not pay constitutes no argument in favour .of the nationalization of our shipping services, nor is it an argument from which we can deunduce that even railways are more successsome fully managed by the State. They are better managed, because the State can afford to make a loss on some lines by the railway service as a whole, and It not making each section stand by itself.. However, I do not wish to pursue the subject any further. It seems to me that in did all their estimates, the members of the Commission have assumed that the present rates of freight and passenger fares would the be maintained. In clause 5 they say, 1 ""Reckoning our returns according to the of fares fixed by the Orient line."" Do the members of the Commission suppose if the State undertook to run a line of. steamers in the manner proposed, the shipping companies would tamely submit?",28
198,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Mr Kenneth Anderson said that the Shipping Conference for would not interfere.,28
199,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I do not think he said that. He stated that, personally, he would not raise any objection to the Commonwealth line joining the Shipping Confert is a different matter altogether.",28
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Exactly . If did that, we should not be nationalizing the shipping service. We should be into a private venture in order to large uphold what the Socialists regard as Therean enormity from which escape is to sought by the process of nationalizafion. The Commission say that things are not as they should be in the shipping line, and that the nationalization of the mail service would go a long way to set things right. The desired end would not be accomplished if the Commohwealth were to bolt into the combine, and become a member of it . If the Commonwealth mail service did not join the combine-and I take it that there is a combine-the shipping companies would not quietly stand by and see their trade taken away from them by a Government line of steamers. Precisely what has happend in connection with the cable enterprise would occur in this instance. The moment a new competitor entered into the field, the freights and passenger rates would be reduced by the comjianies. That is what happened in connection with the cable service. The moment that the Pacific Cable was constructed, the Eastern Extension Company cut down their rates. We could not induce them to abate i d . before that.",28
201,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,In that instance Government action was beneficial.,29
202,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , it was beneficial to a certain extent, and no doubt a reduction of shipping rates would be beneficial in that it would help the commercial classes, and our producers, and exporters of perishable products. But honourable members are very fond of pointing out that any betterment of that kind is only a short-lived one-that the private companies only cut rates ini order to shut out competition, and afterwards recompense themselves for all their trouble and sacrifice by once more increasing their charges. Therefore the Commission have adopted an obviously fallacious method of estimating the returns that would be yielded by the proposed new line of steamers. They assume that they would be able to obtain the same rates that are now charged by the Orient and Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Companies,; but obviously, if another competitor came into the field, the freights would be reduced. Either the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company or the Orient Steam Navigation Company would withdraw entirely from the trade, or would endeavour to retain a fair share of public patronage by reducing fares and freights.",29
203,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The Orient Steam NaviI gation Company could not exist - in the trade.,29
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I find a further reference to the same matter. For instance, it is pointed out in clause 8 that the British Shipping Conference considersthe Australian trade only as an auxiliary,, and as subsidiary to their Eastern interests. I understand that the Australian part of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's business does not pay them. This has been pointed out time and again, and collateral evidence in support of that statement is afforded by the fact mentioned by the honourable member for Bland, that the Orient Steam Navigation Companywas not paying its way in connection with its Australian business.",29
205,Mr WATSON,Unknown,It has no other business.,29
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Exactly , and therefore is not paying. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company sav that their Australian business does not pay them.",29
207,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,And still they are building more ships.,29
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Therefore , according to the Commission, we are to relieve ourselves of the Eastern embarrassment spoken of by concentrating our efforts upon a losing business . The more 1 closely we adhere to such a policy the more likely we are to go to the wall. It is stated that the Commonwealth should concentrateits efforts upon the Australian business,, and take no account' of the Eastern business. That is to say, by concentrating its attention upon the business that does not pay, and ignoring and excluding the business that does pay, the Commonwealthwould be able in some mysterious way to make a success of a State-owned line of steamers.",29
209,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I should be glad if the honourable member would quote what the Commission said. We did not say what he indicates. *,29
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have already quoted from the report. The CommissionsayAt present the British Shipping Conference, in which foreign shipping, is represented, regulates the Australian passenger traffic, not specially for the convenience of Australians, but rather to meet the necessities of its many and varied interests in the East and elsewhere. But a Commonwealth line, not being embarrassed by these conflicting interests, could concentrate its efforts on giving to passengers to and from England the best and most convenient services. may point out, in reply to that, that the Australian business does not pay the companies now engaged in the trade.",29
211,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Then it is very good of Messrs. James Laing and Company to come along with their new steamers.,30
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I suppose that the honourable member has known of many gold mines that have been abandoned as non-paving, and afterwards taken up by other simpletons, who have also lost their money.",30
213,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"In many cases other simpletons have taken up abandoned gold mines, and have made them pay.",30
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I was just about to mention the alternative. Messrs. James Laing and Sons may make the new mail service pay; but all the evidence we have been able to obtain so far is that the trade does not pay the companies now engaged in it. If the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company had not their Eastern business to work in with the Australian trade they would not be able to carry on.,30
215,Mr EWINO,Unknown,:Why do the. German and French steamers come here? . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Because of the subsidies which they receive.,30
216,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Some people say that the French and German steam-ship lines are losing money also.,30
217,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I . am told that the German steamers would not come here but for the huge subsidies which the companies receive.,30
218,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"No r would the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, the Orient Steam Navigation Company, and Sir James Laing and Sons come here but for the subsidies which, are paid.",30
219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is what I say.,30
220,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,This Australian company would receive a subsidy.,30
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"But the Peninsular and Oriental and the Orient Steam Navigation Companies declare that with the subsidies the Australian portion of their business does not pay. The balance-sheets of the Orient Company do not show any dividends so far as that part of its business is concerned. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company declare that they do not make monev out of the Australian portion of their business, and that it is only liecause they are able to work it in with their Eastern business that their vessels come here at all. Mr THOMAS!-Is that statement contained in their annual reports? If so, I cannot see it.",30
222,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It has appeared often enough in their annual reports.,30
223,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Has the honourable member read it there?,30
224,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Yes . I admit that it is some years since I read it,30
225,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Has the honourable member read the annual reports issued by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Companv for 1904 and 1905?,30
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No , but I doubt whether they contain the specific statement that the Australian portion of their business is paying. Now that the honourable member has spoken of it, I do recollect that in one report they point out that there has been an increase in. the freights to and from Australia, and that the Australian portion of their business' is improving. From that statement, surely the honourable member for Barrier will not argue anything, except that there has been a revival of trade, and that the company has been taking advantage of it. But in the report of the Shipping Commission, it is pointed out that the very thing which is an advantage to this company must be excluded from a .scheme for the establishment of a national fleet of steamers, and that by concentrating effort upon the losing part of the business, a magnificent success might be made of it . Any sound, commercial man would sav that that would not be the case. He would argue that the Jess he concentrated! upon the losing part of the business, and the more upon its paying part, the better would be his returns.",30
227,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Would , not the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company prefer to derive larger profits upon a smaller tonnage than smaller dividends upon a larger tonnage? If the Australian business were not paying, they would make larger profits upon their Eastern businessat least, that is the view which any commercial man would take.",30
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member again misses the point, namely, that a service as an independent service may not pay, although when worked in conjunction with the Eastern and India service it mav pay. Those who have to depend entirelv upon the Australian portion of their business-as have the Orient Steam Navigation Company-maintai n that it does not pay.",30
229,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,But the Orient Steam Navigation Company fight like men-the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Companv never did.,31
230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That is another matter. I am dealing with or.e point which is specially emphasized in the report of the Commission. The Commissioners declare that in excluding the good paying portion of the business, and in concentrating upon that part of it which does not pay, a magnificent success might be made of a' national line of mail steamers. Then they point out that there are the usual collateral advantages to be derived from a Commonwealth line of steamers. Amongst other things they say that it would have the effect of keeping money and work in the country.",31
231,Mr SKENE,Unknown,Does the honourable member for Barrier sav that?,31
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Y s, and also the honourable member for Coolgardie, the honourable member for Kennedy, and several others.",31
233,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Does the honourable member obiect to that?,31
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am not concerned with objecting to it. I am merely pointing out one of the collateral advantages claimed in connection with the proposed establishment of a national line of steamers, namely, that we should keep the work required to be done, as well as the money and the ships, in the country.",31
235,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"That is not a bad advantage, I should say. Mr. JOSEPH"" COOK - I notice, also, that the success of the proposed new line of steamers is said to be dependent upon a great many contingent circumstances. In short, the report of the Commission is full of "" if s , "" and "" burs."" For instance, in speaking of the necessity for running full ships during five months of the vear, for carrying, cargo between Australian ports, it saysI f this is merely a matter of arrangement with thecoastal companies, there can be no reason why a State-owned line should not undertake coastal freights. If , however, the reason for declining the carriage of cargo is the limited time allotted to each port in the schedule of arrival and departure, it might be found impracticable for mail steamers to enter on such a trade. Anybody knows that. It is tantamount to saying, "" If this thing should prove to be impracticable, why then, it will be impracticable."" Who desires reports of that kind as the result of a costly and prolonged investigation? No doubt it is a little bit of innocent and quite harmless padding, but it does not bring us any nearer a' solution of this matter. Incidentally, this national line of steamers is to accomplish a number of things. It is to advertise Australia all over the world. I fancy that it would advertise Australia-and if I am not very much mistaken-it would advertise our folly all over the world as it has never been advertised before. In this connection, I would remind honourable members that there are some kinds of advertisement that we would be very much better without. The advertisement of our failures and follies has already been made too much of by the rest of the world, and by others who have been described by certain honourable members of this House as the ""stinking fish"" party.",31
236,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Where have the failures and follies been proved to exist, save in the e imagination of the honourable member and that of his friends?",31
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am pointing out that, in my opinion, the establishment of a national line of steamers would be a failure, and that, therefore, the less we advertised it to the rest of the world, the better it would be.",31
238,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,But suppose that the scheme were a success?,31
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If it were a success, it would be a success, and that statement is just about on a par with the statements contained in the Commission's report. The Commissioners say that if this could be done, and that could bo done, the undertaking would succeed, but if this and that could not be done, it would not succeed. Who desires reports of that character? We want definite reports which are based upon exact data. Nothing else is of the slightest importance in connection with an undertaking, which would involve us in an expenditure of £ -5,000,000 or £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0, and which would affect the exporters of our produce and all those who are engaged in our industrial enterprises. It is too large and serious a matter to be undertaken upon mere guesswork, such as the report of the Shipping, Commission has been based upon. May I point out in this respect that there never was a "" c r o n k "" undertaking entered into in any part of the world which did not show a balance-sheet which was "" passing fair"" ? Take all the great outstanding ""cronk "" affairs of the world. They have all shown excellent balance-sheets, and I fear that balance-sheets in themselves are - of very little value. Experience is the great test, and in this particular matter we have experience to guide us. Consequently, we should not commit ourselves to the mere guesswork and tabulations of the honourable member for Barrier and his fellow Commissioners. If the figures contained in the balance-sheet of the Commission are all right, then the scheme for the establishter ment of a national line of mail-steamers is »U right.",31
240,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Some people would say not. The honourable member would say that it was not all right, because it is one proposing Government control.",32
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I tell the honourable member candidlv that I have no faith in figures which are preluded by the - statement that there are no definite and liable data on which to base an estimate.,32
242,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"The honourable member said that if the figures were right, the scheme would be all right; but even if they thought they were, neither the honourable member nor his leader would agree to it.",32
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Commissioners who reported in favour of the scheme tell us that they are unable to make a definite and reliable estimate. They then proceed to make one.,32
244,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,B-u t the honourable member said that if these figures were correct the scheme would be all right.,32
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I say that if they are correct, they are correct, and if they are incorrect, they are incorrect. When I say this, I am simply parodying the report, for that is the nature of it from beginning to end.",32
246,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,We shall see what Hansard says. I repeat that the honourable member said that if these figures were all '-right the scheme would be all riight.,32
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If I did, it was a mistake. Has the honourable member never made a slip of the tongue?",32
248,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Then the statement in question was a slip of the tongue?,32
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes . I have yet to know that I did make the statement. The honourable member wishes to bind me down by a slip of the tongue as an advocate of the nationalization of steam-ships, although all my arguments are against such a proposal.",32
250,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable member said something earlier which suggested that he was in favour of such a scheme.,32
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I can find nothing in the report of the Shipping Service Commission which would furnish us with the slightest justification for so grave and important a national departure. At any rate, I prefer keeping by the old paths of private enterprise until the experience of the world furnishes me with something betthan this inquiry does-in the shape of skill in the recommendations, and in the shape of experience and skill behind those making the recommendations. We have, in the report of the Commission, a. statement to the effect that "" If Queensland had helped, what a difference there would have been."" "" If this or that had occurred, what a difference there would be,"" is a statement that we find in almost reevery clause of the report. If we could obtain for the national service all the freights to London; if we could get the lands of Australia developed, and have them producing frui t and butter and other products of that kind in abundance; if we could induce the States Governments to help to make the line pay; if competition were abolished, and a fair and free run for our enterprise obtained; if we could secure these and a multitude of other favouring circumstances-if , in short, all the gales of prosperity would blow their happiest upon us-then , according to the report of the Commission, it would be a good thing to nationalize our shipping. But, strange to say, in the actual experience of an individual or a nation, one hardly ever .finds all these 'favouring circumstances converging upon any one enterprise at th5 one time. I , therefore, hold that, judged, upon anysound, practical basis, this report must be ruled out. In. presenting it, the Commissioners begin by expressing their inability to furnish a practical basis, and that statement in the very forefront of the report is amply demonstrated throughout its pages. The report is ingenious-it is clever-bu t I do not think that any one who looks at the matter from a broad business stand-point will say that it is convincing. There is still another thing necessary for the success of the scheme, and that is the possession of the requisite brains and skill to conduct such an enterprise. The report states that the Government can purchase brains and skill as well as any private company can do. Maybe they can; there is no guarantee, however, that the skill and brains which are so purchased would have the same free play as brains and skill have when their possessors devote them to concerns wihich they are running for private profit. The statement in the report to which I refer is equal to an assertion that the Government could make a man do that which a private individual now does for himself. That is the whole argument. It is begging the whole question, as between Socialism and anti-Socialism. Every one will admit that if we could secure people to do for the Government that which they now do for themselves-if the Government enterprise were as good in every particular as private enterprise- and apply the principle to every ramification of business and every detail and outlook of human life, then the case for Socialism would be complete. But this is begging the question; it is simply entering the 1 whole field of controversy and argument. Instead of arguing out the matter upon plain business considerations, the Commissioners throughout the report have to maike a skip now and again to reach the rosy consideratiions .which they have placed before us. I infinitely prefer the arrangements wihich the Government have made for the future carriage of our mails to the project sketched for us by the Royal Commission. I hope that the Minister will be able to make it clear that everything in the contract is straightforward.",32
252,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Hear , hear.",33
253,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That everything is straightforward and impossible of being wrongly construed. In other words, I hope he will make it clear that the contract has been well drafted, and that its meaning isbeyond the possibility of doubt. I trust also that he will give us some evidence of the bona fides of the contracting company-that he will give us something in addition to the name which has been placed before us. Sir James Laing may be all that is claimed for him; I have nothing to say against him. He has a great, record as a ship-builder, but I am told that he has never entered upon the building of vessels of the class required for this service.",33
254,Mr EWING,Unknown,"I think that is inaccurate, but still ' Mr JOSEFH COOK - If the company contemplates making use of the contract for the purpose of acquiring the requisite capital the Government ought to be aware of the fact.",33
255,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Hear , hear.",33
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Speakin g generally, with no mail steamers in existence, with a contract still to be faced from its foundation to its completion, the company is one about which we should know something more before we give our consent to an agreement which is of supreme importance to exporters of perishable products, and of much importance toAustralia generally. We cannot separate this mail service from its commercial side. I believe that our mail service does more to keep the commercial transactions of Australia with the older countries of the world at the point of expedition and despatch than perhaps anything else of which I know. In .these circumstances, the question before us is a matter of supreme importance to all who have produce to ship, and for which they must find a market in other parts of the world. I shall le.ive the Government to take the full responsibility of their action in this matter. If they conclude an agreement which proves satisfactory, which will command a service of the speed laid down for the price given, and will be subject to the other conditions mentioned, they will have completed a contract which will be in the interests of Australia as a whole, and will have made an excellent bargain indeed.",33
257,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [4.29] - It is to be regretted that the honourable member who has just resumed his seat did not receive the last copy of Hansard and the other Parliamentary documents necessary to enable him to prepare his case. Had he done so, he would not have inflicted upon the House a series of very attenuated arguments, and what I may describe, I hope without offence, as some absurd conclusions. The honourable member, in the concluding portion of his speech, said that the Royal' Commission had not attempted to deal with the salient points in the proposal to establish a Commonwealth fleet on a socialistic basis. He left it to be inferred that, although a Government could purchase brains and energy, it could not guarantee that those brains and that energy would work for the State as vigorously as they would do in their own interests. But he concealed the fact that the brains and the energy employed in directing great private enterprises are very often purchased just in the same way as they would be if employed by a Government Department. I venture to say that the men who direct the great enterprises of the world are not alwaysare very seldom, indeed-actuall y shareholders in them. So that the real position is not as stated by the honourable member. I am rather sorry that he should have constituted himself the latest champion of the party which he joins in denominating "" the stinking fish party,"" the party which is always prepared to repudiate the possibility of anything gocd eoming out of Australia-the jiarty which has attempted to blacken the good name of this community, and to hold us up before the world as a people who would shut out British subjects from cur shores, and as having actually refused to allow drowning men to land'.",33
258,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Any one who does not believe in Socialism is a member of ""the stinking fish party"" !",34
259,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I say that when the honourable member, admittedly on insufficient evidence, proclaimed these Commonwealth steamers must be a failure from their inception, he undoubtedly linked himself with those who are continually decrying Australia.",34
260,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Ye t the honourable member supports the Government which is going to do the same thing!,34
261,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I do not know any member of this House who is more intolerant of interruptions than the honourable member is ; and when, early in his speech, I made what I considered to be a relevant remark, he actually jost his temper, and told me that I was making an impertinent interjection. There was nothing impertinent in what I said. He was talking at that time about a purely legal question, and, as he was not a lawyer, I conceived that if there was anything in his point it should be argued out between legal authorities, rather than in a House mainly composed of laymen. Therefore, I think that my interjection was not impertinent, but was, on the contrary, extremely relevant to the point at issue.",34
262,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If it was not impertinent, it was absurd.",34
263,Mr MAHON,Unknown,We-wil l leave it at that. I am quite prepared to accept the honourable member's opinion of any interjection which I make provided that he will accept my judgment as tc his observations.,34
264,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Do not be so nastv ' Mr Mahon - If I have had the misforficiency tune to be ""nasty,"" it is difficult to example which the honourable member sets in his own speeches. I do not wish to revive old sores, but, really, the honourable member .is the last one' who should mention that word. He commented very severely upon the first paragraph of the report of the Royal Commission, dealing with the question of poundage as opposed to the payment of a subsidy for the carriage of our mails. He said that it was impossible to dissociate the commercial classes, the producers, and the exporters from the rest of the community. The first paragraph in the report emphasizes the fact that this subsidized mail service is instituted chiefly for the benefit .of a very sma,ll class of the communitv-that is to say, for those who are actually interested in commerce, whether as importers or exporters, and those who are engaged indirectly in such occupations. The honourable member overlooks the fact that 80 per cent .of the people of Australia were born in this country, and have very little interest in old-world affairs. The great bulk of the native-born people of Australia, and also a large number who have come to this country, and who have made their homes here, no longer have anv necessity for communicating with the old world. They do not often write letters to send abroad. Therefore, it was pointed out in the report that it was immaterial to these people whether the mail-boats occupied three or four days more in the delivery of letters. It further went on to say-and I think justly-that the burden of payment for these subsidized mail services should be transferred, so that they might fall upon those wha directly benefit. Although the honourable member may choose to say that it is impossible to dissociate the commercial classes from the rest of the community, there is, I think, good ground for saying that these charges should be borne by the people who reap the bulk of the benefit. The mail subsidies are paid out of Customs revenue, to which, as a matter of fact, as every one knows from experience, the working man, who rarelv uses the over-sea mail services, contributes almost equally with the wealthier classes.",34
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The cost is only borne out of Customs revenue when there is a deficiency in the Postal revenue.,34
266,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Exactly ; but the hon! orable member knows that there is a dein the working of the Postal and avoid the Telegraph Department every year.,34
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"That has ways been the case. Before Federation the Western Australian Post Office showed a surplus, and bore the cost of the mail subsidy.",35
268,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"At the present time there is, I think, only one State in the Commonwealth, namely, South Australia, in which the Post and Telegraph Department is paying its way. Taking the service over the whole of the six States, the honourable member for Parramatta cannot deny that the work is carried on at considerable loss. That being so, the deficit is undoubtedly made good out of the Customs revenue,' of which, as the honourable member is perfectly aware, the working classes of Australia pay an undue share. These are the"" classes who, I say, do not use the oversea service to any great extent. On the general proposition that those who get the benefit of any Government service-of any collective effort of the people-shoul d share in the cost, I should like to quo^e some extracts from speeches delivered at the recent Conference of Premiers, held in Sydney, in April, of this year. When the question came up of providing funds for old-age pensions, the President of the Conference, Mr Carruthers, Premier of New South Wales, saidif ihe Commonwealth authorities will impose duties on tea and kerosene, and hypothecate or earmark the revenue from those duties for the purpose of old-atje pensions, we shall have the back of the expenditure broken, anrl we shall Ret, in a simple way, a contribution from the classes who most largely are the recipients of this pension. "" In a simple way "" are the words which Mr Carruthers used'; and here we have a proposal to make the workers of Australia, who share in old-age pensions, direct contributors to the fund. Then, Mr Bent, Premier of Victoria, on the same occasion, saidTt is the view of the Victorian Government that it would be wise for us at this stage to urge that the people who obtain the pension should contribute a little through the duties on kerosene and tea. Mr Davies, another member of the Conference from Victoria, saidWe do not propose either, that it (Federal pension fund) should be raised by some tax from the payment of which those who would get the chief benefit would be exempted. Here we have ample precedent and justification for the position taken up by the Royal Commission in the first paragraph of their report. Let me summarize the facts. Here is a subsidized mail service, used not alalmost exclusively by one class of people in the community-that class who have business in oversea commerce j and to make up any deficiency in the payment for the service, the whole people Of the community are taxed. Mr Coghlan recently estimated that about 80 per cent, of the residents in Australia are natives of the continent ; and that 80 per cent., I may assume, have very little interest in the social or domestic affairs of people on the other side of the world.",35
269,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Does the honourable member say that the 80 per cent, of the community have no relatives on the other side of the world?",35
270,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Not for one moment; but the honourable member for Lang knows as well as I do that even those from the old country, who have lived, as I have, for nearly a quarter of a century in Australia, have very little correspondence with the old country. It is wonderful how one's correspondence diminishes year by year, until it is represented by one or two letters.",35
271,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I think the honourable member is mistaken.,35
272,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,The honourable member' for Coolgardie is absolutely correct.,35
273,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I am giving my own experience. ',35
274,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Whic h is necessarily limited.,35
275,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Quite so; but 1 apprehend that what happens in my case, also happens in the case of other people. Therefore, I agree with the finding of the Royal Commission that the bulk of the public would not be inconvenienced by the adoption of the poundage system-that the mere fact that' letters were delayed three or four days extra on the voyage, would not affect the great majority of the people in any way. The honourable member for Parramatta was, I think, quite at sea when he contended that the bulk of the people are interested in the maintenance of the oversea mail contract. It is a serious matter that the people of Australia should be paying £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 per annum more than, is necessary for the conveyance of the mails to England. When the honourable member asserted that the service of mail steamers is the test of all communication between Great Britain and Australia-that it nerves other shipping companies to make speedier voyages-di d he ignore the fact that there are no mail subsidies as between Great Britain and America, and that the duration of voyages across the Atlantic has been reduced within the last twenty or thirty years by from 2 5 per cent, to 40 per cent. ?",35
276,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The honourable member knows that there are some subventions in the case of the Atlantic service?,36
277,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I know that the time of the voyage between England and America has been very considerably reduced during the last twenty years, not because of any mail subsidy, but simply because the steamship owners have found it pay them to provide a quicker and better service. In my opinion, the same result would follow in the case of the service between England and Australia. In the natural order of things private shipping companies would undoubtedly provide greater facilities in a very short time. The honourable member for Parramatta spoke of the revenue of the line of steamers as remaining at the piesent dimensions. Nobody who takes a rational view of Australian development couldagree with the honourable member in that respect. On all sides we see evidences of greater prosperity-increase d exports as well as increased imports. We know that Australia has enjoyed several good seasons, and that a wave of prosperity has reached this country, causing our revenues to expand, and enabling the public to spend more money in every way. Consequently the honourable member is not doing justice to the Royal Commission when he claims that its calculations are based entirely on the present position of affairs. On the contrary. I think the Royal Commission was justified in holding that the export trade of Australia will largely increase, and that a Commonwealth line of steamers would undoubtedly share in the increased passenger and goods business. The honourable member for Parramatta also said that the shipping companies which at present carry on the traffic would not take ""lying d o w n "" the competition of a Federal line of steamers. That mav be so; but I remind the honor-_ able member that dealing with the Govern-' ment is altogether a different matter from dealing with a private company. Orient and Pacific Steam Navigation Company and the Peninsular and, Oriental Steam Navigation Company, if they attempted to apply unfair tactics to the Commonwealth, would find that we have power within us to resent such tactics in a most decisive and emphatic wav, which they would remember. The honourable member tried to justify his condemnation of this paragraph in the report of the Royal Commission by saying that anomalies are not peculiar to mail contracts, and he mentioned the fact that the* Postal and Telegraph Department carries newspapers at a lower rate than that for letters. The honourable member should have remembered that the Department differentiates in regard to the importance in value of mail matter; but he altogether ignored that aspect of the matter. A newspaper is of comparatively little importance compared with a private letter, and therefore the Department chargesless for the conveyance of a newspaper than it does for a letter. The honourable member also mentioned an anomaly connected with railway management:, and stated that stone in the rough is carried over the railways at alowerrate than that charged for carved stone. These were, of course, merely illustrations, but throughout his speech the honourable member ignored the fact that the value of the article carried is an essential factor in. fixing the rate in connection with all transportation charges. As I have already said,, the honourable member was placed at a great disadvantage in not having morematerial at hand in criticising the proposed contract. At various times he asked for more information, but I did not hear him specify the particular points which he desired should be further elucidated. Insome respects, I think the honourable member's speech was rather contradictory. F o r instance, he said that if the Governmenthad really completed this contract, they had' made a good bargain, and in the next breath, he said that the penalty of £25.000to be enforced against the company under certain conditions was altogether out of proportion to the loss which the Commonwealth would sustain if the companv did not carry out the contract. As a matter of fact, the honourable member said that Weshould sustain a loss of at least £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 , whilst it might be infinitelv more, and for that reason urged that the contractor The should be asked to deposit more 'than £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 . How the honourable member can regard as a good bargain a contract which involves a possible loss to the Commonwealth of £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 without any compensation is mote than I can understand. The honourable member further said that; in case of default, the company would incur nogreater liability than the loss of the deposit of £ 2 5 , 0 0 0. I direct his - attention to the fact that in the third paragraph of clause 39 of the Conditions of Contract, it is stated thatThe Postmaster-General may at once call upon - the contractor and his sureties to enter into a new bond to increase the amount from ^""25,000 to ^'50,000, and so on. So that the honourable member was not accurate either in his criticism of the contract or of the Commission's report.",36
278,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"The contractors need not pay the extra £25,000; they could simply cancel their contract.",37
279,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I am not a lawyer, but I think the honourable member will find that the Commonwealth Government would have the power to enforce the penalty of £""50,000.",37
280,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Hear, . hear.",37
281,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,No .,37
282,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I see that doctors differ. The Minister says that the Government would have that power. I again repeat my regret that the honourable member for Parramatta had not an opportunity to prepare his speech on this question. I was rather amused in following the honourable member's speech, and comparing it with the report of an interview with a Mr. Paxton, which appeared! in the Sydney press a few days ago. I found that the honourable member's speech was largely a reproduction of the arguments used by Mr. Paxton, and almost in the order in which they were used by that gentleman. might just notice one statement which Mr. Paxton made to the newspaper interviewer. He saidAlthough the contract looks genuine enough on the face of it, I must admit that I have a feeling that there is something which has not been disclosed. This gentleman is evidently possessed of a most lively imagination. When he was in Perth some time ago, attending the conference of Chambers of Commerce, in  made another mast interesting and important discovery. At that time, he criticised the terms of the service for which tenders were 'invited by the Government, and, in reply, I pointed out that they were exactly the same as those which had been adopted by previous Governments. He said that no shipping authority would ever approve of - such conditions as were sought to be imposed.",37
283,Mr EWING,Unknown,He said that no one would tender ?,37
284,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"No . What he said was that the conditions sought to be imposed by the Government were outrageous, and that no man with any shipping experience would give his approval to them. The  that occasion happened to be clauses which found a place in a previous contract, and I reminded him that when the Watson Government were in office a no less distinguished shipping authority than Sir Malcolm MCEacharn had approved of those conditions.",37
285,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,But the honourable member would not put Sir Malcolm MCEacharn   come from?,37
286,Mr MAHON,Unknown,He is the chairman of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce.,37
287,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The chairman of the shipping section of the Chamber.,37
288,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"- I believe that is so. I reminded him that so eminent a shipping authority as Sir Malcolm MCEacharn had fully approved, and had, in fact, revised the conditions of a previous contract before their publication.",37
289,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,At the honourable gentleman's request as Postmaster-General ?,37
290,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"At the request of the Watson Government. It will hardly be  whose arguments have been repeated by I the honourable member for Parramatta this afternoon, replied to my statement in this wayYes. That has confirmed the strong suspicions we always, entertained that Sir Malcolm 1 MCEacharn was in league with the Labour Party. He did not attempt to show that the conditions were wrong in any way, but to my reminder, as an answer which he regarded as triumphant, he said that it was further evidence in support of the suspicion that Sir Malcolm MCEacharn was in league with the Labour Party. That extraordinary invention indicates that the gentleman who has furnished the honourable member for Parramatta with the chief arguments which he used today possesses a strong imagination. I am not entirely in accord with the contract which has been proposed. I am in favour of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barrier, who. as chairman of the Oversea Shipping Service Commission, has placed the Commonwealth under a con- , siderable obligation by the industry, ability and research which he displayed throughout the conduct of the proceedings of that Commission. I think we certainly should pause before tying ourselves up for so many years to the payment of the large subsidy proposed to be paid to this company. Although I admit that the proposed contract is in many respects advantageous to us, there are many which I think it could be improved. Take, for instance, clause 10, which deals with the employment of white labour on board the ships. If honourable members will refer to the contract they will see that in every other clause it is provided that the contractor "" shall "" do this,, or "" shall not "" do that. Clause 8 saysEvery mail ship shall be a good substantial Australia. and efficient steam-ship. Clause 9 saysEvery mail ship shall be always properly and sufficiently equipped in all respects. But when we coma to clause 10 we find these wordsThe contractor binds himself to employ only white labour on vessels used or employed the contract, but this condition shall not apply to the coaling or unloading of the mail ships at places beyond the limits of the Commonter wealth. Unless a penalty for the employment of black labour on a' ship is provided in other clause, certainlv it is not prescribed in any part of clause 10.",37
291,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It will be a breach the contract.,38
292,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"That may be, but it not apparent on the surface. undesirable that no provision should be made that only Australian and Bri25 tish seamen shall be emploved. If we on board a German boat we find nobody but Germans employed. Attain, go on board a French boat. Ave shall find only Frenchmen employed.",38
293,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It is a condition of the subsidy in those cases that the company must employ French or Germans on the it vessels.,38
294,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I think that the Prime Minister might very fairly imitate that ample, and say that none but Australian gether inadeouate. or British seamen shall be empoyed on these mail boats. No other nation take offence at such a condition being serted in the contract, because so far as their Australian trade is concerned- I not know about their North American the trade-the steamers belonging to the German or French companies adhere strictly to the provision that only the subjects of their nation shall be employed. However, I do not wish, to emphasize that point any further. I ask the Prime Minister to see whether it is not possible, even now, to insert a similar provision in this contract. points in There is another little omission from the contract, and possiblv the Postmaster General is not to blame, because if I remember aright, it was omitted from all previous contracts. So far as I can see, there is no arrangement requiring the contractors to be punctual in the delivery of Inter-State mails. Take, for instance, the mails leaving Sydney and Melbourne for Western Suppose that the steamer left Adelaide on a Thursday, instead of delivering the mails at Fremantle on the f o l lowing Mondav, as at present, she mitrht not deliver them until the following Tuesdav.",38
295,Mr EWING,Unknown,There is no time-table for intermediate ports?,38
296,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"No . I speak now not under so much from the postal point of view as in the interests of passengers. The Minismust see that access to Western Australia can be gained at present only by the ocean, and that therefore it is very imanportant to those who travel, and who have business in that State, that an Inter-State time-table should be kept. I believe that of the Postmaster-General has done very well in altering the clause, stating that no fine shall be inflicted upon the contractor unis less twentv-four hours be lost, so as to It is also provide that the fining should start when the shin has lost even an hour. Bv clause a fine of £ 5 pei hour is prescribed."" go - If the Postmaster-General considers it necessary to offer such a laree payment if we for an accelerated service, this is a very small fine indeed to impose for any delay. For instance, a boat could be twenty-four hours late, and pay a fine of only £ 1 2 0 for the delay. Under certain circumstances might pay a steamer to lose twenty-fourhours, and the companv would still be in = porket. Seeing that the ra.pid delivery of exmails is essential, that penaltv is altoThe honourable member for Parramatta laboured considerably could over clause 15, which, provides briefly that inshould the legislation of the Commonwealth result in a diminution of the. earndo ings or an increase of the expenses of ships, the contract shall be terminated. I object to the clause-whic h I believe has found a place in previous contracts-or . grounds entirely different from those urged by the honourable member. 1 think that it would give the company power to hold a threat over the Commonwealth. Regarding any proposed legislation, they might sav, "" You will adopt that legislation at vour peril. We shall lose £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 or _£.i 5.000 or -/""so,000 a year by the legislation, therefore be caref u l as to what vou do about it . "" That is not a proper position for the Parliament to be placed in.",38
297,Mr EWING,Unknown,Is the honourable member sure that all legislation would affect shipping ?,39
298,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I am not prepared to argue that point, which formed the subject of a long dialogue between the honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member .for Corinella. I think that the Prime Minister appreciates the position which I am putting-that it is scarcely right that we should have the threat held over us that, if we adopt certain legislation, penal consequences will follow.",39
299,Mr EWING,Unknown,They are not Heavy£5.ooo,39
300,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"They are not heavy, but if that condition is accepted I think that we should insist upon a similar condition,_ giving the Commonwealth a corresponding advantage. There should be in the contract a clause providing that, if the legislation of the Commonwealth cheapens the operations of the company, we shall share in the advantage thus gained. For instance, as the contract stands, if , through the intervention of the Government, the Imperial Government, which holds the bulk of the shares in the Suez Canal, were to reduce the canal rates, the contractors would pocket the difference, and the Commonwealth would get no advantage. however, would not be fair, and therefore I suggest that it may be possible even now to insert a clause which will put the Commonwealth in a proper position, and not make the bargain one-sided. The contract is undoubtedly a great improvement upon previous ones, and the Government are to be complimented upon it in many respects. If the House is not prepared to agree to the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier, no doubt the adoption of the contract, subject to the improvements which have been suggested, is the best course that we can follow. The Government should [59] make an attempt to have the terms of the contract modified, with a view to carrying these suggestions into effect. I do not think that we should for all time pay a subsidy exceeding by £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 per annum the cost of the service on a poundage basis; and Parliament will be justified in saying to those who chiefly benefit by the establishment of subsidized mail services, "" We propose to readjust the burden, so that you shall bear the greater part of it. The cost of these services promises to be a very heavv burden upon the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, and it is only right that those who chiefly benefit shall bear the greater part of it . """,39
301,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [5.14] - The consensus of opinion amongst honourable members seems to be that, if the terms of the contract are faithfull y observed, the Government will have made a very good bargain. It is wrong to assume, as the honourable member for Coolgardie did, that the Opposition holds two diametrically opposed opinions on the subject, namely, that the Government have made a very good bargain, and that they have made a very bad bargain. Our opinion is that the contract will be a good one if its provisions are faithfull y observed by the contractors. But some of us believe that some of the c'auses of the agreement could be amended with benefit to the Comm'onwealth. It has been pointed out by a gentleman intimately connected with, and having a large experience of the shipping business, that the construction of the fleet of steamers .necessary for the performance of the service will occupy at least three years. Now, the service is to be inaugurated on the 1st February, 1908, or in about eighteen months' time, when the necessary vessels are unlikely to be ready. In view of that fact, the deposit of £ 2 , 5 0 0 is quite inadequate. That, - M-r. EWING - A deposit of £ 2 , 5 0 0 and another deposit of £ 2 5 . 0 0 0 have been made.",39
302,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Not in cash.,39
303,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Yes , in cash deposited in London. £ 2 7 , 5 0 0 is the amount which the company stands: to lose if it does not proceed with the service.",39
304,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I do not-think that cash to that amount is in the hands of the Government, although the equivalent of it may be:",39
305,Mr EWING,Unknown,It is the same thing.,39
306,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,I do not think that it is. Interest would not be paid on its equivalent. A bank before paying interest on such a deposit would require actual cash.,40
307,Mr EWING,Unknown,The money is available if the company does not do what it has promised to do.,40
308,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"In any case, the amount seems disproportionate, seeing that we are to pay £125,000 per annum for a ten vears' service, or, in the aggregate, £1,250,000. If the Commonwealth had to fall back upon the next lowest tender it would be involved in an additional expenditure of £300,000, even assuming that the tender would hold good after the acceptance of another tender. Therefore it seems to me that our interests have not been sufficiently safeguarded. It may be that it is not too late to make an alteration. Mr Tohn Paxton, whose criticism of the contract was published in the press a few days ago, referred to a matter which formed the subject of a question asked by me this afternoon, namely, the authority of Mr Croker for signing the contract on behalf of Messrs. James Laing and Sons.  The agreement was not one which was required to be signed under seal, and assuming that Mr Croker had the necessary authority the agreement should be perfectly binding. He assumed, however, that in respect of such an - important piece of business the Commonwealth would have taken the precaution through their representative in London to obtain from Sir James Laing and Sons Limited, under the hand of their chairman or secretary, an extract minute from their official minute-book giving the precise wording of the authority which had been delegated to Mr Croker. think it at all likely that Mr Croker would affix his signature without full authority, still using a phrase that was employed by barristers, "" For more abundant security's sake,"" the Commonwealth should see that this aspect of the matter was made clear. It would appear from the statement of the Prime Minister that this precaution was not taken. The Government were content to make Mr Croker responsible for the performance of the contract. I do not pretend to any expert knowledge upon technical points of this character, but, in view of the  - thoroughly experienced man, I was surprised to learn that the Government did not consider it wise to adopt the course indicated. Of course, this is purelv a contract for the carriage of mails between Brindisi and Adelaide, but I think it would have been wise to provide that the mail steamers should call at Melbourne. Sydney, and Brisbane. In all probability, the steamers will go on to two of those ports, because the trade inducements held out to them will be sufficient to make it worth their while to extend the voyage. We cannot forget, however, that the Queensland Government had to make a special payment to the Orient Conv panv to secure the extension of that company's service to Brisbane, and possibly the new contractors may make similar demands upon Victoria and New South Wales and Queensland. That is the reason why I think it would have been wise to make Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane ports of call for the mail steamers. We propose to pay the contractors £125,000, o r £s> 0 0 0 per annum more than is now received by the Orient Company. In return for this, the contractors undertake to shorten the period occupied in the conveyance of mails between Brindisi and Adelaide by sixty hours, and supply a fleet of greatly improved and larger steamers.",40
309,Mr EWING,Unknown,"At present we pay £120,000 for the carriage of our mails within 696 hours, and, under the new contract, we shall pay £i2'5,ooo for the carriage of our mails within 636 hours.",40
310,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Quite so; but I notice that it is provided in clause 7That during the prevalence of the south-west monsoon, the ""period of transit"" from Adelaide to Brindisi shall be extended by thirtysix hours.",40
311,Mr EWING,Unknown,That concession is granted to the present contractors.,40
312,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"It s effect is to materially reduce the advantage conferred upon He did not us by the new contract. Even if that provision is in the present contract, I think that, in view of the additional sum that is to be paid by us, the new contractors should have taken the risk of any delay owing to the prevalence of the south-west monsoons.",40
313,Mr EWING,Unknown,The honourable member knows that there are times when ordinary speed cannot be maintained.,40
314,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I am perfectly well aware that when a vessel is passing through a monsoon she cannot be forced along against a head sea and a head wind at her ordinary speed. But when ship-masters have reason to expect, as in this case, that they will meet with adverse conditions, they can drive their vessels at more than ordinary speed both before entering and after passing through the monsoonal regions, and thus make up for loss of time. Irobably those who are responsible for drawing up the agreement failed, owing to their lack of nautical knowledge, to take this point into consideration. I presume that the steamers will be equipped with sufficient power to drive them at a rate of speed in excess of that required to keep strictly within the contract time. As a matter of fact, I gathered from a conversation I had with the captain of the RMS. China, that, whilst the Peninsular and Oriental steamers can comply with the requirements of the contract by maintaining a speed of sixteen knots per hour, they are capable, if necessary, of steaming eighteen knots per hour throughout the voyage. That being so, the new steamers should be capable of giving us an accelerated service strictly within the terms of the contract, despite any delay that may be involved when passing through the south-west monsoon. Clause 8 providesThat the port of registry of the mail ships to be employed in pursuance of this agreement shall be a port within the Commonwealth Australia. No provision is made for the crews being signed on and off in Australia, which is very important matter from a Commonof wealth standpoint. In unfolding the terms of the contract the other day the Postmaster-General made much of the fact that Australians will be very much inteeach rested in the new venture. If that argusteaming ment be worth anything it would be worth per hour. a good deal more if the contract had vided for the signing on and off of the crews in Australian ports-no t necessarily have a well-defined meaning. at the port of registry, but at the starting point of these vessels from Australia. the agreement stands, the crews will prothe bably be signed on in London at the London rate of' wages, and consequently AusSteam tralian seamen will not derive any very great advantage from it. If it had been intended that they should receive any benefit, provision should have been - made for the signing on and off of crews round voyage in Commonwealth ports. That would have insured the employment of Australian seamen at Australian of wages. Clause 9 stipulatesThat the plans of the new mail ships built to carry out this agreement shall within a reasonable time be submitted for the approval of the representative of the Commonwealth vernment in London. Now, the phrase "" within a reasonable time "" seems to me to be a very loose indeed. Who is to define what will [59]- 2 stitute a reasonable period? In a contract of such an important character, a definite period should have been specified, within which plans for the building of the vessels should be submitted to the representative of the Commonwealth Government in London. As matters stand, months may elapse before those plans are submitted, and all kinds of excuses may be urged for not submitting them earlier. Under the agreement, Sir James Laing and Sons can hawk their concession about for the next twelve months, at the end of which period they may be no further forward in the matter of the construction of the ships than they are now. It does not seem to me that, >under the agreement, the Government have any means of compelling them to submit plans within what may be termed "" a reasonable period""-that is, within three or four months of the ratification of the contract by this Parliament. Clause 11, which is perhaps the most important provision in the agreement, appears of to have created some apprehension in the minds of certain honourable members, judged by the questions which were asked a this afternoon in reference to the tonnage the vessels. That clause providesThat each of the mail ships to be employed io pursuance of this agreement shall be of at least 11,000 tons registered tonnage, and that of .such mail ships shall be capable of at a minimum speed of fifteen knots proNow, in shipping parlance, the words "" eleven thousand tons registered tonnage"" Registered tonnage is a very different thing As from gross tonnage. The gross tonnage of largest vessels of the Peninsular and ""Oriental Steam Navigation, and Orient Navigation Companies visiting Australian ports, is something like 10,000' or 11.000 tons, but their registered tonnage is only between 5,000 and 6,000 tons. I  for the thing to say upon this point.",40
315,Mr EWING,Unknown,"What does the fact to which the honourable member has referred, rates convey to his mind ?",41
316,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"A ship of 11,000 tons to be registered tonnage would convey to _nw mind a ship of about 16,000 to 18,000 tons gross register-in other words, a vessel Gowhich would have a gross tonnage of at least 5,000 tons more than any vessel of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation one Company or Orient Steam Navigation conCompany coming to our ports. When a ship is said to be of 1,000 tons register, means that she is a vessel of about 1,500 tons gross carrying capacity. The gross tonprecise nage of any vessel is always a in excess of its registered tonnage. I see  say upon this point, and to make the tion perfectly clear, perhaps it would as well for me to quote his statement. He says, referring to clause u It provides that each of the mail ships to ployed in pursuance of this agreement shall be of at least 11,000 tons registered tonnage. I do not think that even the Government lizes what this means, and I am very certain that excepting the few closely connected with shipping business not many understand what the words "" registered tonnage "" mean or appreciate the value of the clause. It really means the vessels to be employed willrequire to be more than twice the size of such steamers as the Mongo'is and the Marmora, whose registered tonnage is a little under 5,000.",41
317,Mr E WING,Unknown,"The Marmora tised in the newspapers as a vessel of 10,500 tons.",42
318,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"That is her gross tonnage. The steamers provided under this contract will require to be more than twice the size of the Mongolia and the Marmora, which are the finest ships of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's fleet visiting Australia at the present time.",42
319,Mr EWING,Unknown,"It will not do any harm if the vessels are of that size, I suppose?",42
320,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"-Not at all. I should be very glad to see them here, and I do not think that anybody would complain of their presence. I am., however, inrelating to shipping."" formed, upon the most reliable authority, that it will take at least three years to build these steamers, and, consequently, fear that the contract cannot be entered within the specified period, because there are not sufficient ships of the required nage afloat available which could be charof tered for the purpose of carrying our mails.  saidAs a matter of fact, the total number of afloat at the present moment of the required tonnage would not be much more than sufficient to comply with the conditions of the contract. At the moment, I cannot give you the name a vessel which would indicate the precise called for. The nearest I can think of is the White Star liner Arabic, of 15,801 tons gross 10,062 tons registered tonnage. Wilhelm der Grosse, which Sydney people pretty well, is of 5,521 registered tons, and, therefore, as nearly as possible half the size of the steamers called for by the new contract. idea that such steamers can be built for it such sum as ^'400,000 is simply preposterous. They will cost at the very least half a million apiece, and probably a great deal more, but the sum depends to a certain extent on the great deal nttings and machinery. to I was induced to read the latter part of  be assertion in the report of the Shipping Commission that mail steamers suitable for a Commonwealth service could be constructed at a cost of £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 each. I be emhave no wish to unduly occupy the time of Now, the House in dealing with this motion; reamy sole desire is to emphasize points that appear to me to be deserving of consideration. In clause 15 we have the provisionShould the earnings of the mail ships be dithat minished and or the expenses of running the mail ships be increased either or both and whether prospective or actual by an amount of not less than Five thousand pounds (^5,000) per annum at any time during the currency of this Agreement in consequence of Commonwealth is adverlegislation relating to shipping enacted subsequent to the date of this Agreement the Contractors shall be at liberty at any time after such enactment to determine this Agreement on giving six months' notice in writing to the Postmaster-General of their intention so to do. Provided always that if so required the Contractors shall furnish the Postmaster-General with a statement of the amount and particulars of such diminution of earnings and or increase of expenses such statement to be certified by a chartered accountant to be mutually agreed upon. This clause may or may not have been cunningly devised to give the contractors a certain advantage. I refer more particularly to the use of the words "" legislation Those words, in my view, and in that of some eminent lawyers, do not necessarily imply legislaI tion dealing directly with shipping. All into commerce relates to shipping, and all interference with, or restrictions upon, comtonmerce, have a direct relation to shipping the most vital importance, since a shipowner's earnings could be reduced to the vanishing point by such legislation. In the course of conversation with me, the other day, a gentleman eminent in legal ships circles, expressed the opinion that the words "" relating to shipping "" had been deliberately inserted in the clause in order of that the contractors might take advantage size of legislation passed subsequent to the and signing of the contract, which might The Kaiser diminish or interfere in any way with the know inflow of imports to Australia. He cited the Australian Industries: Preservation Bill The as a measure which, in effective operaany tion, would have the result of diminishing the earnings of a shipping service, which, to that exent, would therefore relate to shipping. To obviate such a continSan gency, he suggested that the clause should be so altered as to make it clear that it £ related only to legislation applying direcly to shipping. The point is an important one, and I trust that the Minister will make a note of it, with a view to seeing whether other words, which more clearly define the intention, could' not be substiHouse, tuted.",42
321,Mr EWING,Unknown,In any event it would have to be cleared up.,43
322,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"And it is better that the point should be brought under notice at the present time, when it is possible make the meaning of the clause clearer. its general provisions be faithfull y observed the contract is one to which no exception be taken, and if it be brought to a successleave British ports. f u l issue the Commonwealth will be able to congratulate itself upon having its mails delivered by a very fine fleet of steamers, on terms which, so far as the price and the services rendered for that price concerned, are very much in advance of those of the existing agreement.",43
323,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [5.48] must certainly compliment the honourable member for Barrier, who, with charaction teristic determination, has given a close study to a question that will before receive in Australia far more attention than lascars. is being given to it at the present time. Some of the arguments raised in opposition to his amendment that a Commonwealth line of mail steamers should be obmodation tained are certainly strange. Scarcely any honourable member would advocate the selling of the railways of the States, or transfer of our telephone or telegraphic system to private control. Speaking subrepeatedly ject to correction, I believe that something liike £150,000,000 has been expended on the railways of the States, and, compared with that sum, the £3,500,000 necessary to provide the Commonwealth with a crowded national line of mail steamers is a very small amount. The producers in the centre of Australia may possibly be given differenNavigation tial rates on the railways to assist them getting their produce to the sea-board, it is, to sav the least, singular that not extend the principle to the carriage that produce to the motherland-the centre of the English-speaking race. I read a statement a few days ago in the Age that supremacy. the private telegraph company in the United and States of America had robbed the unfortunates who suffered by the earthquake at Francisco, and also their friends in other parts of the world, of upwards of 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 . After that I do not think that any one would have the temerity to say that we should hand over our telephone or telegraphic system to a private company. There is one point for which the Government will receive the encomiums of the and that is that white labour only is to be used on these ships. I have spoken in this Parliament, and in the State Parliament of Victoria on several occasions, against the great injurv that is being done to British naval supremacy by the Pento insular and Oriental Steam Navigation If Company. That company has done more to weaken the British mercantile marine can than has any other company whose vessels It is stated in Mr. Ernest Williams' book, Made in Germany - a work that has become almost a classic - that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam paid Navigation Company would take German are goods, tranship them at the port of London, and bring them out to Australia at 50 per cent, less than it would charge to carry English goods. So much public op- I probrium was cast upon the company by reason of that conduct after the publicaof Mr Williams' book, that for its own sake it ceased the practice. But conlong sider the company's treatment of the On its vessels only 36 cubic feet space are allowed for each man. No one will sav that it is possible for a human being to live healthily when the accomprovided for him measures only 6 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 2 feet high - a space only a little bigger than a dethe cent-sized coffin. The British Board of Trade, I believe, has fined the company by not permitting it to utilize as much cargo room as the tonna.ee of its vessels would allow. This was done in order to insure that more room should be given to the unfortunate lascars who were into practically rabbit hutches in the way I have described. What do we owe to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Company ? I do not feel under in the slightest bond of regard to it, but I and do feel a great amount of respect for the we canOrient Steam Navigation Company, beof cause it has worked its ships with white labour, and by so doing, has tended to promote, instead of lowering the British naval The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation. Company receives more money from the British Government by way on of subsidy than the Nordeutscher Lloyd British. Company or the Hamburg-American line receives from the German Government. It Mr Weirshows its gratitude by carrying German asked goods for 50 per cent, less than it charges contract. for the carriage of British .goods. Lest honhe orable members should think I am very severe in dealing with this company, I their should like to quote some of the remarks anas, which were made concerning its conduct the House of Commons, as reported in the London Times of 12th May, 1900. Mr. John Dillon, M.P., said thatA British sailor should not be subjected the competition of men who would work for half his wages and live on half his food. The Government encouraged the greatest steam-ship company to break the law. It was the Peninsular and Oriental pany to which he referred, and at that one of the directors qf the company was a member of the Balfour Government. On the same occasion Mr Havelock Wilson said that hedid not object to lascars being employed, they should be so on the same terms with regard ts wages, accommodation, and food as British seamen. That is what the party' with which I am cessary associated has always maintained. We do ask those who would not fear competition with anv race in the and Oriental Steam defend world, provided the competition is on equal to remember that one of terms, and that coloured men, if employed, receive the same wages as are paid acolleagues to white men. Sir Howard Vincent, a conservative member of the House of Commons, referred to the same matter in these was termsFormerly lascars were employed only in the engine-room, but now they were employed on deck, the proportion in one case being sixty-one lascars; only twenty-nine, or less than half, were employed in the engine-room. Australian Governments, notably Queenslandand this is to the credit of Queenslandhad taken a serious view of the matter, and had refused to give contracts to vessels ing lascars. Mr Henry Labouchere, then member for signed. Northampton, said that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Companyhad broken the law in a criminal manner, employing the men under conditions that fostered disease and shortened life. Mr Llovd George, who is a member of the present Ministry in Englandnoticed that while on the American lines, and the Castle and Union lines, go per cent, of the Mr Maloney. seamen were British, on tramps 30 per cent.„the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's vessels only 25 per cent, werei f there were any labour conditions in theI f there were not there ought to be, as when the British flag flew over South Africa, supposed that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company would have at. disposal the labour of Matabeles, BechuSwazis, and other native tribes, and these men would work for 4d. a day, and with a. in little training cut out the lascars. Admiral Field, a conservative, expressed, the opinion that the 'conduct of the Government with regard to the Peninsular to and Oriental Steam Navigation Company was deserving of strong condemnation, and though he would not vote against hisparty, still he would not support the GoComvernment on this question. He spoketime from the point of view of the naval supremacy of Great Britain. He said that we could not expect lascars to fight England's battles at sea, and that, if theBritish mercantile marine were not manned 7 by British sailors, Great Britain would bebut placed in a position of great danger, because landsmen could not serve in time of"" need, since they would not have the netraining. Mr Ritchie, who wasthen Chancellor of the Exchequer-and I the Peninsular Navigation Company Mr Ritchie's ownin the Balfour Government was director of the company-said If the law had not been complied with it not for the want of strong remonstrances. The Government had called attention to the fact that the space supplied to lascar seameKi was not the space provided for British seamen, and that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company were not acting in accordance with the Merchant Shipping Act. In thisway the Peninsular and Oriental Company had' already been heavily fined.",43
324,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that Mr Ritchie was a member of carry- the Balfour Government at the time hemade that statement? I thought he re,44
325,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"He had not resigned"" at that time. He was Chancellor of the Exchequer. He added thatHe agreed that such a company should be beyond reproach, and had made his opinionsknown to them more than once in strong terms, that they ought to give their lascar sailors thespace required by the Merchant Shipping Act. He had gone further, and informed them, although the Board of Trade had been unwilling* to prosecute in the hope that its remonstrances might induce them to comply with the English law, the time might come when he would consider it his duty to order a prosecution if the law were not complied with hoped that in future they would not have the annual recurrence of these complaints. That is the kind of shipping company that the honourable member for Parramatta is defending, and that he puts forward as an - example against those of us who are in favour of nationalizing the mail service. I remember an occasion when the honourable member took the chair at a meeting of Labour members which was called to try to - do something for the unemployed. I won-der that his voice and his abilitx-becaus e no one would deny his ability - are not used in the interests of the white race. I cannot see how the honourable member can - object to a national line of steam-ships. That great good man, the right honourable member for Adelaide, had great difficulty in South Australia in dealing with shipping - companies on whose vessels lascars were carried ; and he has sent me a return showing that in 1893 no less than 667 Asiatics were dumped down in Australia against our laws. These men were brought in vessels from the northern ports, and the vessels, on commencing their return journey, were - short of that number in their Asiatic crews. The State of New South Wales, to its eternal discredit, did not help the right honourable member for Adelaide in his efforts, but, on the other 'hand, threw every obstacle in his way; and the honourable member also had difficulty in getting some of the - other States to assist him in the matter. No one can deny that there is a shipping - combine-to prove the fact one has only to refer to the remarks of the late Mr Seddon, as quoted by the honourable member for Barrier. I have heard, both inside and outside the House, that there is a system whereby the shipping companies at our various ports allow percentages; in other words, tney use their power to keep out fair competition. It has been stated to men by a man who ships goods daily that it costs more to send cargo from Melbourne to Brisbane than to bring it from London to Australia. That could never happen if we had a national line. We should not' then have the Peninsular and Oriental - Company charging the foreigner-thoug h I must say I respect Germany as a great nation-5 0 per cent, less than is charged to people of the British race, although the - latter are responsible for the large subsidies it receives. One argument quoted by the honourable member for Parramatta was very absurd. He stated that some one, who was And he opposed to a national line of steamers, gave as one reason that there might be quarrels if two or three clergymen happened to be travelling on the same vessel. It has been stated that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company always have a Church of England clergvman on board their vessels; but I can say that, when travelling on the steamers of that company, I found clergymen of different denominations conducting services at different periods of the day without any friction whatever. It is certainly ridiculous to argue that, because we have no State religion, we ought not to have a national line of steamers. If the other arguments of the gentleman quoted are as convincing as the one I have just indicated I cannot give l him much credit for intelligence. In connection with private shipping companies, I might quote the great Gladstone, who, on one occasion, was asked whether he thought such companies would carry an enemy to the shores of Great Britain if the latter were involved in a European war, and who replied, "" I believe, for the sake of lucre, they would, if . possible, carry the enemy into the gates of heaven."" That was the great Gladstone's opinion of shipping companies ; and that is my opinion of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. ' Every continental nation which assists shipping companies insists that only men of its own nationality, shall be employed; and we ought to take a similar stand, though I am willing to accept the white man as against the coloured. On the question of railways, I could not pin the honourable member for Parramatta to any definite expression of opinion. I have 'here a letter which shows the cost of travelling on a private railway in Tasmania, on which I had the privilege of making a journey a few months ago with the honourable member for Darwin. On that line the charges are 4d. per mile first class, and 3d. per mile second class; and, really, the sheep trucks in comparison are fairly decent. Mr KING O'MALLEY - There are no cushions, but simply plank seats, like those provided for convicts.",44
326,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"I ought to say, however, that backed up by the Van Diemen's Land Company, this private. railway carries certain kinds of'ores at a considerably cheaper rate than that at which similar material is carried in Victoria. I cannot understand how any man, who believes in nationalized railways, can have the slightest hesitation in voting for the amendment. Those who support it may not win this time, but I am certain that we shall win in the future. One argument in favour of a national line of steamers is that we could then convey to this country desirable European settlers.",45
327,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"We could give, cheap passages. "" Mr Wilks - The honourable member for Melbourne talks about winning next time - doe s he observe that this contract is for ten years?",46
328,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"There may be some means of ending that contract. Will the honourable member for Dalley, bold as he is, venture to say what will be the political events of the next five years? The people ought to have the larger and greater power of the referendum.",46
329,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,The power to take over the ships is already in the agreement.,46
330,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"If we cnce have the referendum, we shall obtain everything we want. I take second place to no one in the desire to see Australia populated, but I wish to see the country filled with our white brethren. If the various States will not pass just land laws, the Commonwealth ought to have the dominant power to create a fair and equitable land system, whereby our own people may be enabled to settle; and then the country might be opened to our white European brethren from any part of-the world. I will go farther, and say that there ought to be a nationalized line of ships running between all the various ports of the .States. It is all very well say that the shipping companies lose year after year; but, in the confusion of combined interests, it is well nigh impossible to ascertain the real profit and loss. If I be present. I shall vote for the amendment, and, if absent, I shall pair in its favour.",46
331,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Laanecoorie) [6.11] The Postmaster-General and the honourable member for Richmond are to be congratulated on the excellent terms they have secured for the Commonwealth. I express that opinion the more heartilv because I realise that had it not been for the special effects put forth by those honourable members, and by the Government generally, we should possibly have been placed in a very awkward positior: as regards our oversea communication with the old country. This is a contract entered into with full knowledge on the part of those interested on both sides, and as the tender conditions provided for suggestions by any intending contractor, we may be sure that the terms are the very best that could be obtained under the present circumstances. For many reasons the agreement is a marked advance on any gained hitherto; and, it being so favourable, the public support is assured. In this connection a great deal depends on our own people. If the people of the Commonwealth and the people of the old country are prepared to help in every possible way those who do business with us under suchfavorable conditions, success is certain. Considering that we are beset on everv side by conflicting interests, in the shape of foreign competition, it is time that something was done to render more complete the relationship between us and the old country. I realise that the projected company will displace an old companv which has done business with Australia under very adverse circumstances for many years past. We have the word of the managing director of that company in Australia that its connection with this country has been very unprofitable to the shareholders. That, of course, is to Ibe regretted; and I agree with those who have referred to the debt of gratitude which the Commonwealth owes to the Orient and Pacific Steam Navigation Company for their splendid resistance, as long as possible, to the employment of black labour. I should like to see the whole mercantile marine of the Empire composed entirely of our own people; and, therefore, I feel some regret at parting, under such conditions, - with a companv which - has for to so many years provided an object lesson to other companies in this respect. Another condition in the agreement, which ought to satisfy those honourable members who are prepared to support the amendment, is one of a very safe character, providing that the Commonwealth mav at anv time buy out the contracting company, and take over the line of steamers.",46
332,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,We ought to have our own line of steamers.,46
333,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"The condition referred to is, in my opinion, the line of demarcation between those who think with the honourable member for Hindmarsh, and those who think as I do. Socialism must always be judged on its merits; that is to say, any socialistic proposal must standi the test of whether it will be a paying concernwhether it will pay the State. I know that the honourable member for Hindmarsh is prepared to have Socialism in everything; - but I am not. We have not sufficient evidence before us to warrant our adopting the amendment; and, therefore, I am not prepared to support it. As I said before, the - condition that we mav at any time take over the line ought to satisfy the supporters of the amendment.",46
334,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is that why the condition has been put in the agreement?,47
335,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I think such a condition is part of every such contract; at any rate, in my opinion, it ought to be part of every contract of the kind entered into between the State and private individuals.",47
336,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The similar tion in English contracts is inserted in view of war.,47
337,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"The matter was referred to previously in this House. Of course, we are working under somewhat different conditions to those which prevail in the mother-land, but I , at any rate, come the insertion of the stipulation, though I feel that it will be very many years before the Commonwealth will prepared to give it effect. I intend later to indicate very briefly why I think so. Referring to the conby tract, the penalties we have provided able to do so. for are quite sufficient to guarantee not only greater expedition, but also proper and thorough maintenance of the service. The honourable member for Barcarried, rier stated specifically that the suggestion contained in his amendment did not come from the Labour Party, or from any cialistic party, but from a Conservative wealth. member of the House of Commons. Mr. Henniker Heaton. We are all familiar with that honourable member's name, and are aware of the splendid efforts forth in a particular direction, which the honourable member for 'Barrier has followed to a certain extent in Australia. Some us, however, agree that the interjection made when the honourable member for Bartake rier uttered that statement was completely justified-that we find the most ultra-Conoffering servative very close indeed to the Socialist.",47
338,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I believe that Socialism is very conservative, since it tends to serve all that is noblest and best in community.",47
339,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I agree with the honcountry. orable member that in a sense it is conservative, but I think that, if Socialism adopted in its entirety, it would not tento conserve all that is highest and noblest in the community, but rather to bring us down to a very much lower level than, that which we occupy at the present time. One has only to read some of the publications with which we are now being favoured regarding the possibilities of the next 100 or 200 years of development to find cogent reasons for such a. belief as I have indicated. Whatever may be the genesis of the proposals contained in the amendment, no honourable member will deny that it is undoubtedly and essentially socialistic in character. It is purely and essentially a socialistic proposal, and should be discussed as such.",47
340,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,The same as the condicontrol of the railways.,47
341,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,And of the Post Office.,47
342,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I will not say that it is the same as the control of the Post Office or the railways. There is a very welmarked difference to be considered. In the alconduct of our railways and Postal Department our work is carried on within our be own borders. If we go outside our own borders to conduct business connected with the Postal Department, we find it is only international arrangement that we are",47

345,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Does the honourable member not admit that our produce departhe has put ments do that now?,47
346,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"The honourable member must surelv see that, if the amendment, of were carried, the Commonwealth shipswould not merely start from Australia and letters and other postal matter to the old country, but would take in, any cargo at ports of call on the way.",47
347,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,The South Australian Government send produce Home now. It conis possible for the producer in that State to the send through the Government a pound or two of butter or a crate of fowls to the old,47
348,Mr SALMON,Unknown,I ami afraid we are were talking of different things. It is one thing for the Government of South Australia to send produce to their Agent-General in London,47
349,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"No , not necessarily to the Agent-General.",48
350,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Well, to their accredited agents in London. But in doing so, they would be in a very different position from that which the Commonwealth Government would occupy in owning a line of steam-ships doing business with all and sundry on the route between here and the old country.",48
351,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,They would be able to do the work better than it is being done now - a profit. I refuse to accept such,48
352,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"That is purely a matter of opinion. The honourable member for Barrier, as Chairman of the Shipping Service Commission, has presented a very excellent report to the House. Though I have studied it, I regret to say that I have not vet completely mastered it. and possibly I never shall master the financial portions of it.",48
353,Mr WILKS,Unknown,I suppose that is why the honourable member calls it an excellent report?,48
354,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I agree that the honourable member for Dalley has hit upon one of the most frequent causes of expressions of admiration. ' It is not uncommon for persons who do not thoroughly understand a thing to assume that it is something remarkaby good. The honourable member for Barrier, in the report of the Commission, states that no definite and reliable figures were available to the Commission upon which to base an estimate. * That, in my opinion, is a confession which detracts very seriously from the importance of the financial portion of the report. The honourable member must realise, and, in fact, he has specifically stated in his that he cannot expect the Commonwealth to engage in an undertaking which will not be a profitable one. He informs us that the basis of the figures supplied by the Commission are mere estimates, and that they were unable to obtain the necessary information to supply a correct estimate of the total amount which it would cost the Commonwealth to take up this particular work. The honourable member, however, takes something for granted when he says- ® Private companies would not send vessels to Australia unless by doing so they hope make a profit. I make bold to sav that the hope that wewill make profits is one of the rocks upon, which our fortunes most frequently split.",48
355,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,But the honourable member will agree that no one sends ships out here without that hope?,48
356,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I agree with that, but that is no argument to use in support of soserious a proposal as that made by the honourable member. The honourable memberis not justified in asking the House to accept his proposal upon grounds so flimsy as that, because persons are sending vesselshere with the hope of making a profit, therefore, they must be making a profit, and the Commonwealth would make1 a statement ' as that as evidence. Later on, the honourable membertold us that the Peninsular and Oriental. Steam Navigation Company are highly prosperous. That, of course, we see on reference to their annual balance-sheet. If"" the honourable member could not get exact: figures, it may be taken for granted that I could not get them. It has been frequently stated that it is impossible to ascertain the amount of profit on their Australian trade, but 'it has been mentioned over and over again by Sir Thomas Sutherland, the Chairman of Directors, that that trade is unprofitable.",48
357,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Ye t the company goon building new ships, when more lines: of steamers are coming into competition with them.",48
358,Mr SALMON,Unknown,The Australian tradeof the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company is only a part of their Eastern trade.,48
359,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,What about other shipping lines?,48
360,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"It must be recollected by the honourable member that this comspeech pany's boats do not trade only between the United Kingdom and Australia, but doa very large trade with the East and in certain seasons carry a very large number of passengers to and from the East.",48
361,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,They arephilanthropists.,48
362,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I do not think so. I am glad to see that their balance-shept shows a profit. It is very probable that the line from Colombo to Australia-because, after all. that is all we ought to take into account-is not a paying part of to their business. The honourable member for Barrier went on to furnish certain calculalions which he had made. From these it would appear that it would cost £400,000 to build and equip each steamer that would be required for this trade.",48
363,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,That is an overthat - estimate.,49
364,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I do not know, but .am inclined to think that it is somewhere .about the mark. The honourable member for Barrier has not been able to get all :figures which he desired to obtain, - willing to accept his calculation.

366,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"The Government might - find it extremely difficult to charter a and the loss would be greater, possibly, - than the interest on the cost of constructing 'the boat which would be kept in reserve.",49
367,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is the company going to pay? ; have nine boats ?,49
368,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I do not anticipate that - the company would have to keep one boat in reserve all the time, but it would be a useful thing to have, at one end - other, a boat which could be put 'into use immediately when another boat had 'laid up for, perhaps, a month.",49
369,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,It would be useful 'have two boats.,49
370,Mr SALMON,Unknown,It would be more useing ful to have two boats.,49
371,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,The question is whether it would be business.,49
372,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"If the honourable members ""ber is prepared to sav that, in his' belief, eight boats would do the work, I shall my calculations upon that number.",49
373,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,In the report we said so.,49
374,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"For eight boats we should require the sum of £3,200.000, the honourable member has not indicated where the money 5s to come from.",49
375,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"They would not cost £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 each.",49
376,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"The - honourable memalways ber for Barrier has accepted that estimate, and for the purpose of my calculation shall accept it too. He has not indicated, ""however, where the monev is to come from.",49

I thought he was not prepared, under any circumstances, to pledge the credit of the I Commonwealth for any sum. Yet I find that when he comes along with a little pet project of his own he is prepared to pledge the the credit of the Commonwealth in order but I am to raise the necessary funds.",49
379,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"At any time. I am preone boat pared to pay £90,000 instead of will be admitted £120,000 a year.",49
380,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Fro m my point of the socialistic proposition of the honourable member is not to be considered, bemarcause, in the first place, we have no evidence that the service would pay, and in the second place, it would compel the Commonwealth to borrow money for the conboat, struction of the vessels. These two objections are fatal to his contention.",49
381,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,Has the honourable member any evidence that it would not,49
382,Mr SALMON,Unknown,It is not the business of myself or of any other honourable member to come down here and produce evior the dence that it would not pay.,49
383,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,In their report the to be Royal Commission say it would pay !,49
384,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"It is the duty of those to who submit such a proposition to offer irrefragible evidence that it would be a paybusiness for the Commonwealth to enter into. In the course of his speech, the honourable member for Barrier made several remarks concerning the protectionist memof the House to which I do not intend to refer more than to say that at any rate base the three great bodies from whom he expected opposition did not find many recruits have from the party to which I belong. He said that he expected that vested interests would be too strong, that prejudice would but be too powerful, that ignorance would be too rampant, to allow his proposition tc be carried. There is something which apparently he did not expect, and that is a feeling of common sense, which I hope will obtain amongst a majority of honourable members concerning any proposals of I this character. I trust that we shall never be prepared to pledge the credit of the Commonwealth in order to start a fleet of In vessels across the sea, or to enter into a business, unless it is justified by circumstances and we are absolutely assured that it would pay. Not only does the honourable member for Barrier contend that the undertaking would be of a paying character, but also that it would be in the best interests of the Commonwealth to carry on this business. That is where the honourable member and I disagree.",49
385,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"Did not the honourable member say in his electorate, about twelve months ago, that he was prepared to support a Commonwealth line of steamers?",50
386,Mr SALMON,Unknown,I would be very surprised if the honourable member could bring me evidence that I made that statement.,50
387,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,The honourable member is reported to have said so.,50
388,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Perhaps the honourable member is thinking of something which occurred in the House three years ago when I strongly urged that we should subsidize a line of steamers to South Africa, for the purpose of getting, our produce there on something like fair terms. was a proposition of a very different character.

389,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,I saw the statement in one of the Melbourne newspapers. I was surprised when I saw it.,50
390,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I should be intensely surprised, too. Mr Wilks . ' - It was said in reference to fighting a shipping combine.",50
391,Mr SALMON,Unknown,Is that so?,50
392,Mr WILKS,Unknown,That is how it was ported.,50
393,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Ver y possibly; but we have not a combine, but a proposal which is of quite a different character. have from the Government a business like proposition, which has been referred to in laudatory terms from one end of tihe 'Commonwealth to the other. Honourable members and the press generally have practicallv been falling over each other in order to pour their congratulations upon the Government and the two Ministers immediately concerned in the matter.. I do not desire to delav the House. I feel perfectly, satisfied ffhat ' if the contract fas carried out in the spirit in which it has been entered into we needl have no fear for the future with regard to communication between Australia and the old country, and especially with regard to the carriage of our produce, which we desire to see placed upon the London and other markets in the best possible condition. Sitting susf ended from 6.30 to 7.30 f.iih",50
394,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,"Moreton) [7.30] When the last mail contract was under discussion in this Chamber, I , in common with other representatives of Queensland, found fault because it contained a condition which, in our opinion, should not have been inserted. The condition to which I refer provides that the steamers now carrying on the mail service shall come beyond Adelaide-the port at which mails are landed and embarked, and to and from which they are transmitted through the eastern States by means of the railways-to take cargo at Melbourne and Sydney. The Government in framing the present contract have admitted the force of that objection, because they stipulate that the service shall end with the transmission of mails to and from Adelaide. Indeed, if But that the Postmaster-General had not insisted upon certain conditions as to the tonnage of the vessels, I think that we should have had no complaint to make against the contract. The fact that steamers of 11.000 tens burden must be employed', and certain refrigerating and cargo space provided still gives Queensland a ground of complaint, because it makes apparent an attempt to provide a service for the other States. Queensland being left out, since steam-ship companies are not likely to send their vessels there, unless they obtain from that State a substantial subsidy in addition to that paid by the Commonwealth. reAlthough Queensland has gained some material advantages by joining the Union, it cannot be denied that she has also suffered greatlv by doing so, and more consideraWe tion should have been given to her interests in this matter. In the agreement it is stipulated that the mail steamers shall be each of 11,000 tons register, and capable of steaming at a minimum speed of is knots per hour. I have .no objection 1 to the stipulation as to speed; but if a mail service alone is required, I do not see the need for the stipulation as to tonnage, because very much smaller vessels would be sufficiently large for the carriage of our mails. To my mind, the condition regarding tonnage has been*, inserted in order that vessels mav be provided which will be sufficientlv large to serve the oversea trade of Fremantle, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, Brisbane being left out of consideration. I should have liked to see more attention given to the recommendations of the Shipping Commission. In mv opinion, we should have tried to obtain mail ships of our own. Britain, which subsidizes mail services on the Atlantic and Pacific, and to all parts of the world, reserves the right to use the vessels as transports or cruisers in time of international trouble. Similarly, if this country had a fleet for the conveyance of its mails oversea, it would secure, in addition to other advantages, that of having under its control a number of vessels which could be used to protect our commerce in time of war. My chief complaint, however, is that the proposed subsidy is to be paid largely to secure a passenger and cargo service for the ports on the western and southern coasts of Australia, and as far north on the eastern coast as Sydney. The steamers are not likely to go to Brisbane, particularly as New Zealand is talking of subsidizing the same line. If Queensland wants a line of her own, she will have to pay a considerable sum to get it. Although an ardent advocate of Federation. I am beginning to think that Queensland made a mistake in not standing alone. We never had a better mail and cargo service than when the vessels of the British-India Companv steamed from Brisbane up our eastern coast, and through Torres Straits, giving a service to the East as well as to Europe.",50
395,Sir TOHN FORREST,Unknown,Why was that service not maintained ?,51
396,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,"We paid a subsidy of -£60,000 a year for that mail service, and, as we are but a mere handful of people, could not afford to continue the subsidv subsequent to Federation. If the States were separate again, however, we could afford to pay the same amount in subsidizing a similar service. Queensland has ports other than Brisbane, some of them of almost as much importance. We have Rockhampton, which affords an outlet for almost as larce an area of country as does_ Brisbane. Then, again, Cairns is the port for a tract of territory the potentialities of which are not known even to Queenslanders, much less to residents in the southern States. Townsville is also another important seaport, and beyond Cape Yorke other harbors have behind them, along the rivers discharging into the Gulf of Carpentaria, some of the richest country on the continent. I submit that, in the conditions laid down by the Government. Queensland has been entirely left out of consideration. The people of that State will be taxed unfairly and unjustly to the Great extent that they will be called upon to contribute to a subsidy for a service from which they will derive very little advantage. They will probably be called upon to pay an additional subsidy in order to induce the owners of the new mail steamers to visit their ports and carry away their produce. I understand that the Prime Minister is still in communication with the contractors with reference to the extension of the service to Brisbane. It appears to me that something more than a mail service is contemplated, that the Government have considered not only the carriage of our mails to other parts of the world, but also the question of providing facilities for the conveyance of our perishable products to markets beyond the seas. In no part of Australia is the export trade developing to the same extent that it has done in Queensland during the last few years, and in any contract for other than a mail service the claims of that State should have been taken fully into account. If it were intended that Ihe new service should be arranged solely with a view to the conveyance of our mails, why should conditions have been laid down as to the tonnage of the steamers and the provision of refrigerated space? For a mail service pure and simple it would have been necessary to stipulate merely that the mails should be taken on board and delivered at certain specified ports within a given time. The contract, however, goes far beyond that. It is required that the steamers shall be of a certain tonnage, that they shall maintain a. certain rate of speed, that certain machinery shall be provided, and that the plans of the vessels shall be submitted for the approval of the Postmaster-General. Why ? It is clear that the new service is intended to provide not merely for the carriage of 'mails, but for the conveyance of perishable products from our ports to the markets of the world. Under these circumstances, I contend that Queensland had a right to be considered as well as Western Australia. South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. Fremantle is to be the first and last port of call in Australia, and Adelaide, the present terminus of our railway system, is to be the final port, so far as the conveyance of mails is concerned. We know, however, that neither at Fremantle nor Adelaide will the new steamers be able to obtain a sufficient amount of cargo to make it worth their while to trade out here. The Prime Minister and the Postmaster-General knew very well that the contractors would find it necessary to extend their service to Melbourne and Sydney in order to secure freight and passengers. I think that steamers, whether subsidized or otherwise, coming to Australia by either the Torres Straits or the southern route will eventually have to call at Queenscellent land ports in order to fill their holds with cargo. That, however, is not the point. The agreement entered into by the Government is not for a mail contract only. That is the objection that was taken by the representatives of Queensland when the last mail contract was under discussion, and that is the position that I am assuming now. The conditions imposed upon the contractors make it almost imperative that their steamers shall call at Melbourne and Sydney, whereas Brisbane has been left out in the cold. I do not wish to embarrass the Government in amy way, or to make it more difficult for them to come to terms with one of the great shipping companies for the carriage of our mails to the old country, but I do not think the fairest possible bargain has been made in the interests of the whole Commonwealth. If time had permitted, and the conditions had been favourable, I should have preferred to adopt the recommendation of the Shipping Service Commission, and to arrange for the mail service to be carried out by means of steamers chartered or owned by the Commonwealth. I do not think that any such arrangement is within the possibilities of the immediate future, but I contend that equal justice should have been measured out to everv State in the Union. I am not speaking for Queensland only, because I feel that Tasmania has also been left out in the cold. I supDose that some of the mail steamers will call at Tasmanian ports in order to add to their cargo, and that the contractors will also find it to their advantage to proceed to Brisbane. But there is nothing in the terms of the contract to compel them to do so, whereas they will be obliged to go to Melbourne and Svdnev. Under a mail contract pure and simple there should be no necessity to submiif the plans of the proposed steamers for the approval of the Government. It would have been sufficient to renuire the contractors to take our mails on board at certain ports, and deliver them at other norfs within a specified time. The Mr Wilkinson. conditions laid down place the agreement entirely beyond the category of a mail contract, and I conceive that everv State has a right to share in the advantages conferred by it.",51
397,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [7.48]. - Jus t prior to the dinner hour the honourable member for Laanecoorie expressed the opinion that the Government had made exterms with the contractors. From the point of view of Ministers, possibly that statement mav be correct, but we have to consider whether it would not be possible to improve the conditions. I think that that could be done. If the Commonwealth mails could be profitably carried by a company, the service could, with equal advantage, be undertaken by the State. The honourable member for Parramatta told us that the company that were taking the new contract in hand were entirely new to this business. Therefore, they are on exactly the same footing that the Commonwealth would occupy if we decided to carry on the service for ourselves. The honourable member for Laanecoorie stated that there was no comparison between the conveyance of mails upon Government railways and the performance of similar work by State-owned steamers. The reason which he advanced was that we were going outside our own boundaries. I should like to point out to him that in South Australia, and the other States today, we are doing business outside our own boundaries-busines s with the old country, which I hope will continue to increase. In South Australia, we have established a depot to which the producer cansend a crate of fowls, a few pounds of butter, or other produce, and so soon as it has entered the depot, the Government assume! tontrol of it, ship it to the old country, and return him any profit that mav accrue from the transaction, whilst, if a loss be incurred, he is charged with it. In the past, the difficulty experienced has been to get our produce carried to the foreign market in first-class condition. Another difficulty has been to get reasonable terms, and it would be entirely in the interests of the producers if we established a Commonwealth line of steamers, not only for the purpose of carrying, our mails, but for the purpose of giving them far better terms than they can obtain under private enterprise. In this connection, I have only to mention the enormous charges which have been levied by the mail companies for the carriage of butter to the old country. To-day, those steamers are carrying that commodity at something like half the freight which they formerly changed. Of course, we are told that butter is being carried at a loss, just as we are assured that the Orient Steam Navigation Company's enterprise results in a loss, but I am very doubtful of the accuracy of that statement. The honourable member for Laanecoorie desired to know if a national line of mail steamers would pay. I do not want to see a Commonwealth service established which will pay in the sense that a service conducted by private enterprise pays. What I desire to know is, "" Can we, without loss, offer our producers better terms, and carry our mails much cheaper than they are being carried at the present time?"" T am quite convinced that we can. I do not know whether the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier will command a majority, but I shall certainlv vote for it. It will not be my fault if it does not obtain a majority. Those who desire to see us obtain the best terms for the carriage of our mails and our produce, should support the honourable member for Barrier. We have been repeatedly told that the trade of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company and Orient Steam Navigation Companv is an unprofitable one. ' Yet, we find that shipping company after shipping company is not only coming here to compete in what is alleged to be an unprofitable business, but, after engaging in the trade, is building steamer after steamer. I can quite understand the Orient Steam Navigation Companv declaring that they have not made a profit upon their Australian business. That may be so, but I would point out that some of those who are chiefly interested in that company, receive very large salaries as managers, dwell in magnificent palaces, and live like princes. They do not do that upon the losses which are incurred in the Australian trade. If I were conducting a large business, and received a large salary as manager, I would not grumble if I did not obtain a dividend. . It would not matter to me whether I was receiving £ 5 , 0 0 0 a year as manager, or the same amount in dividends.",52
398,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Whic h of the managers of the mail companies receive £5,000?",53
399,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I know of other companies whose managers receive that amount. I know of one industry in Western Australia, the chief director of which is receiving a salary of £ 5 , 0 0 0 per annum. I refer to the timber industry. I do not know what salary the manager of the Orient Steam Navigation Companv receives, but I am quite sure that if his dividends were taken into consideration, he is getting considerably more than £ 5 , 0 0 0 a - year.",53
400,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Oh , no.",53
401,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,Is it not possible that' there is a commission for superintendence?,53
402,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"That is very probable. Let us suppose that a national line of steamers did not pay. What right have we to ask a company to embark upon an enterprise in connection with which we propose to pay a very' large subsidy, if we know full well that, despite that subsidy, it will not pay?. I am very unwilling to believe that shrewd business men like Sir James Laing and Sons are prepared to sink an enormous amount of capital in the construction of a line of steamers if they are satisfied that the undertaking will result in a certain loss: Seeing that the inhabitants of the Commonwealth would derive any benefit which might flow from the establishment of a national line of steamers, I hold that if the enterprise resulted in a loss it is only fair that they should be called upon to bear it. Throughout Australia today the cry of a large section of the community is, "" Let us have immigrants. Let us spend money in bringing them here."" I should like any money which may be spent in defraying the passages of immigrants to Australia to go to our own line of steamers. We are asked to pay an enormous subsidy to a line of steamers for carrying our mails, and then-if I can judge of the temper of the liberal portion of the community-to bring to the Commonwealth a large number of immigrants whose passages would cost an amount sufficient to build a large fleet of our own. We have only to look at the historv of immigration schemes in Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia to ascertain what they have cost. With the sum which has been expended upon them we could have had our own line of steamers running to-dav. Whether the undertaking wouldl prove directly remunerative is immaterial. Even if it could be shown that there would not be a monetary profit straight away, the proposal would not stand condemned in my eyes. As the Shipping Commission has pointed out, the large subsidy which we are now paying for the carriage of our mails is being paid for the exclusive benefit of our commercial community. If it were not for that section of the communitv we need not insist upon securing an accelerated mail service at all. The report of the Commission statesI t does not appear that outside the class mentioned the general community would, to any material extent, be inconvenienced by the adoption of the poundage system. A few days' delav in the delivery j n Great Britain of private correspondence, which occupies some five weeks in completing the whole journey, can rarely involve hardship either to the writers or recipients of such correspondence. Moreover, the heavy subsidy now being paid for the conveyance of oversea mails conflicts with the principle which the Department usually follows in regard to inland mails-that each service shall pay its way. Any deficiency in postal revenue must be made good out of Customs and Excise taxationI want honourable members to take particular notice of thatand as the} bulk of this taxation is paid by the masses who rarely use the subsidized service, we think some effort should be made to re-adjust charges, so that the burden of the subsidy may fal l upon those who are directly benefited by it.",53
403,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,Do not the masses benefit indirectlv by the present service?,54
404,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"No . I ask the honourable member to look around the circle of his acquaintances, and to point to one who derives any' benefit, either dttrectlv or indirectly, as the result of the mail steamers reaching Australia a day or two earlier than would otherwise be the case. But every one would benefit by the adoption of the poundage system, seeing that it would effect a saving of -^""80,000 annuallv. There is not a single acquaintance of mine-and I have a few hundred scattered throughout the Commonwealthwho would suffer loss by the adoption of the poundage system.",54
405,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Wit h the exception of that friend of the honourable member's-the merchant prince-in South Australia. "" Mr HUTCHISON - I will give another illustration. T fincf that at the Premiers' Conference-carryin g out the idea of the Shipping Commission, that the cost of the mail service ou^ht to be borne by those who benefit by it ' Mr Mahon - The Premiers' Conference was held before the Commission reported.",54
406,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I am aware of that. At the Premiers' Conference Mr. Carruthers statedI f the Commonwealth will impose duties on tea and kerosene and hypothecate or earmark the revenue from those duties for old-age pensions we shall get in a simple way a contribution from the classes who most largely are the recipients of those pensions. The demand is always made that the poor shall contribute to the cost of any scheme from which the community is to receive a benefit. The honourable member is one of those who would seek to shift the burden of this subsidy on to the shoulders of the poor-wh o receive no gain from it-b v requiring that any loss should be made good out of Customs and Excise revenue. At the same Conference, the Premier of Victoria, Mr Bent, saidIt is the view of the Victorian Government that it would be well for us at this stage to urge that the people who obtain the pensions should contribute a little through the duties 0.1 kerosene and tea. That is the way with some legislators! They would shift these burdens on to the backs of those who have become poor in making others wealthy.",54
407,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Do they not already contribute by way of the duties on narcotics and stimulants?,54
408,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"They contribute in every direction, and the Opposition wiil not assist us to remove some of these burdens from their shoulders.",54
409,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,They contribute more largely through a heavv Tariff.,54
410,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"As the result of the reduction in the telegraphic rates-and very few poor people use the service to any extent-ther e was a loss amounting to £11,000 in South Australia, and £11,000 in Queensland, during the year before last. That reduction was made entirely in the interests of the commercial classes, and the poor have to make good the loss so occasioned. It is time that we had something different.",54
411,Mr WILKS,Unknown,And the honourable member has been fighting for the manufacturer just as keenly as others have been fighting for the commercial classes.,54
412,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I have been fighting"" both for the manufacturer and the worker. I am not particularly anxious to protect the manufacturer, unless he is prepared to protect the labour employed by him. By way of further illustrating the point I wish to make, I would quote the statement made at the Conference of Premiers by Mr Davies, Attorney-General for Victoria, who emphasized what the Premiers of Victoria and New South Wales had said. Referring to the old-age pension fund, he statedWe do not propose that it should be raised by some tax from the payment of which those who wou'cl get the chief benefit of it would be exempted. If this system is to be adopted, then it is time that the commercial classes, who will reap the benefit of the accelerated mail service, should be called upon to contribute the larger subsidy that we may have to pay. T am sorry that the honourable member for Barrier is not likelv to carry his amendment, but I am glad that there is in the contract a provision .giving the Commonwealth power to take over these steamers whenever the Parliament mav decide to do so. We are nearing a general election, and it is possible that the honourable member for Barrier, if defeated on 1 the present occasion, may be successful in the next Parliament. One of the provisions of the contract of which I do not altogether approve is that which calls upon the contractors to provide a guarantee of only £ 2 7 , 5 0 0. Having regard to the extent of the speculation, that is a very small sum.",54
413,Mr WILKS,Unknown,It is a mere bagatelle.,55
414,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,In the circumstances it is.,55
415,Mr EWING,Unknown,Usually there is no deposit.,55
416,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"- H ad the Governments responsible for other contracts looked after the interests of the country they would have insisted upon a substantial guarantee being given in each case. Still, there is no comparison between the existing established mail service and a purely speculative company.",55
417,Mr EWING,Unknown,They are not speculative. Sir James Laing and Sons Limited are as strong as the Orient Steam Navigation Company.,55
418,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"They will be as strong as the Orient Steam Navigation Companv when they succeed with this contract. There is no proof, however, that they are going to carry on the venture. They are possibly going to sell the concession-jus t as many Government concessions are hawked about and sold-to someone who may not be quite as capable of fulfilling it as they are.",55
419,Mr WILKS,Unknown,L a in g and Sons Limited are only speculative ship-builders.,55
420,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Oh , no.",55
421,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I have sufficient faith in them to believe that if they retained the contract entirely in their own hands they would carry it: out successfully, but we have no guarantee that they will. I am not in favour of the contract- I prefer something that would be better for the community. I am in favour of a national line of steamers which would carry out a patriotic work in a way that is not done today by many ship-owners. Much to the detriment of our mercantile marine, we have steamers employing large numbers of lascars in doing work which could be much better performed by white labour. The Orient Steam Navigation Company say that they employed them, not because they are cheaper, but because they are more amenable to conditions. Have honourable members ever seen the lascars on the mail steamers taking a meal ? Have they seen them gathered round a tub of food without knives or forks, and plunging their hands into it? They behave like hogs. It is not for the benefit of the lascars that these steam-ship companies employ them. It is shocking to see them eating on these vessels.",55
422,Mr LIDDELL,Unknown,"I have seen them many a time, and they are quite as clean as the honourable member is.",55
423,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"The honourable member does not know what he is talking about. They never trouble to wash their hands before sitting down to a meal. If the honourable member thinks that they are so clean, I shall avail myself of the first opportunity to secure for him an invitation to dine with them, whilst I look on. Under our mail contracts we must have white labour, as long as we have a Liberal Government in power. There is little likelihood of the Opposition gaining office; but ' f they did, the white labour section in the Post and Telegraph Act would be struck out.",55
424,Mr R EDWARDS,Unknown,Do not say that.,55
425,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,The Opposition tell us that they would strike it out.,55
426,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,They only say that.,55
427,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"They mean what they say; but, happily, they are not in a position to carry out their desire in that respect. The position in regard to our mercantile marine is so bad that if we were called upon to take part in the great struggle that must come in the near future we should not have sufficient men to man our ships. And yet, year after year, the lascars employed on mail steamers are increasing. Do I want lascars to fight for my hearth and home? Do those who have property wish to entrust them with it? Nothing of the kind ! Purely patriotic considerations should lead us to recognise that it is time we established a Commonwealth-owned line of steamers, in which we could train seamen, not for the British 1 Navy, but for our own Australian Navy. As the result of the establishment of such a line of mail steamers, the rebate system would disappear. We know what the mail companies have done in the past. gentleman alone has got something like £ 1 2 , 0 0 0 in commission and rebates. Andfor what? For cheating the producers of this country by compelling them to allow him to ship all their butter and other produce at far more than would be a reasonable figure for carrying at.",55
428,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Governmen t railways have also been paying rebates. """,56
429,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I am just as much opposed to them when paid by a Government ; and I am quite sure that when the railways of this country belong to the Commonwealth, as one day they will, the rebate system will be ended. The Commonwealth could not, under the Constitution, allow them to be paid. not been for the statements made in opposition to the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier, I should not have had much to say upon this proposal. I am not opposed to the contract itself, although I believe that there is room for amendment in it. It is a little bit onesided. It leans rather to the side of the contractors.",56
430,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The honourable member does not believe in the principle of subsidies.,56
431,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I would not pay subsidies at all. I would devote the money to the maintenance of a Government line of steamers. The British Government at one time believed in paying subsidies, but now it has discontinued them on the American lines of steamers. A Commonwealth-owned line of steamers would prevent a shipping combine fro m fleecing our producers in the way they have done. The very fact of the new line coming into existence will insure much fairer charges being made to our exporters, who at present are being treated most unfairly. Fair play is not at present being accorded to our coastal trade. To my way of thinking as a layman-and my view is backed up by the soundest legal opinion that can be obtained in this country-w e provided by Act of Parliament that when over-sea steamers engaged in the coastal traffic they should pay the same rates of wages as our local shipowners have to pay. That was a fair provision. Commonwealth-owned steamers would pay the wages rates ruling in the Commonwealth, and that in'.itself would be an advantage to those, ship-owners who are at present carrying on our coastal trade. One I am astonished that the Commonwealth Government has refused to do justice in this connection. They are not likely to do justice until such time as a stronger party from my side of the House is able to compel them. We cannot compel them to do it at present.",56
432,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Why not?,56
433,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Because , unfortunately, we have not the numbers. I only wish that we had the power that the honourable member for Parramatta sometimes suggests that we have. I can assure him that if we had it we should use it to compel a good many things to be done that are at present undone. Is there any plank in our platform that is being advocated by the GoHad it vernment at the present moment? Not one ! I may add that, although personally I advocate the nationalizing of our mail services, the Labour Party as a party has not said that it is in favour of nationalizing them, or, in fact, of ' nationalizing, any other industry. All that it has said is that it is in favour of nationalizing monopolies. Before we nationalize monopolies, we have first to obtain the power, and, secondly, to prove that a monopoly exists. I go somewhat further than that, and say that I am prepared to nationalize anv undertaking at the earliest moment whether it has been proved to be a monopoly or not, if , by so doing, we can secure a better service to the community for the money expended'. . P'or the reasons I have given, I shall have the greatest pleasure in supporting the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier.",56
434,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"Fremantle) [8.16]. - I am very anxious to see the next order of the day dealt with, so that I shall not occupy much time upon the matter under discussion : but I cannot give a vote without stating in a few words the position which I occupy, and foreshadowing an amendment which I intend to move. Speaking generally, I approve of the contract which the Government proposes to make. On the whole, Ministers may be congratulated upon having made a fair bargain under the conditions that exist today in the shipping world. There are some provisions in the contract which many honourable members would like to see much more in our favour; but we know that in dealing with the gentlemen who control the shipping trade we have to do with men who wield considerable power, and who can. be of great service to us if that power is properly directed, whilst they can, and sometimes do, work considerable mischief, involving great loss to the people whom they are supposed to serve. It is something to find that, in spite of all that has been said by the croakers in and out of Australia",56
435,Mr WILKS,Unknown,What croakers does the honourable member mean?,57
436,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"Chiefl y the opposition croakers-the gentlemen who have been referred to as ""the stinking fish party,"" who go about and tell the people in the old country that Australia is a place to be avoided because there happens to be here a Labour Party which is bringing general ruin in its train.",57
437,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman's party is continually describing Australia as a cancer or a living lie, and several things of the kind.",57
438,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"I hope that the honourable member, and those who are actyears ing with him, have altogether dissociated ship companies. themselves from that party.",57
439,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Most certainly.,57
440,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,I am glad to hear it. It is a comfort after all the abuse which Australia has been subjected to find that there are still some business men have sufficient confidence in the future Australia to invest a few million pounds in. a shipping service to carry the trade which they know Australia is in a position to do with the other side of the world.,57
441,Mr WILKS,Unknown,If the interest on the outgraph lay be guaranteed by a subsidy.,57
442,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"I do not know to whether we are guaranteeing the interest. I am personally glad that the much-disperiod cussed white labour provision has been cepted as a matter of course. I do not know whether there has been any contention between the contracting parties on the point; but, remembering that at the present day there are some honourable members of this House who are telling the public that they intend at the first opportunity to wipe this provision out of the Post and Telegraph ' Act-and who refer to it as a piece of folly - it is something to find that in making a new agreement for ten years with a new company, the condition as' to white labour is accepted without any demur. I desire to call attention to clause 6 of the contract, which is not quite clear to my mind', and on which I should like a few words of explanation. That clause provides that if during the sixth year of the contract, any competing line of mail steamers is performing the journey in a shorter time than is the contracting company, the Postmaster General may call on the latter to similiarly accelerate the service. That is a very wise provision up to that point; but I desire particularly to draw attention to the fact that under paragraphs b and c of clause 6, there is an assumption that if the contracting company give the accelerated service, they must, as a matter of course, receive some additional payment or compensation. Apparently it does not matter under the clause whether or not the accelerated speed involves any additional cost to the contracting company. We all know that it is quite possible that the adoption of a new fuel may render possible a speedier service at the same expense. For instance, oil as a fuel for steam-ships is coming to the front; and the next few may see its general adoption by steamI am not quite sure whether the use of oil fuel today means an increase or a decrease in cost; at any rate,. it is quite possible that there .may be found some means of accelerating: the speed withtoout incurring any additional expenditure. who Paragraph b of clause 6 provides that the of increased amount to be paid to the contractors for providing the improved and accelerated service shall be taken for granted, whether the contractors are put to any additional cost or not, or even if , by the change, a saving is effected. Then parac of clause 6 provides that with any such action on the part of the Government bring about an accelerated service, provision shall be made for extending the for which the improved' service shall accontinue. If I rightly understand paragraph c, it means that if the Government at any time after the sixth year of the contract, call on the contractors to run their vessels at a quicker speed, there is to be an extension of the period of the contract.",57
443,Mr EWING,Unknown,"No , not to that extent; the paragraph simply means that it might be wise to extend the time in order to get better conditions.",58
444,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The arbitrators would settle that.,58
445,Mr EWING,Unknown,"But still, the Government could do nothing in the way of giving the contractors further payment, or an extension of time, without the approval of Parliament. Parliament virtually approves of the agreement before us, and no Government could interfere with the agreement without the approval of Parliament.",58
446,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"But by this - clause, the Postmaster-General is given power to call on the contractors for an accelerated speed, and the paragraph lays down the conditions on which that accelerated speed shall be supplied.",58
447,Mr EWING,Unknown,I am quite satisfied that no Postmaster-General or Government would interfere with this contract without the approval of Parliament. The honourable member may take that as absolutely correct,58
448,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"It would not be an interference with the contract, but carrying out the contract; and I ask the Postmaster-General to look more closely into the clause. To me, it appears quite plain from the wording that if we exercise the power of calling on the company for a quicker service during the sixth year or after it",58
449,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Not after the sixth year.,58
450,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"It is plain to me that if, during the sixth year, an accelerated service is asked for, it can be supplied only on our observing the conditions laid down in paragraphs b and c of clause 6; and these paragraphs tie us down to giving inincreased remuneration and an extension of the period of the contract.",58
451,Mr EWING,Unknown,"That is only possible, subject to the approval of Parliament.",58
452,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"If the Minister is quite sure that this would be regarded as an interference with the contract, and would therefore require to be brought before Parliament, I am prepared to accept his statement.",58
453,Mr EWING,Unknown,I do not think there can be any doubt about it.,58
454,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"As I read the clause, I believe it would not be considered an interference at all, and we should be tying ourselves down to something which might prove to be very irksome in the future. With reference to the amendment, I wish to say that I recognise the excellent work which has been done by the honourable member for Barrier, and the members of the Commission of which he was chairman. They have rendered Australia a service by the very extensive inquiry they have made, and by producing a report from which it is evident to any unbiased mind that the scheme they recommend is a practicable one, and that the Commonwealth Government might own and run a line of steamers to do their own work, and the work of the producers of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has pointed out that State ownership and control Of a line of steamers is not a part of the labour platform. I am pledged according to that platform to advocate the nationalization of monopolies, but the oversea shipping service cannot certainly be classed as a monopoly.",58
455,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,It is not far off it.,58
456,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"I admit that \ i may come very near to being a monopoly, and that by-and-by we may be subjected to the control of a shipping combination.",58
457,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,It is quite as much a monopoly as are some of the businesses that have been so described.,58
458,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Every bit as much.,58
459,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"I am not preparer! to argue that question now. I have considered the matter for some time, and I am bound to confess that I think there is a distinction between a monopoly, as generally understood, and a line of steamers competing with other lines on the high seas. I was going to say that I regret that it would not be possible under such an agreement as that before us to have some understanding with the company that they should not by any action of theirs become a part of a monopoly; that they should not, while enjoving a subsidy from the Commonwealth, inflict uoon the people of Australia the evils which a shipping monopoly can and does inflict.",58
460,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Is the honourable member prepared to vote that they shall not join the shipping ring in England?,58
461,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,I will tell the honourable member directly what I propose to do.,58
462,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"If the honourable member would do that he would kill this contract, and it might as well be killed by that way as by the honourable member's proposal.",58
463,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"As soon as ever we had any indication that this company has become connected with the Shipping Conference, as it is called, but which is merely the respectable name for a shipping combine, the Government should have power to take over the company's boats at once, and run them as a Commonwealth concern. No one would then support them more strongly than I should.",59
464,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I suppose the business would then become a monopoly ?,59
465,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,It would be part of a monopoly.,59
466,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,That would be the dividing line.,59
467,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"I do not wish to place myself in a position of antagonism to the acceptance of this contract, which I think offers the best terms we can get under existing conditions, but I still desire to protect the people of Australia from any combination between the new company and existing companies, which would place them at the mercy of a capitalistic combine. I therefore give notice that I will move the following amendment: That the following words be added to the motion, "" and is of opinion that the Government should at the earliest possible date acquire and control any approved steamers built pursuant to this contract in order to provide the producers of the Commonwealth with cheap and rapid carriage of sea-borne goods.""",59
468,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,The contract already provides for that.,59
469,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,The contract gives the Government power to acquire the steamers.,59
470,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,We had better wait until we see what they are like.,59
471,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,The amendment which I propose to move forestalls the honourable and learned member's objection.,59
472,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"It would be member's amendment. buying a pig in a poke. ' Mr CARPENTER - The honourable and learned member for Angas perhaps did not hear the amendment I intend to proBarrier, pose. I propose to use the words "" acquire and control any approved steamers built pursuant to this contract."" I do not supobtained pose that the Government would buy a pig in a poke, as the honourable member for North Sydney has put it . I intend to mit the amendment as indicating what wish the Government to do.",59
473,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,The honourable member proposes that the Government may talke two of the steamers and permit the rest to go on with the trade.,59
474,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"It must not be forgotten that, according to the terms of the proposed contract, the Government will have power to buy all or any of the steamers constructed by the company.",59
475,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Would it be fair to leave them in possession of only half their steamers ?,59
476,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"The Government will have that power if we approve of this contract. I am merely, in my amendment, including what the agreement already provides for with the proviso that we express the opinion, while accepting the contract, that the Government should, at the earliest possible moment, exercise the power of purchase wihich it gives them.",59
477,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Who is to decide what will be the earliest possible moment?,59
478,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,The Government; who else would decide that?,59
479,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I take it that the honourable member suggests that we should acquire the whole fleet engaged in carrying on the service.,59
480,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"We should acquire a sufficient number of the boats to enable the service to be continued, but I do not desire that the Commonwealth Government should be bound down to the purchase of any and every ship which the company might build or acquire.",59
481,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The amendment of the honourable member for Barrier is better than that proposed by the honourable member.,59
482,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,I hope that if he thinks so the honourable member for Dalley will vote for the amendment of the honourable .member for Barrier.,59
483,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"I do not believe in it, but I think it is better than the honourable",59
484,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"If the honourable member does not believe in the amendment moved by the honourable member for he will, no doubt, vote against it. What I propose is merely that we should accept the contract as the best that can be for the time being, whilst we think that the Government should have the power, and should have an expression of opinion 1 subfrom this House that they should exercise I that power, as soon as they think fit, to acquire and control these steamers.",59
485,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The member suggests that in substitution of the - amendment moved by the honourable member for Barrier?,60
486,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"Yes . I am opposed to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barrier, and I shall submit in preference to it the amendment which I have suggested, which expresses my - own view.",60
487,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Kennedy) [8.35] The honourable member for Barrier, as well - as the members of the Shipping Service 'Commission, of .which he was the chairman, may, I think, be very well satisfied ""with the report they have presented, when they take into consideration the criticisms which have been levelled against it. The - only serious attempt to criticise that report was that made by the Age 'newspaper, and the honourable member for Barrier, when speaking the other day, - flattened that criticism out in such a way as 1 to afford sufficient justification for the cision arrived at by the Commission. I may say in passing that it has taken the proprietors of the Age a couple of issues to gracefully retreat from the position taken up by that newspaper in criticising the report. There has, in fact, been no - criticism of the report to which any member of the Commission can take exception. If it had been possible to criticise it - severely, honourable members of the Opposition, the section of the press opposed to the nationalization of the shipping and - other industries, and especially the anti'Socialists, would have taken a stronger stand against it than they have done up to the present. One matter connected with the criticism of the report to which I should like to refer, is the fact that a letter was published in one of the newspapers, over the signature, I think, of Mr Kenneth Anderson, who made a very strong point of the fact that the members of the Commission arrived at conclusions which are, in his opinion, erroneous, and which he thinks they would not have arrived at had they seen, as they might have done, the balance sheets of the Orient Compamv. I mention this matter now in order that the position - of the members of the Commission may be - clearly explained. It is true that we had an opportunitv to see the balance-sheets of the Orient Companv, but it is also true that it was proposed that if we took adVantaee of that opportunitv we should keep secret what we had seen. We distinctly stated at the time that the Commission was not honourable formed to pry into the private affairs of any company doing business in Australia. We were conducting our investigation in the public interest, and desired that any information we obtained should be made known to the public. Consequently, we declined to see the balance-sheets of the Orient Company on the condition suggested.",60
488,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Does the honourable member not think that what was desired was that the information should not come to the knowledge of rival companies?,60
489,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I am not suggesting that that was not the object of the condition imposed, but Mr Kenneth Anderson, no dbubt inadvertently, makes the statement to which I have referred, without thinking for the moment of the reason we had for not inspecting the balance-sheets of the company. If is quite possible that he did not desire that the private affairs of the company should bede- come known to those conducting rival companies, but it was because we would be unable to publish the information obtained that we declined to inspect the balance sheets of the Orient Company. I make this statement in order that members of the Commission may be put right in connection with the somewhat important objection raised by Mr Kenneth Anderson in his criticism of their report. I may further say, so far as Mr Anderson ris concerned, that no one connected with the oversea shipping industry treated the Commission more courteously, and proffered more information to assist them in carrying on their inquiry, than he did. I regret to have to say that in Victoria, in New South Wales, and even in Queensland, a better public spirit was not exhibited, that greater interest was not taken in the work of the Commission, and that a. larger number of the public men connected with the shipping industry were not prepared to come forward to give evidence. In some cases we actually had to drag it out of them. In one case it was not until we had virtually threatened to summons an individual that we were able to get any information from him, and when it was supplied it was of a very meagre character. I think it is just about time that the Commonwealth dealt in a definite way with the huge shipping ring which now dominates, not only our oversea trade, but * also our coastal trade. Each year the shipping ring which is controlling our oversea trade is becoming more powerful, and it is only a question of time when, if some step be not taken to check its actions, it will have the producers of this country practically in its hands. It is for that reason we think that it is in the public interests that a Commonwealth line of steamers should be run. I do not propose to dwell long upon these particular matters. First of all, let me dwell upon one important case which is referred to in paragraph 14 of the report. It goes to show that if certain consignments-and it refers more particularly to the f r u it trade-ar e not sent through the shipping companies, and sold by certain agents whom they dictate, the combine will not, carry the frui t at all. Where a company dictates, not only the particular line of vessels by which frui t shall be carried, but also the particular agents through whom it shall be sold, I think that, from the stand-point of the interests of our producers, it is carrying things a little too far. Furthermore, we are told in this paragraph that had the shippers a free opportunity To sell by such agents as they desired, or by whatever method they desired, they would be in a position to save not less than is. 6d. per case on their fruit. In Adelaide this monopoly practically has the fruit trade at its mercy, and could ruin it at any moment if it thought proper. That is a very serious state of affairs, and certainly it is one which ought not to be allowed to exist. I do not intend to read this particular paragraph, as it is rather long, and it may be referred to by honourable members if they choose. In Brisbane we had evidence from Mr T . C. Beirne, a very large importer, in which he pointed out that owing to the combine's practical monopoly of the oversea trade, those who require certain goods at special seasons are virtually at its mercy, and have to pay whatever charges it thinks proper to impose. In one case to which he particularly referred, he did not know until the goods were actually landed at the wharf that there was going to be an increase of about ios. or £ 1 in the freight. He aiso told us that in the hands of these companies the power of the rebate system is so strong that, owing to the broker who used, to handle the goods he sent to Brisbane having once shipped a consignment of goods to South Africa by a line of vessels that was outside the ring, he was threatened with the loss of his rebates. It is an extraordinary thing that in such a case the combine can say to a man that if his agent, who is also agent for a large number of firms doing a similar class of business,, should send a. particular shipment, even without his knowledge, by an outside line of vessels, he shall lose his rebates,, which may amount to any sum from. £ 1 0 , or £ 2 0 , up to £ 2 0 0 or £ 3 0 0 . That is a very serious state of things. It. prompted us to suggest that the sooner thecombine ""was broken down the better, and; we are of opinion that the only way in which that can be done is. by establishing a. national line of steamers. Let me point out another action of the combine. From. Brisbane, Townsville, and Rockhampton a very large consignment of meat is shipped.. For some years it was carried by boats that proceeded by the northern route to Great Britain. There was a feeling prevailing that the prices charged were rather high, A new line of boats- I think it was theAberdeen line-cam e upon the scene, and .competed for this trade. But the combination which is conducted in Queensland! ports principally by the British-India Company, was so powerful that, after a fight which lasted for several months, and in which the Aberdeen line lost, according to the press, from £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 4 0 , 0 0 0, the latter was compelled to capitulate. And today, although the Aberdeen line is allowed to go on from Sydney to 'Brisbaneand ship other commodities, it is not allowed to take an ounce of meat away from* Queensland. It will be seen that^the combine interferes very largely with the progress and development of the meat industry, to the detriment of that State. Under these circumstances, we naturally think that it is an evil which ought to be abolished as soon as possible.",60
490,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,It is very nearly a monopoly.,61
491,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"At the present timeit is practically a monopoly, and one which is acting detrimentally to the best interests of the Commonwealth. The combine has alsothe right to regulate freights. It may be argued that, if too high a rate be fixed, other steamers may come along and lakethe commodities at a lower rate. But that is not so simply done, because the combine has the shippers in the hollow of its hand. In other words, it retains, in the shape of rebates, enormous sums, which the shippers would lose if they were to ship by other vessels. Under these circumstances, we can honestly say that the combine is an actual monopoly at the present time. Year after year, as the volume of trade increases, the amount of rebate also increases, and the power of the combine becomes more complete and effective, and therefore a national line of steamers ought to be instituted. For a moment I wish to refer to the monopoly along the coast, and to indicate the evils which, in my opinion, justify our recommendation. On the Queensland coast there is a shipping monopoly as great as, if not greater than, any oversea monopoly affecting the transport of cur produce, with the result that industry there is hampered in every way possible. I wish to place the House in possession of an incident which shows how, by means of the rebate system, this combine has been able to materially injure so important a town as Maryborough, where, as honourable members knew, many of the locomotives in use on the Queensland Government railways have been made, where there is one of the biggest timber industries in the State, and where other industries also nourish. A firm of sawmillers there-Messrs. Hyne and Sonhad a contract to supply timber to Sydney, and for its conveyance secured two small vessels, the Mayflower and the Hopewell. It was, of course, necessary for them to obtain back-loading from Svdneythey found it almost impossible to do so, - because persons who wished to send goods to Maryborough were afraid to consign by their vessels, for fear of losing the rebates due to them in connection with consignments by the vessels of the combine. 'Hyne and Son therefore purchased a quantity of flour, bran, and cement, and, I think, pig iron, and, sending this to Maryborough, gave it to a commission agent to sell. It is well known that business men, when a large quantity of a commodity is thrown on a market, buy largely in order to protect their own interests, so that the public may not be able to supply their requirements at wholesale prices. fore, when these goods were offered at auction at Maryborough, a number of the merchants there purchased them. For doing so, however, they were threatened by the shipping combine with the loss of their rebates, and were allowed to keep these rebates only on condition that they promised to refuse to purchase anything more carried by the vessels of Messrs. Hyne and Son. In the case of a baker who had obtained flour from Sydney by one of those vessels, the combine went so far as to say that it would not carry any more goods for Mr MCDonald. him. In making these statements, I am not dependent for my information on mere idle rumour, but am supported by the evidence given on oath before the Shipping Commission. I have, moreover, copies of the original letters which passed during the transactions. Messrs. Hyne and Son tried to come to terms with the combine, and in regard to the negotiations write as follows :At the inception of our - trade with Sydney the representatives of the combine here called on us, and wanted to know on what terms we would agree to work with them, that is, not to carry cargo backwards. To this we agreed to accept a low minimum back freight iii instance of each of our vessels, 50 tons for "" Mayflower,"" and roo tons for "" Hopewell,"" which we were prepared to carry at 10s. per ton, and as the rate of combine in the main is 17s. 6d. per ton this left them with a profit of at least 5s. per ton after they paid rebate to their customer of 10 per cent.', and paid what little labour was incurred in taking delivery at this end. But this did not suit the combine; they wanted the whole of coastal^freights to be entirely in their hands. Subsequently to this we made them still more reasonable offers, which they rejected. The action of the combine has been to put an end to what might have been a flourishing trade between Maryborough and Sydney, where there is always a great demand but for timber, importations to meet it being made from other parts of the world. Such a trade would have benefited the people of Maryborough and of the Commonwealth generally. An even more serious case occurred in connection with a quotation for Messrs. silky oak logs. Messrs. Hyne and Son desired to obtain a number of these logs from Northern Queensland, where the tree flourishes, the timber being sent from there to various sawmills to be cut up. Messrs. Burns, Philp and Company, however, exercise a great influence up north, because of their stores and other establishments in different centres, and, to a large extent, the business of the timber-getters is in their Therehands. Therefore, when Messrs Hyne and Son asked for a quotation of prices, they received the following letter:We are duly in receipt of your's of the 22nd inst., and now beg to confirm our wire, advising that we had asked Mr James Lyons to ouote vou for Silky Oak Logs, which we understand he has done. We may state that we are unable to quote for shipment by any other than the Associated Company's steamers, otherwise we should lose our accrued bonuses with those companies. It is extraordinary that such things can happen in a democratic country like Australia, where everyone speaks about the liberty and freedom which we enjoy. A.combine such as I have been describing can wield enormous power, and can, as I have shown, practically bring about the ruin of an important industry. In addition to what has been done in regard to the timber industry, I would point to the action of the shipping combine in connection with the carriage of pig-iron for Walkers, Limited, at Maryborough. The combine have laid down freight conditions which operate to the serious disadvantage of those who are engaged in carrying on industries at all our Queensland ports. The moment that they obtain full control of the situation-and tihev have almost succeeded in ousting all competitors-the y will be in a position to dictate any terms they please, and to compel the public to pay exhorbitant rates for the carriage of their produce or of the goods which they may require for manufacturing or other purposes. present position of affairs is a public scandal, and the sooner an improvement is effected the better it will be for the Commonwealth. All honourable members who have spoken during this debate have expressed the opinion that monopolies and combines are bad. It is well known that, in connection with the oversea trade, the reduction of the freights upon our perishable products has been of great advantage to our producers, and has placed them in a much better position than they occupied some years ago. This reduction was brought about only when a few outside firms came along, and captured a. certain amount of the trade, in spite of the combine. Then the companies that were carrying on the contest against the combine became so strong that the shipping ring were compelled to take them into the fold, with the object of again increasing freights .in order to recoup themselves for the losses sustained. When Mr Kenneth Anderson was giving evidence before the Commission, I asked him if it would be possible for a competing firm to join the shipping combine, if it so desired. He replied that it would all depend on the financial strength of the firm. In other words, he conveyed the impression that if a firm were sufficiently strong to fight the combine, the latter would be prepared to accept it as a member of the shipping ring, whereas in a case such as that of the Aberdeen line they would dictate their own terms.",61
492,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The party to which the honourable member belongs is a combine.,63
493,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"It is a benevolent combine. The Commission contend that if we were to run our own line of steamers we should be able to provide employment for our own citizens under conditions very different from those ment.oned by the honourable member for Melbourne. We should also be able to give our employees reasonable wages, and would be able to afford a desirable outlet for our young men who have a liking for a seafaring life. I think, moreover, that if we had a Commonwealth fleet, our citizens would display more interest in maritime life generally. It is desirable that this interest should be encouraged, in order that we may be enabled to train officers and men to man an Australian Navy when the conditions are ripe for the maintenance of such an institution. We should also be in a position to assist our producers to place their produce upon The the markets of the world to greater advantage than at present. We could provide them with a more regular and rapid means of transit than they have enjoyed in the past. This is a matter of special importance to our butter and fruit industries. If we had a fleet of our own we should advertise Australia, perhaps, more effectively than by any other means. As the honourable member for Barrier pointed out, we should have at our hands a means of introducing our best products in the way of fruits, preserves, and meats, and this in itself would probably lead to the opening up of fresh markets.",63
494,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,What about our wines?,63
495,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Althoug h the members of the Commission were almost without exception teetotallers, they did not lose sight of the fact that we might provide passengers by our steamers with wines grown in the Commonwealth, and thus introduce the product of one of our staple industries to the favourable notice of the outside world. We were told that if we established a Commonwealth-owned line of steamers we should have to fight the Shipping Conference. I do not believe that that result would be brought about, because the Shipping Conference would realise that if the Commonwealth once embarked in such an enterprise it would have to go on with it . They would appreciate to the fullest extent the distinction between the Commonwealth - and, say, the Aberdeen line, and would realise that if they once entered into a fight with us they - could not expect to sweep us from their path within a few months. No people worthy of the name would allow any combination to exist within the Commonwealth which was greater thani the Commonwealth itself. Under these circumstances, I contend that no shipping or combination would attempt in any shape - or form to fight the Commonwealth. We have been told that if the proposed new mail contract be ratified the contractors will establish a new line of steamers to fight the combine. If they can form a companv and expend £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 in constructing a fleet of steadrought mers, and if they can afterwards establish a remunerative trade with Australia, why in the name of common sense cannot the Commonwealth do so ? We have been assured by the honourable member for Parramatta that whilst it is true we can purchase the services of men who are qualified to run a national fleet - of steamers, those men would not devote the same energy to their task that they would exhibit if they were employed by private enterprise. The Shipping Commission were informed by Mr Kenneth Anderson that we should require to engage the services of men who are familiar with every phase of shipping, in order to insure the running of a Commonwealth line - of steamers as economically and profitably as possible. We all realise that. But the Commission were also informed that these men could be obtained if we were prepared to pay them reasonable salaries. I contend that it is only natural that the Commonwealth would secure the best available talent. Is it not reasonable to suppose that the men who would be placed in charge of a national fleet of mail mers would-for the sake of their own reputations-d o their best to make it a - success ? Would they not endeavour to make it successful because of the emoluments which would attach to their positions? Here in Victoria have not the Government imported a gentleman to take charge of the railways?",63
496,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And to run them as private railways are run elsewhere.,64
497,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Jus t so. We require the services of men to fleet of steamers upon similar lines.,64
498,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member's party would not let them do that.,64
499,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Are the Railways Commissioners not allowed to do that in New South Wales? Is it not a fact that last year those gentlemen returned to the Treasury of that State £300,000 or £400,000 owing to their magnificent management ?",64
500,Mr WILKS,Unknown,They have made a mess of ring things in New South Wales.,64
501,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It was owing to the magnificent seasons.,64
502,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The railways were paying before the drought occurred in New South Wales, and in one year the Commissioners returned a profit of nearly £250,000 to the Treasury. When the took place they showed their sagacity by carrying fodder for starving stock at extremely low rates, in order that they might save that stock in the future interests of New South Wales.",64
503,Mr WATSON,Unknown,A private company made more money in that year than in any other year of its history.,64
504,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"A Royal Commission has recommended that the Railways Commissioners i.n New South Wales should be got rid of as quickly, as possible.",64
505,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The honourable member for Parramatta will agree with me that the late Mr Eddy made the New South Wales railways a financial success.,64
506,Mr WILKS,Unknown,And who gave him a very bad time?,64
507,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Providenc e stepped in and gave him a very bad time.,64
508,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The Socialist party were always tormenting him.,64
509,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And if they had had the power they would have hunted him away.,64
510,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Mr Eddy was a strong man, and I regret that we have not steaa dozen more like him to take charge of other national enterprises.",64
511,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"If I recollect rightly, the honourable member's own leader voted against Mr Eddy's salary upon the ground that it was too high.",64
512,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I do not think so. If I did, I soon found out my error.",64
513,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Now I come to think about the matter, I know that the honourable member did not vote in the way that I indicated, although the majority of the run a national Labour Party did.",64
514,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"It is only reasonable to suppose that whoever was intrusted with the work of running a national line of steamers would do their best for the Commonwealth, if only to save their own reputations, and to retain their positions. I have already referred to the fact that the establishment of a Commonwealth fleet of mail steamers would be the means of providing a large number of our citizens with a maritime training. The serious decrease that has taken place in the number of British sailors in our mercantile marine is sufficient to make us pause and think. I find that in i860 the total shipping tonnage of Great Britain was 4,257,739 tons, whereas in 1900 it was 1.0,550,094 tons. The number of British seamen during those forty years increased from 157,112 to x 75'53 - I "" the former calculation the 2 masters and officers have been excluded, and in the latter they have been included. In i860 the British, mercantile marine employed 14,280 foreigners and 335 lascars, whereas in 1890 their numbers had increased to 36,893 foreigners and 36,023 lascars, or a total of 72,916. In other words, the proportion of foreigners and lascars to British seamen in i860 was 9.3 per cent., whereas in 1900 it was 41.78 per cent. Here we have a clear proof that in running oversea ships, private enterprise will employ the cheapest labour procurable. That point is worthy of special notice by those who favour the repeal of the section in our Post and Telegraph Act which prevents our mails being carried by vessels which employ coloured aliens. The fact that the number of lascars engaged in the British mercantile marine has increased from 335 to 36,023 during the past forty years should be taken into consideration. The establishment of a Commonwealth line of steamers would tend to minimize that evil.",64
515,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"If the British authorities made a similar proposal in their postal contracts with regard to white labour, that difficulty would be largely overcome.",65
516,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I admit that the British Government have not made a similar proposal, but they are in a different position. At present they are deriving a very large revenue from a portion of the Empire, which comprises a coloured population of something like 350,000,000. in the circumstances, we are not compelled to give the same recognition to those coloured people.",65
517,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Nevertheless , the question is one into which the British Government will have to look very seriously.",65
518,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"That is so. I do not propose to deal with the figures advanced by the Commission in support of their recommendations, for they have not been seriously assailed.",65
519,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is. just as wellnot to deal with them, because they constitute the main feature of the report.",65
520,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,No honourable member has seriously assailed them.,65
521,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Why need we do sowhen the Commission themselves assail, them?",65
522,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The only newspaper which seriously endeavoured to challenge them was the Age, but after the speech made by the honourable member for Barrier in support of his amendment, it gracefully backed down. That speech was a complete refutation of the criticism levelled at the report.",65
523,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But the members of the Commission themselves say that they are only guesses.,65
524,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"It is true that some of the figures may be, so to speak, slightly experimental, but in the main they will withstand all criticism. Some honourable members say that the amendment is an excellent one, but that it is inopportune. Had the honourable member for Barrier failed to take advantage of the present opportunity, he would have been unable to submit his proposal with the prospect of its being, carried into effect until this contract had expired. I , therefore, hold that the coursehe has taken is a proper one. Before passing from the report of the Commission to> other matters, I would say that, when the terms of this contract were published, Mr. Denham, Minister of Agriculture and Secretary of Railways in the Government of Queensland, said that he objected to it,, and that he felt that that State was being bled in connection with it Whilst I personally approve of the Government inserting in the contract a clause compelling the mail steamers to go as far as Brisbane, I regret very much that Mr Denham, or some other member of the Queensland Ministry, failed to place before the Shipping Service Commission evidence showing the situation in which Queensland was placed in connection with the Orient Company's contract. Before proceeding to Brisbane, the Chairman of the Commission-the honourable member for Barrier-wrot e to the Government of Queensland, asking if anv members of it were prepared to give evidence, and the then Premier, Mr Morgan, replied that they were. When we reached Brisbane, however, the Chairman received a telephone message from a Government officer that it had been decided that no member of the Ministry would give evidence, but that, if we desired it, a State official would be prepared to give evidence. Such a witness would, doubtless, have given us some official and stereotyped answers to any questions submitted to him; but we wanted something more. Our desire was that a member of the Government should come before the Commission, and give us some idea of what, in their opinion, should be done in regard to the calling of the mail steamers at Brisbane. Although Queensland was vitally interested in the carriage of mails under future contracts, not one member of the Government was prepared to give evidence before the Commission. I regret this, not merely because I was a member of the Commission, but because, as a representative of Queensland, I wished my fellow Commissioners to learn how unjustly Queensland was treated in being called upon to pay £26,000 per annum to secure the calling of the Orient Steam-ship Company's mail steamers at Brisbane. In the circumstances, it ill-becomes any member of the Queensland Ministry to find fault with anything that is ing done in regard to the mail contract. We have been told by the Postmaster General that this is to be an Australian company; but he did not tell us to what extent it could' be so described. All that we are told is that the company is to be registered in Australia, All that we can gather from the statement of the Minister, and the other information placed before us, is that we are to give a concession to certain persons who will subsequently'form a company, which, if successful, will build a fleet of steamers and carry out the terms of the contract. We are also told by the Postmaster-General that the gentleman who has signed this contract has given a guarantee to the extent of £25,000. but, having regard to the fact that the building of this fleet of steamers would involve an expenditure of about £4,000,000, that is a very insignificant sum. I would draw the attention of honourable members to an incident which took place in Queensland some time ago. A certain companv desired a concession for the construction of a railway from Normanton to Cloncurry. We were told that this concession was not going to be hawked round London or anywhere else, but that the financial magnates interested in the company were in a position to put down the £4,000,000 necessary to build the line, and to carry out other works in Mr MCDonald. connection with the scheme. That was the argument used to induce the members of the Sfate Parliament to vote for the granting of the concession, and in the same way the Postmaster-General has 1 said that the company proposing to take up this contract could build the necessary steamers, and carry out all the conditions, without appealing to the public. The concession was granted, in addition to which five or six other concessions were granted to different companies to build various lines of railway. Although those companies put down sums varying from £2,500 to £10,000 by way of guarantee, not one of the railways has been built up to the present time. I should like to warn the Postmaster-General that,, a guarantee of £25,000 is, in my opinion, insufficient under the circumstances, for the reason that,' if the company fails within a reasonable time to give some guarantee that the vessels will be built, and if the contract is not proceeded with, the Commonwealth will be involved in a loss of, perhaps, -£50,000 or £100,000. The historical incidents to which I have referred are therefore worth be- remembering. It behoves us to think very seriously before we enter into the contract now proposed. We should have some guarantee that the scheme is not going to be hawked around London, so that a company may be formed, or mav be attempted to be formed, with the consequence of landing us ultimately in a serious difficulty. We are told that this is to be an Australian company, and that the ships are to fly the Australian flag. What is the use of their flying the Australian flag and being registered in Australia if the shares are held in London? In Austria-Hungary the Government insists that at least two-thirds of the shares of any company subsidized by the State shall be held in the country, and by Austrian subjects. Germany goes even further. In Japan the Government refuses to grant a concession to any company the shares of which are not held by Japanese. In America the conditions are still more stringent. Before we can call this an Australian company, at least two-thirds of the shares should be held in Australia. A clause should be inserted to provide that not only the shipment of all crews, but their discharge, shall take place in Australia. That would make the company a little more Australian than it will be under the agreement as it stands at present. With such an amendment the contract will be improved. But I regret very much that the Government has not seen its way clear to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier.",65
525,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member's own party is not solid upon it.,67
526,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I cannot help that. J can assure the honourable member that the members of the Royal Commission are very solid. Combines, not only in the coastal trade, but in the oversea business, are all-powerful today, and do very much to retard the development of Australia. The only method by which those combines can be induced to take a reasonable view of their duties, instead of fleecing the public of Australia, is by adopting some such proposal as that of the honourable member for Barrier to nationalize the shipping industry. We should thus create an enormous influence in favour of Australia. To have a fleet such as is proposed by the Royal Commission sail from our ports to other parts of the world would be one of the biggest and best advertisements we could possibly have.",67
527,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,"Capricornia) £9.36] - I do not rise to congratulate the Government upon this new contract. On ihe contrary, I think that, if it is ratified, it will inflict a flagrant piece of injustce - upon Queensland, and will do more damage than any honourable member contemplates. In the first place, the Postmaster-General has told us that this is a mail contract pure and simple. If that be so, why is there a clause in it requiring that the ships shall be of the size of 11,000 tons? It is not necessary to have vessels so large simply to carry mails to England. It appears ro me that there is something behind the proposal. It must be admitted that they must - do other work. They must come to Melbourne and Sydney, where the large centres of population are situated, for tiade purposes. The carriage of mails alone would not pay a fleet of this character. The amount they received for that purpose would only barely pay interest on the .»utlay. Under the proposed contract only two States of the Commonwealth will have the ships calling at their ports, namely, Western Australia and South Australia. Much was said some time ago about the contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company, which we then had before us, ainder which the Commonwealth Government contracted to pay £ 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 for the carriage of mails. But now the Government is to pay £125,000. The Orient Steam Navigation Company not only calls at Melbourne and Sydney, but also goes on to Brisbane. Under this contract the voyage of the steamers will terminate at Adelaide. There is nothing to compel them to go elsewhere. It is true that we shall secure some advantage in a shortening of the time of the voyage; but the great masses of the people care nothing about the saving of a few hours. They do not know when the English mail either leaves or arrives in Australia. They do not feel much interest in it. Only a few people like the richer merchants, and those who wish to communicate with Europe, are interested in the speed of the mail boats. Wc cannot afford to allow this country to be inuJct in a further expenditure of £ 5 . 0 0 0 to save a few hours. There is much to be said about the contract from a monetary stand-point. The present mail service is, in my opinion, just as good as the new service will prove. I see very little in the condition that the vessels shall be registered in Australia and fly the Australian flag. That may be all very well from a patriotic point of view; but I , as an Australian, do not attach much importance to the stipulation. Personally, I would just as soon see the English flag - continue to flv over the mail steamers until the time arrives when we have vessels of our own over which to fly our flag, As to the calling of mail steamers at Brisbane, I know there are at present negotiations goinsr on between the Premier of Queensland and the Prime Minister as to what the extension of this facility would cost. So far, I understand that Messrs. Lang and Sons Ltd', have asked for an extra subsidv of £ 2 6 , 0 0 0 per annum; but I think that the Queensland Government would be exceedingly foolish to fall in with any such idea. I know that tomorrow I shall_wire to the Premier of Queensland' advising him to have nothing whatever to do with such a proposal, which I regard as an injustice to the northern State. Sydney, and all the other Australian ports are bound to be visited' by the mail steamers for the purposes of trade, and yet Queensland is to be left out.",67
528,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We are not aware that the Premiers of any of the States have been consulted.,67
529,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,"But the Premier of Queensland has been consulted as to the payment of an extra subsidy, although that State is at present paying its quota of the Commonwealth subsidy. Such a proposal appears to me to be an infringement of the Constitution, because it practically means certain States legislating for one State, and differentiating that State from the other members of the Union. As I said before, I hope that the Queensland Government will refuse to pay any further subsidy, but will reserve any such assistance for a Torres Strait service. We are told that the steamers of the contracting company, under the new agreement, are to run fifteen knots an/hour; but what is that speed compared with the twenty-four or twenty-five knots an hour of the Atlantic liners?",67
530,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"The new boats will have to do more then fifteen knots an hour, in order to perform the voyage in the allotted number of hours.",68
531,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,"Eve n if the new steamers did sixteen knots an hour, the German liners and the Cunard liners on the Atlantic are now doing twenty-four and twenty-five knots. According to the terms of the agreement, it is apparent that, instead of £125,000 per annum, we shall have to pay £150,000 per annum, if the vessels are to attain the higher speed. Then it seems to me to be wrong to enter into a ten years' contract with the company. It would have been far better to have contracted for a shorter period with the old company, even if we had to pay more. We have no guarantee that the contracting com- Sydney. pany occupies anything like the position which has been indicated. We have been told to-dav that the company has up to the present built only tramp steamors. and their deposit of £25,000 is a mere fleabite.",68
532,Mr EWING,Unknown,Who has said that the contracting companv are building only tramps ?,68
533,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,That is what is said by those who have gone into the question.,68
534,Mr EWING,Unknown,It is not correct.,68
535,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,"Of course, it does riot follow that because the company has up to now built only tramps, it is not capable of turning out ocean hound's. A man who can build a tramwav can build a railway. I dare say this is a very respectable firm, and doubtless it will have to find a lot of monev in order to go into this enterprise; whether or not the enterprise will pay them is for their consideration, not ours. I have nothing further to say, except to repeat my protest against this agreement as it stands. There ought to be a stipulation that the vessels, shall call at all the States; and I may point out that Queensland in the past has been badly treated, not only in connection with the mail service, but in a great many other ways. I have, time after time, madethat statement, and it cannot be repeated too often. The people of Queensland think that they have been badlv treated, and a great number have the idea of secession in their heads. That may be only empty talk, and I do not attach much importance to it ; but when we find that a State is badly treated, simply because it happens to be situated far away from centres of population, a point should be strained in order to extend some assistance. It is well known that ever since the inauguration of the Commonwealth, the* Queensland finances have been on the wrong side, and that that State has had to take less than the three-fourths of the revenue to which it is entitled under the Constitution. I hope these boats will go on to Brisbane. There will certainly be plenty of trade there for them in the future. At the presenttime the dairying, meat, and other industries of Queensland are looking up, and I have no doubt that in a few years she will' be the premier State. In ten years time there will be a big difference in the condition of affairs in Queensland, and it is very hard that the boats of the contracting company should be permitted to stop at",68
536,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There is nothing in the contract requiring them to stop at Sydney.,68
537,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,There is nothing in the contract to compel them to go to Svdney.,68
538,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,In that respect Queensland is placed in the same position as the other States.,68
539,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,"That is so; but the honourable member overlooks the fact that there is a very big population in Melbourne and Sydney as compared with greythe population of the capital of Queensland, and also the fact that Brisbane is so much further off. A company running these very large boats might consider that it would be too expensive to take them on to Brisbane for the trade of that port. I think that, even though we should have to pav a little more for this contract, it should be specified that the boatsshould' call at a port in each of 'the States.",68
540,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,Would ' honourable member have the boats engaged in the Vancouver service go on to Western Australia ?,69
541,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Wester n pays her share of the cost of that service.,69
542,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,"They might go to Western Australia, so far as I am - concerned. If it is a Commonwealth service it should serve all the States. . Mr DUGALD THOMSON - Le t the honourable member consider the cost.",69
543,Mr DAVIDTHOMSON,Unknown,"If it were shown to be necessary I should have no - objection, nor would the people of Queensland. What I complain of is that the proposed contract is for a direct line from England, and it is not proposed that the boats shall call at ports in all the States. I hope that this contract will not be ratified. I intend to oppose it , and will do all I can to secure its rejection. I have only my vote with which to ""prevent its ratification, and I know it is of very little use to talk when a majority of honourable members are opposed to one's views, but if the contract is ratified I hope that the Government will see their way to introduce some condition under which the boats engaged in the service will call at Brisbane.",69
544,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We should have no - guarantee that the proposed national line would go there.,69
545,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,"We will guarantee that if honourable members will agree to the amendment. I must congratulate the honourable member for Barrier on the project submitted by the Shipping Service Commission. That - Commission has proved to be one of the best that has been appointed by any Commonwealth Government. It has submitted a number of ticable recommendations, and' has shown us how to do something. for honourable members to trv to pick holes in. the figures submitted by the Commission, but I think that their estimates are in - cases rather too high than too low. There is only one matter regarding which may be an element of speculation, and is the revenue to be derived from such line. The Commission considered venue derived by the Peninsular and Orient tal Steam Navigation Company, and the . Orient Company, and I think that when structing that railway. the figures are carefully considered it be found that the Shipping Commission have not been very f ar out in their estimate the of the probable revenue from a Commonwealth-owned service. I am satisfied that if we established such a service it would be an eye-opener to the world, as it would prove Australia that we in Australia are able to provide a line of magnificent ships. I am sure the honourable member for Barrier would not advise the construction of inferior vessels. The question is asked whether such a line of steamers would pay, and I reply that if it pays a private company such as the Orient Company or the Peninsular and Oriental Company to run a line of steamers here it would pay the Commonwealth Government equally well.",69
546,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member for Barrier is proposing the establishment of another competing line.,69
547,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,"The honourable member is proposing the right thing, and you are not proposing the right thing - a lot of sharks as you are, trying to take the people down.",69
548,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must address the Chair.,69
549,Mr DAVID THOMSON,Unknown,"A few days ago we had under consideration a proposal to build a great railway through the desert of Western Australia at a cost of £5,000,000. We found a majority of honourable members in this House supporting that proposal, but if we can afford to pay £ 5 , 0 00,00 0 for the construction of that railway we can better afford to pay that sum for the construction of a Commonwealth line of ships. Such a line of ships would be of very great service, and it would be much more profitable to the Commonwealth to construct eight or nine ocean-going vessels than to construct the railway I have referred to.",69
550,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,No fear. The pracbuilding of the railway would mean unity.,69
551,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,This is the true It is all very well Federal spirit.,69
552,Mr DAVIDTHOMSON,Unknown,"It would be better evidence of the true Federal spirit some that honourable members should support a proposal to connect us with Great Britain there by establishing a line of Commonwealth that ships rather than a proposal for the cona struction of the proposed transcontinental the rerailway to connect us with Western Ausr a l i a . ' We hear nothing about the necessity of paying interest on the cost of conI again congratuwill late the Shipping Commission on their report, and I should prefer action on the lines they recommend to the acceptance of this contract. I do not say that by the tablishment of a Commonwealth line of steamers we should be able to do away with the £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 now paid annually towards our naval defence, but a Commonwealth line of steamers would be useful for the defence ""of our shores. I repeat again that I hope this contract will not be ratified, and that a Commonwealth line of steamers will become an accomplished fact. Mr CULP1N (Brisbane) [9.55] --! wish to say a word on this question. I am in favour of something being done which will help us, and which especially will be of advantage to the northern State. With that object in view, and believing that, under the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barrier, Queensland, as well as the rest of the Commonwealth, can be provided with a good shipping service, I shall support that amendment. We have had instances from the other side of the readiness of honourable members to give up something. According to his own statement, the lender of the Opposition has given up no less a thing than this Parliament. The right honourable gentleman also proposes to give up the provision we have made for the employment of white seamen in vessels subsidized by the Commonwealth. Whatever we may feel about giving up this Parliament, none of us on this side thinks of giving up that provision. I shall support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Barrier, and I hope that we shall be able to carry it.",69
553,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [9.57] - Whils t we may be making a very good bargain with the new shipping company, so far as the cost of carrying our mails is concerned, I think that if we were running the business ourselves we should be quite satisfied to adopt the poundage system which has been referred to, and thus save £ 8 0 , 0 a year on the present expenditure. That is a very large sum, in my opinion, for the Commonwealth to have to pay for the sake of a few days earlier delivery of mails. As I . pointed out last year, I do not think that the speedier service afforded by the contract system is worth the additional cost, even to the merchants, who contend that it is. Although under the poundage system there might be a delay of a day or two in the delivery of mails, all the merchants concerned would be placed on the same footing, and one would be given no advantage over another. The majority of our merchants and others seem to think es- that it is necessary that we should have a quicker service than we could procure under the poundage system, and if they are prepared to pay a large proportion of the additional cost under the contract system I do not think that it would be wise for us to object. At the same time. I think that in a mail contract of this description we should have some guarantee that the shipping company obtaining the contract will make provision for the transport of perishable products. I am aware that a great many people in Australia do not be ^ e that the Post Office should be debited with expenditure incurred by other Departments, but I hold the view that the public Departments of the Commonwealth should be considered as one, and that each should be expected to assist the other. If by their arrangements with the steamship companies the Postal authorities can get concessions and benefits from the snipping companies, they should do so. I know that the Government of the Commonwealth have communicated with the various States, and have not received from them that support which they might reasonably, have expected. At the same time, I think it is their duty to make some provision in reference to the carriage of perishable products, in order that there shall be a guarantee. No doubt, for its own sake, a shipping company may make some concessions in that direction, but, at the same time, there is no guarantee that it will be done. If in the contract the Postmaster-General had inserted a condition to that effect, a service would have been assured to the shippers. I am very glad, however, that it contains a clause empowering the Commonwealth to purchase the steamers if the Parliament should think it advisable to do so. In a contract extending over the long period of ten years, 0 0 it is only right, I think, that that power should be taken. What troubles me as a Tasmanian representative, is that provision is made at the public expense for the conveyance of the mails to all parts of the Commonwealth except Tasmania. Under this proposed contract, the mails will be landed at . Adelaide, and despatched by train, to the various points on the mainland, but Tasmania will have to pay for the transport of its mails across Bass Strait. Last year, when the acceptance of a contract was under consideration, Tasmania and Queensland got an advantage in that direction. Under the new arrangement. Queensland will still have its mails sent on by train from Adelaide at the expense of the Commonwealth, but Tasmania will have to pay for the conveyance of «its mails across the Strait. That is not exhibiting the true Federal spirit. In view of the fact that Tasmania has also to pay a special rate for cablegrams, and a subsidy of £ 4 , 0 0 0 to the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, I trust that the true Federal spirit will be displayed, and that before the termination of this Parliament the carriagt of mails across the Strait will be made as free as on the mainland.",70
554,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [1:0.4] - The discussion on this important question has not been of such a character as I should have wished. And the Ministry is not doing full credit to the subject when it neglects to make a fuller explanation, and to reply to some of the speeches which have been made. It is of no use for honourable members to try to shirk the responsibility which rests upon them. The Commonwealth must be provided with a mail service in one way or the other. inauguration, it has never received an offer for the carrying of its mails at a fair price and under fair conditions. these circumstances, we shall have to face, sooner or later, the question of carrying in our own ships, not only the mails, but also the produce of our people to other parts of the world. It may be evident that a majority of the representatives of the people are not of that opinion now, but that in no way justifies an attempt to make little of a great question such as this is. caught his reasoning correctlv to-dav. .the deputv-leader of the Opposition said that the subsidy paid to these boats is of general benefit to the whole of the community, and that fast services are absolutely necessary if we are to take our place amongst progressive nations.",71
555,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I think that that was said' in criticism of the Commission's report. I said that anything which affected advantageously the commercial class as well as the exporters of produce must necessarily affect advantageously every man and woman in the community.,71
556,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That will serve my purpose equally well, and I quite agree with the honourable member, but I submit that no better argument could be advanced in favour of a national line of steamers, because if anvthinir which affects the merchant and the importer, also affects [60] the producer, then it is our duty to find the very best and the cheapest method of carrying on those services. That brings us to the question of whether for the carriage of mails and cargo a national service is cheaper and more effective than a service such as that which has been provis:onally agreed to between a steam-ship company and the Government to carry the mails. I quite agree with those who contend that we should have the most up-todate steam-ship service between Australia and other parts of the world. Under these circumstances I consider that a large subsidy is justifiable, but although I believe that from their point of view the Government have made a fair bargain, I am of opinion that even greater advantage would accrue to the Commonwealth and its people if they could face the initial cost of pro viding a line of steamers to carrv not only mails, but also the products of this country to other countries, and to bring back the products of other countries. Furthermore, it has been pointed out by the honSince its orable member for Kennedy that in Australia there is a shinning combine even more drastic in its operations than the Under shipping combine at the other end of the world. My view is that if we met this big oversea combine by a national line of steam-ships it would be equally necessary to provide a subsidiary service to meet the wants of the States. I am one of those who contend that we ought not to be afraid of things that are new if we can prove that they are ri.<rht, and would be beneficial If I to the communitv. Australia has a great advantage in being self-contained. It has an advantage-fro m one point of view it is a disadvantage-in having no great shipping at the present time, and it would be to .our distinct advantage if we could initiate an oversea service, and also an Australian service, so as to completely meet the necessities of the people who are settled over a very vast continent. Let us take the conditions which prevail at the present time in the district I represent. For some years the condition of affairs at the port of Maryborough has been - such that no person has been free to trade as he wished. When Messrs. Hyne and Son endeavoured to send timber from Maryborough to other parts of Australia, and to bring back cargo, not only did the combine refuse to assist them, but it placed every obstacle in their way, and would not even enter into an agreement allowing them to take back freight at low rates and under a sharing arrangement. They went further, and announced that any one buying goods brought to Maryborough in the vessels of Messrs. Hyne and Son would lose the rebates to which they were entitled. Some honourable members consider that such dealings are to be regarded as freedom of contract, and a proper system of trading; but, in my opinion, they are commercially immoral, and any Government having the power to put an end to them, and allowing them to continue would be unworthy of its position. It is thought by some that the Australian Industries Preservation Bill will meet the case; but, even if it does, it will not put an end to the oversea shipping ring. One of the weak points in the contract-and this criticism should have been answered from the Government Bench - is that it contains no provision preventing the company carrying our mails from combining with the other shipping companies now doing business here, and leaving us in our present position. No one who examines the correspondence and the conditions of the contract will consider that we have had a fair and honest offer for a mail service. I am of the opinion that it would have been better, as the honourable member for Bass has pointed out. to continue, for some vears to come, to pay poundage rates for the conveyance of our mails, until the people of the Commonwealth became ready to make arrangements for the establishment of a national line of steamers. If we agree to the contract, we shall be bound for a period of eleven and a half years from the present time, and, as the honourable member for Coolgardie has pointed out, many developments in ocean transport are to be expected .in that period. No doubt there is a majority against the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier; but the arguments pur forward in support of it have not been answered by those who are defending the contract. The honourable member for Parramatta says that the Commissioners gave an estimate of the cost of constructing a fleet of steamers large enough to carry on the Government service, which was not reasonably correct.",71
557,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Commissioners say that it is not correct.,72
558,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I submit that the figures of no one connected with the Commonwealth are generally regarded as so reliable as, and' will be taken more readily than, those of Mr Coghlan. I have always found greater accuracy in his works than in those of any other statistical writer to whom I have had to refer, and have always been satisfied with' my dealings with him. It is 5 his figures which are impugned when the estimate of the Commissioners is challenged. The Commissioners put forward no estimate of their own. All they say is, "" We have done everything that we can to obtain the best estimates."" No doubt Mr. Coghlan was able to obtain information from some of the most competent authorities in London.",72
559,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No doubt; hut experts here say that he has not been supplied with a full estimate.,72
560,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"An estimate going into shillings and pence was not expected, but that furnished by Mr Coghlan is fairly complete, and, I'venture to say, as nearly accurate as could be obtained by appealing to any one else on the subject.' If that: is the only difficulty which prevents the honourable member from favourably considering the proposals of the Commissoners, I suggest that the Commonwealth Government should ask some of the chief ship-building firms what they would build the necessary steamers for. It is a usual thing for firms to submit estimates of this kind. No doubt Messrs. Harland and Wolff would say what they could build the vessels for, and would be quite willing to undertake the work, because they would be sure that, u'pon its completion, the payments d'ue would be made. Then, to deal with another statement of the honourable member for Parramatta, the people of the Commonwealth would be benefited if the effect of establishing a national line of steamers were to increase competition and reduce rates. That would bring about a state of affairs which, to the honourable member, is almost ideal. We have heard from him a thousand times of the advantages of competition, and the fact that there would befiercecompetition 1 between the national line and the private lines is a reason why we should support the proposal. Even if there were a loss in the working of, the national line, the public wquld benefit by the reduction of rates created by the competition. There would be an indirect benefit somewhat akin to that which results from the construction of nonpaving railways.",72
561,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The honourable member refers to developmental lines?,72
562,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"A railway constructed' as a developmental line soon becomes a paying line, and, ultimately, helps to support other lines, which do not pay directly, but, indirectly, are beneficial to the community, as a national line of steamers would be, even if it did not show a profit on its working expenses. It has been contended by some honourable members that our railway systems, which are socialistic, are monopolies,- with which competition is impossible. I do not believe, however, that Socialism can exist only where there is monopoly. If socialistic principles could not hold their own even against private competition, I would not support them long. It is because I believe them to be sound, beneficial, and necessary to the development of the community, where there is competition, that I support them. I am as willing to face competition on the high seas as in connection with any State enterprise on land.",72
563,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Is the able member in favour of increasing the loss at present incurred in connection with the postal service, by carrying on an unprofitable mail service ?",73
564,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The honourable member is assuming that there would be a loss in connection with the mail service.,73
565,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Commission show that there would be a profit of £ n 2 . o o o per annum.,73
566,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I am not here to father the figures put forward by the Commission, but I would point out that manifestly inaccurate figures have been submitted by other authorities, and that the most egregious blunders have been committed by some of the leading newspapers. I cannot vouch for the correctness of the figures put forward by the Commission, because I am not acquainted with the details. It cannot be denied, however, that Mr Coghlan is most reliable in matters of this, kind.",73
567,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Mr Coghlan not make up the balance-sheet.,73
568,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No , but the capital expenditure estimated by the Commission is based upon Mr Coghlan's figures.",73
569,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Yes , but could boats built at a cost of £ 3 7 5 , 0 0 0 'be equal to vessels costing £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 ?",73
570,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,What steamers cost that amount ?,73
571,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The sular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's steamers.,73
572,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The question as to whether boats of the required class would [60]- 2 cost £ 3 5 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 could easily; be settled by calling for tenders. I venture to say that if the Government cabled to some of the principal builders in England they could ascertain within a very short time exactly what expenditure would be involved in the construction of steamers of any given class. In estimating the income of the proposed Commonwealth owned line of steamers, the Commission have based their calculations upon the number of passengers carried by the present mail companies during the seven months over which the busy season extends.",73
573,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"No . We calculated upon the steamers having a full complement of passengers for five months in the year, and did not reckon on. having any passengers for the balance of the period. Mr DUGALD 0 THOMSON - The number honor- of passengers carried by the present mail companies has nothing whatever to do with the question. 1",73
574,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Commission have allowed a very considerable margin for contingencies, and I think that their expectations are very reasonable.",73
575,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Alway s supposing that the Commonwealth-owned steamers diove one of the other lines out of the trade.,73
576,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is contemplated that the Commonwealth-owned steamers would be equipped upon such lines that they would be superior in every respect to the vessels proposed to be employed under the new contract. No reasonable expense would be 1 spared, and there is no reason why the Commonwealth line should not secure the cream of the public patronage. Moreover, Ave should be able to avail ourselves of the services of the officials in all the Commonwealth Departments in providing facilities to producers for despatching their produce did to the best markets. The postal officials, for instance, could give information to farmers and others as to the markets to which they could forward their produce to b.est advantage, and there is no reason why how the Customs officers should not also lend their assistance, in facilitating exportation generally.",73
577,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Would the honourable member make our public servants general carPenin- riers and forwarding agents?,73
578,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Why not? What is the object of government but to afford every facility for production and the pursuit of industry, thus promoting the comfort and welfare of the people? The aim of those who are engaged in private enterprise would appear to be to beggar their neighbours, but the Government would not enter into trading concerns with any such purpose. It would be the duty of every public servant to offer every possible facility to those who had goods to send away to other parts of the world.",73
579,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The theory enunciated by the honourable member is an excellent one.,74
580,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Many wild theories have been enunciated in the history of the world. Some of the most desirable reforms have, when first proposed, been stigmatised as wild and impracticable.. I venture to sa,y that arrangements could be made under which the railway servants of the various States could render valuable assistance to our settlers in the back blocks, and enable them to send away their produce to the best markets without incurring agency and other chargessuch as they now have to bear. I would point out that in 1888 or 1889, the Queensland Railway Act was amended to enable the Railway Commissioners to make an arrangement such as I have suggested. That action was taken in a State that was not then regarded as so radical in its political tone as some others. The idea of the State owning steamers is no new one. Nearly thirty years ago a certain Premier of Queensland took it upon himself to order a steamer, with a view to breaking down a monopoly. I should like to add a great ""dea.i more upon this matter, but I have alreadv declared myself in favour of the establishment of a Commonwealth line of steamers. I believe that the nationalization of these services is the only course which ultimately succeed. I am not prepared to pamper anv socialistic scheme, but I claim that the proposal of the honourable member for Barrier can be iustified upon the grounds of economy and justice. The reason why a number of State concerns have not succeeded as they ought to have done, is that those who have been charged with their management have not been in svmpathv with. them. In some cases it was to their interests not to succeed. Can we have a brightei example of what can be accomplished by the State than is afforded by the Newport workshop? Its position has been challenged again and again, and upon each occasion it has come out victorious. When we find the Railways Commissioners appealing to the Government to place a sum of money upon the Estimates to recoup them, because they have had to purchase machinery elsewhere at a greater cost than it could have been manufactured at the workshop in question, it is the best testimony that can be given to its efficiency. Although the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier may not as command a majority on the present occasion, I trust that many of us will live to see, not only a national line of steamers trading between Great Britain and the Commonwealth, but a fleet of our own vessels trading round the coast of Australia. In this Parliament during the last session or two we have heard a great deal about our profound loyalty to the mother country and to Australia. How can we better evidence our Ioyaltv to Great Britain than by. establishing a national line of steamers to trade with that country, and by providing a means of giving effect to the great immigration scheme of which so much has been said? If the Commonwealth owned a line of mail steamers, it could, in the "" of f "" season, carrv immigrants to Australia for practical lv nothing.",74
581,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In fact, it is wonderful what the proposal would accomplish.",74
582,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The difference which the conveyance of a few passengers would make is neither here noi there. That being so, we could bring immigrants to the Commonwealth in the "" of f "" season for practically nothing, and we should only incur the cost of having to feed them in transit.",74
583,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In fact, the prowill posal is a regular bile bean. It will cure all evils.",74
584,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Nothin g will cure all evil's. I believe in competition. If socialistic enterprises cannot withstand competition I will not support them. I am more stronglv in favour of competition than is the deputy-leader of the Opposition, because I would not support an unsound proposal.",74
585,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"If the amendment were carried, a motion would soou be submitted in this House, declaring that owing to "" unfair competition,"" other ships coming to Australia should be prevented from carrying goods.",74
586,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That may be so. Perhaps such things have been done; but the honourable member must recollect that we now have an enlightened democracy sending representatives to Parliament, the like of which has never been known before. I trust that the amendment will be thoroughly threshed out in the light of day, and it is the duty of the Opposition to see that that is done. From every point of view those who support the establishment of a national line of steamers have had the best of the argument, although those who entertain ihe opposite view will, I think, have the best of the voting. Debate (on motion by THOMSON) adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. CANTEEN BILL : ACTION BY THE COMMANDING OFFICER AT QUEENSCLIFFTELEPHONE SERVICE : TOLL SYSTEM.

587,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [10.36] - 1 desire to bring under the notice of the Minister .representing the Minister of Defence a matter of very considerable importance. Honourable . members will recollect that upon Thursday last this House passed through all its stages a Bill for the abolition of canteens. In connection with that measure the Commanding Officer at Queen-scliff has taker, a most remarkable course. He has issued to his officers and men the following circular:From CO . R . A . A ., Victoria, To Officers Commanding Melbourne District. CO . desires that each Warrant Officer, non-commissioned officer, and other soldiers in the R.A.A. serving in Victoria should give a direct answer to the following questions :1. Do you personally desire that the sale of all intoxicating liquors should be forbidden to soldiers in barracks and camp ? a. Do you desire that the canteen as now established should continue? By order, H . COX-TAYLOS, Capt. R.A.A.,",75
588,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Is the honourable member quoting from an official document?,75
589,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I am quoting from a copy of an official circular which has been issued. A referendum of the officers and soldiers is being taken whilst the Bill for the abolition of canteens is under consideration in another place. Mr FISHF.R - There is need for action to be taken somewhere.,75
590,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The course adopted by the Commanding Officer at Queenscliff is decidedlv objectionable, and it seems to me that it is open to the construction that it is an endeavour to discover what officers gave the information, which was used in this Chamber. Mr DUGALD Mr FISHER - Conduc t of that sort should be stopped at once.",75
591,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I have never previously heard of such an attempt being made to interfere with legislation passed by this House. Coming, as it does, from officers who have derived undoubted benefits from the establishment of canteens",75

595,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Yes ; but I do not know by whose order. The course which has been adopted is entirely wrong. I do hope that the Government will take steps to put an end to this sort of thing, and to let the officers at Queenscliff know that they have certain duties to perform. The course of action which has been taken is decidedly outside their duties, and is in insult to this House.",75
596,Mr EWING,Unknown,"Richmond-Vice-Presi Queenscliff, 21 st July, 1906. dent of the Executive Council) [10.39] The honourable member for Melbourne Poits was good enough to inform the Prime Minister that he .intended to bring this matter forward, and the latter has caused certain 'inquiries to be made. I shall read a copy of a memorandum from the Commandant in reference to inquiries regarding the circular issued at Queenscliff by the Commanding Officer of the jRoyal Australian Artillery, Victoria, to officers commanding district. It reads as fol- lows:The Commanding Officer R.A.A. stated in answer to a telephone message that the circular was issued by his authority, and on his own Staff Captain and A d j t. responsibility, as he had been informed that the warrant officers, non-commissioned officers, and men of his command were greatly - surprised at the proposal, to abolish all military canteens, and that, before approaching the Commandant on the matter, desired to know the feelings of the members of his command regarding such canteens. - The copy of the circular is similar to that referred to by the honourable member. The steps that have been taken, however, are likely to toe satisfactory to the House. The Minister of Defence has issued instructions that no further action is to be taken in this matter by the Commanding Officer, Royal Australian Artillery, Victoria, and has directed that the Commandant shall supply a full report regarding it.",75

I have seen in the Argus and Age information which I have been unable to obtain in respect to the action .contemplated by the Government, although when manv of my constituents ask what is likely to take place I am unable to reply.
