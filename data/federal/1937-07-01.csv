This body, which consists of the representatives of eight powers, was set up on the 14th September last to cooperate with the chairman of the Nonintervention Committee in the practical application of the non-intervention agreement. According to information received by the Commonwealth Government, the chairman's sub-committee will meet on Friday, the 2nd July, to consider the proposals of the four Powers hitherto responsible for the naval patrol of the Spanish coasts in regard to the future operation of the patrol. Nothing in the nature of an ultimatum has been delivered to the German and Italian Governments by the British and French Governments.",10
2,Mr BEASLEY,Unknown,"Has the Government received any information regarding the international situation which would warrant a statement such as that made by the Acting Prime Minister of New Zealand, who is reported to have said at a convention in Auckland yesterday that "" since 1914 we have never been closer to a world war than last Thursday""?",10

5,Mr JOHN LAWSON,Unknown,"In view of the ominous position that has developed in Europe, and in view of the contention occurring in the East, will the Government give further consideration to the question of curtailing the export from Australia of scrap iron and scrap tin., either by the imposition of an export duty for a dis- or by imposing an embargo?",10
6,Mr WHITE,Unknown," by leave-The request for an embargo on exports of scrap steel is not a new proposal, and fears have been expressed on several occasions during the past ten or twelve years that shortage of supplies would prevent local users from carrying on. quent events have proved, however, that these fears were unfounded. The request for an embargo was again made a few months ago, and the matter has since' been under close observation. lowing export"" figures of scrap iron and steel for recent years show that this is not a new export:- Year. Tons. 193132 .. .. 2G.052 193233 .. .. 25,310 193334 .. . . 31,260 193435 .. . . 49,230 193536 .. . . 49,173 1930-37 .. . . 47,742 (10 months) Overseas countries and Australian industries have a greater demand for metals, with a consequent increase of prices, and scrap metal prices also have, naturally, advanced. This position has been affected by Japanese competition, and the fact that recently the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited came on the market to buy scrap. The price of scrap steel in the United States of America rose from £3 13s. 2d. in January, 1937, to £4 4s. Sd. in April, and fell again to £3 19s. lOd. in May. In the United Kingdom the prices ranged from £2 17s. Cd. in January, to £3 10s. in April, 1937. The prices vary in Australia, the latest information being' £ ». <i.

A deputation on this matter waited on rae in May last. The employers' side was put by Mr Timmins, the representative of Melbourne Iron and Steel Mills Proletary Limited, which company has been taking a most prominent part in the agitation for an embargo. Mr Timmins had represented in 1934 that his company could not pay more than 25s. a ton for scrap steel and make a profit on the finished article, but he admitted at the interview that he had no difficulty in selling all the steel that he could manufacture. It was admitted by this company's representative at the recent deputation Subse- that there was no real shortage of supplies. That is the principal consideration which affects the Government. If unemployment were likely to be caused, or if Australian industry might be greatly The fol- hindered, some action would have been taken; but the 'principal company interested, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr .Holloway), who introduced the deputation, admitted, said that the question was one of price. Mr HOI.T.OWAY - The prices are uneconomic.",10
7,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"But manufacturers pass on increased costs. It was further admitted that the difficulty would probably be of a temporary nature only, and that the demand for scrap would be considerably eased, probably towards the end of the year, \vhen the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited's new blast ' furnace for treating pig iron had been completed. The Melbourne Ilerdld of the 29th May last, reported that the Japanese were going off the scrap market until prices return to normal, and that the announcement had resulted in a substantial reduction of the price. The department has been receiving frequent and regular reports on this aspect, and recent advices indicate that tliere has been an appre£ H. d. ciable weakening of prices. The latest report from Victoria states that the price has dropped by 15s. a ton ; that very little 2 10 0 new business is being done with Japanese buyers, and that the scrap steel 2 1J 0 being exported is chiefly in fulfilment of past contracts. Latest reports from other States also show that .the position has eased, and users are not being handicapped by shortage of supplies. At one time the price of scrap steel was so low that, owing to freight and other considerations, it was not worthwhile to collect it and bring it any distance. The recent increase of price has encouraged certain firms and individuals to engage in the collection from all parts of the country of this material, which would otherwise be wasted. The Government is not prepared to interfere with trade and force down prices by imposing an export embargo, unless there is very good reason for this course. Upon a careful review of all the facts, it is not considered that the present position is such as to justify an embargo on export of scrap steel. The situation is being closely watched, and, if there is any change justify action, the Government will take it. A Melbourne firm recently made repre30th June? sentations to the Trade and Customs Department for assistance in establishing a new industry for recovering tin and steel from scrap metals. This asked for an embargo or.an export on scrap cast iron and scrap tin to an extent that the prices of these materials ment about them. to local purchasers would be reduced to £2 a ton for scrap cast iron, and £1 10s. a ton for scrap tin. It was estimated that, if the request were approved, the new industry would give employment in Victoria to 27 men, involving wages amounting to £6,500 per annum. Some time ago the department made inquiries, aud ascertained that there was practically no overseas demand for scrap .cast iron, and, that even without such compethe tition, the material was being locally for from £4 to £4 5s. a ton. In recent' months, the Japathe nese have taken some of our scrap cast iron, but it seems obvious that neither an export duty nor an export prohibition would make scrap cast iron available to local users at a price approxiof mating £2 a ton. Taking the price of £7 a ton for scrap tin, an export duty of £5 10s. a ton would be necessary to in which it is done. make the material available to local users at £1 10s. The export of scrap tin from Victoria alone for 1936-37 would exceed 3,000 tons, and, on the basis of a reducchartered tion of price by £5 10s. a ton, the to Victorian canister makers alone would be about £17,000, which is nearly three times the estimated wages to be paid those to be engaged in the new industry in Victoria. It is contrary to GovernTramp ment policy to interfere with trade by imposing export restrictions, unless there is very good reason for such action. the case of this industry the proposition does not appear to be an economic one, and it seems that the industry could only if it were afforded assistance gether out of proportion to its value. After careful consideration, the request for an embargo on scrap tin and scrap cast iron could not be approved. Mr White. FINANCIAL STATEMENT.",11

As soon as they are available, I shall make a public stateWHEAT FREIGHTS.  Commerce aware of the enormous increase of wheat freights from Australia to the United Kingdom and the Continent of Europe made by the shipping companies? If so, is the Government able to do anything to prevent these excessive charges? Is wheat included in freights controlled by the Australian sold Overseas Transport Association?",12
10,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The answer to first question is "" Yes "", and the reply to each of the two subsequent questions is "" No"". In view of the fact that a number of inquiries have been made as 'to the method o*f charging for the carriage wheat and the reason for the increase of the rates, I had intended to make a Bhort statement as to the manner By leaveMost of the wheat shipped from Australia is transported on vessels specially for the purpose. It is cusloss tomary for wheat shippers to arrange their own charter in London. This is done through their own London offices, to where such exist, and otherwise through shipping agents in this country. A Shipping Administrative Committee is established in London, and it . determines a scheme of minimum freight' In rates for the Australian grain trade homeward, and to Eastern ports. These rates appear to be'the basic bargaining exist point upon which actual charges are altoarranged. Whether these minimum rates shall be charged with respect to a particular charter, or some premium above them be also applied, depends in thp first analysis upon the amount of shipping available to meet applications for charters, or anticipated charters, at any particular time. In other words, charter rates are, to a great extent, dependent upon the demand for freights, and upon the available supply for not only the Australian grain trade but also the trade throughout the world. A heavy demand for freights from Argentina or Canada would undoubtedly affect the rates to be applied to Australian shipments. Only a small proportion of the wheat from Australia is shipped on other than chartered vessels. This small percentage is carried as parcels, and the parcel are determined by the Overseas Shipping Representatives Association. The Ausservice, tralian Overseas Transport Association makes arrangements with respect to Sydney ? freights on certain commodities exported from Australia, but wheat shipments do not come within its jurisdiction. As already explained, wheat freights are sidered. determined by arrangement between shippers and shipping companies, matter of the rates operating in regard to them is one which is beyond the scope of the Government's control. AIR MAIL SERVICE'S. POSITION OF ""WESTERN AUSTRALIA. Mr A GREEN"" - I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General i he has noticed a paragraph published in the West Australian of the 25th June, in which a telegraphic message from bourne stated, "" It is considered that federal Ministers and officials will discuss soon the prospects of the Empire air-mail service being diverted from Darwin to Adelaide to serve Western Australia, South Australia, and possibly Victoria and Tasmania "" ? Is he aware that this report has greatly alarmed the being taken. people of Western Australia, more particularly those living in the north-west of the State? When this matter is being considered, will he take into account the risks involved in reducing the effiArbitrator, ciency of the service up the north-west coast, if the service is diverted to Adelaide; also that the proposal would entail a slower service from the Old Country?

15,Mr HAWKER,Unknown,"I ask the Acting Prime Minister why the bill which was introduced last session to provide protection for British shipping between New Zealand and Australia against foreign competition does not appear on the notice paper this session? Is it because this f objective has been dropped, or because of pressure of business, or is it due to the fact that further negotiations are being Melcarried on with New Zealand or some certain other Empire countries?",13
16,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The position in respect of that measure is that it has been restored to the notice-paper in the Senate, where it has been brought exactly to the same stage as it had reached last session, preparatory to further action SHORTER WORKING WEEK.",13
17,Mr DRAKEFORD,Unknown,"Is the Attorney General aware that the Public Service in giving judgment today on the claims of the Public Service for a 40-hour week, stated that, whilst as au individual he held the view that a 40hour week was warranted, he thought as a national question, its initiation to rightly concerned Parliament? Will the in view of that statement by the Public Service Arbitrator, give early consideration to the matter of taking iiotion to bring into operation the 40hour week for industry, and to give it immediate application to those employed in the service of the Commonwealth Government ?",13

Has the Acting Minister any further information on the subject of the physical training of the youth of the Commonwealth ?",14
20,Mr THORBY,PHYSICAL TRAINI NG OF,"Prio r to his departure for England, the Minister for Defence brought under my notice certain discussions which had taken place between himself and the education authorities in some of the States, and expressed anxiety that the whole of the States should be consulted with a view to establishing physical training facilities in each State for the youth of Australia. Those arrangements have not yet been, completed. NA CONFERENCE. Mr MoCALL - I ask the Acting ister Prime Minister if the Tasmanian Goinformation vernment has given any reason for its being the only State to refuse to discuss the proposal for the establishment of 40-hour working week in industry at the forthcoming conference of the States unemployment insurance to be held at Canberra?",14

Dr Page said that the conference would be held in the second or third week of the month?",14

26,Mr NOCK,UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE,I ask the Assistant Minfor Commerce if he can give me any with regard to Tasmania's attitude towards enacting legislation for the purpose of eliminating the draft on a wool as was agreed to 'by the representatives of the States at a meeting of the on Commonwealth Agricultural Council?,14
27,Mr THORBY,UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE,"My recollection is that Queensland, Victoria, South. Ausand Western Australia have already passed legislation along those lines whilst I New .South Wales has agreed to pass similar legislation but has not yet submitted a measure to Parliament. Tasmania is the only State that has not even agreed to introduce such legislation, and from various discussions which I have had with representatives of the grazing industry in Tasmania, I understand that that Government is not inclined to do so. New Zealand and South Africa have agreed to co-operate with Australia in this matter. EMBARGOES ON EXPORTS.",14
28,Mr STREET,UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE,"I ask the Minister for Commerce whether, in view of the suggested imposition of an embargo upon exports such as sheep, tantalite, scrap iron and iron ore, &c, his department will ensure that a situation will not arise from such action whereby i nterested sections in Australia will secure the imposition of an embargo on practically everything for which there is a ready market overseas leaving the Department of Commerce to deal only with surplus products for which it is difficult to secure buyers?

Mr DRAKEFORD.i-Has the Minister for the Interior, had brought under his notice a device known as the Booch patent for overcoming the disadvantages of the break of gauge ? Is he aware that this device has been favourably commented upon by Sir George Julius as the best plan he had yet examined to bring about unification of railways and that, as chairman of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Sir George recommended that the Federal Government earmark £50,000 with a view to thoroughly testing Mr. patent? ""Will the Minister take steps to see that the Booch plan is given a thorough test?  device mentioned by the honourable memconnexion ber and I have made arrangements will permit of my seeing the report, to which he has referred, tomorrow in Sydney. NA COMMISSION. Mr E. J. HARRISON - Has the attention of the Acting Treasurer been drawn to a report in today's Sydney Telegraph purporting to give the recommendations of the commission on banking and monetary reform whose report is now in the hands of the Government? Can he say whether there is any foundation for the statements in the article published that the commission recommends the separation of the reserve and trading sections of the Commonwealth Bank, and that Australia may have a decimal coinage if one recommendation of the commission is accepted?",15
29,Mr MENZIES,MONETARY A ND BANKI NG,"The report to which the honourable member has referred has not been released to the press and anything appearing in the. press regarding this matter is purely speculative.

36,Dr EARLE PAGE,MONETARY A ND BANKI NG,"The only intervention that the Commonwealth Government has been asked for is in regard to an application, in support of other applications, for the admission of Japanese experts to assist in the conduct of certain exploratory engineering operations in connection with the handling of the ore. The Government of Western Australia has not asked the Commonwealth Government to intervene in the development of the deposits, and, from the information available it would probably resent such intervention if it were offered. PRICE OE BUTTER.",16
37,Mr HOLT,MONETARY A ND BANKI NG,"It has been stated by the Secretary of the Dairy Produce Equalization Committee that the latest increase of the price of butter by Id . per lb. was not to offset losses on exports, but was a straight-out benefit to farmers. Will the Acting Prime Minister state whether it is a fact that there have been two recent increases in the price of butter which will mean an additional annual cost to consumers of £1,720,000? Is it practicable to inquire into the prices charged for primary products in the same way as inquiries are made into secondary industries in order that while the producer can thus be assured of a reasonable price for his product, the consumer may be protected against any possibility of"" exploitation? What steps can be taken to ensure that the consumers of butter will be safeguarded ?",16
38,Dr EARLE PAGE,MONETARY A ND BANKI NG,"There have not the been two or three recent increases of the The last previous increase, I understand, was in 1934, when the price was stabilized at 140s. per cwt. As to whether the Tariff Board should inquire into primary industries in order to determine whether exploitation is taking place under the cover of protective duties, I remind the honourable member that such duties are of little value to an industry which must export more than half of of its total production. That was why the Government asked the people to approve a marketing scheme, which alone would assure to the butter producers a protected home market. The primary industries are willing to submit to examination by any impartial body, but their presentcondition is clearly indicated by the fact that the Government has had to find £12,000,000 for the adjustment of farmers' debts.",16
39,Mr ROSEVEAR,MONETARY A ND BANKI NG,"Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that the Dairy Equalization Committee is not only dictating to the retailers the price at which they must sell butter, but that they have also notified them that if they give any consideration by way of coupons, bonuses, &c, their supplies of butter will be cut off? In view of this attempt to force up the price of butter, and to control other people's business",16

41,Mr ROSEVEAR,MONETARY A ND BANKI NG,What action does the Government propose to take?,17
42,Dr EARLE PAGE,MONETARY A ND BANKI NG,I think that the action of the butter producers is on a par with that of labour leaders who demand preference to unionists in regard to what they have to sell.,17
43,Mr FRANCIS,MONETARY A ND BANKI NG,"Is the Minister for Commerce aware that many dairy farmers, owing to drought conditions, have had their production for the season cut by more than 40 per cent.; that a great many of them have been receiving returns less than the basic wage, ana are, in fact, in necessitous circumstances?",17
44,Dr EARLE PAGE,MONETARY A ND BANKI NG,"A very large part of the coastal districts of Queensland and New South Wales, which usually supply more than half the butter produced in the Commonwealth, has experienced exceptionally dry conditions, so that the State governments have had to take steps to provide farmers with fodder for their stock. Butter production during the last four or five months has been reduced to a minimum.",17
45,Mr GANDER,MONETARY A ND BANKI NG,"In view of the controversy regarding the alleged exploitation of the consumers by the butter producers, will the Acting Prime Minister have inquiries made regarding the advisability of introducing into Australia the butter tree, which is described in a recent publication as follows:Butter from a tree sounds ridiculous, but there is such a commodity. The tree from which it is obtained is the butter tree of Weft Africa. The product is Shea butter, a finer produce than the best animal butter.",17

68,Mr MENZIES,FEDERAL AID ROADS AND,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [3.15],- I move That the bill be now read a second time. This is a very large measure. I introduce it today, not in an endeavour to have it passed during the present sittings of the House, but in order that honourable members, as well as the commercial community, and others affected by it, may have a full opportunity to examine and consider it before the House next meets. The necessity for a lengthy speech by me disappears, having regard to the nature of a document that I have had prepared, which contains three things. The first is a very full report by a committee which I appointed to examine the patent law; the second, the existing patent law, and the third, the bill, printed on opposite pages, so that when considering this proposal, honourable members may have not only the benefit of a general explanation of points that have been made the subject of alteration, but also, on opposite pages, the relative portions of the existing legislation ancl the proposed measure. venture to think that honourable members generally will find that an extremely convenient form for the consideration of the measure. In 1929, the Board of Trade in Great Britain appointed an expert committee to report as to whether any amendments of the British Patent Act were desirable. As the result of the report of the committee so set up, very extensive amendments were made in the law in Great Britain in 1932. Subsequently,- a good deal of the work done in England in 1932 received consideration in Australia, and from time to time various suggestions were made as to the incorporation of some of it in the Australian law. In those circumstances, and knowing from my own experience of patent law that several matters very urgently required attention, I invited a committee of gentlemen to undertake what I suggested to them was a real public service, namely, a thorough examination of the patent law, and the decisions that had been given upon it, a full comparison with patent laws elsewhere, the consolidation of the whole of the existing law, and the recommendation of such amendments as seemed desirable to make the law more effective, improve the expedition of transactions under it, and increase the security attaching to such transactions. The committee to which I ' made that reference consisted of the Solicitor-General, Mr. Knowles, the Commissioner of Patents, Mr Wallach, Mr L . B. Davies, a patent attorney, of Melbourne, who at the time of the appointment was president of the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia, and Mr Arthur Dean, a barrister, of Melbourne, who has had extensive experience in the patent jurisdiction, and for whose ability in relation to these matters I have a very high regard. That committee sat for a long time, and did a great deal of work, for which I express the deep gratitude of the Government.",18

70,Mr MENZIES,FEDERAL AID ROADS AND,"Yes , and did an enormous amount of work. When the report of the committee was completed, and the bill had been prepared, the result was submitted by me to Mr R. S. Bonney, KC., of Sydney, who is a very I eminent practitioner in patent and trade marks work at the Sydney Bar. He, too, very generously made an examination of the matter, and offered further suggestions which, in turn, were considered by the committee, and in some cases were adopted and incorporated in the bill. I mention these facts in order to show that, apart from the ordinary examination which I , with a fairly considerable experience of patent law, would make, these matters have had very close and special consideration by a highly competent committee. I am hopeful that in consequence this legislation will not only bring our patent law completely up to date, but also make it a much more effective instrument for the establishment and preservation of the rights of industrial property in Australia. I feel that there is no doubt that on the passing of this measure, the patent law of Australia will be more up to date than that of any other country. The bill is one which, to the extent it requires to be discussed at all, will no doubt be discussed in committee; consequently, I do not propose to traverse it in detail. I merely want to indicate briefly several respects in which changes are made in the existing law. The first change that I need refer to is that relating to the registration of patents. At the present time, no obligation is placed on the person who becomes the owner of a patent, on transmission or by assignment, to register the fact, with the result that sometimes it is a matter of great difficulty to discover who owns the patent or to establish formal proof of ownership. Clause 21 of the bill proposes to require that where a person becomes entitled to a patent by assignment or transmission, he must apply to the commissioner to register his title; in other words, and in substantial brevity, it requires compulsory registration of the title to patents.",18
71,Mr LAZZAEIHI,FEDERAL AID ROADS AND,Is any better protection being given to the inventor?,19
72,Mr MENZIES,FEDERAL AID ROADS AND,"I believe that, on Hie whole, the clarification of the law proves the position of the inventor. The next matter that I need refer to has a bearing on the point raised by the honourable member. At the present time, it occasionally happens that an invention to which a man has directed'his ingenuity, and which he has genuinely made, is invalidated; that is to say, he is prevented from obtaining protection in relation to it, because it has become known to some other person or the public without his knowledge or consent. The hill overcomes that difficulty by providing that, in cases in which an invention is made public without the authority or knowledge of the inventor, he shall not lose his right to obtain a patent in relation to it. Under the existing law, certain provisions relating to the revocation of patents are somewhat obscurely phrased. It is said, for example, that a patent may be revoked on any ground on which it might have been revoked by writ of scire facias at common law. That has given rise to no end of difficulties, because the grounds on which the common law proceedings may be launched are themselves by no means beyond doubt. Therefore, in this that bill an endeavour has been made to produce certainty on that point by setting out elaborately and with particularity the various grounds on which the revocation of a patent may be sought by any applicant. The next matter to which I wish to refer is concerned with the jurisdiction of the High Court. The High Court has no general jurisdiction today in actions arising out of infringement of patents. In fact, actions for infringement are usually brought in the Supreme Courts of the various States. ""When an action for infringement is brought in the Supreme Court of a State, and the defendant-the alleged infringe!""-wishe s to challenge the validity of the patent, he may counter claim for revocation. He may also, in entirely different circumstances, apply to the High Court for the revocation of the patent. In other words, there is some confusion and overlapping of jurisdiction. The bill proposes to give to the High Court general juris'dietion, concurrently with the Supreme Courts, im- in infringement actions. It also provides that where a defendant in an action for infringement in a Supreme Court counter claims for revocation of the patent, the action will automatically be referred into the High Court; in other words, the revocation of patents will be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the High Court. The result will be to eliminate certain proceedings that occur today. A further advantage will be uniformity of decision, and greater certainty in the law. Another matter to which I might refer is that an appeal tribunal in patent matters is to be established. That tribunal will be the High Court, constituted by a single justice thereof. The object is to provide, as far as possible, that patent matters shall be heard by a judge who is conversant Will patent law-which , as honourable members will realise, is a department of the law in which there is a tendency specialize, and with respect which a great deal of special knowledge is required. Tinder the existing law, certain appeals in patent matters may be brought to the law officer, who is the Attorney-General, or, in certain cases the Crown Solicitor. It is proposed to abolish the appeal to the' law officer, as well as to the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, and to concentrate in the High Court the appeal in those cases, the High Court being made the special appeal tribunal, constituted according to the description that I have given. The last matter to which I wish refer is small, but not unimportant; it is, that the bill makes certain alterations of the law relating to the registration patent attorneys. At the present time there is no - requirement in the law that a patent attorney follows need be a British subject or 21 Laying years of age. The result is that there no restriction on the registration of aliens, nor is there any age limit. I proposed to provide that an applicant registration must satisfy the CommisHouse. sioner of Patents that he is a British subject and not less than 21 years of age. There are other provisions of a highly necessary kind, to prevent unqualified persons from practising. These are just a few matters that I have selected from those that are dealt with in the bill. I warmly commend honourable members their consideration of the memorandum that I have had cirnatural, culated, which, I am sure, will prove very great value. The supply of copies of the memorandum is limited, and I am not in a position to provide more than one copy for each member. In it will be found, I believe, a complete illumiCourt, nation, not only by description, but also by comparison of one page with another, of the nature of the proposals made the bill. I hope that I may be permitted to express on my own account the hope that by this means we shall be able effect a complete overhaul of the patent law. It is not, I agree, a matter which attracts much political interest, but it Mr Menzies. the kind of legislation which is of considerable importance to a large number to of persons in the community. to Debate (on motion by Mr BLACKBURN) adjourned. JUDICIARY BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 29th June (vide page 685), on motion by Mr. MENZIESThat the bill be new read a second time.",19
73,Mr BLACKBURN,FEDERAL AID ROADS AND,"Bourke) [3.30] This is really a draftsman's measure which does not change, but merely restates the law to bring within the Judiciary Act the particular provisions contained in that act and other acts relating to to the rules of court. I am rather at a loss to understand why section 202 of the Electoral Act has been omitted from the of schedule. That section provides that the High Court may make rules relating to the hearing of election petitions. It the old form providing for the of< such rules on the table of the is House within 40 days after the making of them. As this measure is quite useful, t is and will make the law more accessible for than at present, I commend it to the Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: The bill.",20
74,Mr MENZIES,FEDERAL AID ROADS AND,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [3.33] - The comment made * to moment ago by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn) is quite having regard to the contents of of the bill. Section 202 of the Electoral Act confers upon the Justices of the High Court the power to make rules, but as the power to make rules is not for the regular practice and procedure of the High but for the Court of Disputed Returns, it has been thought that any such amendment as that contained in this bill in should be made as an amendment of the Electoral Act, to bring it into line with what we are now doing. Consequently-, to when the Electoral Act is next before Parliament for amendment, steps will be taken to introduce into it uniform prois visions with those contained in this bill.",20
75,Mr BLACKBURN,FEDERAL AID ROADS AND,"Bourke) [3.34] I can understand the suggestion that the Electoral Act should be amended, but I cannot understand the suggestion that the jurisdiction conferred by section 202 is not conferred upon the High Court as such. Provision is made in section 184' of the act that the High Court should be a court of disputed returns, and it refers to the jurisdiction of the High Court. Under that section, the High Court exercises a special jurisdiction, but it is still the High Court. On that account it might be thought that it would be more convenient to make the amendment in the Electoral Act. I point out that the Patents Bill, which was before us a few minutes ago, contains a provision based upon that section. I offer no objection to this bill on the ground that it does not include the section of the Electoral Act to which I have referred, but I thought it right to draw attention to it. Bill agreed to, and reported from mittee without amendment; adopted. Bill-by leave-rea d a third time. NA ENDOWMENT BILL 1937. SECOND BEADING. Debate resumed from the 30th June, matically follow. (vide page 774), on motion by Mr. HUGHESThat the bill be now read a second time. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [3.36] - I commend this bill to honourable members. It is highly desirable that it should be passed. I would have this sitting! been.glad had its provisions been more comprehensive in some respects, but, as it is, the measure evidently gives effect to strong recommendations that have been made for some time to various govern to ments in connection with the general health of the community. We have made available, from time to time, various sums of money for research into agriculwill tural diseases, diseases in cattle, tick eradication, and the like, but Australia is one of the few remaining countries which no generous sum of money has shall been made available for medical research work. The principle of this measure, which is sound, is hased on the utmost simplicity, with the object of regularizing research into medical problems. Notwithstanding its simplicity, however, the bill is one of the most important submitted to the Parliament this session, for it deals with fundamentals, and recognizes the necessity for governmental administration. 'Good government must obviously be concerned with the health of the people. It should also give attention, through some of its activities, to the health trends of various nations, for they have been the cause of humbling many mighty peoples in the past. History is full of experiences and evidence that will bear out this statement. The Minister for Health (Mr Hughes) has supplied honourable members with certain figures dealing with disorders of one kind and another that are, in themselves, rather alarming, embracing tuberculosis, cancer, heart disease, and other common ailments. He pointed out that our general death comrate, which is 9.4 per cent., was lowreport possibly the lowest in the world, excepting New Zealand. But the pleasure that the contemplation of this fact may give us is destroyed when we take into account the percentage of population contained in our - youngest age groups. Quite obviously, as the years pass, these people will pass out of young age groups intoolder age groups and an increased death rate must autoHonorable members have seen an indication of this in the increased number of applications for the old-age pension.",21
76,Mr CURTIN,MEDICAL EESEAEOH,"Does the honourable member desire this bill to be passed at Mr E. J. HARRISON - I do; but I wish to advance some facts which I think even the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) will regard as sufficiently serious justify the time taken in submitting them. [Quorum formed.] It is not my intention to delay the passage of-the bill, but the facts that I propose to advance be of such a character as should cause the Government to consider whether the scope of the proposed research should in not be widened in certain respects. I refer, first, to certain considerations which are largely responsible foT our infantile death rate, which is higher today than it was 30 years ago. ""We should also be seriously concerned by the fact that our maternal mortality rate is higher than it was 25 years ago. I have ueiore me a number of reports on this subject to which I desired to direct attention, but I shall not occupy time in doing so at the moment. Various committees which have investigated this subnet over a period of years, both in Australia ancl overseas, have drawn attention to the fact that toxaemias of various kinds have never been traced directly to their cause. This important fact should be investigated. The final report of the Departmental Committee on Maternal Mortality and Morbidity, issued by the Ministry for Health in London, makes the following significant statement on this point:Owing to too infrequent examinations of urine and the assumption of blood pressure, toxaemias are often not recognized in even when recognized they are often inadequately treated. Tlic causation of these toxaemias is not understood, and very little advance has been made towards new knowledge. I ask that the Medical Research Institute be requested to make an investigation into this subject, and also into the cause and eradication of puerperal sepsis, which is astoundingly prevalent. A comprehensive report on these subjects, arising f r o investigations by research officers, be invaluable. Various persons of high standing who have investigated the important subject of maternal mortality have made reports upon it to the Government from time to time. I refer, in particular, to Dame Janet Campbell,, who visited Australia some time ago, and also Dr Morris. Every effort should be made to overcomethis wastage of our national life. The recommendations made in conFar nexion with child-birth also deserve sition serious consideration. I urge the Minisexpedite ter to direct the Medical Research pression Institute to inquire into the extraordinary wastage of life that occurs in this direction. Of the 500 mothers who die Australia i u each year, one-half of them are about 30 years of age, and about oneoffer third die in their first experience motherhood. These are the women should be likely to bear the greatest number of children. [Quorum formed.] I am sorry to notice that the Opposition I am to do? Mr B. J. Harrison. as a whole is so callous with regard to this measure, and that its obstructionist tactics prevent me from completing my remarks.",21

HARRISON - Why should the Leader of the Opposition determine what",22
85,Mr CURTIN,MEDICAL EESEAEOH,"But if electioneering speeches were to be delivered by Government supporters then most certainly further speeches would be made on our side. I answer the charge of disinterestedness by directing attention to a report on child endowment which, in 1928 in association with Mrs Mildred Muscio, I wrote in my capacity as a Commissioner, in which, representations that work of the character which this .bill makes possible should be carried out were made to the Commonwealth Government. I rose only to impress these facts on the honourable member for ""Wentworth (Mr E. J. Harrison) in order that I might make it plain that the Opposition congratulates the Government on. bringing down this measure. It regards it as a definite contribution towards enabling important national problems to be scientifically and properly dealt with.

87,Mr GREGORY,ACTS INTERPRETATION,"Swan) [3.49] What provision is contained in this measure for dealing with motions for the disallowance of ordinances and regulations? Will a motion of such nature be immediately submitted to the House and dealt with when moved?

The obligation on the Government to submit these Supplementary Estimates to Parliament preserves the authority of Parliament over public expenditure. In respect of expenditure of this description, that authority is more nominal than actual, but that is unavoidable. The only suggestion that can be made is one with which I feel certain the Acting Treasurer (Mr Menzies) will agree, namely, that Supplementary Estimates ought to be presented to Parliament at the earliest possible moment. Further, in making so substantial an advance to the Treasurer as is customary under the general Estimates, there ought to be some understanding that departures from policy not envisaged in the budget should be made the subject of a definite intimation to 'the Parliament before expenditure is incurred in connection therewith. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. NA APPROPRIATIO N (WORKS A ND BUILDINGS) BILL 1935-36. Bill brought up by Mr MENZIES, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",24
94,Mr MENZIES,SUPPLEMENT ABY,"Kooyong-Actin g Treasurer) [4.8] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. This bill covers the new works aspect of the Supplementary Estimates. The only tiling that I need say in connection with it is that of the £190,S31, the main item is £165,000 for telephone services, including the telephone cable between the mainland and Tasmania. These works are of a reproductive nature.",25
95,Mr MAHONEY,SUPPLEMENT ABY,"Denison) [4.9] - Is it the intention of the Postmaster General's Department to devote some of the profits derived from radio licences to the carrying out of the building programme of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Melbourne, Sydney, and Hobart? Prom time to time the Government has promised to erect a studio in Hobart for the commission so that the services .of the local artists could be availed of. At present, so far as national stations are concerned, the people of Tasmania have to rely on programmes from the mainland States. That is contrary to the policy of decentralization advocated by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I am disappointed that this bill does not provide funds for the building of a studio at Hobart, as promised. About eighteen months ago the chairman of the commission said that plans and specifications would immediately be drawn up to enable the building to be proceeded with. Later we were told that Mr Cleary was to go abroad to inquire into new methods and improved technique, with a view to improving the broadcasting servicesin this country. He has now returned to Australia, and there is no longer any oxcuse for delay. Two blocks of land in Hobart have been purchased by the commission, and the old building on one of them has been demolished. The house on the other block is unoccupied. Such poor business management is not to the credit of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Eighteen months ago I was informed that the - first studio to be erected for the commission would be at Hobart, but I now understand that the commission has decided that new buildings must first be provided for Sydney and Melbourne, and has stated that there is not sufficient money to build a studio at Hobart. I hold the Government to its promise to erect the first building at Hobart. Mr Cleary, chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, has thrown the responsibility on the Government, which, he says, has not made sufficient money available to the commission to erect these buildings. The delay in this matter is causing the people of Tasmania to lose faith in the present Government; their attitude to it will be reflected at the next election. The Government cannot evade its responsibilities by saying that the people of Tasmania have not pressed for the erection of a studio at Hobart, for I , as well as other honourable members, have brought this matter forward on many occasions. I also protest against the extravagance of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in buying two blocks of land when one would have sufficed. Mr MENZIES.^-I shall convey the honourable member's protest to the Postmaster-General.",25
96,Mr BARNARD,SUPPLEMENT ABY,"Bass) [4.15] - I support the remarks of the honourable member for Denison (Mr Mahoney) concerning the unsatisfactory wireless broadcasting service provided in Tasmania. The Acting Treasurer (Mr Menzies) informed the House that as this measure covers only the Supplementary Estimates for 1936, the remarks of the honourable member for Denison were somewhat irrevelant, but as debate on the Supply Bill was curtailed, we have had no other opportunity to bring the matter before the House.",25
97,Mr SPEAKER,SUPPLEMENT ABY,"Hon. G. J. Bell) I do not wish to curtail the remarks of the honourable member, but the subject he is discussing is irrelevant.",25
98,Mr BARNARD,SUPPLEMENT ABY,"I do not desire to transgress your ruling, Mr Speaker; but the plant at 7LA is obsolete equipment transferred from 3LO. Moreover, the studio in Hobart is situated in an old and generally unsuitable building. I trust that the Acting Treasurer will bring under the notice of the PostmasterUeneral the request that more modern facilities be provided.",26
99,Mr MENZIES,SUPPLEMENT ABY,"Kooyong - Acting Treasurer) [4.17] - I have a great deal of sympathy with what has been said by the honourable member for Denison (Mr. Mahoney) and the honourable member for Bass (Mr Barnard). I shall convey their requests, which support requests previously made by practically every Tasmanian representative, under the notice of the Postmaster-General. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. NA CHARGES BILL 1937 In Committee of Ways and Means: .",26
100,Mr THOBBY,PRIMARY PRODUCE EXPORT,"Calare-Assistant Minister for Commerce) [4.18] - I move1. That, subject to a lower rate being prescribed by regulations made under the Primary Produce Export Charges Act 1935, as amended by the act passed to gi've effect to resolution, in respect of any of the kinds of primary produce to which that act, as so amended, applies, a charge, at the rates hereunder respectively specified, shall, on and a date to be fixed by proclamation issued under the act passed to give effect to this resolution be imposed on the following primary produce exported from the Commonwealth to any place other than the United Kingdom or the Continent of Europe:On fresh apples - Pe r case, two half-cases ov three trays, three-eighths of one penny. On fresh pears - Pe r case, two half-cases or three trays, three-eighths of one penny. 2. That, where the Governor General has. by order published in the Gazette, after report to the Minister by any organization prescribed by the regulations under the Primary Produce Export Charges Act 1935, or under that act as amended by the act passed to give effect to this resolution, exempted, cither unconditionally, or subject to such conditions or in respect of such period (if any) as were specified in the order of exemption, any primary produce to which the Primary Produce Export. Charges Act 1935, as amended by the act passed to give effect to this resolution, applies, from the charges imposed by or under that act as so amended, the Governor General may, by order published in the Gazette, cancel the exemption and thereupon those charges shall, from the date fixed by the order, become payable in respect of that kind of primary produce. The Government regrets that it is necessary to submit the resolution, in which no vital principle is involved, at this stage. The object is merely to extend the levy of three-eighths of a penny a case now imposed on apples and pears exported to the United Kingdom and other European countries, to apples and pears exported to all countries. Under existing conditions no levy is chargeable on apples and pears exported to countries other than those mentioned. This causes difficulty in ascertaining whether the fruit may be going to a destination where the charge would be leviable or to some port where it would be exempt. The apple and pear council have made strong representations to the Government to amend the Primary Produce Export Charges Act to make a uniform charge on all apples and pears exported from the Commonwealth.",26
101,Mr CURTIN,PRIMARY PRODUCE EXPORT,Regardles s of their destination ?,26
102,Mr THORBY,PRIMARY PRODUCE EXPORT,"Yes . This proposal, if adopted will avoid difficulty at the port this or country to which the produce is being exported. Moreover, we have been advised by the Crown Law authorities that after the present system is likely to cause some difficulty in connection with trade treaties and our trade relations generally with other countries, because there is differentiation in respect of apples and pears. Mr Scuuvrsr - How has this position arisen ?",26
103,Mr THOBBY,PRIMARY PRODUCE EXPORT,"When the principal act was passed practically all apples and pears exported from Australia were consigned to the United Kingdom or to European countries, but since then. consignments have been despatched to other destinations. This amendment has been sought by the industry. The imposition of a levy will increase the funds of the council and enable further advertising and publicity work to be undertaken, particularly overseas.",26
104,Mr CURTIN,PRIMARY PRODUCE EXPORT,"Fremantle) [4.25] The explanation which the Assistant Minister for Commerce (Mr Thorby) has given should commend the proposal to the. committee; but I enter a most emphatic protest against the manner in which the business has been introduced. No intimation of any kind was given to me concerning ' this resolution, and I frankly object to the procedure which has been adopted. Some of the measures which in a general way are non-contentious have to be disposed of somewhat hurriedly to facilitate administration; but this weakness in the existing law must have been discovered some time ago. The ordinary procedurein connection with the imposition of the levy ought to be adhered to as far as possible. E cannot exonerate Ministers from the charge of having treated honourable members discourteously. I have agreed to the passage of some of the' bills which appear on the notice-paper, because we have had an opportunity to study them. We have refrained from debating them because we did not wish to delay the business of the House. Although the explanation of the Assistant Minister annears satisfactory, it might be found, if more time were available, that this motion is unnecessary. I am under the imnression that originally this matter was dealt with somewhat hurriedly with the result that Parliament failed to make the imposition general. T do not know whether there will be any serious breakdown in the working of the act if this matter be deferred until liament re-assembles; if no inconvenience will arise it should be deferred. If , on the contrary, the Assistant Minister can assure me that some grievous harm will result to the exporters, owing to a new trade having developed which is outside the scope of the levy imposed under our existing legislation, I am prepared to support the motion. I cannot accept responsibility for this type of legislation because I have not had an opportunity to study its purport.",27
105,Mr GREGORY,PRIMARY PRODUCE EXPORT,"Swan) [4.28] - I have no objection to the bill. Western Australian primary producers are exporting large quantities of fruit to India, on which this export levy will be imposed. [20] On many occasions I have strongly urged the Government to enter into negotiations with India in an endeavour to obtain some tariff concession to enable us to extend our trade with that country. At present there is a duty of 30 per cent, on fruit and vegetables imported into India and American and Japanese exporters can secure the best of the market. The Government should be able to enter into a trade agreement with India under which the Western Australian primary producers will be able to get a larger share of the trade with that country.",27
106,Mr WHITE,PRIMARY PRODUCE EXPORT,It has tried; we cannot even get the British preferential rate.,27
107,Mr GREGORY,PRIMARY PRODUCE EXPORT,The only report received dealt with trade between the eastern States of Australia and India. No reference was made in that report to trade between Western Australia and India. If the Government would give consideration to the request some benefit might accrue.,27
108,Mr FROST,PRIMARY PRODUCE EXPORT,"Franklin) [4.30] - I am quite in accord with the principle of the bill. I agree with the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) that something should be done to increase our trade with India and the East. The Tasmanian fruit-growers have been unable to execute many orders received from the East .for fruit, because suitable shipping space has not been available. Consequently, a profitable market has been lost. When I and a number of other members of this chamber were in England some time ago, reprePar- sentatives of India informed us that a considerable trade in Australian fruit could be developed with that, country, if it could be placed on the Indian market at a reasonable price.",27
109,Mr MAHONEY,PRIMARY PRODUCE EXPORT,"Denison) [4.33] - I support the remarks of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Frost) - The growers of apples in Tasmania' produce remarkably good crops, but frequently thousands of cases of fruit cannot be marketed because of lack of shipping space, and the fruit is left to rot on the ground. Apple-growing under scientific methods is of no use unless active steps are taken to assist the orchardists to find profitable markets for their produce. This year one of the biggest crops i i i the history of the State was grown, but, the orchardists suffered because they could not ship their fruit to markets where could be sold. When the representatives in them. of Tasmania asked the Commonwealth for assistance last year, we were told by the Minister for Commerce (Dr Earle Page) that the matter was under conadopted. sideration.",27
110,Mr THORBY,PRIMARY PRODUCE EXPORT,"B y this bill the Governprepare ment is giving more than consideration to the growers. . Mr MAHONEY - I commend ' the Ministry for the assistance which will be given under this measure, but the growers require further assistance so that they will not be placed in the position of having thousands of cases of fruit left on their hands. The honourable member for - Franklin has mentioned that apples could have been sent to India this year had shipping space been available. The Government should endeavour to see that the ""growers have sufficient freight space allotted to them to enable them to export their f r u it . to. any part of the world where it can be marketed. The growers are struggling against great natural disadvantages. 'A-government that allowed .them to suffer the hardship of having to leave, their fruit to rot in the orchards would. deserve strong condemnation.",28
111,Mr HAWKER,PRIMARY PRODUCE EXPORT,"Wakefield) [4.40] The difficulty referred to by the Assistant Minister for Commerce ' (Mr Thorby) amendment or debate. in explaining the necessity for this bill should obviously be rectified. Probably the growers desire to have it rectified, but this fact scarcely excuses the Government for bringing the measure forward at this stage of the session^ without previous warning to the committee, and asking it requests:to pass the bill in a few minutes. Almost every session a few small bills are submitted immediately before the Parliament rises, which, no doubt, could have been introduced earlier. Although I do not intend to exercise my right as a private member to obstruct the passage of this bill, because I consider it to be a. non-contentious and manifestly desirable one, I. should be sorry to assist in establishing a . precedent . that private members generally should be expected to give their - agree d toconsent, on behalf of their constituents, to measures introduced in these circumthe stances, seeing that no time is available to the for their examination by the people in it the country who are directly interested Question resolved in the affirmative.

ADJOURNMENT. CANBERRA HOSPITAL: REPORT OF ROYAL COMMISSION-AI R MAIL SERVICES : POSITION OF WESTERN AUSTRALIASITTINGS OF PARLIAMENT. Motion (by Mr MENZIES) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",28
114,Mr CURTIN,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"Premantle) [5.24] - I desire to direct attention to the report tabled today of the royal commissioners who inquired into certain matters remitted to them in respect of the Canberra hospital. I have had no time to peruse it in detail, but I am astonished to find that the commission reports that it had much evidence which would enable it to bring forward a more critical report, and is prepared to do so should the occasion ever arise. It seems to me that the commissioners contemplated furnishing a sort of Kathleen Mavourneen report if the Minister for Health (Mr Hughes) desires that to be done. I ask the right honourable gentleman does he not consider that the public interest demands that the various matters remitted"" to the royal commissioners for decision should be at least the subject of some indication of what they consider the weight of evidence warranted them deciding. A perusal of the report leaves me the impression that the commissioners have put the interests of a group of medical men before the public interest, and that they have shown a certain amount of bias by their attitude. The report of the proceedings before the commission which appeared in the press suggested, too, that certain evidence that could not be regarded as coming within the meaning of the terms of strictly medical testimony-by that I mean the discussion of matters which would be private as between a medical practitioner and his or her patient-ha d not been made available to the public. The commissioners say that there are matters which they could deal with more critically than they have done, and they invite the Government to say whether or not this more critical report should be furnished. Does the Minister intend to invite the commission to make a more complete report? Broadly speaking, it appears to me that the commission has abandoned t&e terms of reference. I direct attention in this connection to paragraph 14 of the terms of reference which reads as follows:To inquire into and determine whether owing to gossip or criticism emanating from the Canberra Government Hospital any honorary medical officer has been compelled in self defence to perform unnecessarily major operation on a patient critically ill . The comment which the commission makes is as follows: The commission is of the opinion that in spite of adverse criticism of whatsoever nature, no medical officer of any institution should perform an operation which he considers unnecessary if his judgment dictates otherwise. That appears to me to be rather a ridiculous observation. It does not answer the question contained in the terms of 1 reference as to whether this was or was not done, and it goes on to say that no medical officer ought to perform an operation unless he thinks it is necessary. I could say that myself without evidence or inquiry. I do not know what the Minister thinks about it, but the report gives me the impression of being vague and unsatisfactory. Either those matters which he remitted to the commissioners were matters which they should decide upon, or else there should have been no inquiry at all. That appears to sum up the situation. I ask the right honourable gentleman whether he intends to direct the commission to furnish this more critical report which the commissioners say they are in a position to submit? I also desire to refer to a matter which was raised by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) in connection with air routes in Western Australia which may be affected as a result of the conclusion of the overseas air-mail agreement. I point out that the commercial air routes in Western Australia have been developed very considerably under the stimulus of the postal services which they were able to associate with passenger traffic. I also remind honourable members that the Western Australian air services were among the first of the Australian aerial services, and that with the exception of the East-West service they have not been dependent on Commonwealth subventions to any material extent. These aerial services traverse a portion of Australia which cannot be adequately served by a sea-service because of the cost, the comparatively limited population and the small amount of traffic, although the State Government has an excellent shipping service, and vate companies are also operating in conjunction with the State service. The shipping services are adequate for the requirements of the present sea-borne trade, but the gaps between the sailings are many and 'delays in connection with transportation of passengers and of mails by sea are out of keeping with the modern conception of what is required. It is impracticable to service this immense territory by railways or roads. If we look at the map particularly of the north-west of ""Western Australia, having regard to its distance from Perth and the fact that that country is an important part of the territory of Australia, we realise that we must do our utmost, not only to preserve such settlement as is there, but also to encourage even more settlement. I hope that the deep significance of aerial services in that connection will be appreciated by the Govern^ ment. These services are being rendered by private enterprise-I say that merely to state the fact-and should the diversion of the overseas air-mail service result in the Western Australian overseas mail arriving at Adelaide or at any other capital of the eastern States, the gravest injury will be done to the Western Australian aerial services north of Perth. Probably, almost certainly, an advantage will be given to the East-West air service; but the general impression in Western Australia is that the round-about route down to Adelaide, and then west to Perth, would mean the retrogression of the service, even as it now stands, with respect to overseas mails. I invite the Acting Leader of the House (Mr Menzies) to give consideration to the representations that have been made in 'this matter. I have merely amplified what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has said. I feel confident that the whole of the representation of Western Australia in this Parliament, regardless of party, will agree with the views that I have expressed. Mr Curtin.",29
115,Mr NAIRN,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"Perth) [5.31] - I support the remarks of the Leader' of the Opposition (Mr Curtin). Earlier in thp day I asked the Acting Prime Minister (Dr Earle Page) as to whether the Government would consider the completion of the existing service on the north-west coast of Western Australia. The pri- proposal, as I understand it, is that, commencing about January, 1938, there will be a tri-weekly overseas service from Darwin to London. It has been suggested that mails from and to Western Australia will be carried through either Adelaide or Sydney. The result of the adoption of that proposal would be loss of time in the delivery of overseas mails in Western Australia. I urge upon the Government the extension of the north-west service. At present, the route is from Perth to Wyndham. Mr HAWK.UK - And on to Daly Waters.",30
116,Mr NAIRN,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"To complete the service, only an additional 200 miles at most would have to be flown. That would not be a serious matter from the viewpoint of expense, but, on the other hand, the additional service would be of great importance. I feel with the Leader of the Opposition that, if the north-west service loses the transport of overseas mails to Western Australia, it is likely to become unprofitable and deteriorate, probably into a weekly service. That would be very much against the interests not only of the people of the north-west, but also of the defence of Australia. There are Very strong reasons for continuing and, indeed, improving the service on the north-west coast.",30
117,Mr STREET,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"Corangamite) [5.33] I wish to draw attention to a matter which I believe is responsible for a certain degree of dissatisfaction among honourable members generally; I refer to the sitting periods of this Parliament. It should be possible for the Government so to arrange its business that this House would sit for definite periods. For example, it might sit in March, April and May, and then adjourn until the michPe of August, when it could sit until it had disposed of its business. I realise, of course, that, in a state of emergency, it could be called together immediately. All honourable members, I think, ""will agree that if Parliament were to lay it down that the sittings should be during certain specified months, it would function more effectively and the work would lie done in a more business like manner, in Victoria, the State Parliament sits (.luring the last, six months of the year. 'Chat might not be altogether suitable for Canberra, because of the severity of the winter months here, but I do think that honourable members should be able to see sufficiently far ahead to know when Parliament would meet. That would give them a far better opportunity than they now have to deal with the innumerable reports that they receive. Under the present Fystem, which would seem to be not a system, but merely a haphazard method of meeting from time to time, I believe that Parliament is not capable of exercising properly its deliberative functions. I , therefore, hope that the Government will investigate the possibility of the institution of a system such as I have suggested, and, should the improbable occur, and the Treasury bench he occupied by another party, that party should make the investigation. I am sure that action along these lines would meet with the approval of all honourable in embers.",30
118,Mr HAWKER,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"Wakefield) [5.36] I rise to address myself to the subject that has been brought before the House by the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn), and, earlier, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green). I wish to draw n. very definite distinction between the reasonable request from South Australia, which has the support of, and is being strongly pressed by, every honourable member from that State, for a direct connection with"" the overseas air mail service, and the extended request - I do not know whether it has actually been brought before the Government, but it has received a certain amount of publicity in Soxith Australia-that the mails for Western Australia should be diverted through Adelaide. As a South Australian, i he latter request appears to me to be quite an unfair one. I , with probably every other honourable member from South Australia, dissociate myself from any request which would have the effect of damaging the existing service on the north-west coast of Western Australia, where there are so few alternative services, and any service with proper ground organization to support it is so valuable to the supervision, and probably the protection, of the coastline in that part of Australia.",31
119,Mr HUGHES,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"North Sydney-Minister for Health) [5.38] - The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) has directed attention to the report that I tabled today of the Hospital Commission, which was asked to conduct an inquiry into the dispute at the Canberra Community Hospital. The honourable gentleman is not satisfied with that report, although it has very much to recommend it. I am sure he will appreciate the fact that it is at all times possible to present a report that will attract the attention of the multitude and be regarded as a credit to those who make it, but it is not so easy to do what this commission' was expected to do, namely, make a report on the evidence and at the same time enable the hospital to carry on as an institution for the benefit of the people of Canberra. The honourable gentleman referred to the evidence. I have not read it, but the report states, at page 1, that 36 witnesses were examined on oath and 297 pages of evidence were taken. As I have said I have not informed my mind on that evidence, but I shall have an opportunity to do so in the days that are to come. Whether, as a result, I shall conclude that the report presented is something short of perfection remains to be seen. At the moment, I am not prepared to say more than this: The report clears up one or two points that were seriously disturbing the minds of the people of Canberra. These are referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the terms of reference to the commission which were as follows:To inquire into and determine why so many patients, especially poor patients, refuse point blank to enter the Canberra Community Hospital although in many cases contributing towards its upkeep. To inquireinto and determine whether or not there are at the moment patients critically ill and chronically ill in homes totally unable to provide nursing and/or hygienic services who refuse for definite and specific reasons to enter the Canberra Community Hospital. That is a serious charge. The commission's answer, which is very definite, and appears to me to be quite satisfactory, isA. number of patients gave evidence to the effect that they wouid not enter the Canberra Community Hospital, but the commission has experienced many similar expressions of complaint about many hospitals and is of the opinion that the reasons advanced by these patients for refusal to enter were not justified. The honourable member will appreciate that the members of this commission Avere trained to weigh and estimate the value of evidence given in such an inquiry as that which occupied their attention in Canberra.",31
120,Mr CURTIN,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"They were medical practitioners, not legal practitioners, and were not more trained to weigh evidence than we are.",32
121,Mr HUGHES,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"I do not propose to argue the matter at length. I point out, however, that internees of a hospital and nursing staff and doctors, are an isolated community engaged in absorbing duties in a somewhat depressing atmosphere, in which there is a tendency to friction. Trifles are magnified, personal feelings and likes and dislikes are intensified, and colour their outlook and affect their relations in a way that would not occur in a larger community. The smaller the hospital and community, the more likely such troubles are to arise. The commission that visited Canberra has visited many hospitals in which similar disputes have occurred. The paragraph of the report referred to by the Leader of the Opposition readsThe commission has much evidence which Mould enable it to bring forward a more critical report and is prepared to do so should the occasion ever arise. The commission, however, lakes the view that the present spirit of conciliatory co-operation should be fostered and developed by the spirit of its comments and takes pleasure in publishing a helpful and constructive, rather than a critical, report. I do not see anything there suggestive of Kathleen Mavourneen. All that the commission says is, "" Do not do it again. Tf you behave yourselves like good children, things will be all r i g h t ; otherwise, look out."" That is my interpretation of what the commission said. Mr CURT IN j - To whom is that said? Is it said to the department controlling the hospital, to the board members, to the medical officers in attendance, or to the patients? Who is not to do it again, whatever that is?",32
122,Mr HUGHES,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"The hospital has been established primaril y for the benefit of the patients. The doctors are there to minister to the patients, merely accessories for their benefit to alleviate their sufferings and, if possible, cure .'their - ills. The governing principle is that the hospital exists for the benefit of the patients. I shall see that that is upheld. I do not pretend to defend anything that has been done which conflicts with that principle. No doubt things have been done which should not have been done. The commission was askedTo inquire into and determine whether, owin>r to gossip or criticism emanating from the Canberra Government Hospital any honorarv mcdical officer has been compelled in self defence to perform unnecessarily major operation on a patient critically ill .",32
123,Mr SCULLIN,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,Did it do so?,32
124,Mr CURTIN,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"At any rate, it did nor. answer the question.",32
125,Mr HUGHES,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"I agree with the comment of the Leader of the Opposition on that point, but the commission did sayThe commission is of the opinion that im spite of adverse criticism of whatsoever nature, no medical officer of any institution should perform an operation which he considers unnecessary if his judgment dictates otherwise..",32
126,Mr CURTIN,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"If the right, honourable"" gentlemen were on trial for murder, and I were the jurv, it would not be sufficient for me to say "" You should not commir murder "".",32
127,Mr HUGHES,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"If a patient goes to"" Dr B l a n k "" who diagnoses his troubleas appendicitis, and finds, on removing the appendix, that it is perfectly good"" and healthy, he is undoubtedly liable under the section! In other words, as in, cooking, the proof of the pudding is in the eating of it . Everything would depend upon the state of the appendix. However, I shall communicate the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition toDr Colvin and ask why it was thought inadvisable for the commission to submit a report on the evidence to which reference is made. For the rest, I am most loathe to do anything at all that will' fan these dying embers into a blaze again. I am here as the guardian of the patients, and the board has been appointed to consider the well-being of the patients and to administer the affairs of the hospital with that object in view. Medical officers, of course, have their rights, and it is perfectly proper for the British Medical Association to see that they are protected. My position is different. With other honourable members here, I represent the people at large. Our business is to see that their interests are protected, and we shall doubtless do it.",32

Total .. AERO CLUBS: GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE FOR TRAINING PILOTS. Mr THORBY;-On the 30th June, the honourable member for Lilley (Sir Donald Cameron) asked the Acting Minister for Defence the following questions, upon notice:1. Is he in possession of particulars regarding governmental assistance to aero clubs for the purpose of training pilots in civil aviation in South Africa,. Canada, and New Zealand ? 2. If so, will he inform the House of the .nature of the assistance so. rendered? I a m now in a p o s it i o n to f u r n i following replies:1. Yes. 2. South Africa - An initia l grant of £30 is paid by the Government to aero clubs in respect of each pilot (male or female) who qualifies for an "" A "" licence. A second grant of £30 is paid for each male pilot who completes a further. 25 hours' solo flying, and a third grant of £100 is paid in respect of each male pilot who .qualifies for - the reserve of pilots before reaching the age of 36. years. The clubs pass on a share of the subsidy to pilots, in the following proportion, viz., first grant*-£1 0 flying credit; second grant-£1 5 in cash'; and t h i r d grant-£9 0 in cash. It is understood that the above basis of subsidy is being ..modified, and that a new scheme is proposed^ whereby the Government will pay clubs and schools the full 'cost of training pilots up 'to' 50 hours flying and non-continuous training thereafter. Canada - Aer o clubs are permitted to hold and use the equipment which has been made available:, previously by the Government. Such equipment, however, remains the property of the Government, and may not be disposed of except' as the Government may authorize. A bonus of 100 dollars is paid by the Government' to clubs in respect of each male pilot between the ages of 17 and 45 years who qualifies for an "" A "" licence. A further bonus of 4 dollars an - hour is paid by the Government to clubs in respect of pilots undergoing training for "" B "" (commercial) licences. This bonus is limited to a maximum of 40' hours, and is payable when a pilot .qualifies for "" B "" licence.. The maximum amount.of sub£ sidy payable to any one club annually for the training of pilots is 3,000 dollars. An additional grant of 5,000 dollars is made each year to the Canadian Flying Clubs Association 244,627 to enable that body to maintain a central office for the more convenient regulation of the flying club movement. ' .. 351,028 New Zealand - The Government makes an initial issue (on loan) of one or two aircraft, .. 431,470 complete with engines, to any approved club. Should such equipment be insufficient to meet the demand for flying instruction in any . . 1,027,125 approved club the Government, at the request of the club, may issue one further complete aircraft at any time within a period of five years from date of issue of the initia l equipment, conditional upon the club providing at the same time and at its own cost aircraft and equipment of a value equal to that which it has requested from the Government. All aircraft and equipment issued by the Government to any approved club remains the property of the Government. The Government, however, recently approved of aircraft on loan becoming the property of clubs after completion of 1,000 hours' flying. A bonus of £40 is paid to clubs in respect of each of the first five mule pilots between the ages ot seventeen and 30 who qualify, for "" A "" licences, a bonus of £25 for each of the second five, and a bonus of £10 for other pilots. A bonus is also payable in respect of male pilots between the ages of eighteen and 35 years s h the who renew their licences. The rate of bonus is £10 for each of the first ten pilots, and £5 for each of the second ten pilots. The annual maximum amount of subsidy payable to any one club is £500. The foregoing particulars are the latest available in the Defence Department. DERBY AERODROME.",33

139,Mr ROSEVEAR,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO AL L,"the Minister for the Interior, upon n-otice1. Will ho have further investigations made into the case of Lum Hoy, a prohibited immigrant whom the Government has allowed to remain in Australia, to discover whether it is a fact that Detective Cody, of the Customs Department, found a number of prohibited immigrants' on Lum Hoy's property in his employ ? 2. Were Choy Hing and Hoon Sin, who have been living in Australia for .fifteen years and eleven years, respectively, among them, and nre they prohibited immigrants? 3. Was Lum Roy guilty of being a prohibited immigrant, and was ho also guilty of the offence of concealing other prohibited immigrants involving liability to a pcnaltv of £200? 4. If so, will he review the whole position in thelight of „ whether Lum Roy, who has been residing in Australia for sixteen years ;ind was guilty of a dual offence, should be allowed to remain in Australia, whilst Choy Hing, a resident of fifteen years and guilty of one offence, is to be deported?  honourable member's questions are follows':1. Reports furnished to the department show that Lum Roy and two other Chinese, namely Choy Hing and Hoon Sin, who were suspected of having entered the Commonwealth illegally, were found in the same garden. 2. See 1. Choy Hing and Hoon Sin were both convicted on charges of being prohibited immigrants. Choy Hing was in Australia slightly less than fifteen years at the time of his arrest and conviction. 3. Lum Roy was found to be identical with II Chinese who had entered the Commonwealth illegally more than fifteen years ago. On account of the special circumstances, which I have already explained to the House, action was not taken to secure a conviction against him on the charge of being a prohibited immigrant. There is no evidence that he was guilty of an offence of concealing other proinhibited immigrants with intent to prevent their international discovery by an officer. 4. It is not proposed to alter the decision already arrived at in this case. EXCHANGE EQUALIZATION ACCOUNT.",36
